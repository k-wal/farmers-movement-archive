24-05-2021||News||Road to 2022: In UP, the pandemic has changed public discourse, political agenda||If things were normal, by now, Uttar Pradesh would have been abuzz with intense political activities in the run-up to the 2022 assembly elections, which will likely be held in February-March.Instead, like many other states, Uttar Pradesh has been ravaged by the second wave. And while the state government’s narrative has been focused on how well it has managed the second wave – to be fair, the numbers do indicate this – anecdotal reports from one of India’s most backward regions do suggest that testing is inadequate in rural areas, and not all deaths are being correctly attributed to Covid.That narrative apart, all is largely quiet on the political front.As Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary says, “With so much misery all around, one doesn’t know if campaigning in any form would be appropriate even after the pandemic subsides.” Chaudhary himself lost his father, Ajit Singh, to complications arising from Covid on May 6.In 2017, the assembly elections were held in seven phases between January 17 and March 8. The elections were announced on January 4 and counting took place on March 11. Yogi Adityanath, the current chief minister, took the oath of office on March 19.Experts believe India may well be hit by a third wave of the pandemic in the latter half of the year, adding to the anxiety of citizens and pressure on the government. It is clear that the state will enter the battlefield in a disturbed atmosphere and all political parties are well aware of that.Also Read | Vaccinators face resistance in some Uttar Pradesh villagesWhile the first wave was more city-centric, the second wave has struck the vast rural areas of India’s most populous state — the lack of medical infrastructure, including medicines, has only added to the misery of people as they struggle for space to cremate their near and dear. As many as 299 of the 403 assembly seats in the state are in primarily rural constituencies.Pandemic changes discourseThe deaths, by all reports, have united castes and communities.Communal passions, especially in the western part of the state, triggered by the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 have cooled, although they have not disappeared completely.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP from Amroha, Danish Ali, says: “The farmers’ movement first diluted the communal animosity and now the pandemic has regrouped communities. There is a change in the air; people who earlier refused to listen to a word against (PM Narendra) Modi or Yogi are not reacting (to criticism) now. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have the machinery to correct course.”His reference is to the six-month long farmer protest against farm bills passed in September that has unified farmers across states and communities.On the face of it, in a state where identity has always mattered, caste and communal issues appear to have taken a backseat — Covid-19 has eclipsed issues such as the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the movement in legal cases in Kashi and Mathura for the liberation of places associated with Shiva and Krishna, and the so-called “love jihad”.Author and political analyst Badri Narain agrees: “There is a shift in the public narrative with politics of medicalisation (one’s survival) overtaking the politics of caste and religious identity. Now public health will become the main discourse and not construction of malls or highways. The yardstick of development of the state, too, will change as people have experienced pain and agony.”The ruling party had a glimpse of the public mood in the recent three-tier panchayat polls, in which the Opposition, which was completely decimated in 2017, held its political space. Though the panchayat polls are not contested on party symbols, all political parties were in the fray, openly supporting candidates.Also Read | UP govt schools kids to study Covid, Vedic Maths and Namami Gange tooOf the 3,051 zila panchayat seats, the Samajwadi Party won over 1,000 while BJP ended close with over 800 seats.Is the party worried? BJP state chief Swatantra Deo Singh while addressing the working committee meeting that followed put up a brave front and said: “Media is projecting panchayat polls as semi finals to 2022. They should not forget that the party has won all elections ( referring to by- polls, council and Rajya Sabha elections) since 2014.”Nonetheless, the party has geared up the organisational machinery while senior leaders led by Sunil Bansal are carrying out a detailed review.Party spokesman Naveen Srivastava said, “We are reaching out to the people, connecting with them through our government’s much appreciated ‘ test, trace and treat’ programme. The chief minister himself is touring the state gearing up the official machinery.”Samajwadi Party state spokesperson and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary said: “What would happen with this political tourism now? The CM’s political tourism will not help despite the fudging of data. Despite his tours, the BJP can’t conceal Covid and black fungus deaths due to lack of oxygen, beds, medicines. The daily tours won’t help BJP in covering up the dead bodies that floated in rivers. Panchayat polls have indicated how villagers, farmers, labourers are angry,”Brand Yogi on test Brand Modi helped the BJP sweep the 2017 polls, capturing 312 of the 403 seats. Yogi Adityanath, the mahant of Gorakhnath Peeth and five-time MP, was one of the star campaigners of the BJP.But after taking over as CM, he has sought to build his own brand – one built around Hindutva, aided by his status as a monk, and no-nonsense administration. The party has also sought to project him as an important national leader. Yogi is the only BJP chief minister to have been deployed across the country for campaigning.As an incumbent, Yogi will have to carry the weight of the polls on his shoulders and the pandemic has only made the task heavier. Dozens of BJP MLAs, MPs and union ministers have shot off letters to Yogi highlighting the mismanagement of Covid in the state. For instance, on May 8, union minister Santosh Gangawar wrote a letter to the chief minister complaining about Covid mismanagement in his home town Bareilly. He wrote, “I have received complaints that patients going to government hospitals are not being admitted as the hospital is asking them for a referral letter from the district hospital. The patient keeps running around from one place to another and in the process oxygen level decreases. Please ensure this does not happen.”Also Read | Covid vaccination: Centre enables on-site registration for 18-44 age groupBut the CM has a strong network and an efficient party machinery, and faces a fragmented Opposition. Amid widespread criticism over his management of Covid, he hit the road, visiting districts and villages worst affected by the pandemic. He also enjoys the confidence of the central leadership and has the unwavering support of the RSS.Mritunjay Kumar in chief ministers office opined, “It’s purely his hard work. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, he has not missed even one meeting of the Team 11, formed to monitor Covid management in the state, not even after he tested positive. Immediately after recovering from corona, he started a tour of the state completing all the 18 divisions of the state tomorrow. The cases fell by 234,000 in 23 days.”As Badri Narain puts it, “The party would certainly like to project him as the savior of many lives.” However SP president Akhilesh Yadav is of the view that people won’t spare the government for the precious lives lost. “False propaganda and data won’t help now,” he said.The BJP’s challenge The farmer’s agitation has revived the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Jats are likely to rally around Jayant Chaudhary who has been at the forefront of their movement. His father’s death has also created a groundswell of sympathy for him. The Bhartiya Kisan Union, which had become redundant over the years, has received a fresh lease of life.And even in its strongholds of Varanasi and Gorakhpur in east UP, the government may have to deal with the migrants, who have been forced to return to large cities in the absence of viable job opportunities.Public memory is short but it is likely the Owill hark on deaths and the floating bodies in the Ganga.Central UP has been the Yadav stronghold. The SP suffered losses there in 2017 for various reasons – including an intra-family dispute, and a backlash against the Yadav domination. However, since then, Akhilesh Yadav has strengthened his hold on the party and his recent silent tour of the state to activate his cadre may have helped. As such, 2022 will be a do-or-die battle for the party and its cadre.The Bahujan Samaj Party under Mayawati remains largely inactive. The party is now seen as a friend of the BJP. While Dalits, mainly Jatavs, remain her backbone, she runs the risk of losing support from the Muslim community.The Congress under Priyanka Gandhi has been making some sincere moves to raise public issues from Hathras to Sonbhadra, but the party has to activate the cadre to win some seats. Professor Yogeshwar Tiwari from Prayagraj said, “The Congress should be more constructive and less critical. They should come up with a road map than sporadic actions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/road-to-2022-in-up-pandemic-has-changed-public-discourse-political-agenda-101621855747472.html
24-05-2021||News||Inside India’s new plan to deliver water||A few years ago, many scholars were drawn to a curious social phenomenon in Denganmal, a parched hamlet in Maharashtra. Dire water crises had turned the village’s monogamous population into a polygamous community over time.The village’s men take up to three wives just to fetch water from far-flung sources. More wives mean more hands to draw water and, hence, less hired labour. Sociologists labelled them “water wives”.“This is a common feature in the community where women are looked upon as a human resource for family labour,” says Archana Tamble, a researcher with Savitribai Phule University, who has documented the trend.The emerging crisisMany Indian regions are hurtling towards Day-Zero conditions, when taps and tube wells will simply run dry, according to the state-run think-tank Niti Aayog’s Composite Water Management Index 2019.Nearly 820 million people in 12 major river basins of the country face “high to extreme” water stress. Of these, 495 million inhabit the Ganga basin, accounting for 40% of the country’s gross domestic product. At the last count, 256 districts, or more than a third of a total of 743, faced water stress.Also Read | Over 3.77 crore rural households given tap water under Jal Jeevan Mission: GovtAs the clock ticked, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his Independence Day speech in 2019 to launch an ambitious national programme, the Jal Jeevan Mission, to tackle the crisis on an unprecedented scale.Apart from mass-mobilisation campaigns to conserve rainwater and restore traditional water bodies, the mission has a never-before target of providing every household with a functional piped water connection that delivers 55 litres per capita per day by 2024.In many large states, it’s tough for rural households to get to a water source. By the World Health Organization’s standard, a household is considered water-stressed if it spends more than 30 minutes getting to its water source.Here’s how some Indian states fare. According to a National Sample Survey Organisation survey, in Jharkhand, it takes women 40 minutes one way, without taking into account the waiting time. In Bihar, it’s 33 minutes. Rural Maharashtra clocks an average of 24 minutes.The contours of the mission The piped water mission aims to change this drudgery. The programme has entered a critical stage, as officials race to meet the deadline amid a raging Covid second wave. The programme requires states and the Centre’s newly formed Jal Shakti ministry to work in tandem, from devising plans to monitoring and implementation.Senior bureaucrat Bharat Lal in the newly formed Jal Shakti ministry, the head of the piped drinking water mission, says progress has been satisfactory so far. Some states of course need to ramp up, he says, pointing to a high-tech dashboard in his office showing real-time, geo-tagged location of every household connected so far with piped water.“From around 17% households (before the start of the mission), we are now at about 37%. That growth is quite good, although I don’t want to sound hyperbolic,” Lal says.The mission prioritises habitations with contaminated water, such as with arsenic, where community water purification plants need to be installed. About 32,000 such plants have been installed so far.Disadvantaged areas with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes also figure in the priority list, as are 61 districts in five states which are Japanese encephalitis-endemic. The mission also prioritises 117 so-called aspirational districts with low human-development indicators. Drought-prone and desert areas are also high-priority zones.India has 190 million rural households, according to Census 2011. At the start of the mission, slightly more than 30 million households had piped drinking water. Since the mission’s launch in August 2019, nearly 40 million new households have been added, official data show.The challenges aheadTo meet targets, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman hiked the allocation for the Jal Jeevan mission for 2021-22 to ₹50,011 crore from ₹11,000 crore during 2020-21. There is, however, a set of challenges.Experts say excessive focus on numbers alone and achieving targets — given the mission’s deadline of 2024 — could be short-sighted.“Ultimately, the biggest red flag is sustainability. We have data to show the biggest failure is often of sustainability of resource,” says Shashi Shekhar, former water resources secretary and senior fellow, World Resources Institute India.Groundwater is the source for 85% of piped-water plants. “The same source is used for agriculture and industry. There is no control over the amount of water that is extracted,” Shekhar says.Experts say the programme must not be contractor-driven, but led by local communities. “It might be successful today, but will it be successful in future because of source sustainability? Is the community ready to take over ownership of such high-cost projects? These are the concerns,” Shekhar adds.The country’s public water-supply systems are leaky. In large cities, much of the assured supply is hogged by the rich. Urban demand is currently 135 litres per person per day, three times as much as rural India’s 55 litres, excluding agricultural use.Experts say no water-efficiency programme, such as the Jal Jeevan mission, can be successful without making India’s agriculture efficient. About 90% of India’s available water goes into farming. This figure is 64% for China and 60% for Brazil, according to WaterAid. It takes India about roughly 5,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of rice, in contrast to China’s approximately 3,000 litres.“Agriculture’s demand for water is disproportionately huge. One of the reasons is free electricity and lot of incentives for crops such as paddy,” says Alok Nath, a former official of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.Despite its water scarcity, India has turned out to be a virtual water exporter because it exports water-intensive foods more than many countries.Virtual water exports refer to the molecules of water used to produce exported goods. Such exported water molecules, in India’s case, are a net 95.4 billion cubic metres a year, according to the Water Footprint Network. This is way higher than that of China and Russia.Groundwater accounts for 90% of India’s irrigation source, but its scarcity is frightening. One way to measure this is the depth at which water is available. In 1998, the average groundwater level depth before the monsoon season was 7.5m.By 2018, this had gone up to 9.2m. Punjab’s groundwater levels have plummeted by 10.6m from 7.2m in 1998 to 17.8m in 2018, while in Madhya Pradesh groundwater levels have fallen by 5m.Agriculture’s demand for water continues to grow. The government’s minimum support price scheme incentivises production of water-intensive crops, such as rice and sugar cane in areas where ground water is scarce. Electricity subsidies have prompted farmers over-extract groundwater cheaply.According to a study by scholars Reena Badiani (World Bank) and Katrina Jessoe (University of California Davis), cutting agricultural electricity subsidy by 10% can lead a 7% decline in groundwater extraction.“The Jal Jeevan mission’s focus to improve India’s water-use efficiency right from the household-level,” says Avinash Arora, editor of the Water Policy journal. “It might be better to start on the farmer’s field,” he says.(This is the first of a four part series on India’s water crisis and the ambitious Jal Jeevan Mission)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/inside-india-s-new-plan-to-deliver-water-101621846630599.html
24-05-2021||News||Trafficked, exploited, starved: The story of the pandemic and sex workers||A 55-second video captures the ordeal a 19-year-old, trafficked from Jharkhand to Bihar seven years ago, had to endure. Sobs wrack her delicate frame as she cries, “Papa, papa”, while hugging her father. The father is inconsolable too, as he embraces her in a tight hug. A few seconds into the video, the brother comes forward and the three weep together.The minor was kidnapped from Sindri in Jharkhand when she was 12 years old by a woman who made her smell a laced handkerchief. When the girl regained consciousness, she found herself on a bus. The handkerchief was used again, and the next time she opened her eyes, she was in a strange house in Darbhanga where she was told she had been bought for ₹1 lakh.For the next seven years, she was abused, beaten and forced to be part of a dance orchestra that travelled through parts of Bihar. Nude dances were part of what was expected of her and, each time she cried or asked for her family, she got a thrashing in return.On one of her dance tours, a kind man gave her the number of Virender Kumar Singh, the director of Mission Mukti Foundation. She managed to call him and beg for help. With help from the police, Singh and his team finally rescued her in January this year amid huge drama and many tense moments.She could not be rescued at the first attempt because the orchestra owner had been tipped off and he hid her at a relative’s home. It was only after the police picked up his brother that he relented. He knew the game was up.But while the young woman was rescued, the pandemic and lockdown, challenges have only increased for anti-trafficking activists and organisations.Also Read | Covid second wave: Sex workers get help from Good SamaritansThe pandemic-induced trafficking “Traffickers are using the lockdown to lure young girls into prostitution. The racket is thriving because there are no jobs and families are facing a huge financial crunch. Many girls leave home to take up petty jobs to add to the family income,” says Singh.The data speaks for itself—Singh’s NGO rescued 30 girls between March 1 and December last year, during the first wave. This year, 70 have already been freed; the last rescue was on May 14, in the midst of the second wave.Images of burning pyres and patients gasping for oxygen have not deterred traffickers. According to Singh, prostitution ringmasters are advertising spa centres and massage parlours through WhatsApp chat groups and bulk messaging to expand the flesh trade.In March this year, just when the deadly second wave gripped the country, he sought the police’s help in Surat, from where 14 girls, mostly from West Bengal, were rescued in a single swoop. The “parlour” was littered with used condoms. The rescued included a mother of two children who had been promised a job at a restaurant.Distress in the red light districtsUnlike the traffickers who are managing to push girls into the flesh trade—and operate in the shadows—established red light areas such as the ones in Delhi’s GB Road, Kolkata’s Sonagachi and Mumbai’s Grant Road have taken a direct hit.Delhi’s GB Road, which used to spring to life in the evenings, is now struggling for survival. Of the approximately 4,000 sex workers who resided there, close to half have migrated back to their villages. Those who remain are cramped in the dingy brothel rooms, with empty kitchens and dwindling bank balances.The second wave has hit them harder. Last year, their savings came to their rescue but this time around, they are scrounging for food. NGOs are helping out with dry ration but there isn’t always enough.Anjali Sonu, project coordinator, Centre for Holistic Development and her team are tapping several sources for donation and received help from the Indian Youth Congress. Its president, Srinivas BV, who has become a key source of support and assistance during the pandemic, confirmed that he helped out with dry ration for 250 sex workers to begin with.The sex workers, already stereotyped and marginalised, are grateful for the help from NGOs, but say their problems are multifold. They don’t have enough money to get gas cylinders refilled. Many of the older sex workers have rented rooms for their children—because the kids don’t know what their mothers do—and have not been able to pay rent for the last two months. Some are simply handing their children over to shelter homes now.Usha, who prefers to be called just by her first name (she has a different one for her family), was trafficked from Maharashtra eight years ago. GB Road is her only address, and she says, “I don’t have one rupee today. I used to send ₹3,000 per month to my mother but can’t any more. I use to entertain three or four customers a day and earn about ₹900 but I don’t know what to do now. Sometimes we just eat one meal a day. My mother thinks I work for a detergent company and is waiting for the lockdown to end. I really don’t know when I’ll get a customer again.”Many like Usha have grown accustomed to being sex workers. Till the pandemic struck, the money kept the fires burning; for them and their families in villages. They don’t know any other profession.She says in a matter-of-fact tone, “I can wash utensils and swab floors but that will give me ₹3,000 a month. How will I be able to send money to my mother, who is also looking after my five-year-old daughter? I know what hunger feels like.”Many are dialling their clients for help. Some helped out last year but this time it is getting harder.The absence of institutional supportSonu, project coordinator of the Centre for Holistic Development, detailed the plight of the “most stigmatised community of our society” in a letter to Delhi’s lieutenant governor on April 15.Urging the administration to provide essentials and medical facilities, she sought help for the sex workers, saying that the “horrible impacts of the previous year’s lockdown have not healed” and there is now fear that they are falling into a deeper crisis. No reply has yet been received.According to the National Network of Sex Workers, “There is an increase in mental health concerns amongst the sex workers due to their livelihood being impacted and uncertainty about the future.”The ministry for women and child development puts the total number of sex workers in India at three million. Social distancing norms have impacted each one of them. Lalitha Nayak, founder, Society for Participatory Integrated Development has been helping sex workers for over 30 years. “The pandemic has left them most vulnerable,’’ she says, as she now struggles to feed the workers and children born in brothels.Nayak has been trying to break the chain of trafficking. She runs a centre for children and provides vocational training but the pandemic has left her and other NGOs struggling to just source food. Their only hope is for more donors to come forward.As one worker put it, “I can’t go to a nearby school for a cooked meal because we are taunted and abused. I wait on the stairs, not for a client, but for food. Can you help me?’’Help is what they need the most, as they alternate between survival and starvation. India’s institutions must step up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/trafficked-exploited-starved-the-story-of-the-pandemic-and-sex-workers-101621843506907.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||New 8pm deadline for home delivery brings Ludhiana restaurants back in business||Now allowed to deliver food till 8pm instead of the earlier 12pm deadline, the city’s restaurant sector has finally heaved a sigh of relief.Already facing mounting losses due to low footfall amid the Covid pandemic, restaurant businesses have been struggling to stay afloat since the 17-hour curfew was imposed in the district on May 10, limiting their hours of operation to 5am to 12pm.From Monday onwards, the district administration pushed their home delivery deadline to 8pm and also extended the curfew relaxation hours to 5am to 1pm, allowing take-away service for eight hours. The relaxation also came as a boon for delivery boys, whose daily earnings had depleted with customers unable to place home delivery orders after noon. Restaurateurs are now also seeking permission to open dine-in services at 50% capacity to help them cover their fixed expenses. “Restaurants were unable to even meet the fixed costs to keep their businesses running with the 17-hour curfew in place. Now that the administration has allowed home delivery till 8pm, around 50% business may return in the coming days. Yet, as dinner hours are usually till 10pm, further relaxation is needed,” said Bhupinder Basant, owner of Basant Restaurants, and senior vice-chairman, Punjab State Traders Board.Meanwhile, representatives of the city’s restaurant and hotel industries also said that the administration’s decision will only benefit certain outlets that offered home delivery, while those depending on dine-in customers were still out of business.“Those offering only dine-in will continue to suffer. We will take up the matter with the government to allow restaurants to host customers at 50% capacity, else the restaurant and hotel sector will collapse,” said Amarvir Singh, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana.Proprietor of Club 69ML, Bhanu Ahuja said,”We cannot open our premises, as our business mostly depends on customers wishing to dine in during dinner hours. With negligible footfall before noon, it has become almost impossible to cover our expenses and salaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-8pm-deadline-for-home-delivery-brings-ludhiana-restaurants-back-in-business-101621880587576.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s daily Covid deaths drop to 15, lowest in 26 days||The Covid-19 pandemic wiped out 15 more lives in Ludhiana on Monday, though the number was the lowest in almost a month.It was only on April 28 last that an equal number of fatalities was recorded, following which the daily deaths had been rising, even touching the all-time high of 30 twice, on May 10 and 11.So far in May, 514 Ludhiana residents have lost their lives to the deadly virus – an over two-fold increase as compared to April’s 231 fatalities.On the bright side, the daily coronavirus cases continued to recede on Monday, as 507 people tested positive, 15% lesser than Sunday’s 597 cases.This took Ludhiana’s caseload to 81,525. More recoveries on Monday brought the active cases further down to 7,804, lowest since April 30. Since reporting the highest single-day surge of 1,729 on May 9, Ludhiana has recorded a 70% drop in cases in the two subsequent weeks during which the district has remained under a 17-hour daily lockdown.For nine straight days, the daily case count has remained below the 1,000 mark, with the positivity rate also coming down to 4.59%, indicating around five in every 100 people being sampled were testing positive. A total of 71,832 people have been cured till date, a recovery rate of 88.11%, tad lower than the national average of 88.69%. As many as 60 patients are on ventilator support at various health facilities in the district.The latest deaths, which comprised 12 men and three women, pushed the district’s toll to 1,889. The youngest patient was a 32-year-old resident of Narinder Nagar, while the oldest was a 70-year-old resident of Mundian Khurd. Nine out of the 15 deceased were aged between 60 and 70. Three were in their 50s, while one was in his 40s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-daily-covid-deaths-drop-to-15-lowest-in-26-days-101621880408288.html

While Bhattacharya was being treated at home, his wife was discharged from a private hospital in south Kolkata on Monday. She was admitted on May 18. The hospital authorities said in a statement that she was advised to stay in home isolation for a week. Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, one of the most senior leaders of the CPI(M), has been suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for more than a decade. His movements are restricted. CPI(M) members said the medical attendant who used to look after the ailing former chief minister at the latter’s two-room government quarter in south Kolkata also tested positive for the virus but his condition is not serious. In October last year, Bhattacharya was admitted to the hospital for six days. He was admitted in critical condition with symptoms such as breathlessness and low oxygen count in the blood. He was put on a ventilator. However, his condition improved quickly. A 13-member medical board was formed for his treatment. Bhattacharya tested negative for Covid-19 at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/former-bengal-cm-buddhadeb-bhattacharya-stable-wife-discharged-from-hospital-101621879749772.html
24-05-2021||Noida||Fake cops extorting money nabbed in Noida||Noida: Noida Police arrested two men for allegedly extorting money from motorists by impersonating as Delhi Police personnel.Police identified the suspects as Neeraj Chaube and Mohammad Afsar, who were from Varanasi and Delhi, respectively, and in their 20s. Police said that they have recovered two fake Delhi Police identity cards, a set of vehicle documents and two cellphones, among other things, from them. Senior police officers said that the duo would stop motorists on pretext of violations like not wearing a helmet or mask.“The suspects would ask for the vehicle’s papers which they would then seize claiming them to be a part of an investigation. Sometimes, if the papers were not in order, they would use that to their advantage as well,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1.They would then threaten legal action against the person unless they paid up, Verma said. On May 20, the suspects allegedly stopped a Noida resident near the Mahamaya flyover and took ₹4,500 from him.“The suspects took his papers and threatened to send him to jail. They told him to meet at Labour Chowk with another ₹20,000 for them,” said the ACP. Instead, the victim approached the police. “We intercepted them during the meet and nabbed them.From their phones, we have recovered evidence of at least 10 other people being duped in this manner. Some of them are now coming forward with their complaints. We are working on identifying other victims as well.”The duo had been active for over six months and mostly worked in desolate areas in Delhi and Noida, said police.The suspects were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 58 police station, police said. They added that the men had been produced before a magistrate who sent them to 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fake-cops-extorting-money-nabbed-in-noida-101621879568120.html
24-05-2021||Noida||In Ghaziabad, black fungus burns a hole: Up to ₹1 lakh a day||After having spent a fortune on Covid-19 treatment, many families thought their troubles had breathed a sigh of relief. But now, cases of mucromycosis, also called black fungus, are inflicting more damage.Covid treatment is free in government hospitals, but at private hospitals, even after the Uttar Pradesh government’s cap, is expensive for many. Similarly, treatment costs for black fungus can go up to ₹1 lakh a day at a private facility as the only drug used to treat it -- amphotericin injection -- and surgeries are expensive.Sihani resident Pushpendra Kumar is a contractual worker and earns ₹13,000 a month. His father, 57-year-old Raja Ram, tested positive for Covid-19 and was discharged on May 7. That costed him ₹4.5 lakh.“On May 14, my father developed headache and his eyes seemed dilated. On May 18, his complications increased, and we took him to another hospital where he was diagnosed with black fungus. My family started running around to Delhi, Meerut and Ghaziabad to arrange for amphotericin, but we could not find any,” said Kumar. “He died on May 20. Treating the fungal infection costed me ₹80,000 per day.”Raja Ram’s doctor, Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT surgeon at Harsh ENT Hospital at Raj Nagar District Centre, confirmed the death due to black fungus.“The infection had spread to his nose, eyes and brain and despite all efforts he could not be saved,” said Dr Tyagi. “We have 27 such cases and all had recovered from Covid and uncontrolled diabetes.” The cost of an amphotericin injection is around ₹5,000 and patients are administered multiple doses depending on severity. “Patients with mild infection are administered 2-3 injections per day while moderate patients require about five. Those with severe infection require about 10 per day. So, this increases the cost considerably, besides the staff involved during the treatment are hired at high salaries due to the risk involved,” said Dr Tyagi.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.Officially, there are 41 black fungus cases in Ghaziabad.Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad), said that the government supply of amphotericin, which is restricted to only hospitals via the UP Medical Supplies Corporation, should be increased.“In April when remdesivir was required to treat Covid-19, its black-marketing started. Now, we again have short supply of amphotericin,” said Dr Agarwal. “It is up to the health department to ensure that patients do not have to run around getting the drug. ENT (ear-nose-throat) surgeons say that they cannot operate on patients without amphotericin.”Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that the district health department had two ENT surgeons and hired a general surgeon recently.“At present, we do not have availability of super specialists, but they are available with private hospitals. All black fungus patients are getting treated at private hospitals,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-ghaziabad-black-fungus-burns-a-hole-up-to-1-lakh-a-day-101621879447555.html

For us, every life matters and will continue to save people like we have. The officials must ensure that adequate medical aid and food is provided to every person in need. Neither we have nor will we ever discriminate between voters and nonvoters.“Unlike others, we do not believe in serving people selectively," he said in Azamgarh.The chief minister visited the Covid Care Centre set up at Government Girls' Inter College (GGIC) in Azamgarh. He also paid a surprise visit at Bijuara village and reviewed the healthcare facilities available for COVID-19 patients, the government said in a statement.He also interacted with the newly-elected village pradhans and advised them to work with the cooperation of the citizens, public representatives, administrators and district officials in order to achieve the desired results for a harmonious and progressive society.Earlier in the day, Adityanath had visited Gonda, where he exhorted the public representatives to adopt PHCs and CHCs and use their funds to improve the health services there.He also reiterated his idea to set up 'special vaccination booths' for the guardians of children up to 12 years of age.The CM said vaccination against the novel coronavirus infection will be taken up in rural areas in a huge manner.He said the mantra for “Test, Trace and Treat” has helped in curbing the second wave in the state."Today, we have only about 74,000 active cases in the state, down by about 2.36 lakh since April 30, during the peak.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana prison dept’s proposal to educate inmates remains a pipe dream||The Haryana prison department’s 20-month-old proposal to educate the inmates, especially women prisoners and their kids, is yet to take off despite eight letters being sent to the elementary education department to depute one teacher in every jail on temporary basis, according to official documents.There are about 21,600 prisoners lodged in 19 jails of Haryana against the authorised capacity of 20,041. While 5,168 prisoners are convicts and over 16,400 are undertrials. Lodged in these jails are about 684 women prisoners, including 171 convicted women inmates, who have been serving their sentence along with their children. A section of the prisoners are uneducated.Stressing on the urgency of educating the prisoners in order to help their seamless rehabilitation into the society after they serve their sentences, the director general (DG) prisons had first mooted this proposal in September 2019, asking the director elementary education to post one JBT guest teacher in every jail.As per the first letter of the DG prisons, “among the inmates are mothers and their children, illiterate convicted prisoners and youth.” In every letter/reminder the DG prisons said “educating these inmates is important to help them become good citizens.”According to DG (prisons) Shatrujeet Kapur, whose predecessor had mooted the proposal and kept pursuing it, “About 75% of the inmates in Haryana prisons are undertrials and reforming them is crucial.”He said the jail department is seeking just one teacher for each prison on temporary basis. “We have only 19 prisons in Haryana,” he added.After the first letter to the director elementary education on September 10, 2019, the DG (prisons) sent five reminders in 2020 (January 15, March 6, October 9, November 3, December 14) followed by another reminder on February 11, 2021.He sent the final reminder so far on March 16 this year to know the fate of the proposal.In the latest reminder to the director elementary education, the DG (prisons) said the jail department, through many letters, has been requesting to direct the district elementary education officers to appoint a teacher on temporary basis in all district prisons except central jail Hisar and district jails of Palwal and Rewari.“However, we have not received any intimation from your office in this regard. Thus, we again request you to issue the necessary directions,” the letter reads.When contacted, neither the director elementary education nor the joint directors dealing with the matter, were available for comments.Sources said on May 21, office of director elementary education sent a letter (HT has a copy of which) to all district elementary education officers informing them about the proposal of the jail department and asking them to reply so that JBT teachers can be posted on temporary basis in district jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-prison-dept-s-proposal-to-educate-inmates-remains-a-pipe-dream-101621876507855.html
24-05-2021||Pune||Maha BJP ready to agitate for Marathas under any leader: Chandrakant Patil||BJP workers are ready to take part in any agitation for Maratha quota without holding the party banner or flag in the larger interest of the community, Maharashtra unit BJP president Chandrakant Patil said on Monday. Speaking to reporters, Patil said though the Centre has filed a review petition against the Supreme Court’s verdict striking down the Maratha reservation law, “it is the responsibility of the state government to prove that the community is backward and there is an exceptional situation where the ceiling of 50 per cent reservation needs to be breached”.“The BJP’s stand on the Maratha reservation issue is clear. In the interest of the Maratha community, we will take part in any agitation for Maratha quota like common citizens irrespective of which party or leader is leading it, be it Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, Vinayak Mete, Rajendra Kondhare, or Vinod Patil,” he said. Queried about Sambhajiraje not getting the appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue, Patil said, “PM feels the issue (Maratha reservation ) is more of state than the Centre. What is the use of meeting the PM when the issue falls under the purview of the state government?” He said the Centre had told the apex court that even after the 102nd Constitutional amendment, states have the right to extend quota to any backward community. The Supreme Court on May 5 struck down the Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs, terming it as “unconstitutional”, and held there were no exceptional circumstances to breach the 50 per cent reservation cap set by the 1992 Mandal verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-bjp-ready-to-agitate-for-marathas-under-any-leader-chandrakant-patil-101621876329182.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Minimal Covid cases in rural areas belie claims of massive spread||Even as the decline in Covid-19 cases continued in Haryana for the second successive week, the minimal number of cases detected from villages have belied the claims of massive spread of the virus in rural areas.The state-wide dip in number of cases is significant. Health department data showed that the state registered 34,929 lesser cases last week (May 17-23) than the week before (May 10-16). A total of 43,601 cases were reported last week as compared to 78,530 the week before.RURAL SCREENING SHOWS UNEXPECTED RESULTSAmid the continuous drop in cases, a drive launched by the state government to screen rural population for the virus has thrown up unexpected results.The screening drive has not only shown a lower rate of infection in villages, but the outcome also puts a question mark on the claims over role of agitating farmers in acting as super spreaders.The Haryana Villagers General Health Check-up Scheme (HVGHCS) was started by the state government to screen villagers for influenza-like illness (ILI) in view of reports of pandemic making inroads in rural areas.As per statistics, only 2,823 infections have been detected from 5,156 villages in the past nine days of screening by 3,370 field teams.As per the health department data, 97.72 lakh persons from 20.89 lakh rural households have been screened for ILI since May 15 when the check-up drive was commenced. This meant that about 59% of the village population has been screened so far.Data showed that 75,501 persons suspected of ILI were tested using rapid antigen testing (RAT) kits and 13,190 were tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The cumulative positivity rate was 3.74%.‘RURAL SCREENING DATA IS MISLEADING’While politicians across spectrum are expressing concerns over the “outbreak in villages”, statistics of by the screening drive are quite contrary.“The number of cases is more than what the screening is showing. The data is misleading as a large section of the population is still reluctant to get tested. There is stigma attached to Covid and it is more prevalent in villages,” said a top BJP leader, not wishing to be named.State BJP chief OP Dhankar said villagers should go for testing without hesitation, get vaccinated, and refrain from smoking community hookahs and playing cards to protect themselves and their families from the contagion.Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the data is inaccurate. “The number of positive cases in villages is way more then what the data shows. There have also been more fatalities than what the government data shows,” he said.Hooda said villagers are in denial and not ready to go for testing due to stigma. “Even when someone is sick in a village, there is reluctance to go for testing as people fear that they will not make it back home,” he added.A BJP MLA said cases in rural areas have started to dip in the last 10-15 days and so screening of rural populace is showing a lower number of cases.FATALITIES IN RURAL AREAS RISINGData showed that the percentage of fatalities in villages have gradually increased over the past few months.As per the latest data, 2,737 people from rural areas have succumbed to Covid since March 2020 which is about 36% of the total fatalities reported.The gradual increase is evident as the percentage of deaths reported from rural areas in late February, when the second surge had just started, was about 29.36% of the total deaths, 29.63% on March 21, 31.83% by April 25, and 33.52% of the total deaths by May 9.OUTBREAK IN VILLAGESTotal villages: 6,841Total rural population: 1.64 crore (approx)Villages screened: 5,156Villagers screened: 97.72 lakhHouseholds covered: 20.89 lakhVillagers found infected: 2,823Villagers in isolation centres: 251Villagers referred to higher centre: 146||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/minimal-covid-cases-in-rural-areas-belie-claims-of-massive-spread-101621876208074.html

24-05-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh says Yogi wasting govt's resources by visiting districts||Days after alleging that various UP ministers deputed to monitor the Covid situation in various UP districts have gone missing, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday questioned Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s ongoing visits there for the purpose. It is a complete “wastage of the government’s resources and time” when there is no respite to the people from COVID-19, besides the black and white fungus infections. "There is a shortage of medicines, injections and vaccines,” said Yadav, while again questioning the alleged absence of ministers deputed to monitor the pandemic situation in various districts. “No one knows where is the Team-9 or Team-11 constituted by the CM,” said the former chief minister. Questioning Adityanath’s ongoing visits to monitor the situation district-wise, Yadav added.“Instead of taking stock of the situation and giving time for the improvement, the CM has embarked on tours.” “Except for the wastage of the government resources and time, what is the significance of the CM's marathon tours?" he asked in a statement here. After visiting several western UP districts including Gautam Budh Nagar and Muzaffarnagar last week, Adityanath on Monday undertook tours to Gonda, Azamgarh and Varanasi in eastern Uttar Pradesh. "He (CM) is touring the state not for improving things but for achieving his own political goals,” Yadav added. Amid the reports of a persistent shortage of anti-Covid vaccines, Yadav said, “The CM should also tell when only 35 lakh people have been given the second dose of vaccine, how does he claim that all people in will be inoculated by Diwali?” “A large number of youths and elderly visit hospital but return without vaccination," he said. The pandemic situation in villages is very bad and people are dying without treatment, claimed Yadav while listing several villages facing a grim Covid situation.He also asked what Adityanath was doing to meet the shortage of resources in anti-Covid centres to tackle its next wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-says-yogi-wasting-govt-s-resources-by-visiting-districts-101621875484472.html

The village was sealed to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus disease to other places because of the movement of the people.People were seen without face masks and physical distancing norms were violated as many villagers gathered for the funeral of the horse. A police complaint was filed in connection with the incident that occurred on Saturday evening.A video of the event garnered wide attention on social media earlier on Sunday which showed that many people, mostly without face masks, gathered at a procession during which the last rites were performed for the horse. No social distancing norms were followed by the attendees of the procession, who were seen walking in close contact with each other, the video showed.“Hundreds of people were seen at the funeral of a horse in the Maradimath area of Belagavi, yesterday, in violation of current COVID-19 restrictions in force in Karnataka,” news agency ANI tweeted earlier on Monday and shared the video clip.Karnataka, which has been battered by the unabated spread of Covid-19 infections in the second wave of the pandemic, is currently under a lockdown and large gatherings such as this have been prohibited. The state has been reporting a high number of daily new infections and has seen less than 30,000 new cases for only three times in May so far. Also, it currently has the highest number of active cases of the coronavirus disease among all states in India, with 440,435 cases.Responding to the incident state home minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that action will be taken regarding the gathering of the crowd for the funeral. “The district administration will look into this incident, and action will be taken,” news agency ANI quoted the home minister as saying earlier on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-village-sealed-villagers-to-be-tested-for-covid-19-after-hundreds-gather-to-attend-a-horse-s-funeral-101621874280516.html

The man arrested on May 22 was identified as Ghanshyam Vitthal Deshmukh (41) a resident of Kolwadi in Haveli area of Pune. He was remanded to police custody till Wednesday, according to public prosecutor Dnyaneshwar More. “We had first registered a case only for cheating.

After his arrest, he was remanded to two days in custody for cheating.

24-05-2021||Kolkata||Narada case: ‘If leaders weren’t arrested in 7 years, why now?’ Calcutta HC questions CBI||The five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court questioned the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that if the four leaders, accused in the Narada sting operation case, were not arrested in the last seven years then why were they being arrested now when the charge sheet of the case has been submitted, HT has learnt. “The bench, while hearing the case on Monday, said that one of the issues was that if the accused persons were not arrested in the last seven years, then what was the need of arrest now when the charge sheet of the case has been filed?” said Anindya Raut, advocate and TMC leader.The court would again take up the matter on May 26 until when the accused, including two cabinet ministers, a legislator and a former mayor, would stay under house arrest. The Solicitor General who was appearing for the CBI, however, told the court that the issue was not just of bail but whether the bail hearing of the special CBI court on May 17 was non-est in law.On May 17, the CBI arrested two cabinet ministers, a legislator and a former mayor in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. Even though a special CBI court granted them interim bail, the Calcutta High Court stayed the bail and sent them to judicial custody.On May 21, however, the HC put them under house arrest and constituted a larger five bench to hear the bail plea. Meanwhile, the CBI moved the Supreme Court seeking adjournment from the hearing of the Calcutta High Court. The Solicitor General who was appearing for the CBI prayed before the five-judge bench that the hearing be adjourned as the agency has filed a special leave petition (SLP) before the apex court. The High Court, however, refused the prayer and went ahead with the hearing as the Supreme Court hasn’t heard the matter yet.“The court would again hear the matter on May 26. Till then, the accused would remain in house arrest,” said Manishankhar Chatterjee, Subrata Mukherjee’s advocate.The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing several high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. The TMC has linked the arrests to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss in the recently concluded assembly polls. It has questioned why the CBI didn’t arrest Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy who were also seen in the sting videos but have since switched from the TMC to the BJP. The CBI’s plea to transfer the Narada trial out of the state is also pending before the High Court. The agency has named West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the trial of the case from the lower court. It claimed violent protests orchestrated by the TMC against the arrests hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/narada-case-if-leaders-weren-t-arrested-in-7-years-why-now-calcutta-hc-questions-cbi-101621871772584.html

Mumbai now has 697,959 cases of the Covid-19 disease which includes 14,613 deaths.The coronavirus situation in Maharashtra is improving with each passing day. The major credit for this improvement can be given to the lockdown-like restrictions-- which have been extended till June 1-- and the people’s adherence to them.The Maha-Vikas Aghadi led government has indicated these restrictions will not be further extended and will be eased in a staggered manner, according to Hindustan Times on Sunday.Even though the number of Covid-19 infections are falling in Maharashtra, the state is staring at a huge spike in the cases of Mucormycosis or black fungus. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on Monday that Maharashtra has 1,188 cases of the black fungus, the highest in India till now.On May 20, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope requested the Centre to approve allocation of Amphotericin B injections-- used for treating black fungus patients-- as 300-400 people were getting infected on a weekly basis.Over 20.7 million beneficiaries have been administered vaccine doses against Covid-19 in the state till now of which 16,370,365 have been given the first dose and nearly 4.4 million have been given both doses.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on Sunday that vaccination for the 18-44 age group has been suspended due to a shortage in supply of doses. However, Thackeray said that from June the vaccine production will speed up and therefore, the state government can operate a round-the-clock vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-adds-22-122-new-covid-cases-mumbai-s-daily-tally-continues-to-fall-101621866190459.html

The arrest came after a series of actions and a fresh FIR for filed against Dr Anand at RIT police station on Saturday evening by relative of a patient who died of Covid-19 during treatment at his 111 Save Life Hospital in Adityapur. The FIR was filed under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code, which relates to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. “Dr Anand was arrested late last evening and he was sent to judicial custody after production in the CJM court this morning,” Srinivas Singh, RIT police station officer-in-charge, said.Earlier, Seraikela-Kharsawan civil surgeon in-charge Dr Bariyal Mardi had filed an FIR against Dr Anand at RIT PS on Sunday for obstructing government work, threatening and abusing health department probe team and health minister on May 16.Meanwhile, Jamshedpur (East) MLA Saryu Roy slammed the action as “excesses against a doctor whom police and administration were treating as a criminal”.“New FIR, series of fast-changing developments ... this now looks much beyond ego class. It’s something more deep and police and administration are working as agents. Government has power and force, they have done whatever maximum they could. Let’s see if this stands the trial in court or not... this type of actions damage the credibility of a government. I had written to the CM to ensue that the hospital remain functional when government is trying to increase beds and treatment facilities for Covid-19,” Roy said after visiting Dr Anand’s residence Monday afternoon.Dr Anand, on the other hand, said the state government stood exposed and defeated and he would share his victory message after coming out of jail. He said he treated the father of two girls as his own brother but he was now going to jail on their complaint. “Truth will come out. People in power have spared no tricks,” he said in a video message before being taken to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doc-who-threatened-to-thrash-minister-arrested-saryu-roy-warns-govt-101621870387163.html
24-05-2021||Ranchi||Cyclone Yaas: Red alert issued for parts of Jharkhand||Strap: Weather department predicts extreme rainfall in southern and central parts of Jharkhand on Wednesday and Thursday with wind-speed up to 130kmph at few places; NDRF teams to be deputed in East Singhbhum and Ranchi  The meteorological department has sounded an alert for parts of Jharkhand with prediction of extreme rainfall and high-velocity winds at speed up to 130kmph on May 26 and 27 in the backdrop of cyclone Yaas. The department on Monday also appealed the state administration to be alert for at least southern and central parts of Jharkhand for the two days, as there is prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall. Deputy director at Ranchi centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Abhishek Anand said, “Cyclone Yaas is likely to make landfall around noon on Wednesday and it will take around three to four hours to complete. Jharkhand’s southern and central parts are expected to be most affected.” Even though Jharkhand was yet to constitute its own state disaster response force (SDRF), three teams of national disaster response force (NDRF) have been moved for East Singhbhum and adjoining districts, while two teams have been deputed in Ranchi to deal with any crisis. Cyclone Yaas was likely to intensify into very severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and make landfall on West Bengal and Odisha coasts on Wednesday, weather officials said. Anand said, “Extreme rainfall is expected in some places of southern parts of Jharkhand, which include East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan and Simdega districts, on May 26. There is also possibility of thunderstorm and high speed wind at speed between 40 and 60kmph in the morning hours, while the speed may go upto 130kmph by evening.” He said central part of Jharkhand, that comprises Ranchi, Bokaro, Gumla, Hazaribagh, Khunti and Ramgarh, was likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall on Wednesday. The districts might also experience wind speed up to 80kmph. On Thursday, almost the entire state will witness light to moderate rainfall, but some places at northwest, centre and south-east parts may experience heavy rainfall. “Extreme rainfall is likely in few places of south-east parts of Jharkhand on Thursday,” Anand said. He said the impact of the cyclone will be visible from Tuesday where some places will experience light to moderate rainfall along with lightning. Ranchi might see moderate rainfall on Tuesday, and heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday. “The state administration should be alert, as the cyclone may cause heavy damage. People should avoid going out on Wednesday and Thursday,” Anand said. The state disaster management department seemed to be missing from the approaching cyclonic event, as it was yet to issue any directive to districts in this regard. However, East Singhbhum and Ranchi districts have deployed five NDRF teams. Inspector Saroj Kumar, NDRF Ranchi team commander, said, “Three teams have moved to Jamshedpur, while two teams will deployed in Ranchi to deal with any crisis.” East Singhbhum district also arranged shelter homes for people living in low-lying areas. The administration has also directed to make arrangement of emergency lights, generator sets, shelter houses and issue a control room number at the block level. A state disaster management authority was constituted in Jharkhand in June last year. But, the state was yet to constitute an SDRF. More than 100 personnel were selected for SDRF, but they neither have been trained nor they deputed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/cyclone-yaas-red-alert-issued-for-parts-of-jharkhand-101621869667227.html

Several BJP ministers, who recently visited their respective constituencies and inspected medical facilities for treatment of Covid infected persons, have questioned the rationale behind banning movement of elected representatives during the crisis period. On Monday, the cabinet secretariat department issued letters to the private secretaries of all the ministers, asking them to not visit their constituencies to inspect medical facilities or any scheme during the lockdown phase to check the spread of pandemic. West Champaran MP and state BJP chief Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, who is currently in his home town to supervise the drive to check spread of Covid and arrange proper medical facilities, said, “Ask the ministers and JD(U) national chief RCP Singh why such an order has been issued.”“Just because the CM and JD(U) ministers are not moving does not mean BJP leaders should also not go out and help people tide over the crisis. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has toured over 50 districts during the lockdown to monitor medical facilities and relief operations,” said another BJP minister, wishing not to be quoted. Another BJP minister said they would lodge a complaint regarding the curbs at an appropriate party platform. “Since we are in the ruling alliance, the coalition dharma does not allow us to make our grievances public,” said the minister. Congress MLC and All India Congress Committee (AICC) media panellist Prem Chandra Mishra said everything was not well in the ruling coalition. “How could the ministers be the cause for spread of pandemic? Are officers immune to the pandemic? Why the ruling party leaders asking about physical presence of opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav if the government has banned activities of its ministers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-upset-with-curbs-on-movement-of-ministers-101621869427179.html

24-05-2021||Other||After getting 2nd shot, Manjhi aims a jab at NDA: Why PM pic on vaccine certificates||PATNAIn an apparent embarrassment to the ruling alliance in Bihar, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, whose party Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) is a constituent of the ruling NDA in the state, has objected to putting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s picture on Covid-19 vaccination certificates and either his picture should be dropped or they be put on death certificates too.Manhi’s party had won four out of the seven seats it contested during assembly elections held in 2020 and his son Santosh Manjhi is a minister for minor irrigation and SC/ST welfare in the Nitish Kumar-led government. “If you are so fond of putting (the PM’s) photograph on the vaccine certificate, his photo should be put on the death certificates too. Only this will be fair,” Manjhi tweeted on Monday. Earlier on Sunday, soon after taking the second dose of vaccination and after receiving the vaccination certificate, the former CM had questioned the logic behind putting picture of the PM on the certificate. “President Ram Nath Kovind’s photo would be more appropriate on the certificate as he is the highest constitutional functionary in India,” Manjhi said. As an alternative, the former CM suggested, the certificates can have the photos of the President, the Prime Minister as well as the chief minister of the respective states. The Jharkhand government has already started using CM Hemant Soren’s photograph on vaccination certificates, so has the Chhattisgarh government.The main Opposition RJD was quick to back Manjhi. “What he raised today, we have already been demanding. If you (Manjhi) are against the autocratic system, come out of the NDA. Otherwise, people will think you are issuing statements to stay in news,” said RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary.BJP and JD(U), both part of the ruling NDA in Bihar, were guarded in their reaction. “I can say for sure that the certificate is an authentic letter for one and all anywhere in world,” said BJP Bihar president Sanjay Jaiswal.JD(U) state president Umesh Kushwaha said, “Manjhiji is a mature leader and part of the NDA. In democracy, everybody has the right to put forward his views and at times people come out with personal views as well, which is always welcome. This is the beauty of democracy.” HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan, while justifying Manjhi’s demand, alleged that vaccination percentage among Dalits and Adivasis had been abysmally low in the state. “Not 1% of the population of Dalit and Advisasis have been vaccinated yet, because they fear vaccination. Putting President’s picture, who is also a Dalit, will inspire them,” Rizwan said. Political analyst D M Diwakar said Manjhi, by issuing such statements, was sending “confusing” signal. “This means all is not well for him in the ruling alliance and he is testing waters. Problem with him is that he cannot adjust anywhere, but, he along with VIP and AIMIM can be helpful in forming a government in such fluid conditions in Bihar,” said Diwakar, former director of A N Sinha Institute for Social Studies.

The PMC road department had in the past given permission to lay underground optical fibres to telecom companies including government and private. In Wanowrie, the PMC road department found that one of the private telecom companies laid down 700 metres of optical fibre near Shivarkar garden area. The local residents registered a complaint to PMC officials. Sunil Kadam, executive engineer of road department said, “We had given permission for 300 metres of cables to the VPPN firm. The company paid for 200 metres; however, we came to know from local residents that the company placed a total of 700 metres underground cables.” “When we contacted the company officials, they denied it. So, we filed a complaint against an unknown person and have removed the unauthorised cables with the help of machinery on Monday,” Kadam said. As per the demand of telecom companies, the civic body’s road department officials scrutinise applications from private firms and charge ₹10,155 per metre for laying the cable. “As per normal procedure, PMC officials check maps and drawings submitted by agencies and visit the site to crosscheck the permitted cables and actual laid cables. There is no third-party checking,” he said. According to PMC road officials, for the last two years no permission was given to any company. Right now, the PMC road department has given around 150 kilometres of permission to telecom companies to lay underground cables. Agency to identify unauthorised cables The PMC has sanctioned a trenching policy in the city to streamline the process of laying underground pipelines or cables and avoid occurrence of faults, requiring excavation for carrying out repairs and bringing the excavated surface back to its original status. Besides this, PMC wanted to stop unauthorised or illegal installation of cables or digging in the city. The officials found that private telecom companies are not following the norms mentioned in the trenching policy. Citizens are complaining about illegal digging and laying optical fibres in the areas, said a civic official. Taking cognisance of citizen complaints and in an attempt to boost the revenue of the corporation, the PMC has taken a decision to appoint an agency to find out illegal cables in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-removes-unauthorised-optical-fibre-cables-in-wanowrie-101621869247179.html

Students from the city share that they miss making new friends and college activities like fests and compensations. Siddhi Disale, a student of Class 12 at Sushilatai Bahudhani junior college said that she misses learning in offline mode. “I started my Class 11 with Science stream last year when the college started online. Since then, I have interacted with a lot of classmates but could not make friends. We could not meet and bond at all. We spoke only for sharing notes. I miss a lot of things about offline classes. Especially the interaction we used to have with teachers. Except for asking doubts we don’t interact with them on other topics,” said Disale. She also said that she has no idea about what offline practicals are because she has not attended any so far. “I have opted for Science, but I haven’t attended any practical and the experience of learning is not there. This is what I miss the most about college,” said Disale. Another student of Class 12 with Shree Haribhau Balwantrao Girme junior college, Prerana Kadam said until class 10, she was very excited about college. “But due to the lockdown, all this excitement was gone. More than that due to online education, there were no college fests, no competition and we couldn’t meet any students as well. This was a little disheartening. When we say college we imagine a lot of fun things, but these two years have been just opening a laptop and studying power point presentations,” said Kadam. Sarthak Kulkarni, a class 12 student from Garware College who is also a theatre enthusiast said that he was excited about junior college. “I wanted to participate in theatre groups and be on the stage, but all the activities have stopped. I follow college contests like Purshottam drama competition. I was hoping to participate in them but due to the lockdown and Covid I have missed this opportunity as well,” said Kulkarni. “Earlier college was an experience but now it is just endless online lectures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-missing-experience-of-offline-learning-college-life-due-to-covid-restrictions-101621869187144.html

The Pimpri-Chinchwad police arrested both Pooja Milind Shinde and her husband Milind Gautum Shinde (30), who were remanded to four days in police custody by a local court on Monday. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Talegaon Dabhade police station. The deceased woman was identified as Baby Gautam Shinde (50) a resident of Talegaon Dabhade area of Pune. The incident happened in Daulat society in Telco Colony of Talegaon Dabhade area around 10 am on May 21, officials said, adding that the incident came to light three days later after some neighbours saw the accused couple trying to get rid of the sack. While the arrested woman is a housewife, the husband works as a driver. The victim and the arrested lived in the same house with the arrested man’s younger brother Amit Shinde (22). Amit Shinde was at work when the incident happened. Police officials said the woman used a blouse to strangle her mother-in-law to death following a domestic fight between them. The husband then helped the woman dump the body on the terrace of the building they lived in. The body was wrapped in a gunny bag and dragged by Pooja with husband’s help, the police said based on the CCTV of the act recovered. However, when the other family members started enquiring about the woman’s whereabouts, the couple panicked and shifted the body close to a nearby bungalow’s garden. “We found the CCTV of them dragging the gunny bag from the terrace to the nearby garden. The husband was not involved in the murder, but he was clearly involved in the destruction of evidence. We are investigating what led to the murder, but it seems like a domestic fight turned violent,” said assistant police inspector Narayan Patil of Talegaon Dabhade police station who is investigating the case. A complaint in the matter was lodged by the younger son of the deceased woman who also lived with the assailants and the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-woman-kills-mother-in-law-tries-to-dispose-of-body-with-husband-s-help-101621869067173.html

24-05-2021||Kolkata||‘Centre discriminating with funds for Yaas cyclone, depriving Bengal’: Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged that the Centre was depriving the state by allocating insufficient funds to fight cyclone Yaas compared to what was being allocated to Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.“They have announced an advance fund of ₹600 crore each to Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and a little more than ₹400 for West Bengal. I have questioned why Bengal was being deprived despite being a larger state with a dense population. I asked Shah why this discrimination. He said that he would talk later and that that allocation was based on scientific views,” said Banerjee. She said that at least 20 districts in West Bengal, including Kalimpong and Darjeeling in the north, could be affected even though the three coastal districts – South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore - along with Kolkata would bear the direct brunt. “Evacuation has already started and we plan to evacuate at least 10 lakh people. Around 4,000 cyclone and relief shelters have been set up. At least 51 rescue teams have been deployed. A 24X7 control room has been set up at the state secretariat which would coordinate up to block level,” the chief minister said, adding that the army has been alerted. The chief minister urged people to wear masks even at relief centres as Covid-19 was taking a heavy toll in the state. On Sunday the state recorded more than 18,000 new cases. At least 156 people had died on Sunday.“This time we have set up safe homes and quarantine centres where suspected and patients detected with Covid after RAT could be shifted,” said a senior official of North 24 Parganas who is associated with the evacuation process ahead of the cyclone. Very severe cyclone ‘Yaas’ is expected to cross the Odisha-West Bengal coast, close to Balasore in Odisha, around Wednesday noon, Union home minister Amit Shah held a virtual meeting on Monday morning with the three states to assess the preparedness. In May 2020, Bengal was hit by another very severe cyclone Amphan with similar intensity killing 98 people and damaging property worth a few thousand crores.“Very severe cyclone Yaas is expected to cross the Odisha-Wes Bengal coast between Paradip and Sagar close to Balasore in Odisha on Wednesday noon. It would move towards Jharkhand,” said Sanjib Bandopadhyay, deputy director of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional office in Kolkata. During the time of landfall, the cyclone would trigger wind with speed up to 155 – 165 kmph gusting up to 185 kmph in the district of East Midnapore, located along the West Bengal – Odisha border. In Kolkata, the wind speed may reach up to 70 – 80 kmph gusting up to 90 kmph, Light to moderate rainfall has already begun in the coastal districts of West Bengal. The spread and intensity of the rain would increase from Tuesday with some districts likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain. On May 27 even Sikkim may receive heavy rain.“Hospitals have been asked to keep power backup and oxygen storage at least for two days,” said a senior health official. Around 1,000 power-restoration teams and 450 telecom restoration teams have been readied. Boat movements have been suspended and railway authorities have been asked to cancel some trains. Officials said that that it would be hard to reach some of the islands on Tuesday as the sea and river conditions would turn rough when the cyclone comes nearer to the coast, evacuation has been launched on Monday. “While around 1200 – 1500 people living along the banks of Ghoramara Island were being shifted to relief shelters on the mainland, others were shifted to cyclone shelters built on higher and safer grounds within the island itself,” said a senior official of South 24 Parganas. In some blocks in the Sunderban, pregnant women, particularly those who have their estimated date of delivery in the next one or two weeks, have also been evacuated and shifted to hospitals and ‘mother hubs’. “As the cyclone would be hitting when the water level is already high because of the Spring Tide phase, we are expecting a storm surge of 2 – 4 meres in East Midnapore and 1 – 2 metres in North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas,” said a weather department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-discriminating-with-funds-for-yaas-cyclone-depriving-bengal-mamata-banerjee-101621864147712.html

Today there are partial or complete lockdowns (in every state)," he added.The chief minister said that Jharkhand got barely 40 lakh doses of vaccines against a requirement of 4 crore doses, leading to the shortage.However, the state government would make serious efforts to procure vaccines, including through imports, he said.Soren said the state government would soon make a decision on extending the lockdown as 23 of its 24 districts share borders with either Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh or Chattisgarh, which are severely affected.Every day about 20,000 people are coming to the state through the railways and to combat the spread, Jharkhand has decided to intensify testing in rural areas on a war footing, Soren said.In urban areas, he said, the chain of the virus has been broken and fresh cases have reduced drastically to around 2,000 from earlier 15,000-20,000 a day."As far as death rates are concerned, we are the top in the country. UP and Bihar are reporting fewer deaths but you can assess if it is true. Many states are manipulating data but it is the priority of our government that we will ensure full transparency and take all possible steps to contain the virus," Soren said."Till the time a single death takes place in the state, we will consider it as peak," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-facing-vaccine-shortage-2-3-days-stock-left-for-18-44-group-cm-soren-101621862612531.html

Singh gave written replies to the questions mentioned in the notice sent to him last week and said everything he has posted or shared on social media are in the public domain,” said Superintendent of Police, Raipur, Ajay Yadav, adding that the police are examining the written answers submitted by Singh Meanwhile, Singh later told reporters that the FIR was a Congress conspiracy, adding that, the “police in Chhattisgarh was being governed by the Congress and not the law”. “The notice issued to me by the police was tweeted by the Congress even before I got it. The document, which should have been with the police, was with the Congress. It clearly indicates from where the police are getting directions and working under pressure,” the former CM alleged. The complaint against Singh and others was lodged by Congress’s student wing leader Akash Sharma. “They forged, falsely fabricated and manufactured the said documents on the letterhead of AICC research department and spread such material in social media which has the potential of creating communal disharmony, unrest in the country and the said document is being utilised by the BJP to spread fake news which has the potential of evoking violence and fueling hatred,” the complaint said. On May 19, an FIR was registered at Civil Lines station of the state capital against Raman Singh, BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra and others for allegedly spreading fake news and “promoting enmity between classes”, in the toolkit row. The Civil Lines Police Station of Raipur on the complaint filed by National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Chhattisgarh chief Akash Sharma had registered a case under sections 504, 505 (1) b, c, 469 and 188 of Indian Penal Code.

24-05-2021||Other||Mask it right to keep Covid away||The central government’s advisory on double masking to beat the highly virulent, contagious and unpredictable coronavirus variants is in keeping with the more stringent masking moves made in several other countries to deal with the rapidly mutating viruses.However, in order to implement it and break the cycle of transmission, the government needs to quickly distribute the masks free of costs to all those who cannot afford them and also educate all consumers on the importance of wearing the mask and donning it right. This becomes extremely important in view of several scientific studies confirming the effectiveness of universal masking to curb the spread of the disease.The quality of the mask is as important. In fact increasing scientific data on the comparative efficacy of different kinds of masks, the way the virus is transmitted as well as its mutations into more deadly variants –the virus is said to mutate almost every 11-15 minutes- are all forcing many countries around the world to re-visit their masking guidelines. France, for example, has banned wearing of home-made cotton masks and industrially made fabric masks with lesser filtering qualities in public, on the ground that they do not offer sufficient protection to the wearer from more contagious variants. Germany has made medical masks mandatory in stores and on public transit.In India too, the government had last year recommended a simple home-made mask, but obviously, that is not adequate to protect the wearer any more. The principal scientific adviser to the government, while recommending double masking to prevent the spread of the virus, made three important points: (a) N-95 masks offer maximum protection against the virus (b) double masking should be done with an inner layer of surgical mask and a tight fitting outer layer of cotton mask and (c) if a surgical mask is not available, you can use two cotton masks. ‘ A double layer of home-made cotton masks is better than none’, said the advisory to prevent transmission of the virus.The problem with home-made single layered masks is that there is no quality standard, they do not have a nose pin nor proper ear loops to ensure a tight fit as required and their filtration efficiency is poor when compared to three-layered non-woven surgical masks or N-95 masks or even multi-layered hybrid fabrics. Several studies have also shown the poor protection offered to the wearer by loose fitting masks with gaps between the skin and the mask.So effective masking to prevent community spread of the virus requires protection through either double masking with a surgical mask and a cotton mask or an N-95 mask. However, this obviously costs more than wearing a single layered home made mask and puts an additional burden on families already reeling under poverty and unemployment. Besides, all citizens should get equal protection from the virus. In the absence of free mask supplies, the poor will be placed at a very big disadvantage. In fact a large percentage of the economically disadvantaged do not wear the mask at all or wear the same surgical mask, probably given free , repeatedly, thereby giving them no protection from the virus. Another problem is with fake and sub-standard masks flooding the markets since the beginning of the pandemic. Whether surgical, N-95 or even cotton masks, poor quality masks will become an even major problem in rural areas, as the virus stalks villages in the second wave, taking a heavy toll.We are already worried about a third wave and experts are also warning us that the virus is not going to disappear for quite some time and we need to be wearing masks even after full vaccination. So all these factors make it imperative that good quality masks be distributed by the government free of cost to the economically vulnerable sections through fare price shops, anganwadis, primary health centres, vaccination centres and such other facilities. Of course, it is equally important to educate people about the correct way to wear the mask. Quoting a sample survey, the union health ministry recently said only seven per cent of the population wore the mask right, covering their nose, mouth and chin with a mask fitted with a nose pin and drawn tightly over the face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mask-it-right-to-keep-covid-away-101621861986982.html

In a tweet, Manjhi said that if Covid-19 vaccination certificates bear the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi then death certificates issued to all those who died of the virus must also have the PM’s photograph. “If you are so fond of putting (the PM’s) photograph on the vaccine certificate, then his photo should be put on the death certificate of death too. Only this will be fair”, said Manjhi in a tweet on Monday. This is the second time in two days that Manjhi had embarrassed the BJP and the NDA. Earlier on Sunday, soon after taking the second dose of Covid-19 vaccination and after receiving the vaccination certificate, the former CM questioned the logic behind putting the PM’s picture on the vaccination certificates. “President Ram Nath Kovind’s photo would be more appropriate on the certificate as he is the highest constitutional functionary in India,” said Manjhi. As an alternative, the former Bihar CM suggested that the certificates can have the photos of the President, the Prime Minister as well as the chief minister of the respective states.Manjhi is not the lone politician to have objected to the PM’s photo on the certificates. The Jharkhand government started issuing certificates with CM Hemant Soren’s photograph instead. In a similar move, the Chhattisgarh government started rolling out its own vaccination certificate for the 18-44 age group with CM Bhupesh Baghel’s photo.Manjhi’s tweet has given the opposition a ray of hope of a possible defection amid the pandemic. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), while backing Manjhi’s demands, provoked him to come out of the alliance. “What he raised today, the opposition has been demanding the same. If you are against the autocratic system, come out of it otherwise people will think that you are issuing statements to be in news,” said RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary. “I can say for sure that the certificate is an authentic letter for one and all anywhere in the world,” said BJP Bihar president Sanjay Jaiswal while the Janata Dal (United) state president Umesh Kushwaha said, “Manjhiji is a mature leader and part of the NDA. In a democracy, everybody has the right to put forward his views and at times people come out with personal views as well, which is always welcome. This is the beauty of democracy.”HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan justified Manjhi’s demand and alleged that vaccination percentage among Dalits and Adivasis has been abysmally low in the state. “Not 1% of the population of Dalit and the adivasis (the tribals) have been vaccinated yet because they are afraid and fear vaccination. Putting the President’s picture, who is also a Dalit, will inspire them,” said Rizwan. The HAM-S spokesperson said that “One wants to get laurels for vaccination. Then he should also get the pictures on death certificates,” indicating a large number of Covid-19 deaths in the state. Political analyst DM Diwakar said that Manjhi, by issuing such statements, is sending out a “confusing signal.” “This means that all is not good for him in the ruling alliance and he’s probably judging waters elsewhere. The problem with him is that he cannot adjust anywhere but he, along with VIP, Owaisi’s party, can be helpful in forming government in such fluid conditions in Bihar,” said Diwakar who is also a former director at AN Singa Institute for Social Studies. Manjhi’s party, the HAM-S, is part of the NDA in Bihar and his son Santosh Manjhi is the minister for minor irrigation and SC/ST welfare department in the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government. The HAM-S won four seats out of seven it contested during assembly elections held in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bjp-ally-jitan-ram-manjhi-embarrasses-nda-over-pm-s-pic-on-covid-19-vaccine-certificate-101621859767419.html

A panel of doctors from Sir JJ hospital recommended the termination to the court, which was informed that the mother who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment realised she was pregnant only in the 19-20th week and the pregnancy was in its 25th week. The pregnancy had crossed the 24-week mark for termination, which was approved by the Parliament in March, so the couple had approached the court for permission.

24-05-2021||Other||Monday Musings: A sellers’ market as pvt hospitals begin to ease vaccination burden on state||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Sunday, said that the state would soon begin a 24-hour vaccination drive, as production capacity is likely to ramp up in June. Presently, vaccination for people aged between 18-45 years at public hospitals in Maharashtra has been put on hold due to lack of a smooth supply of vaccines. The Maharashtra government has, instead, decided to continue vaccinating those above 45 years of age, for whom doses are being purchased by the Centre and then distributed among the states. The state government, in view of the non-availability of vaccines, has completely withdrawn from the responsibility of vaccinating those in the age group of 18-44 years over the last few days; this age group has been most vulnerable to the virus during the second wave. On an insistence from various states, the Centre had, mid-April, allowed them to purchase vaccine doses directly from manufacturers to inoculate those above the age of 18 years. The shortage of vaccines made it difficult for states to continue with the vaccination programme. With only two firms supplying vaccines in India and different states and local bodies, including the Brihan Mumbai and Pune municipal corporations awaiting a response to proposed global tenders, it is increasingly proving to be a suppliers’ market. As the state is unwilling to immediately restart immunisation for all adults, the responsibility of inoculating this class is now partially being shared by private hospitals in cities like Pune. After starting vaccinations on Friday, as reported by Hindustan Times Pune in its May 21 edition, more private hospitals have received Covishield doses from the Serum Institute of India, the city- based Covid vaccine manufacturer. In two days, at least 12 private hospitals procured doses and begun the inoculation programme across the city. These hospitals from Pune are charging ₹900 for each dose of Covishield, almost four times higher than the ₹250 price determined by the Union government at “non-public” hospitals, when the drive had started for those above the age of 45 years. The private hospitals are getting each dose from the manufacturer at slightly more than ₹600, including transportation and GST. They will also have to take into account wastage of some doses. For employees of corporate houses, the hospitals have priced each dose at ₹1,200 given that jabs are likely to be given on campus. There are scores of corporate houses, IT firms and manufacturing units in Pune who have lined up with these private hospitals and the on-campus drive is likely to start within two days. (See Page 3). Initially, the Cowin portal showed that almost all slots with most private hospitals are booked. With demand far higher than supply as the virus is unsparing in taking lives, most hospitals are witnessing long queues. The involvement of private hospitals in vaccination programme is a welcome step, given that the state government has shunned its responsibility. The need of the hour is to vaccinate as many, and as quickly as possible, as it will help the city drive towards herd immunity to withstand a possible third wave. The chief minister has repeatedly said the state is willing to buy 120 million doses to inoculate the entire 60 million population of Maharashtra, but it may take time for Maharashtra to start the drive for everyone, given that the shortage of doses from manufacturers is likely to continue. Pune has so far vaccinated close to 2.6 million people from various categories. It still has millions to be inoculated. Compared to the economic cost that city has been paying due to lockdown in the past two months of the second wave, the benefit of vaccinating the maximum number of citizens, even through private hospitals where the price is higher, clearly outweighs the cons. Those who can afford the price and are opting for private hospitals are actually reducing the burden on the government, which may at a later point resume vaccination for the larger population free of cost. For suppliers, it makes sense to sell doses to private hospitals rather than to the government, which is procuring the doses at a cheaper rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-a-sellers-market-as-pvt-hospitals-begin-to-ease-vaccination-burden-on-state-101621853227407.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Antibiotic pollution in Sirsa river flowing through Baddi pharma hub||Due to industrial waste being dumped into the Sirsa river that flows through Himachal Pradesh’s pharma hub of Baddi and Barotiwala, its water has a high content of ciprofloxacin class of drugs called quinolone antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections. Also read: Now, on-site registration for 18 and above at govt vaccination centresThe India Veterans Forum for Transparency in Public Life, an NGO that is a constituent of the Consortium for Common Cause (CCC), has conducted a first-of-its-kind study to find out the level of pollutants in the form of discharge of antibiotics in the river in Baddi. To begin with, the discharge of ciprofloxacin was studied. The study, pioneered by wing commander BNP Singh (retd), showed that the level of ciprofloxacin downstream was extremely high and, in some instances, bordering on 1,500 times the basic safe limits meant for such discharge. NGT directed state to study pollution in riverArmed with the findings, the forum filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on June 24, 2020. Hearing the matter, the NGT last year directed the authorities to constitute a task force and study the matter. As a result, the Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board (HPPCB) conducted followup tests and submitted its test reports to the NGT recently. “The tests confirmed ciprofloxacin pollution in the river,” major Kunwar Suresh Rana, the forum organising secretary, said. The board submitted its report to the state government besides the NGT. Studies found contents of ciprofloxacin and directions have been sought from the Central Pollution Control Board on the permissible limits. Impact of toxic discharge on human life The HPPCB test reports also conclude that though there are no standards available for this kind of pollution, there are draft recommendations and by going through them, it can be easily inferred that pollution found in the river is 1,500 times the acceptable norms. In the absence of any standards for evaluating the impact of the highly toxic discharge on human life, it is difficult to ascertain the health problems being faced by the population using the river water downstream and the natural seepage of the toxins into the groundwater table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/antibiotic-pollution-in-sirsa-river-flowing-through-baddi-pharma-hub-101621851789448.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Moderna, Pfizer said they’ll deal only with Centre, not states: Delhi govt||US pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Moderna have informed the Delhi government that “they will deal with the Central government” only and not sell Covid-19 vaccines individually to any state, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. This comes at a time when government vaccination centres in Delhi have been closed for those below 45 years due to non-availability of doses and the government is trying to place orders with Indian and foreign manufacturers to replenish their stocks and reopen all centres.“We have spoken to Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, and both the manufacturers have refused to sell directly to us. They have said they will deal with the Central government. We appeal to the Centre to import vaccines and distribute to the states,” Kejriwal told reporters on Monday. His statement also comes a day after Punjab said Moderna has refused to sell vaccines directly to the state.Kejriwal added: “We need vaccines. The Centre talked to Moderna, and Pfizer, and completed negotiations within 2-3 days. Why can’t it talk again to [vaccine] companies and complete negotiations in 3-4 days? Why is it not being done urgently? Bharat Biotech, which is manufacturing Covaxin, is willing to share its formula with everyone. A national newspaper reported that 16 companies here can produce Covaxin. Out of them, Bharat Biotech has struck a deal with only two companies. The Centre should order, not request, these 16 companies to start production within the next few days.”He added, “According to that report, if the 16 companies start production, they can produce 250 million vaccines every month. Then why are we not making these? Take the example of UK and USA. There are less than 18,000 cases in the USA. That shows that vaccine is the only solution to this [crisis]. Covaxin [stock in Delhi] is over but Covishield is left for a few days.”Also Read | Hoarding case: Drug controller to probe Gautam Gambhir, others, says Delhi HCIn the afternoon, in a press briefing, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government has reached out to Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson&Johnson for vaccines, of which the former two have refused.“We asked the Centre for vaccines for the younger people, to which it replied that Delhi will only get 400,000 and the rest must be procured through a global tender. So, we reached out to foreign manufacturers and they have said they will only give to the Centre. The Central government has made vaccines a joke in India,” Sisodia said.“The Centre is solely responsible for vaccine shortage in the country. It failed to manage and sustain its vaccination drive. It was the Centre’s responsibility to make vaccines available to the entire country, but it chose to sell doses to others first merely for image management across the globe,” he said.The deputy chief minister urged the Central government to expedite approvals to foreign vaccines, and procure, and distribute them among states. He said foreign-made vaccines which the states have been asked to procure through global tenders have not even been given full approvals by the Central government till now.“Russia gave approval to its Sputnik vaccine in August last year and it started mass vaccination in December. In 2020, India had refused to give approval to Sputnik and did so only last month. We are only playing approval-approval here, whereas 68 countries bought Sputnik vaccines way before and started using them. Britain gave approval to US-made Pfizer in December. We were sleeping back then and are still sleeping. At least 85 countries approved Pfizer vaccine and started procuring and vaccinating, but in India, we have not yet given approval,” he said.“Moderna has been approved by 46 counties but India has not given its approval. At least 41 countries have approved the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, we have not yet given approval to sell it. What is this joke? The vaccines which the Centre has asked us to buy from outside have not even been approved in the country yet,” he said.Watch | ‘Pfizer & Moderna refused to sell Covid jabs to Delhi because..’: KejriwalSisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19, said all other countries closely monitored vaccine development across the globe and placed orders well in advance. “By November, 2020, nearly seven months ago, the USA and the European Union had procured 700 million vaccine doses. The US had started procuring vaccines right from their trial stages and today, it has enough doses for each of its citizens. Britain started its vaccination programme in January this year, and in that month itself, it had enough vaccines to cover 75% of its population,” he said.“In November 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the vaccine manufacturing plant of Serum Institute of India. The Indian government pumped in money to increase production only last month whereas the US started investing in production of vaccines in March, 2020,” Sisodia said.The minister said he hopes the Centre expedites procurement of vaccines to avoid a situation where even those who have got their first dose are made to take the vaccines all over again due to excessive delay in getting the second jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/moderna-pfizer-said-they-ll-deal-only-with-centre-not-states-delhi-govt-101621849507080.html

Una superintendent of police Arjit Sen Thakur said the accused, Shankar Nishad, 63, a native of Bihar, was arrested and booked for murder. Also read: China accuses US of hyping theory Coronavirus escaped from lab in WuhanThakur said the incident occurred at 1.30am after four migrant labourers living in a rented accommodation had an argument. The accused attacked the other three with a sharp-edged weapon. One of them escaped and tried to hide in a neighbour’s house but Nishad chased and attacked him on the terrace of the house. He attacked Seema Devi, the wife of Naresh Kumar, and their 13-year-old daughter as they were sleeping on the terrace. He fled when people gathered on hearing their cries for help but was later arrested. The deceased youngster was identified as Ranveer Shah, the son of Vinod Shah. Besides Seema Devi, the two others injured, Manoj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar, were admitted to the Regional Hospital at Una, while the teenaged girl was rushed to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, where her condition is stated to be stable. The interrogation of the accused is on to ascertain the motive of the crime. According to panchayat members, Nishad had come to the village on May 20 and worked as a farm labourer like the rest of the victims. This is the second such crime involving migrant labourers in Una. Two days ago, two migrant labourers had beaten their friend to death at Dehlan village near the industrial town of Mehatpur.

This is the second time the state has extended the lockdown first announced from May 5 till May 15.“Reviewed the ongoing lockdown in Bihar with ministerial colleagues and officials. The lockdown is showing good results and positive cases are coming down. Therefore, we have decided to extend the lockdown in the state for seven days, from May 26 till June 1, 2021,” Nitish Kumar said in a tweet, posted in Hindi.The lockdown has slowed down the spread of the infection.On Sunday, Bihar reported 4,002 positive cases, down from the 14,794 positive cases reported in the state on May 4, the day before the lockdown.“The positivity rate which stood at 15.7% on May 2 has come down to 3% on May 12 and the recovery rate has increased to 93.44%,” said a senior Bihar government official, requesting anonymity.According to the Union health ministry data, there were 33 districts in Bihar which had a positivity rate of more than 10% a fortnight back. On Monday, there was only one district in this list: state capital Patna.Bihar’s crisis management group decided on May 4 to impose a state-wide lockdown from the following day in a desperate attempt to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases and the continuing shortage of life saving drugs, medical oxygen and hospital beds across the state.The state government had been reluctant to go for a hard lockdown when the second wave of Covid infections hit many parts of the country and had tried to control the spread of the infection in early April with restrictions on trade and business activities. Schools and other educational institutions and religious places were told to close. Private and government offices were told that not more than 33% of the staffers can report to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid-ve-cases-on-decline-says-nitish-kumar-extends-bihar-lockdown-by-7-days-101621848308582.html

If required, they may opt for video conferencing," the communication added.Lockdown was imposed in the state on May 5 for 11 days and, buoyed by the "positive outcome", the government extended it till May 25. During the period, a marked decline has been observed in the active caseload and positivity rate while the recovery rate has improved.The state had been relatively less severely affected by the viral outbreak when it first struck last year. However, the second wave has wrought devastation, infecting more than four lakh people in the last couple of months and claiming over 2,000 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ministers-asked-not-to-flout-lockdown-by-touring-constituencies-101621846516129.html

24-05-2021||Delhi||‘Not the way’: Delhi HC orders probe by drug controller against Gautam Gambhir, others in hoarding case||Delhi High Court on Monday said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Gautam Gambhir may have essential medicines to treat patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital in his possession but it was “no way” of going about it and that he has done "disservice" by stocking the drugs which were in short supply. “We are not doubting his intentions. But what has happened… The way he has gone about it, he has done a disservice. Ten other people would stand up and say we will also adopt this modus operandi. This was not the way,” the bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Jasmeet Singh said. "..With the best of the intentions they remain malpractice and in our society we cannot permit this," the court said. The court directed Delhi's drug controller to conduct a probe in the allegations and submit a report within one week. It was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) seeking lodging of a first information report (FIR) over the allegations that politicians could procure in huge quantities and distribute Covid-19 medicines even as families of patients were running from pillar to post to get the drugs.The bench said Gambhir, who represents East Delhi in the Lok Sabha, must have done it with best of intention but he knew that the medicine was in short supply. “Is that responsible behaviour? Should he not have realised that medicines are in shortage for others. He even has some stocks now. This means that when people were running helter-skelter, he was having it in excess. When people were not getting medicines, should he not have thought about this? Many people would have suffered because of this. This was no way,” it said.The court on May 7 directed Delhi Police to carry out an investigation in the alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders even as it refused to direct the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the case acting on a plea by a person, Deepak Singh. Delhi Police cleared nine politicians, including Gambhir, Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president BV Srinivas, as well Dilip Pandey of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), in its preliminary investigation report for alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders, as well as other essential medicines during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.“We would like you to tell us what inquiry you have done. We are not going in other things because the material is not clear. Here a clear case is made out. We want you to tell us what action can be taken against such people, everyone in the chain,” the bench said on Monday. Also read | Hoarding case: Delhi HC dissatisfied with clean chit to BV Srinivas, others“We want to pursue this only with respect to Fabiflu. Otherwise, it will be a witch hunt. We want to see the prescription of the doctor and the offences that are made out and to take actions accordingly,” it added.The bench said three instances of Gambhir, the AAP’s Preeti Tomar and AAP MLA Praveen Kumar deserve to be inquired by the drug controller of Delhi. It is also disclosed that said 2862 strips were purchased from authorised vendor. "The aspect which needs to be examined is that how such a large quantity of medicine was issued by the authorised vendor against one prescription dated April 18 particularly when the said medicine was in grave short supply at the relevant point of time," it said.“We can take judicial note of this aspect as we have been hearing these matters for some time. It would also need examination as to how these medicines which were purchased from retail were given to the patients by Manish Garg or the Garg Hospital.”Also read | Row over Gautam Gambhir’s offer of free FabiFlu from his office“Since the actions are in violation of the Drug Controller Act, let all the material collected by Delhi Police be given to them.

Similarly, in relation to Praveen Kumar and Preeti Tomar, we have perused the report for their alleged conduct of medical oxygen, similar exercise for them as well and include its finding in the SR to be filed within a week,” it added.It also ordered Delhi Police to share relevant material with the drug controller. “We direct the law department of the Delhi government to ensure that necessary expertise is provided to the drug controller to carry out their duties,” it said.Gambhir, on his part, has denied the allegations. He said the Gautam Gambhir Foundation had organised a free medical camp between April 22 and May 7 to provide assistance to people suffering from Covid-19.

This Sunday, the Nuh administration launched dedicated, round-the-clock Covid-19 helplines -- 1950,1800 180 1256, 01267 282 002, +91 70826 26686 -- to provide citizens critical information related to Covid-19 resources.Officials said that chatbot number +91-8059312201 has also been activated on WhatsApp on queries regarding sampling, bed availability, vaccination, home isolation, RT-PCR reports and medical team consultations.Dr Basant Dubey, district immunisation officer of Nuh, said they are facing challenges getting people to come forward for vaccination and testing. “We have involved mobiliser mitras to spread awareness among the villagers to get tested and vaccinated. Villagers are facing issues with online registration and for that, we have tied up with 317 computer operators in different villages who are running customer service centres to help in the registration,” he said. Vaccination for 45+ age group is done through on-the-spot registration at all 17 primary health centres, four community health centres, the government medical college in Nalhar and village routine immunisation session sites . Those in the 18-44 age group need to register online on the CoWin portal.Dr Dubey said they have written to the state government to allow them to start offline vaccinations across the district. “The vaccination number will increase once the offline process starts and people can walk into these centres,” he said.Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata said the WhatsApp chatbot sources information directly from district administration officers. “The helpline will connect villagers to official sources of information and medical services, thus enabling quick access and helping the administration streamline its relief efforts,” he said. The chatbot has processed over 5,000 conversations on WhatsApp from users across the district, including over 1,000 messages sent on Sunday,” he said.Khadgata said the district has seen vaccine hesitancy to a large degree. “To motivate more people to go for Covid vaccination, we have roped in 100 mobiliser mitras, one at each subcentre, for supporting AAAs (ASHA, anganwadi worker and auxiliary nurse midwife) with activities. The teams are regularly doing activities among the community though there have been instances of aggressive behaviour against even our female field workers in the villages. There are 38 villages where despite our regular mobilisation activities, we could not vaccinate a single individual,” he said.The district administration has also roped in maulanas and other social figures to create awareness and get more villagers to come forward for vaccination, said officials.They said since April, they have conducted several meetings at public places, like dhabas, grocery stores, barbershops, and community centres, where villagers were counselled. Nuh total population is nearly 1.4million and 65% of its population belongs to the15-60 age group. Of the adult population, 237,451 people have been vaccinated with the first dose and 22,847 have been vaccinated with the second dose until May 23.The district sees around 1,700 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and RT-PCR tests on average each day, but officials are planning to increase it to 2,000 soon . Till May 23, 4,746 people have tested positive. Two mobile RT-PCR and RAT sampling vans have been deployed at 22 fixed sites -- primary, and community health centres-- to improve testing. “In containment zones, we are doing sampling every day and trying to reach each house. Currently, our positivity rate is 6.1%( May 22), last week’s average was 7.94% . In the past week, the cumulative report was 1.74% , the lowest in the 22 districts of Haryana,” said Khadgata, adding that the recovery rate of the district is more than 92% and contact tracing is 20%, which is the highest in 22 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/helplines-mobiliser-teams-to-fight-vaccine-resistance-in-haryana-s-nuh-101621843031670.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||NSUI seeks refund of ‘extra’ fee charged by Mumbai university colleges last year||National Students Union of India (NSUI) on Sunday requested the vice chancellor of University of Mumbai to direct all affiliated colleges to either refund or adjust resources fee collected for the 2020-21 academic year citing financial constraints faced by students due to Covid-19 pandemic. This category includes charges for library, laboratory, gymkhana, sports and cultural activities, among others.“The pandemic has left an undesirable impact on every earning sector, thus creating a financial crisis in many families. Higher education institutes need to offer fee concession to students in such times,” stated the letter. NSUI also shared copies of fee receipts to highlight that students were charged for unused resources/facilities by several colleges in and around Mumbai despite classes and examinations being held online.Earlier in March, another student group had approached the vice chancellor’s office with a similar demand, but it got no official response from the varsity.“In several cases, despite warnings from higher authorities, several higher education institutes have demanded full fees from students, increasing the financial burden on their families,” said Faisal Shaikh, a member of NSUI in Mumbai. He added that the union will also try to meet the vice chancellor in furtherance of the demand.Not just students, many affiliated colleges, too, had approached the Mumbai university for refunds. Last year in November, the Association of Non-Government Colleges (ANGC) sought a refund of 60% examination fees paid by them to the varsity, citing “increased expenses” due to teaching and examinations having shifted online. “Students think just because they didn’t use the college campus the fee should be reduced, but they fail to understand how colleges are incurring larger expenses by investing in digital platforms and ensuring all exams are conducted online. We are only charging the fees needed for proper functioning of the institute,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nsui-seeks-refund-of-extra-fee-charged-by-mumbai-university-colleges-last-year-101621841107216.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to hold Class 12 exams in core subjects, curtailed format||The Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) will conduct the Class 12 final exams only for main core subjects in a curtailed format. As many as 2.7 lakh students are to take the exams that have been held up due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We will conduct board exams for Class 12 students in a curtailed format. Each exam will be of one-and-a-half hours instead of three hours and students’ own schools will be the exam centres. The paper will have only objective and short-answer questions,” board secretary Rajiv Prasad said on Monday.He said a review meeting of the board is scheduled on June 1.Also read: B.1.617 variant found in 65% of samples sequenced, says health minister15-day notice to students before exams “The board will give a 15-day notice to students for the exams. Our focus is on conducting the exams in a safe and secure environment. All exams will be conducted by following the Covid-19 guidelines,” he said.The Haryana government will conduct board exams of main subjects, including mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, political science, English, Hindi, history, geography and accountancy. The marks of the fifth subject will be decided based on the performance in the main subjects.On the Class 10 results, Prasad said that the state board will declare its results on the pattern of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).Prasad said that Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal and he had taken part in the meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday on holding the CBSE Class 12 exams. The meeting was attended by education ministers and board secretaries of all states in which Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar and women and child welfare minister Smriti Irani were present.Vaccination before exams, say parents Parents and students gave a mixed response to the state board’s decision. Many want the inoculation drive to be done before the children take the exams.“We want the board to conduct the Class 12 exams only once the situation improves and children are vaccinated. Why did the board not conduct exams with a curtailed format in March when the situation was better?” said Krishan Kumar, a parent from Bhiwani.To this, Prasad said that most of the students are aged below 18 years and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not included this age group for vaccination yet.“We need to check with the government if vaccines can be given to students below 18 years. As of now, we have not taken any decision of vaccinating students and teachers before the exams,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-hold-class-12-exams-in-core-subjects-curtailed-format-101621839606593.html

Those above 60 years of age can also walk in at these centres to receive Covishield vaccine but those seeking the second dose will need to have completed 84 days after the first dose to be eligible. Corporation officials added that between Thursday and Saturday, vaccination will only be done on appointment basis, and on Sunday, it will remain suspended.The special drive will also provide the second dose of Covaxin to all age groups. BMC officials said the number of centres and timing will differ during the three day special drive to vaccinate people in the 45 years+ age group.The corporation had suspended walk-in vaccination about two weeks ago citing overcrowding at vaccination centres. The BMC last week resumed walk-in vaccination for those above 60 years. Vaccination for 18-44 years age group remains suspended in civic and government run vaccination centres.As per BMC data, there are 1.1 million senior citizens in the city, out of which, 882,000 have been administered the first dose. The civic body is now focusing on covering the remaining 300,000 senior citizens.On Sunday, Mumbai reported 1,427 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 49 related fatalities, raising the overall count of infections to 696,910 and the toll to 14,565.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers to protest in Hisar today, admin steps up security||Farmers in Haryana’s Hisar will on Monday protest registration of First Information Report (FIR) against more than 300 farmers for clashing with the police earlier this month. The protest comes at a time when the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) -- an umbrella body of more than 40 farm organisations leading protests against the three contentious central agricultural laws -- has given a call to intensify the movement from May 26, when it completes six months.In view of Monday's protest, the district administration has stepped up security in Hisar, especially fortifying the police commissionerate which, the farmers, declared, they would “gherao” to protest against the police’s decision to book 350 unidentified farmers for the May 16 clash, as well as to demand action against the police personnel who allegedly lathi-charged them.Also Read | 350 farmers booked for Hisar incidentViolence broke out on May 16 after a section of farmers, protesting against the farm laws, tried to march towards a venue where Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was to inaugurate a Covid-19 hospital. The police, which was accused of “high-handedness” as it lobbed tear gas shells and used force to disperse the agitators, in turn accused the protesters of pelting stones at police personnel.While Khattar was able to inaugurate the hospital, the farmers, angered by police action, blocked several key highways in Haryana, and also gheraoed the residence of Hisar’s Inspector General of Police (IGP) against the arrest of some protesting farmers. They dispersed after those arrested were released.Also Read | Protest over Khattar’s visit: Farmers block major highways after clashing with cops in HisarHaryana, and its neighbouring state of Punjab, have emerged as the epicentre of the ongoing protests against the three farm laws.

The legislations were passed in September last year, triggering a face-off between the farmers and the central government. 11 rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock; the two sides last sat across the table on January 22.Also Read | Khattar meets Amit Shah to update him on Hisar clashRecently, the SKM wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a resumption of the dialogue.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-to-protest-in-hisar-today-admin-steps-up-security-101621820616057.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt sanctions ₹5k aid for over 150k taxi, autorickshaw drivers||The Delhi government has sanctioned one-time financial assistance of ₹5,000 to over 150,000 drivers of auto-rickshaws, taxis, e-rickshaws and other such modes of public transport, as a relief measure in the light of the Covid-19 lockdown, state transport minister Kailash Gahlot tweeted on Sunday.“...Under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s guidance, the transport department has sanctioned financial assistance of ₹5,000 per month for 155,301 drivers and owners of para-transit vehicles. The amount will be credited to their bank accounts from Monday,” Gahlot tweeted.The beneficiary drivers received similar aid during the nation-wide lockdown last year and didn’t have to apply for assistance this year. A senior Delhi government official said more drivers are being registered, and several others are likely to be paid in the coming days.On May 14, the Delhi cabinet approved ₹5,000 assistance to drivers of para-transit vehicles and Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badge and permit holders, in view of the limited economic activity during the lockdown and the consequent financial hardships they may face.Among the beneficiaries, an official said, are drivers of auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, taxis, ‘Phat Phat Sewa’, eco-friendly Sewa, ‘Gramin Sewa’ and drivers of maxi cabs with Public Service badges.Delhi has over 280,000 lakh PSV badge holders and 190,000 permit holders eligible for aid, the government said.Chief minister announced a similar programme on April 2 last year.However, the Delhi high court pulled up the state government on May 30, 2020, and ordered it to disburse the promised amount at the earliest, while hearing a plea by an NGO that cited complaints by several para-transit vehicle drivers who said they hadn’t got any financial assistance.Records showed that the state government eventually disbursed ₹78 crore as financial assistance for over 156,000 auto and taxi drivers in 2020..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sanctions-5k-aid-for-over-150k-taxi-autorickshaw-drivers-101621813792444.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds fewer than 2,000 Covid-19 cases since end-March, positivity rate below 2.5%||The national capital on Sunday added fewer than 2,000 new coronavirus disease cases for the first time since end-March, while the test positivity dropped below the 3% mark, as Delhi continued to make its way out of a brutal tsunami of infections that battered the city for a month.With 1,649 infections recorded in the state government’s daily health bulletin on Sunday, daily cases were at their lowest since the city logged 992 cases on March 30, around the time Delhi’s fourth wave of Covid-19 began to expand its footprint.Consequently, the seven-day average of cases, known as case trajectory, continued to fall in the city, with Delhi recording an average of 3,286 new infections each day over the past week, down to less than one-third from the previous week. In the week ending May 16, Delhi logged an average of 10,043 new cases a day. The week before that, the city saw an average of 18,374 cases every day.Sunday’s case trajectory was also the lowest in the Capital since the week ending April 5, when Delhi added 2,906 new infections to its tally per day.At its peak of the April-May surge, Delhi added 28,395 cases of the infection in a single day on April 20 — the most ever in the city since the pandemic broke out in March last year.Promisingly, the Covid-19 test positivity rate — the proportion of tested samples that return positive for Covid-19 – fell to 2.4% on Sunday, the lowest since March 28, and down from 3.58% the previous day. Delhi’s positivity rate, regarded as a crucial metric to understand the spread of an infection, has now dropped for 17 days consecutively and has stayed below 5% for three straight days. Experts across the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), consider an infection to be under control in a region if the test positivity rate stays below 5% for at least two weeks.The number of deaths of the infection as per the health bulletin, however, went up slightly from the previous day. On Sunday, 189 people died of Covid-19, as against 182 people a day before. Covid-19 fatalities in Delhi have not dropped as precipitously as infections, though it must be noted that any drop in cases takes at least two weeks to have an impact on the number of consequent deaths.Sunday’s death toll was lower than the number of fatalities a week ago, when Delhi saw 262 deaths of the infection. However, more people died of the infection on Sunday than during the peak of the Covid-19 surge on November 18, when 131 people died — the most in a single day at that time.To be sure, the seven-day average of deaths has dropped for six days straight, from 300 on May 18 to 242 on Sunday, and any drop in case trajectory generally takes 14 days to reflect on daily deaths as studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.Meanwhile, the number of active cases also continued to fall as new infections eased, giving health care infrastructure, medical workers and funeral infrastructure a crucial breather. The fall in active cases, which dropped below the 30,000 mark on Sunday for the first time in 43 days, has allowed the state government to renew its focus on contact tracing, and revive the Capital’s home isolation system.As on Sunday, 27,610 people in the Capital were battling Covid-19, less than half of the 62,783 active cases just a week ago.Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday, while announcing a week-long extension of the lockdown, said curbs in the city will be lifted in phases from May 31 if cases continue to decline.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said the state government’s preparedness to deal with Covid-19 cases after curbs are lifted is crucial.“It is important to ask if our health systems are ready to take on a rise in cases after the curbs are lifted,” he said. “Do we have more hospital beds, more remdesivir, more antifungal medicines, and enough oxygen? This is what we need to ensure.”He added that three steps are vital to stem the rise of further surges: Awareness of appropriate behaviour and available health infrastructure and treatments among citizens, contact tracing, and proper screening of passengers who arrive in the city from other states or countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-fewer-than-2-000-cases-for-the-first-since-end-march-positivity-rate-below-25-101621813157876.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Vaccinate students, teachers, before conducting CBSE class 12 exams: Sisodia||Conducting the CBSE Class 12 board exams without vaccinating students and teachers may prove to be a big mistake, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday at a high-level meeting called by the Union education ministry to discuss the fate of the pending board and entrance exams, which were postponed in view of the ongoing second Covid-19 wave across the country.The virtual meeting was chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, minister of women and child development Smriti Irani, and information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar. State education ministers and secretaries, CBSE officials, and chairpersons of state examination boards were also present during the meeting.Though the meeting remained inconclusive, officials in attendance said that there was a “broad consensus” that the exams must be held, for a limited number of subjects and with a shorter duration, when the situation is under control.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said the state government was not in favour of conducting exams in the current scenario.“Families across the nation have suffered immense pain and trauma due to Covid-19. It’s time for the Union government to take a decision with respect to board exams, considering it has caused enough tension among our student and teacher community,” Sisodia said in a statement.“Conducting board exams in these unprecedented times will be a big mistake on behalf of the central government. Administering board exams when the world is preparing for the third Covid-19 wave is irresponsible, and at a time when there 2.5 lakh Covid-19 cases a day in our country, our students, parents, and teachers will not be in a good mental state to sit for any kind of exams,” he added.Sisodia said students of Class 12 should be evaluated using alternative methods such as those CBSE used for Class 10 students this year after their exams were cancelled last month.“The central government should cancel the board exams if vaccinations are not possible, and initiate the ‘no-exam policy’ for students, awarding grades on the basis of their (students’) unit tests, pre-board exams, practical exams, similar to the Class 10 promotion policy. Students should also be given a choice to retake exams to improve, in case they are not satisfied with their results,” he said.Sisodia said the Delhi government demanded that both students and teachers must be vaccinated before conducting examinations. “In such a time of crisis, the central government should speak to Pfizer, as it has already developed vaccines for children aged above 12, and acquire these vaccines for the 1.4 crore students (across all boards, all over India) who are in Class 12. Only after procuring vaccines and vaccinating all students should the central government think about conducting any kind of examinations,” the Delhi education minister said.He said 95% of the students in Class 12th are above the age of 17.5, and suggested the Centre consult health experts whether the vaccine given to those above 18 can be given to students of Class 12 as well. “If the vaccine can be given to 17.5-years-olds on the advice of health experts, then the indigenously made Covishield and Covaxin should be given to all Class 12 students on priority,” he said.“Once the vaccine is available, all state governments should ensure that all Class 12 students and school teachers are vaccinated within a week. In Delhi, we can vaccinate these two groups within two days,” Sisodia said.The Centre has asked state governments to send their suggestions on the cancellation/conduct of board and competitive exams by Tuesday. “As envisioned by the Hon’ble PM, the meeting was extremely fruitful as we received immensely valuable suggestions. I have requested the State Governments to send me their detailed suggestions by 25th May,” Nishank tweeted after the meeting.Emphasising that both students’ and teachers’ safety, security, and future are “supremely important to us”, Nishank, in another tweet, said: “I’m confident we will be able to arrive at an informed, collaborative decision regarding the Class 12th board exams and remove the uncertainty among student’s and parent’s minds by informing them of our final decision at the earliest.”The Union government has proposed that the states conduct Class 12 exams only for major subjects, according to the proposal document seen by HT. Nearly 20 of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. Board students take a minimum of five and a maximum of six subjects, of which four are considered major subjects.According to the proposal documents, examinations for the major subjects can be conducted in two ways. In the first option, the examination for major subjects may be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format” like previous years and for the minor subjects “marks can be calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects.”Conducting exams in this mode is possible only if the board has three months, which will include “one month of pre-exam activities and two months for the conduct of exams and declaration of results and another 45 days for compartment exams”, according to the document.The second option involves multiple changes, including conducting exams at schools where the students are enrolled, reducing the duration of examination from three hours to 90 minutes, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer-type questions. The process, as per the second proposal, can be completed in 45 days and results can be declared within 15 days of exams ending.The second proposal also said the examination may be conducted twice depending on the state of the pandemic in parts of the country. “The Class 12 examinations could be conducted two times by the Board. Wherever the conditions are conducive, examinations could commence from a suitable date. In the remaining locations, the examinations will start after a fortnight of the first phase,” the document said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccinate-students-teachers-before-conducting-cbse-class-12-exams-sisodia-101621812242135.html
24-05-2021||Lucknow||Family of five murdered over property dispute||A couple and their three minor children were allegedly hacked to death over a property dispute at a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya late on Saturday night, police said on Sunday.The couple’s nephew has been arrested in connection with the murder, along with his parents and wife, they said.The incident took place at Baria Nisaru village under Inayatnagar police station limits after midnight on Saturday.According to preliminary investigation, the victims were attacked with a heavy and blunt object while they were sleeping, Ayodhya senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Pandey said. The bodies have been sent for post mortem examinations, he said.The victims were identified as Rakesh Kumar, 35, his wife Jyoti, 30, and their three children — two sons and a daughter, aged 2, 5 and 8 years, respectively.Rakesh’s nephew, Pawan Kumar, who had been living with the family for a few years, went missing soon after the incident, Pandey said. Locals in the area alleged that Pawan was demanding a share in Rakesh’s property, he said.The police were able to nab Pawan’s parents and wife on Sunday morning, who confessed to being involved in the crime, the official said, without giving details. The three also lived in Rakesh’s house. Later in the day, Pawan was arrested, Pandey said. It is suspected that some others might also be involved in the murders, the SSP said, adding that a forensic team has collected samples from the scene of the crime.The four accused have been booked under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), he said. Further investigation was underway, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/family-of-five-murdered-over-property-dispute-101621810540807.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Lockdown extended, to be eased in phases||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday extended the month-long lockdown in the Capital by another week, but said that the government will consider a phased withdrawal of restrictions from May 31 if the daily cases of the coronavirus disease continue to decline.Taking a cautionary stand, the chief minister said that the larger public opinion supported the extension of the lockdown for another week – till 5am on May 31.“In the last 24 hours, we asked several sections of people what to do and the larger opinion is that the lockdown should be extended by another week. If we open everything now, there is a risk that we may lose all gains on the Covid-19 front we have made over the last one month,” Kejriwal said at a virtual press briefing.“However, if the curve (of Covid-19 cases) continues to decline like this for a week, we will start a phased un-lockdown process from May 31. We cannot open everything at one go. There is immense risk in it. So the relaxations have to be implemented in a phased way. I hope people will cooperate in this,” he added.There is no word yet on the relaxations that may be announced by the government. Under the existing lockdown, general movement of people and economic activities are prohibited, with exemptions only for those engaged in essential services. Metro services, too, have been suspended for the last two weeks and will remain closed for now.On April 19, the weekend curfew in Delhi was turned into a full lockdown for six days.This is the fifth extension of the lockdown that was necessitated by the fourth and the deadliest wave of infections in the city; at the time, Delhi was adding an average of 20,065cases per day with every one in fiveperson tested being diagnosed as Covid-positive.This runaway spread of the outbreak unraveled the city’s public health infrastructure, particularly from April 22 to the first week of May, when hospitals faced an acute shortage of oxygen and other drugs as patients and their families scrambled to find hospital beds.Since then, the city has scaled up medical facilities and services while the transmission of the outbreak has slowed down -- a trend experts attributed to the effect of the lockdown, adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and a natural ebbing of the wave that is likely to have infected those vulnerable.Delhi has added an average of 3,286 new cases daily in the last seven days. On Sunday, the Capital city recorded 1,649 new cases, its lowest single-day tally since March 30 and 189 deaths, according to the government’s health bulletin.The positivity rate, which soared to a peak of 36% on April 22, dipped to 2.42% on Sunday. Epidemiologists say a positivity rate – the proportion of samples testing positive for the viral illness – below 5% indicates that the outbreak is under control.Health experts said the government’s move to wait for another week before taking a call on lifting restrictions to allow some resumption of economic activities appeared to be well thought-out.“The city cannot remain under a complete lockdown forever. That is understandable. Before relaxing the lockdown, Delhi should ideally have a positivity rate of less than 5% for at least one week. Cases are declining and they are likely to further decline by May 31. A phased re-opening of important economic activities can be considered at that point. Also, people must remember that they cannot let their guards down like they did before the second wave of the pandemic hit India. For governments, this is also the time to scale up vaccination,” said Dr Puneet Misra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.Traders associations, too, said they welcome the decision to consider lifting curbs. “Relaxing the lockdown at this point and at one go could have led to a surge in cases again. The government, however, should consider giving some compensation to traders whose income has been affected by the lockdown,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders.Several residents said they were in favour of keeping the lockdown for another week as well. Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, a collective of around 1,800 resident welfare associations (RWA) in the city, said: “It was evident that the situation in Delhi would not come sufficiently under control till the end of this month… Now they should focus on increasing vaccine coverage.”Kejriwal on Sunday echoed a similar stand and said that the threat is not over even though Delhi is in a “much better shape”. “In one month, with the cooperation of Delhi’s residents, we are in a much better shape. I will not say that the Covid-19 wave is over but it has significantly come under control. We overcame the shortage of hospital beds and medical oxygen in this phase with the help of people, central government, Supreme Court and the (Delhi) high court,” he said, referring to the clutch of orders given by the courts to ease the public health crisis in recent weeks.The chief minister added that the government’s priority is to vaccinate the city’s population at the earliest to avoid another outbreak. “There is speculation of a (national) third wave. We have to prepare for that aggressively in terms of scaling up hospital beds, ICUs, oxygen, tankers, oxygen storage facilities, etc. But high vaccine coverage can totally reduce the possibility of a third wave. We have had talks with several manufacturers on how vaccine coverage can be increased in Delhi. We are ready to buy vaccines for our entire population, no matter how much it costs,” he said.Delhi is among the states and Union territories that have raised concerns over the supply and procurement of Covid-19 vaccines. Around 250 government-run centres in the city stopped administering the jabs to people in the 18-44 age group this weekend due to a shortage of vaccines. Other states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, have said their situation is similar.The Aam Aadmi Party government has repeatedly said it needs 8 million doses per month to inoculate its adult population of 15 million by August. So far, around 26% of the adult population in the Capital has received at least one dose of the vaccine, latest government records showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-extended-to-be-eased-in-phases-101621810296931.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Sharing meds and pain during pandemic||Last week, Anita Prajapati, a resident of Sixth Avenue, a multi-storey housing society of over 1,100 apartments in Gaur City, Greater Noida West, sent out a request on the society’s WhatApp group, appealing to the residents to donate their unused Covid-19 medicines. A week later, she put up a long list of the medicines she had collected and the message that anyone could pick any medicine – steroids, vitamin supplements, antibiotics—as long as they had a doctor’s prescription. “The idea was to create a medicine bank to tackle medicine shortage in the market and stop wastage,” she said.The Sixth Avenue is part of a network of 30 housing societies that have come together to pool in their unused medicines, with 50 volunteers like Prajapati, known as ‘medicine warriors’ coordinating the effort. “We have placed boxes with the guards in all the societies, where people drop the unused medicines. There is a central database of all the medicines collected,” says Manjul Yadav, a software engineer and co-founder of the initiative called Helping Hands Medicine Bank.Last month, as the Covid cases recorded a sharp spike, most medical shops across Delhi/ NCR ran out of essential Covid medicines, putting many patients in a precarious situation. That prompted many housing societies to form WhatsApp Covid- SOS groups and ‘medicine banks’—where people can donate their unused medicine and those who require them can receive them free of cost.What started with a few RWAs is now fast becoming a movement across the country, with many NGOs, individuals, including doctors, starting unused medicine donation drives. Some of these initiatives are Covid Medicine Recycle, MedsForMore, Mission Medicine, and Resources Saanjh, among others.These community initiatives, experts say, are significant because factors such as fear of exposure to the coronavirus while visiting a hospital or pharmacy, high cost, scarcity, hoarding and irrational use of medicines create barriers to access to medicines.Many of these initiatives are born out of people’s personal experiences.“I lost my uncle to Covid, we had a lot of his unused medicines. There were reports of a shortage of medicines in the market and I thought if Delhiites could donate their unused medicines, we could easily overcome the problem. So on our organization’s social media platforms, I requested people to donate,” says Rahul Verma, founder, Uday Foundation, an NGO.The response, he says, was overwhelming.In three weeks, his organization has received over 1,000 Kg of medicines, both Covid and non-Covid, new and unused. Donors, he points out, includes RWAs, individuals, companies; while many of them, he says, sent them by courier, others personally delivered hundreds of cartons and packets at the organization’s collection centre. “We are sending these medicines to slums, charity hospitals, and rural areas across the country,” says Verma.Omkar Nath Sharma, 84, better known as Medicine Baba, who runs perhaps the city’s first and oldest medicine bank in west Delhi, says Covid has given a new push to the idea of medicine bank. In the last one month, he says, more people have visited his bank than ever before. “I have collected and donated medicines worth ₹12 lakh in one month. Besides, I sent packets to all parts of the country, including villages,” says the octogenarian, who has been going door-to-door across Delhi even during the lockdown with a loudspeaker in hand, asking people to donate unused medicines.He has also placed several collection boxes at temples, gurdwaras and crematoriums. Sharma, who has hired two people to help him run the medicine bank, says, his associates run two more medicine banks in Faridabad and Chandigarh. “A lot of people called to know if I could get them remdesivir injection, but unfortunately, I did not have them.”Jatin Dhingra, who travels to Sharma’s medicine bank all the way from Jahangirpuri to take medicines for his mother cannot appreciate his idea enough. “My father is no more and my mother has diabetes and high blood pressure. Her medicines cost ₹1,500 per month, an amount which I cannot afford,” says Dhingra.According to a 2020 Brookings Institution report titled, ‘Medicines in India: Accessibility, Affordability, and Quality,’ the share of medicines in Out of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE ) was around 51% in 2013-14, which reduced to 43% in 2015-16, but still remained the biggest contributor to the OOPE incurred by households.It was the plight of daily wage earners during the lockdown that prompted Shakeel Qureshi, an exporter, to start a Medicine Bank in Bareilly. The message on its walls says that all medicines are given free to poor people only on the prescription of a doctor. “During lockdown last year, I realised daily wagers had lost all income and could not afford to buy essential medicines. We have qualified pharmacists and are presently catering to 250 people every day, compared to 100 last year,” says Qureshi . “We purchase medicines from distributors and also collect unused medicines as donations. We intend to continue it even after the pandemic.”Not just Qureshi’s medicine bank, the popularity of many of these unused medicine donation initiatives are rising fast.For example, on May 1, Mumbai-based doctor couple, Marcus Ranney and Raina Ranney started MedsForMore, an initiative which connects people who have unused medicines with those who need it in their apartment building. Three weeks on, it has a presence in many cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Ahmadabad, Gurugram, Noida. So far, the initiative being led by teams of local residents across cities has collected over 150 Kg of Covid medicines.“Society has experimented with similar ideas for books, food and, clothing, so why not do the same with medicines and health products. Our mission is to utilise the existing medical resources, both medicines and devices, as efficiently as possible,” says Dr Marcus Ranney, adding that it also has huge environmental benefit as unused medicines will not end up as biomedical waste in dumping grounds, rivers and the water supply.Experts concur. “Medicine bank by RWAs is a great idea that can really help people when there is a shortage of medicines in the market. It can particularly benefit senior citizens who live alone and might find it difficult to go out and buy medicines in the market,” says Dr Arun Kumar Sharma , former professor, community medicine, University College Of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“But RWAs must ensure that collected unused medicines are genuine, are given away to people only on a doctor’s prescription and only in required quantities,” Kumar said.Dr Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health, JNU, New Delhi, says that it is the duty of the healthcare institutions—both private as well as public—to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients during the pandemic.“There are several barriers to accessing medicines during the pandemic. This issue becomes more important as Covid cases in rural India continue to remain high and may rise for some more time,” says Dr Dasgupta. “States should make uninterrupted supply of medicines a mandated and assured service to be provided by both public and private institutions. Covid medicines should be provided free to the poor. Citizens’ initiatives, I feel, can only have a limited impact.”But Omkar Nath Sharma, aka the Medicine Baba, has a different take. “Medicine banks can play a big role in making medicines accessible to the poor during and after the pandemic. My mission is to open a medicine bank in every state,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharing-meds-and-pain-during-pandemic-101621809851395.html

24-05-2021||Delhi||Cops go easy on violators, offer roses to spread awareness on lockdown rules||Instead of prosecuting people for violating the lockdown and issuing challans, the Delhi Police switched to a non-coercive method by offering roses to the violators and sensitizing them about the need to stay indoors on Sunday.While roses were given to all violators across Delhi, in some parts of the city, the police made the violators pledge that they would not violate the lockdown rules and be more involved in creating awareness. At other places, they urged a group of violators to educate another group about the need to stay safe and follow necessary precautions.At some places, the violators were asked to hold placards bearing messages related to the lockdown. Even policemen were spotted with placards in some places.“For a change, a non-coercive mode has been adopted today (Sunday). The emphasis is on educating violators and utilising them too in furthering awareness among the residents. Policemen are encouraged to adopt effective alternative means instead of issuing challans,” Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said in a tweet.According to Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, challans were not issued only for this Sunday. “Since the lockdown is a prolonged one, we decided to focus a day on sensitizing the lockdown violators,” said Biswal.The police denied that the day-long drive was in response to the criticism faced by a Chhatisgarh IAS officer, who was purportedly caught in camera slapping a boy who was allegedly violating the lockdown.However, a police officer said that the change in police’s attitude was also because of the feedback that the police were “harsh” on lockdown violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cops-offer-roses-to-sensitise-violators-about-lockdown-norms-101621808613582.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s revenues hit by curbs, lockdowns||Months of closures due to the two Covid-19 lockdowns and multiple restrictions have left the Delhi Metro’s finances in bad shape, with revenue streams running dry and losses mounting, showed documents seen by HT.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) incurred losses of ₹1,784.87 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal, with operations either curbed or stopped because of Covid-19, documents show.The Delhi Metro was shut for over five months last year during the nationwide lockdown, and has been closed again for the past two weeks, as part of the state government’s measures to arrest the rapid spread of the infection. The lockdown, which came into effect on April 20, initially exempted some groups and allowed them to use the Delhi Metro. But this changed May 10 onwards, as the state tightened restrictions.“There has already been a significant impact on DMRC’s revenues, and as long as the pandemic and associated travel norms are in place, losses are likely to remain or even increase with the passage of time. However, as a public service system, we are also committed to the cause of stopping the spread of the disease and will always extend all possible cooperation in this regard,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communication), DMRC.Senior Metro officials said even though operations resumed after five-and-a-half months of complete shutdown — from March 22 to September 7 — last year, services were restricted to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. After the Metro restarted, the passenger capacity of each coach was reduced from 300-350 to just 50. To ensure that the trains are sanitised after each trip, the waiting time on each route also increased from an average of three to six minutes earlier to 15 minutes.Revenue records show that in the 2020-2021 fiscal, DMRC’s revenue from traffic operations, which includes income from tickets, feeder bus services and rentals, and other services, fell sharply to ₹895.88 crore, from ₹3,897.29 crore in 2019-2020. Similarly, in 2018-19, their income from operational and non-operational sources was ₹3,582.80 crore.The Metro body’s books also show that in 2020-21, the agency ran into deficits of ₹1,784.87 crore, as against a surplus of ₹758.01 crore in 2019-20. In 2018-19, DMRC recorded a surplus of ₹1,027 crore.Apart from these pandemic-induced losses, the Delhi Metro has also been repaying ₹808.70 crore of loans and ₹433.85 as interest to the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which helped the Metro fund expansion projects. Officials said the DMRC is in talks with the central government to find ways to ensure payments towards this loan does not suffer.Senior Metro officials said the transport body’s incomes have not been near pre-pandemic levels for nearly 14 months. “Prior to the lockdown in March last year, nearly ₹10 crore used to be the average revenue per day both from ticketing and non-ticketing avenues. The Delhi Metro was operational from September last year till early May this year. However, even during this period, pre-pandemic levels of revenues could not be generated because of the protocols in place to restrict the spread of the disease,” Dayal said.When the Metro resumed operations in September last year, the number of passenger journeys went down to 619,242, as opposed to 5,452,367 in the same period in 2019. By March this year, the number of passenger journeys finally started picking up and reached 2,680,358, but this was still nearly half of the 4,392,823 journeys the Delhi Metro made in March 2019.Metro officials said while letters were written early this year to the central and Delhi governments asking for financial assistance, the revenue collected by operations are pumped back into the system for operations and maintenance of the system and of fixed assets such as office buildings, stations etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-revenues-hit-by-curbs-lockdowns-101621808013955.html
24-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan may move Supreme Court for uniform vaccine policy||The Rajasthan government is planning to approach the Supreme Court to ask for a new policy that ensures uniform distribution and pricing of Covid-19 vaccines, said a senior official familiar with the development. It will be the second state to do so after West Bengal, which had on May 7 moved the apex court for the exact same reason and demanded that the states be given the vaccines free of cost.Rajasthan’s vaccination programme has been slowed down by a shortage of jabs. So far, only 1.26 crore of its total population of 8 crore has been administered the first dose, and just 31.2 lakh have received the second. Of those vaccinated fully, 16.34 lakh are over the age of 60 and 7.48 lakh are in the 45-59 age-group.The state government is also spending ₹3,000 crore to inoculate people in the age group of 18-44 years. For this, it has ordered 3.75 crore vaccine shots from the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has been struggling to meet the huge demands raised by all states. So far, over 12.59 lakh people in this age-group have been vaccinated.The state has also floated a global tender to procure 1 crore doses but says that this should have been done by the Centre. “The state can bear the expenditure, but the tender should be floated by the government of India. The Centre can negotiate for a uniform rate, and check the credentials and credibility of the vendors,” said the aforementioned official on the condition of anonymity, adding that so far six to eight vendors have participated in the tender and some of them have been asked to provide more additional documents.The differential pricing, the official said, will result in competition among states, as the vendors participating in the global tender are quoting more than twice the price of vaccine — ₹300 per dose plus GST.Vaccine manufacturers SII and Bharat Biotech have been charging ₹150 per dose from the Centre, and ₹300-400 per dose from the states. The price should be capped at a uniform rate of ₹150, the official said.Centre’s announcement of differential pricing for vaccines was opposed by many states, and had led the Supreme Court to observe, in a suo motu case, that the policy was violative of a citizen’s constitutional rights and the Centre should revisit it. The Centre had asked the court not to interfere with an executive decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-may-move-supreme-court-for-uniform-vaccine-policy-101621803494845.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Moderna refuses to sell vaccines directly to Punjab||US pharmaceutical company Moderna has refused to supply its Covid vaccine directly to Punjab, saying that its policy allows it to entertain such requests only from the government of India, a senior state official said on Sunday.The development came after the Amarinder Singh government reached out to several manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Gamaleya (maker of Sputnik-V), for direct purchase, said state nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg.The state government said last week that it has storage space for 3.5 million Sputnik-V vaccines, which requires temperature of -18 degrees Celsius. But so far, only Moderna has replied to the request, Garg said. The company’s vaccine has so far inoculated over 90 million people. Moderna could not be reached for comments.Earlier, the Punjab government approached Covax, the global vaccine sharing programme, but was told that it would not directly deal with the state, Garg said.The Punjab government has said that it has so far received 4.4 million vaccine doses from the Centre, and the first dose has been administered to 3.66 million people while 730,000 have received the second shot. But due to the non-availability of jabs, the state has had to stop phases 1 (above 60 years) and 2 (above 45 years) of its vaccination programme in the last three days.“We are seeking more vaccines from the Centre. They will also advise how to deal with such manufacturers who directly deal with the Centre,” said Garg.Punjab had a tepid response to the programme as not many people turned up for vaccination in the early days. But the brutality of the second wave triggered panic, leading to rush at vaccination centres, especially in rural areas. Punjab registered nearly 5,300 fresh Covid cases and 201 deaths on Saturday, taking the death toll in the state to over 13,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moderna-refuses-to-sell-vaccines-directly-to-punjab-101621801199674.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s cotton crop area claim last season holds no water||As cotton sowing is in full swing in Punjab, questions have been raised on the state agriculture department’s previous claim that in 2020 more than one-lakh hectare area was diversified into cotton from water-guzzling paddy.Sources admit that the official claim that last year’s area under cotton was enhanced from 3.9 lakh hectares in 2019 to 5.01 lakh hectares across the semi-arid region of southern Punjab does not hold water.Officials said it is surprising that no clarification has been issued by the agriculture department, the portfolio held by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on an overstretched claim of record cultivation of cotton last year.“It appeared to be a case of an exaggeration to claim drastic success in crop diversification. Cotton production data belies any such claim,” says an official privy to the cotton production. Agriculture director Dr Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said last season, only 2.51 lakh hectare was covered under cotton.“I cannot comment about the statements made before my joining the office in February this year. But as per official record, for this year, we have set the target to bring 3.25 lakh hectares under crop, an increase of 20% area than 2020. As per the weekly report till May 17, sowing was completed on a 1.80-lakh hectare area. It will be over in another one week,” he said.In the 2020-21 season, an estimated 45-50 lakh quintal cotton was purchased by Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and private players.Agriculture experts say one hectare produces an average of 20 quintals of raw cotton and Punjab should have produced close to one-crore quintals if the cash crop was actually sown on 5 lakh hectares.“Last season was good, and the cotton-growing area did not witness any major pest attack. An average farmer produced between 8-12 quintals from one acre is on par with the past trend of a good yield. No protest by farmer unions, who are most active in Malwa districts, is an indicator that overall yield was good,” say sources in agriculture and cotton industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-cotton-crop-area-claim-last-season-holds-no-water-101621801024850.html

While 17,327 candidates registered themselves for the exam, 1,619 didn’t appear. The candidates were allowed to enter the examination centre after producing a negative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) report. As many as 67 covid positive candidates also took the test from isolation wards of medical colleges and civil hospitals. Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor, BFUHS inspected three examination centres in Mohali. He said social distancing norms were strictly followed during the examination process. “It was very important process due to Covid-19 outbreak, but we were able to conduct examination successfully,” he said.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||‘Ardas’ row: BJP leaders’ support to ‘pathi’ enrages Sikh bodies||Various Sikh bodies are enraged over some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders’ support to the ‘pathi’ arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments by doing ardas at Bathinda’s Bir Talab village gurdwara for controversial Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim, saying that “this is deep-rooted conspiracy to vitiate atmosphere in the state”. The ‘pathi’ was booked under section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.Members of some Sikh bodies discussed the issue at a gurdwara in Sangrur on Saturday. Prominent BJP leaders who opposed the action against the ‘pathi’ were Vijay Sampla and Rajesh Bagha. Being chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Sampla also sought a report from the Bathinda police. During his visit to Amritsar on Friday, Sampla had said he found no ground for charging the ‘pathi’ with Section 295-A, adding that police acted against him because he was Dalit and prayed for ‘Dalit chief minister in Punjab’.Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “This ardas was against Sikh maryada as it was performed for a person who is guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and against whom hukamnama was issued by Takht Sahib for committing blasphemy. Anyone supporting this kind of ardas is wrong”.“Days after Punjab Police arrested six Dera followers in the sacrilege case, this so-called ardas was organised in which release of the dera chief was also desired. Entire Sikh Panth is enraged over this act, but BJP leaders support it. Why? A Dalit was chosen for this act so that Sikhs are divided over caste lines ahead of the 2022 elections,” Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member Sukhdev Singh Bhaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ardas-row-bjp-leaders-support-to-pathi-enrages-sikh-bodies-101621800604927.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid situation improving in J&K: L-G Manoj Sinha||Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday said the Covid situation was improving with “63% of the targeted population” getting vaccinated.In a video message, he sought active participation from various stakeholders to complement government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic.A government spokesman said that Sinha urged the elected PRI representatives, teachers, ASHAs, anganwadi and ANM workers besides voluntary organisations to play an active role in the effective implementation of Covid preventive measures in rural areas.The administration has initiated the setting up of five-bed Covid centres in every panchayat.“Situation is improving gradually. We are intensifying the vaccination drive across the UT,” Sinha said. The L-G said that testing and vaccination was the mantra to fight the pandemic. “I request all of you to participate actively in both testing and vaccination campaigns so that the spread of the deadly virus can be effectively contained,” he added. He also urged the public to follow the Covid protocols in letter and spirit and get themselves vaccinated.“With collaborative efforts, I do believe we shall overcome this health crisis and take Jammu & Kashmir to the new height of progress and prosperity,” the Lt-Governor said.51 die of contagion in J&KAs many as 51 people lost their lives to Covid on Sunday in Jammu and Kashmir, taking May’s fatalities to 1,282 and overall death toll to 3,564.The region also recorded 3,308 fresh infections in the past 24 hours taking the overall cases to 2,70,621.

24-05-2021||Other||Vaccinate students, teachers, before conducting CBSE class 12 exams: Sisodia to Centre||New Delhi: Conducting the CBSE Class 12 board exams without vaccinating students and teachers may prove to be a big mistake, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday at a high-level meeting called by the Union education ministry to discuss the fate of the pending board and entrance exams, which were postponed in view of the ongoing second Covid-19 wave across the country. The virtual meeting was chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, minister of women and child development Smriti Irani, and information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar. State education ministers and secretaries, CBSE officials, and chairpersons of state examination boards were also present during the meeting. Though the meeting remained inconclusive, officials in attendance said that there was a “broad consensus” that the exams must be held, for a limited number of subjects and with a shorter duration, when the situation is under control. Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said the state government was not in favour of conducting exams in the current scenario. “Families across the nation have suffered immense pain and trauma due to Covid-19. It’s time for the Union government to take a decision with respect to board exams, considering it has caused enough tension among our student and teacher community,” Sisodia said in a statement. “Conducting board exams in these unprecedented times will be a big mistake on behalf of the central government. Administering board exams when the world is preparing for the third Covid-19 wave is irresponsible, and at a time when there 2.5 lakh Covid-19 cases a day in our country, our students, parents, and teachers will not be in a good mental state to sit for any kind of exams,” he added. Sisodia said students of Class 12 should be evaluated using alternative methods such as those CBSE used for Class 10 students this year after their exams were cancelled last month. “The central government should cancel the board exams if vaccinations are not possible, and initiate the ‘no-exam policy’ for students, awarding grades on the basis of their (students’) unit tests, pre-board exams, practical exams, similar to the Class 10 promotion policy. Students should also be given a choice to retake exams to improve, in case they are not satisfied with their results,” he said. Sisodia said the Delhi government demanded that both students and teachers must be vaccinated before conducting examinations. “In such a time of crisis, the central government should speak to Pfizer, as it has already developed vaccines for children aged above 12, and acquire these vaccines for the 1.4 crore students (across all boards, all over India) who are in Class 12. Only after procuring vaccines and vaccinating all students should the central government think about conducting any kind of examinations,” the Delhi education minister said. He said 95% of the students in Class 12th are above the age of 17.5, and suggested the Centre consult health experts whether the vaccine given to those above 18 can be given to students of Class 12 as well. “If the vaccine can be given to 17.5-years-olds on the advice of health experts, then the indigenously made Covishield and Covaxin should be given to all Class 12 students on priority,” he said. “Once the vaccine is available, all state governments should ensure that all Class 12 students and school teachers are vaccinated within a week. In Delhi, we can vaccinate these two groups within two days,” Sisodia said. The Centre has asked state governments to send their suggestions on the cancellation/conduct of board and competitive exams by Tuesday. “As envisioned by the Hon’ble PM, the meeting was extremely fruitful as we received immensely valuable suggestions. I have requested the State Governments to send me their detailed suggestions by 25th May,” Nishank tweeted after the meeting. Emphasising that both students’ and teachers’ safety, security, and future are “supremely important to us”, Nishank, in another tweet, said: “I’m confident we will be able to arrive at an informed, collaborative decision regarding the Class 12th board exams and remove the uncertainty among student’s and parent’s minds by informing them of our final decision at the earliest.” The Union government has proposed that the states conduct Class 12 exams only for major subjects, according to the proposal document seen by HT. Nearly 20 of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. Board students take a minimum of five and a maximum of six subjects, of which four are considered major subjects. According to the proposal documents, examinations for the major subjects can be conducted in two ways. In the first option, the examination for major subjects may be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format” like previous years and for the minor subjects “marks can be calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects.” Conducting exams in this mode is possible only if the board has three months, which will include “one month of pre-exam activities and two months for the conduct of exams and declaration of results and another 45 days for compartment exams”, according to the document. The second option involves multiple changes, including conducting exams at schools where the students are enrolled, reducing the duration of examination from three hours to 90 minutes, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer-type questions. The process, as per the second proposal, can be completed in 45 days and results can be declared within 15 days of exams ending. The second proposal also said the examination may be conducted twice depending on the state of the pandemic in parts of the country. “The Class 12 examinations could be conducted two times by the Board. Wherever the conditions are conducive, examinations could commence from a suitable date. In the remaining locations, the examinations will start after a fortnight of the first phase,” the document said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccinate-students-teachers-before-conducting-cbse-class-12-exams-sisodia-to-centre-101621800184020.html
24-05-2021||Other||Parents, students in Delhi against CBSE exams amid Covid-19 spike||New Delhi: With the Centre once again not able to decide on the pending Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 exams during a high-level meeting on Sunday, students, parents, principals, and education experts expressed concerns over the delays, with many of them now demanding that the exams be cancelled entirely. On Sunday, while the high-level meeting, chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh remained inconclusive, officials said the majority of states were in favour of conducting exams, regardless of the format. Anand Saxena (17), a Class 12 student at a private school in south Delhi said, “While we are still struggling with the second wave of the pandemic and the possibility of a third wave, how is it even possible to conduct exams in such a situation? Who can take the guarantee that the situation will be better by July and August? We have been in Class 12 for the last 15 months. The government should cancel the exams and promote students using alternative methods of evaluation.” Parents, too, said they weren’t in favour of letting students travel for exams till cases subsided completely. Sweta Singh, the mother of a Class 12 student at a Mayur Vihar private school, said, “The government itself is conducting online meetings, but expects our 16-17-year-old children to appear in exams in person. We are not in favour of sending our children for exams till the number of cases comes to zero in the city.” Several principals said the government should act promptly to stop the anxiety children have been facing for 15 months. Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, said, “We can’t leave students in the lurch. A clear decision needs to be taken, since children are going through a lot of mental stress... We need to come up with alternative criteria, since the pandemic continues to prevail. Students went through a lot of anxiety last year and the same is happening this year as well. We can also explore the possibility of delinking board exams from college entrance tests.” AK Jha, principal of the government co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini, said conducting exams amid the ongoing surge may be extremely risky. “If the government conducts exams by August-September, cases may rise once again. Students who are sick with mild symptoms might conceal their illness and appear for the exams due to the fear of missing out on a year. Students can also carry home the virus and endanger their family members,” he said. Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the government should think about doing away from the tradition of assessing the progress of students on the basis of “exams”. “It takes a lot of courage to be safe. And educational leaders need to demonstrate this courage and move away from tradition. There are several ways to promote students, and they need to work towards that, rather than tinker with the exam as a filter,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parents-students-in-delhi-against-cbse-exams-amid-covid-19-spike-101621800124024.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Agricultural laws: Farmers’ convoy leaves Karnal to join Tikri border protest||Defying the coronavirus lockdown, thousands of farmers gathered at the Karnal and Panipat toll plazas on Sunday morning and left for Tikri on the state’s border with New Delhi, the site where farmers have been protesting against the Centre’s three agricultural laws since last November. On the call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers’ unions, farmers will hold protests in New Delhi on May 26, to mark six months of the agitation. Those supporting the agitation have been asked to hoist black flags on their houses and vehicles the day to register their protest.Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Charuni led the convey comprising SUVs, cars and bikes from Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza. “Around 2,000 vehicles will leave for the protest site from different districts every week in order to maintain the gathering there,” he said. Farmers from Karnal will lead the agitation from May 23 to May 30.“This movement of farmers will not only strengthen the agitation but will also send a message to those who predicted that the agitation is likely to fizzle out because of decline in the number of farmers on the Delhi borders,” said a farmer leader, pleading anonymity.With harvesting of wheat over and transplantation of paddy to start from June 15, farmers’ unions from Haryana have reached out to farmers and villagers asking them to ensure a sizeable gathering at the Delhi borders. Charuni also slammed the lathicharge on farmers. “ Farmers were beaten up and FIRs were registered against them but why were the cops not booked for assault and damaging our vehicles,” he said. . He also refuted reports of two farmers dying due to Covid at Singhu border.Despite restrictions on gatherings amid the pandemic, farmers, many of whom were not wearing masks, gathered at the toll plaza in the presence of police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/agricultural-laws-farmers-convoy-leaves-karnal-to-join-tikri-border-protest-101621800066105.html
24-05-2021||Other||Two constables among five who planned to rob businessman: Delhi Police||The robbery of a businessman, who was on the verge of losing ₹2 lakh while on his way home in North Delhi’s Wazirabad on May 12, whichwas thwarted by a policeman, was planned and executed by two other police constables, said Delhi Police on Sunday.According to a police officer who didn’t want to be identified, the robbery bid was made on the night of May 12 when the businessman, who owns a bread shop in Nirankari Colony, was returning home on his car. “As he drove through Hardeep Nagar, a car intercepted his vehicle from the front while a motorcycle and a scooter blocked his path from the side and rear,” said the police officer, adding that in all, there were five robbers. The businessman had ₹2 lakh cash with him at the time of the incident, said police. “Manish,a police constable who was headed to his duty, was passing by when he spotted the two-wheeler riders banging on the windows of the victim’s car,” said the officer. On realising that the suspects were trying to rob the businessman, Manish intervened. “The robbers fled the spot but left a scooter behind,” said the officer. The businessman allegedly refused to file a police complaint since the robbers failed to rob him of the money, but the police decided to go after the culprits. “The scooter was found to be a stolen one. Our probe revealed that a car that was there near the crime spot at the time of the robbery bid was registered in the name of Jatin, a constable serving at the Timarpur police station,” the officer said.Simultaneously, the police apprehended two minors, and a 38-year-old man named Naresh, who was released from jail last year. “Naresh also revealed the role of constable Jatin, as well as another constable Amit, who is posted in Shahdara district,” the officer said.“The three suspects revealed that the two constables were involved in the planning and execution of the crime. They were the ones who knew that the businessman had a lot of money,” the officer said.Jatin was subsequently arrested on Thursday while Amit is still on the run. Police were unable to give any clarity on the extent of their involvement in the crime.On Thursday, police said, they also registered a FIR about the attempted robbery after convincing the businessman to file a complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-constables-among-five-who-planned-to-rob-businessman-delhi-police-101621800064665.html

While roses were given to all violators across Delhi, in some parts of the city, the police made the violators pledge that they would not violate the lockdown rules and be more involved in creating awareness. At other places, they urged a group of violators to educate another group about the need to stay safe and follow necessary precautions.At some places, the violators were asked to hold placards bearing messages related to the lockdown. Even policemen were spotted with placards in some places. “For a change, a non-coercive mode has been adopted today (Sunday). The emphasis is on educating violators and utilising them too in furthering awareness among the residents. Policemen are encouraged to adopt effective alternative means instead of issuing challans,” Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said in a tweet.According to Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, challans were not issued only for this Sunday. “Since the lockdown is a prolonged one, we decided to focus a day on sensitizing the lockdown violators,” said Biswal.The police denied that the day-long drive was in response to the criticism faced by a Chhatisgarh IAS officer, who was purportedly caught in camera slapping a boy who was allegedly violating the lockdown.However, a police officer said that the change in police’s attitude was also because of the feedback that the police were “harsh” on lockdown violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-cops-offer-roses-to-sensitise-violators-about-lockdown-norms-101621800063937.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds fewer than 2,000 cases for the first since end-March, positivity rate below 2.5%||The national capital on Sunday added fewer than 2,000 new coronavirus disease cases for the first time since end-March, while the test positivity dropped below the 3% mark, as Delhi continued to make its way out of a brutal tsunami of infections that battered the city for a month. With 1,649 infections recorded in the state government’s daily health bulletin on Sunday, daily cases were at their lowest since the city logged 992 cases on March 30, around the time Delhi’s fourth wave of Covid-19 began to expand its footprint. Consequently, the seven-day average of cases, known as case trajectory, continued to fall in the city, with Delhi recording an average of 3,286 new infections each day over the past week, down to less than one-third from the previous week. In the week ending May 16, Delhi logged an average of 10,043 new cases a day. The week before that, the city saw an average of 18,374 cases every day. Sunday’s case trajectory was also the lowest in the Capital since the week ending April 5, when Delhi added 2,906 new infections to its tally per day. At its peak of the April-May surge, Delhi added 28,395 cases of the infection in a single day on April 20 — the most ever in the city since the pandemic broke out in March last year. Promisingly, the Covid-19 test positivity rate — the proportion of tested samples that return positive for Covid-19 – fell to 2.4% on Sunday, the lowest since March 28, and down from 3.58% the previous day. Delhi’s positivity rate, regarded as a crucial metric to understand the spread of an infection, has now dropped for 17 days consecutively and has stayed below 5% for three straight days. Experts across the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), consider an infection to be under control in a region if the test positivity rate stays below 5% for at least two weeks. The number of deaths of the infection as per the health bulletin, however, went up slightly from the previous day. On Sunday, 189 people died of Covid-19, as against 182 people a day before. Covid-19 fatalities in Delhi have not dropped as precipitously as infections, though it must be noted that any drop in cases takes at least two weeks to have an impact on the number of consequent deaths. Sunday’s death toll was lower than the number of fatalities a week ago, when Delhi saw 262 deaths of the infection. However, more people died of the infection on Sunday than during the peak of the Covid-19 surge on November 18, when 131 people died — the most in a single day at that time. To be sure, the seven-day average of deaths has dropped for six days straight, from 300 on May 18 to 242 on Sunday, and any drop in case trajectory generally takes 14 days to reflect on daily deaths as studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days. Meanwhile, the number of active cases also continued to fall as new infections eased, giving health care infrastructure, medical workers and funeral infrastructure a crucial breather. The fall in active cases, which dropped below the 30,000 mark on Sunday for the first time in 43 days, has allowed the state government to renew its focus on contact tracing, and revive the Capital’s home isolation system. As on Sunday, 27,610 people in the Capital were battling Covid-19, less than half of the 62,783 active cases just a week ago. Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday, while announcing a week-long extension of the lockdown, said curbs in the city will be lifted in phases from May 31 if cases continue to decline. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said the state government’s preparedness to deal with Covid-19 cases after curbs are lifted is crucial.“It is important to ask if our health systems are ready to take on a rise in cases after the curbs are lifted,” he said. “Do we have more hospital beds, more remdesivir, more antifungal medicines, and enough oxygen? This is what we need to ensure.”He added that three steps are vital to stem the rise of further surges: Awareness of appropriate behaviour and available health infrastructure and treatments among citizens, contact tracing, and proper screening of passengers who arrive in the city from other states or countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-fewer-than-2-000-cases-for-the-first-since-end-march-positivity-rate-below-25-101621800005036.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Despite Capt’s appeal, farmers to go ahead with 3-day protest||Despite chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s appeal, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugarahan) have decided to go ahead with their call of three-day protest from May 28.The farmers will protest against state government for its alleged failure in tackling the Covid crisis and imposing curbs across the state.Farmers claimed that the ill-preparedness of state and central governments has led to spread of Covid. “Both the governments have failed to check Covid spread. People are dying due to lack of ventilators, oxygen and other medical facilities,” said BKU’s general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan.He added that the traders are already feeling the brunt of undue restrictions imposed in the state. “To hide its failures, the government has come up with curfew-like decisions, which has battered the trader class,” he said.The farmers have prepared detailed demand charter in which they demanded government to fill vacant vacancies in the health department, to make adequate arrangements for oxygen and ventilators, to bring private hospitals under its control and to stop forcible vaccination and testing.Rejecting the allegations of the state government’s failure to tackle the Covid pandemic, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged the BKU not to go ahead with their proposed dharna, which he said could turn into a super-spreader of the contagion.The CM said his government had fought hard to prevent Punjab going the way some other states, such as Delhi, Maharashtra and even Uttar Pradesh, where bodies floating in the Ganga.“Any event, such as the proposed three-day dharna of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) in Patiala, had the potential to negate the gains made by his government in tackling Covid in the state,” he said.Amarinder urged the farmers’ group not to act irresponsibly and jeopardise the lives of their own people with such reckless behaviour amid the pandemic, especially when there is a complete ban in the state on all gatherings and any violation of the ban would be highly detrimental to the interests of Punjab and its people.“The group’s action was also completely unwarranted considering the total support the state government had extended all these months to the agitating farmers on the issue of the centre’s black farm laws. It is time for the farmers now to reciprocate by supporting the state government in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.He added that taking note of the gravity of the situation, there was no scope for any laxity in Covid appropriate behaviour, and rallies or dharnas of any kind were totally unacceptable when the lives of the people were at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-capt-s-appeal-farmers-to-go-ahead-with-3-day-protest-101621800004560.html
24-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-induced lockdowns and restrictions sink DMRC into losses||Months of closures due to the two Covid-19 lockdowns and multiple restrictions have left the Delhi Metro’s finances in bad shape, with revenue streams running dry and losses mounting, showed documents seen by HT. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) revenue details show that the agency has incurred losses of ₹1,784.87 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal, with operations either curbed or stopped entirely because of Covid-19. The Delhi Metro was shut for over five months last year during the nationwide lockdown, and has been closed again for the past two weeks, as part of the state government’s measures to arrest the rapid spread of the infection. The lockdown, which came into effect on April 20, initially exempted some groups and allowed them to use the Delhi Metro. But this changed May 10 onwards, as the state government tightened restrictions. “There has already been a significant impact on DMRC’s revenues, and as long as the pandemic and associated travel norms are in place, losses are likely to remain or even increase with the passage of time. However, as a public service system, we are also committed to the cause of stopping the spread of the disease and will always extend all possible cooperation in this regard,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communication), DMRC. Senior Metro officials said even though operations resumed after five-and-a-half months of complete shutdown — from March 22 to September 7 — last year, services were restricted to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. After the Metro restarted, the passenger capacity of each coach was reduced from 300-350 to just 50. To ensure that the trains are sanitised after each trip, the waiting time on each route also increased from an average of three to six minutes earlier to 15 minutes. Revenue records show that in the 2020-2021 fiscal, DMRC’s revenue from traffic operations, which includes income from tickets, feeder bus services and rentals, and other services, fell sharply to ₹895.88 crore, from ₹3,897.29 crore in 2019-2020. Similarly, in 2018-19, their income from operational and non-operational sources was ₹3,582.80 crore. The Metro body’s books also show that in 2020-21, the agency ran into deficits of ₹1,784.87 crore, as against a surplus of ₹758.01 crore in 2019-20. In 2018-19, DMRC recorded a surplus of ₹1,027 crore. Apart from these pandemic-induced losses, the Delhi Metro has also been parallelly repaying ₹808.70 crore of loan and ₹433.85 as interest to the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which helped the Metro body fund their expansion projects. Officials said the DMRC is in talks with the central government to find ways to ensure payments towards this loan does not suffer. Responding to a question about the government’s strategy to mitigate the effect of losses incurred by the DMRC because of the Covid lockdown, in September last year, Union minister of housing and urban affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri in the Lok Sabha said measures to enhance revenue through various innovative means like provisioning feeder systems, property development at stations and on other land, leasing of spaces, transit oriented development and value capture finance are enumerated in the Metro Rail Policy, 2017. Senior Metro officials said the transport body’s incomes have not been near pre-pandemic levels for nearly 14 months. “Prior to the lockdown in March last year, nearly ₹10 crore used to be the average revenue per day both from ticketing and non-ticketing avenues. The Delhi Metro was operational from September last year till early May this year. However, even during this period, pre-pandemic levels of revenues could not be generated because of the protocols in place to restrict the spread of the disease. Then, services were suspended again on May 10,” Dayal said. When the Delhi Metro resumed operations for passengers with Covid restrictions in September last year, the number of passenger journeys went down to 619,242, as opposed to 5,452,367 in the same period in 2019. By March this year, the number of passenger journeys finally started picking up and reached 2,680,358, but this was still nearly half of the 4,392,823 journeys the Delhi Metro made in March 2019. Metro officials said that while letters were written early this year to the central and Delhi governments asking for financial assistance, the revenue collected by operations are pumped back into the system for operations and maintenance of the system and of fixed assets such as office buildings, stations etc. Funds are also used to pay the staff, pay off machinery costs and also operate feeder services for last-mile connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covidinduced-lockdowns-and-restrictions-sink-dmrc-into-losses-101621799943987.html

The government has not allowed malls to open and authorised deputy commissioners to work out the modalities of implementing the relaxations.This is the third extension of the week-long lockdown which was first imposed in Haryana from May 3 in the face of rising infections in the state. It was then extended on May 10, with stricter restrictions such as not allowing more than 11 people in weddings and funerals.In a single page order, Vardhan said the decision to yet again extend the lockdown had been taken “after duly considering the fact that although the Covid positivity rate has come down,” the lockdown, termed mahamari alert-surakshit Haryana, needs to continue with the objective of further bringing down the positivity and the fatality rate.That the lockdown has helped contain the Covid spread becomes apparent as in past 13 days the number of new cases (from 13,548 on May 9) has been declining every day and stood at 5,021 on May 22.Till Saturday, Haryana had vaccinated 52.56 lakh people. The state government said as on Sunday, 1,554 oxygen beds in ICUs, including ventilators, were available in government and private hospitals across the state, while 8,185 oxygen beds were available in both government and private hospitals.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-extends-lockdown-till-may-31-shops-to-open-on-odd-even-basis-101621799644608.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Three more detected with black fungus in Himachal||Even as Covid infections are on a decline for past one month, the rise in black fungus cases has left the health authorities in Himachal Pradesh worried.Three more patients have been diagnosed with mucormycosis in the state.A 41-year-old woman from Solan’s Arki, who lives in Shimla, has been admitted to the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) after complaining of loss of eyesight, said senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj.Initial test reports have confirmed presence of black fungus and culture and biopsy reports are awaited. The patient had recently recovered from Covid. He said ENT specialists removed decayed skin from the patient’s nose through surgical treatment and her condition is stable. Himachal had recorded its first case of mucormycosis on Friday when a 52-year-old woman from Hamirpur was found infected with deadly fungus. She is currently undergoing treatment at IGMC. Her surgical treatment was to be held on Saturday, but couldn’t be done due to her unstable blood pressure and high blood sugar level.Meanwhile, two cases of black fungus have been reported at Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Tanda.Kangra chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Gurdarshan Gupta said a 40-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman were diagnosed with mucormycosis as well.They had Covid and their samples tested after symptoms of black fungus infection emerged turned out positive.Dr Gupta said the patients are being treated as per the protocol.Mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus, is caused by a mould found in soil and in decaying organic matter like rotting leaves. People get mucormycosis, of which there are several types, by breathing in the fungal spores.Intense headache, pain in the sinus area and the right eye, blurred vision and swollen cheeks are some of the symptoms. The disease progresses rapidly and attacks blood vessels and live tissues turning them black — hence the name ‘black fungus. The infection needs to be caught early or it may turn deadly. Once spread to brain, the mortality rate is 50%.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Booking a vaccination slot a Herculean task for 18+ in Himachal||If you are in the age group of 18-44 years and waiting to get vaccinated in Himachal, get ready for a long haul. Booking a vaccination slot in the state is no less than hitting a jackpot.Even those with high-speed internet and fastest fingers are at their wits’ end as there is no guarantee that they will get a spot. Slots open for a fraction of second, one blink and they are gone. “I was on two devices with high-speed internet, but still didn’t get a slot,” said Varun Chaudhary, who lives in Shimla.“The CoWIN portal always displayed slot booked on the vaccination centre in and around Shimla from 2pm to 3.30pm. The official time of slot opening was 2.30pm but it showed no vacancy,” he complained. “It seems like a big scam. The slots are already booked before they are uploaded on the portal,” he alleged.Due to shortage of vaccine, the state government has fixed two days, Monday and Thursday, in a week for vaccination of people in the 18-44 age group. Vaccination began on May 17 and till date, 40,353 people have been given the jab while the estimated population in this range is more than 31 lakh. To start with, the state government had received more than 1.7 lakh doses for the vaccination of the people in this age group.The slots are updated on the website two days before the vaccination schedule.Abhay Karki, a youth from Dharamshala, said he and his brother were trying to book a slot on two separate computers.“It opened for a while and till we submitted the details, all the slots were taken. This has happened not once but twice. If there was shortage of vaccines, the government should have started the drive later instead of creating a chaos,” he said. This is not the only problem with the process. In rural belts, people have limited access to the internet and those living in urban areas have been hogging the vaccination slots.Vinod Kumar, a resident of a rural area in Kangra district, said many people from the other states got jabbed at the vaccination centre near his village.He said village people were not tech-savvy and till they filled the form, all slots were booked.There were also reports of some tourists getting jabbed at vaccination centres in Lahaul and Spiti while a Haryana man was seen getting the shot at Dharamshala vaccination centre. Another member of his family had booked a vaccination slot near Nurpur. Prajwal Busta, a Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader, said if anyone from other state worked here or lived here for long, he/she should definitely get the vaccine.“But, if tourists are hogging the slots, then it’s wrong. If they can travel this far for getting jabbed, then they can also pay for the vaccine. Bona fide address proof should be made mandatory for booking slots,” she added. She said the state government had done a good job in vaccinating its people, but some of them were taking advantage of “flaws in the system”.Matter taken up with CentreMeanwhile, Dr Nipun Jindal, director of National Health Mission (NHM), said problems being faced by people were in notice of authorities.“We have taken up the matter with the Union health ministry and also written to them seeking a solution,” he said. “We have asked the Centre to allow us book certain percentage of slots offline like it is being done in Lahaul and Spiti where 80% slots are not being booked on web,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/booking-a-vaccination-slot-a-herculean-task-for-18-in-himachal-101621799524414.html

24-05-2021||Lucknow||Artistes too have great responsibility: Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha||Theatre veteran and actor-director Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha feels that during pandemic artistes should continue polishing their skills and utilize this free time to the fullest. “We are in a mid of a pandemic and theatre is kart ki vidya (art of doing) so when the time will come it should never be that we are unable to deliver. So, actors and those in other performing art should keep their mind fresh by watching fine content, reading good literature, philosophies, and work on their craft and do web meetings with actors and mentors,” said the former director of Bhartendu Natya Academi, Lucknow. Kulshreshtha has directed over 100 plays and acted in films like Dasdev, Monsoon Shootout and recently Mira Nair’s series A Suitable Boy. “In March I staged my new play Muntazir in Prayagraj. Thereafter, my wife and I both were tested Covid positive but thankfully we recovered in home isolation.” Kulshreshtha emphasised that young artistes should use this opportunity to help people in best possible way during the ongoing pandemic and these real-life experiences and incidents will surely help them a lot in future. Recently, during a webinar ‘Antarang’ held by Sangeet Natak Academi, New Delhi, he gave example of German playwright Berthot Brecht poem: In the dark times will there be singing? Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times! He talked about his vision of theatre. “Everyone has their own vision for theatre and with time it keeps evolving. First thing I learnt is that visuals should speak louder than word. By radio show Hawa Mahal I learnt importance of audio which can create visuals while the value of simplicity I learnt from Ram Leela. My real training happened under the influence of stalwarts and learning from BNA. My vision broadened with various theatre forms — realistic, international (western), folk and classics. My canvas widened with reading various philosophies, literature, culture and history.” Interpreting Russian theatre legend Konstantin Stanislavski theory of 4Ws, in his own way, he said, “For me ‘why’ is hunger for expression. ‘What’ stands for minimalistic theatre — focus on acting than anything else. Whether it is old, classic or new it should be relevant in today’s world! ‘Where’ is all about my wish that bring plays out of auditorium so it can reach to masses. ‘Who’ is for the actors who should be intensely trained while ‘whom’ one should know the psychology of audience and group behaviour! Then comes ‘how’ and that’s what for in my quest is.” The theatre stalwart feels that actors have a great responsibility which he sums up with few lines from Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh’s poem: O! Mere adarshwadi man, O! Mere siddhantwadi mann, ab tak kya kiya? Ab tak kya kiya? Jeewan ka jiya…zyada liya aur diya bahut-bahut kam…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/artistes-too-have-great-responsibility-surya-mohan-kulshreshtha-101621798264475.html
24-05-2021||Lucknow||RLD raises issue of Covid waste being dumped in river, water bodies||: The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has drawn the attention of the chief minister Yogi Adityanath over Covid waste being dumped into the Gomti river. The RLD has also demanded that a committee be set up to ascertain the potential risk of such waste being dumped in the river or lakes and ponds or other water bodies in rural areas. RLD national spokesman Anupam Mishra said the chief minister must issue directives to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to take necessary steps to check such dumping of waste. He has also said a high-level committee be set up to study the potential risk arising out of such Covid waste being dumped in water bodies across the state. Mishra said a proper study must be conducted to check whether Covid’s “genetic material” is not growing in water bodies. “This cannot be ruled out because the water and sewage from patients’ homes and hospitals are being drained into the river, drains, ponds and lakes without further treatment. This may lead to a terrible situation post Covid as then it could lead to a drinking water crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-raises-issue-of-covid-waste-being-dumped-in-river-water-bodies-101621797123803.html

In his complaint, Vishal told the police that he and his friend Laxman Yadav worked at the Ludhiana Railway Station, where they loaded and unloaded material from trains. On Friday afternoon, he received a call from Jagmohan to meet him near the Clock Tower. When he reached there, Vishal said Jagmohan picked him up in his car and on reaching near Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, also picked up four other men. He drove him to his office near Vishkarma Chowk, where he forced him to call Laxman to Dholewal Chowk.Soon after, Jagmohan went to bring Laxman from there, and then drove him and Laxman to Vishwakarma Chowk, where he and his accomplices thrashed him. After brutally beating them up, the accused tore their clothes and filmed it on their phones, Vishal alleged.“The victims were released later in the night with threats of being killed if they reported the incident to the police, and were also warned against any future tip-offs about their consignment to the excise department,” said sub-inspector (SI) Harjit Singh, who is investigating the case.The accused have been booked under Sections 365 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful consignment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act at the Division Number 1 police station.

24-05-2021||Other||Serious crimes down amid curbs in Mumbai but lockdown violations surge||Crimes have decreased during the month-long restrictions on movement imposed in the city, similar to last year’s lockdown. According to the crime statistics compiled by Mumbai Police, barring the cases for lockdown violations, body crimes as well as property crimes have shown a decline. Officers have said that the heavy presence of police on roads, including at more than 150 checkpoints across the city, during the lockdown period has directly contributed in getting the crime rate down. On an average, the city witnessed 19 murders and 26 attempted murders during the April-May period. While the number of attempted murders has remained the same since the lockdown started in April, the number of murders declined to nine during the corresponding period this year. Last year, eight cases of murder were reported. According to the police officers, incidents of street crime have also decreased considerably owing to the movement in restrictions. Crimes such as chain snatching also fell below average. Statistics have revealed that only four cases of chain snatching were reported from April 12 to May 9 compared to an average of 20 in the previous years during the same period. Vehicle thefts also came down considerably from an average of 262 in the past years to 156 during this lockdown. Officers said that city has also seen a decline in the cases of crimes against women. Rape cases decreased from an average 84 in the pre-Covid years to 39 during the current lockdown. Last year in April 17 cases of rape were registered. The police attribute this decline to the strict lockdown measures implemented by the department and steps like ‘Operation All Out’ and other preventive measures to lower the crime rate and increase the detection of earlier crimes. “Greater presence of police personnel in the field is the reason behind the decrease in street crimes,” said deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu. However, the total number of cases recorded in the April-May period skyrocketed with 9,037 crimes being registered this lockdown against the 5,702 last year. Two years ago, 3,272 crimes were reported, while in 2018, 2,886 cases were filed. The police attribute the rise to cases registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) for violation of lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/serious-crimes-down-amid-curbs-in-mumbai-but-lockdown-violations-surge-101621796404315.html

A specialist in physical metallurgy and material science, Banerjee had turned 75 last month.Having completed his Bachelor of Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur in 1967, Banerjee joined the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai as a scientific officer. In 2004, he became BARC’s director and held the post till 2010. He then took over the reins at DAE for the next two-and-a-half years.Banerjee was also the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award recipient and a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy. The academic circle in Mumbai has grieved the loss of a prolific scientist.Indian nuclear physicist Anil Kakodkar, who preceded Banerjee’s terms at both BARC and DAE, said, “We are shocked by this sudden loss. He and his wife had completely recovered from Covid-19. He was not only a professional colleague but a very dear friend.”Kakodkar remembers Banerjee as an energy enthusiast, who loved sharing ideas about clean energy on a regular basis. “Even after retirement, we had continued to work on our ideas. He would call me often and share ideas about energy. We had a conversation just a week or so ago,” he added.Banerjee was a council member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.The institute’s director Srinivasan Ramakrishnan said, “Dr Banerjee had a deep understating of fundamental research and was an ardent supporter of research activities in TIFR for at least a quarter of a century. He played the role of a mentor for TIFR’s past directors and was continuing to do so for the present director too. His enthusiasm for research had no bounds. Many new research initiatives of TIFR (such as the Indian Neutrino Observatory) flourished due to him. As a member of the governing council, he was always supportive of new ideas and encouraged the researchers by talking to them directly.”The late scientist had agreed to deliver the Foundation Day lecture at TIFR on June 1. “He chose the title ‘Small science to big science: A journey’. We are saddened that this lecture will never happen now. To honour his long and fruitful association with TIFR, we are planning to hold a memorial service for him on the same date. However, the tribute from TIFR, which he would surely have liked the best, is to follow the path he had taken. This will certainly be our sincerest endeavour,” Ramakrishnan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exdept-of-atomic-energy-chief-srikumar-banerjee-dies-at-75-in-navi-mumbai-101621795928020.html

He was undergoing treatment at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital for the past two days. He was on ventilator support, but died during the wee hours of Sunday.Saluja had laid the foundation of the group by setting up a garment manufacturing unit in 1969. From a humble beginning on Naulakha Street, the group emerged as a strong textile conglomerate in Ludhiana over the next five decades. People from religious, police, social and industrial organisations expressed condolences over Saluja’s demise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-respite-from-covid-deaths-in-ludhiana-20-more-lose-the-battle-101621795927516.html

The woman and her son have suffered minor injuries in the accident. The police said the accused, Popat Nagargoje, was driving under the influence of alcohol and they will soon arrest him.Nagargoje, a resident of Ghansoli, was rashly driving an Innova while going back home from Koparkhairane. “Around 10.30pm, the accused was on a road at Koparkhairne when he crashed into five cars while trying to overtake them, and also hit a woman who was standing at a corner with her son. Luckily, the two did not suffer major injuries,” a Koparkhairne police officer said. The woman, identified as Nisha Gupta, 46, later filed a police complaint about the incident. “Nagarjore was in an inebriated state and was not able to answer anything on Saturday. His car has been seized,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50yearold-rams-into-2-pedestrians-crashes-into-5-four-wheelers-at-navi-mumbai-101621795863815.html
24-05-2021||Other||Param Bir Singh’s offences as Thane top cop cognisable: State to HC||The counsel for the Maharashtra government has claimed that the documents provided by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh along with his petition to seek the quashing of a case under the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against him itself shows that the cop had committed cognisable offences. During the hearing on Singh’s petition on Friday, the state pointed to the fact that as police inspector BR Ghadge, the complainant in the case, had refused to comply with the former top cop’s orders to shield corrupt developers in Kalyan-Dombivli civic body, he was charged with false cases at the behest of Singh, who was the then Thane Police commissioner. The state further submitted that Singh was aware that Ghadge belonged to the Mahar community (categorised as SC). The state also argued that as per Singh’s documents, it is also proved that Ghadge’s complaints to the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in 2017 and 2018 against the former top cop were not heeded. While arguing on behalf of the state, special public prosecutor and former advocate general, Darius Khambatta had informed the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade that the claims made by Singh’s counsel, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, were far from the truth. Singh’s counsel had argued that the first information report (FIR) against him for allegedly committing atrocities under the SC/ST Act on Ghadge were baseless and aimed at heckling the former top cop for complaining against ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in March, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore every month from establishments. Jethmalani had tried to impress upon the bench that the atrocities case was forced upon Singh by Ghadge as the former top cop refused to withdraw his letter. Jethmalani said that none of the complaints by Ghadge from 2016-18 against Singh and the false cases registered against him had mentioned that he belonged to an SC community, and hence, filing the complaint after five years of the incident clearly pointed out that it was meant to put pressure on Singh. However, Khambatta pointed to the letters and complaints which Jethmalani referred to and showed HC that Singh not only knew about his junior officer’s caste but had also asked both reserved and open category officers to probe the various allegations foisted upon Ghadge. In all, four FIRs were registered against Ghadge in 2016 and charge sheets in the cases were filed against him. He spent over a year in jail and was later acquitted in one of the trials. Khambatta said that the state had then appealed against the acquittal and Jethmalani was misleading the court. As the hearing had started late on Friday, the bench stopped it at 11.55pm and posted it for the hearing on Monday. Singh’s plea will be heard by a division bench headed by justice SS Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/param-bir-singh-s-offences-as-thane-top-cop-cognisable-state-to-hc-101621795683730.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Walk-in vaccination for 45+ between Monday and Wednesday: BMC||Starting today, those above 45 years of age will be allowed to walk in to receive their first Covishield vaccine dose for three days (between Monday and Wednesday), according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This comes two weeks after the BMC suspended the walk-in vaccination drive owing to crowding at centres.According to BMC, between Thursday and Saturday, vaccination will be only on basis of appointment, and on Sunday there will be no inoculation. However, the vaccination for the 18-44 age group remains suspended in civic and government centres. The BMC had last week allowed those above 60 years of age for walk-in vaccination.As per BMC data, there are 1.1 million senior citizens in the city. Among them, 882,000 have been administered the first dose. The civic body is now focusing on covering the remaining 300,000 senior citizens. Meanwhile, those wanting the second dose of Covaxin will be allowed on a walk-in basis. According to BMC, those requiring second dose of Covishield have to come 84 days after taking the first dose, as per instructions of the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/walkin-vaccination-for-45-between-monday-and-wednesday-bmc-101621795444943.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha aiming for 24x7 inoculation, says CM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the state plans to conduct the Covid-19 inoculation drive around-the-clock once they start getting a regular supply of vaccine doses as he wants to immunise the entire population at the earliest. Thackeray said manufacturing companies have informed the state that production will start augmenting from June and subsequently, supply will improve.Maharashtra is facing a shortage of doses and has suspended the drive for the 18-44 age group. It is the state most affected by the pandemic, with over 5.57 million cases. “We are hoping, from what has come from discussion with manufacturing firms, that production will start increasing from June. As soon as supply of vaccine doses becomes regular, we will vaccinate around-the-clock. I want to immunise the entire population at the earliest and have planned things accordingly,” the chief minister said.He was addressing a virtual meeting of expert doctors from the state task force, which was organised considering the expected third wave that may threaten children. He said the state is pursuing the issue of supply and was ready to make a one-time payment for 120 million doses to cover the 60 million population in the 18-44 age group.After the Central government changed the vaccination policy and put the onus on vaccinating those from the 18-44 age group on the states, Maharashtra started vaccination for the group from May 1, but was forced to suspend owing to shortage of vaccine doses.It has also floated an express of interest (EOI) on May 17 to procure 50 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration, and are being manufactured in other countries. Its closing has been extended to May 25, following no response from the bidders till May 20.The chief minister said there are concerns over the third wave, but there is no need to panic. “The first wave hit senior citizens, the second one targeted youth and now children are said to be under threat in the third wave, if it comes. We need to concentrate on vaccinating those under 18 years of age, but there is not enough guidance by the Centre on which of the vaccines can be used. Clinical trials are going on at some places and when an advisory will be issued by the Centre it will also be implemented. Till then there is no need to panic even if there are concerns. Follow all the instructions from the expert doctors and share them with others as well,” Thackeray said.On Sunday, the state vaccinated 40,756 beneficiaries. It has inoculated 20,764,041 beneficiaries until May 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-aiming-for-24x7-inoculation-says-cm-101621795443798.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 26,672 new Covid cases||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 26,672 daily infections, pushing the count to 5,579,897. It was the fourth day in a row when the number of daily cases was less than 30,000. The tally of active cases continued to fall and reached 348,395, with 29,177 recoveries in the past 24 hours. The state saw 594 casualties taking the toll up to 88,620. Pune reported the highest toll with 93 deaths. The district recorded 84 deaths, while the city reported nine fatalities. It was followed by Mumbai and Ahmednagar with 49 and 47 casualties, respectively. The Covid situation in Maharashtra is improving. The number of daily cases is declining and it is down to around half of what it was in the beginning of this month. In the past one week (May 17-23), the average of new cases recorded in the state was 28,777, whereas in the first week (May 1-7), the average was 56,326. In the second week (May 7-14), it dropped to 44,212 cases a day on an average, according to the statistics provided by the state health department. Maharashtra is currently under complete lockdown, which ends on morning of June 1. The state may not extend it further and start easing restrictions in a staggered manner. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said although the cases have been brought under control, they are yet to get success as the state is gearing up for a possible third wave. He also said the decision of imposing lockdown was a tough call that has brought the situation under control. “I chose to impose lockdown by going against people’s wishes. It was the harshest decision to take as it brings restrictions on their livelihood, but I was ready to face their discontent. Today, the situation has come under control, but we are yet to get success. The success is of the people who have shown restraint, not mine,” Thackeray said. He was addressing an open virtual meeting of expert doctors from the state task force to guide other doctors and parents over dos and don’ts in case a child is found infected with the Covid-19 virus. It was organised considering the third wave, which is said to be dangerous for children of all ages. “The danger is yet to pass. We should be prepared for a possible third wave. In the second wave, we faced a shortage of oxygen and other things, considering which we have started our preparations from now on. I want to make sure the state becomes self-reliant, but it will take some time,” the chief minister pointed out. Mumbai also clocked 1,427 new cases, bringing the total to 696,910. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 290,155 samples and had a positivity rate of 9.19%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 16.9%, according to the data issued by the state health department on Sunday. Recently, state health minister Rajesh Tope had indicated that the state may not extend complete lockdown. “Lockdown will remain in force till the morning of June 1. The thumb rules for imposing lockdown are availability of beds, medicines and in case healthcare services are likely to crumble. Today, we have beds and medicines in all districts. We also have an adequate number of doctors,” he said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-26-672-new-covid-cases-101621794906459.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Horticulture waste being dumped in Chandigarh’s southern sectors||The residents of Chandigarh’s southern sectors have had it with the waste problem in the area which they claim has become a dump yard despite prompt complaints to the civic body authorities.As per the chief coordinator of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), Rajinder Garg, an empty patch of land in Sector 46-A has become a dumping ground for horticultural waste.“The land exists between 1-kanal kothis where garbage collectors and residents frequently chuck their waste. The municipal corporation too has failed to resolve the issue, instead the officials ask us for money to hire vehicles to pick up the garbage. Don’t we pay enough taxes already,” asked Garg.When asked, area councillor Gurpreet Singh Dhillon said he has been routinely getting the spot cleaned in the past. “The land belongs to the UT administration, but we still get it cleaned routinely. I was hospitalised for Covid treatment, so I was unavailable for the past few days. I will get this issue resolved on priority now,” he assured.Similarly, president of Sector 38 resident welfare association (RWA) Joginder Singh said, “In the park beside Vivek High School, disposal of horticultural waste has become a routine affair. We demand that the authorities concerned act on our complaints and maintain cleanliness in the area.” He added that the MC should also issue challans if any private individual is found dumping waste here.In Sector 33, this problem continues despite repeated complaints from residents. Sector 33-A RWA president Jagdish Singh Sarpal said, “The park near the Sehaj Safai Kendra is lying in a state of neglect while horticultural waste is also dumped regularly in an empty plot next to Tender Heart School.”MC officials tasked with lifting the waste here said they would look into the matter. The civic body is also in the process of buying more vehicles to lift horticultural waste from the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/horticulture-waste-being-dumped-in-chandigarh-s-southern-sectors-101621794905301.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Make technology part of RTE, say experts||More than a year after schools in the state and the country moved online, there is a pressing demand from educationists and experts to cater to the technological gap in learning, with a large number of students still struggling to get access to smartphones, laptops and computers and thus remaining out of the education system.A 16-page report of the India Task Force under the Lancet Covid-19 Commission titled Reopening Schools after Covid-19 closures has recommended making Right to Technology a fundamental part of the Right to Education (RTE). One of the key recommendations of the report consists of providing digital access to students. “Bridge the divide on a priority basis through a combination of actions including but not restricted to improving access to internet connectivity and devices to poorest children,” states the report.Data on access to technology among students in the state has revealed that a large number of students did not have access to learning due to the unavailability of devices or the inability to pay for the internet. According to a survey conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), nearly 60,000 students in the city had no access to online learning as of February. Half of these were students who had no phones.Similarly, as per a survey conducted by the Maharashtra state education department in February 2021, nearly 16% students from the state do not have access to any medium of communication (radio, TV or mobile phone) for online education. As per the data, over 26% students in the state do not have access to even a simple mobile phone. The state of Palghar had the highest number of students without access to any medium – 37.48% followed by Gadchiroli (36.23%) and Nandurbar (29.87%). Even in Mumbai, which has the highest penetration of WhatsApp (70.33%), 3.58% students do not have access to a mobile, TV or radio.Experts said that the studies done so far should be indicators for the government agencies and for educational institutes to address the issue of poor access to technology among students. “The governments have to creatively think of leveraging education budgets for the next three-five years. The current state of education and learning is very different from before. Financial planning, student curriculum, teacher support, and parent engagement need to evolve. The technology gap has to be bridged. State governments should strongly consider repurposing the allocated budgets for textbooks, uniforms, TLMs (teaching-learning materials), school infrastructure, potentially some part of the mid-day meal scheme (if not already supported by other schemes), and other RTE accompaniments towards providing digital equipment access. If we can aspire to provide one quality device for every four students by 2025 - it will set a phenomenal learning infrastructure for the next 10-12 years,” said Madhukar Banuri, chief executive officer and co-founder of Leadership for Equity, a Pune based NGO.Ghanshyam Sonar, convenor of the All India Right to Education Forum said that students need to be provided devices along with internet connectivity on a priority basis in the new academic year that is set to begin for most state schools in June. “A realistic assessment on the requirements is already expected to be in. The government should now work on bridging the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged students because they have got enough time to do so for the last one year,” he added.Nirmala Jadhav, a parent from a civic school in Borivli said that while her son used her phone to attend online classes last year, he ended up missing a lot because she had to go out to work, hence carry the phone with her. “On paper, we have a device with us but it is of no use because the timings of classes and our work clashes. The government should come up with some solution and try and distribute free devices to students,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/make-technology-part-of-rte-say-experts-101621794843727.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Surge in spike protein antibody tests among vaccine beneficiaries||After taking Covid-19 vaccines, many beneficiaries are undergoing spike protein antibody test which detects proteins created by the immune system to fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Private laboratories have observed around three-fold rise in people opting for the antibody test as compared to February this year. Initially only healthcare workers (HCL) and frontline workers (FLW) were taking the tests, but over the past few months, private laboratories are seeing a number of general public opting for the test to determine the development of neutralising antibodies after vaccination. However, doctors have overruled the need for testing post-vaccination.Since May last year, Dr Vikrant Singh, 38, has been working with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in city slums. He is responsible for tracing close contacts of infected patients in slums of Govandi, Chembur and surrounding areas. Despite wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), there is always a chance of contracting the infection on the field. So, he stayed away from his family in an empty flat.A fortnight after taking the second jab of vaccine on February 12, he undertook the spike protein antibody test. “My test revealed that my antibody presence was high which gave me some assurance. Finally, after months, I could hug my 70-year-old mother who has diabetes,” he said.The spike protein antibody test has gained quite a buzz among vaccine beneficiaries. Considering the rise in demand for the test, several private labs such as SRL Diagnostic, Metropolis Healthcare, Dr B Lal Clinical Laboratory among others have started the facility. The test costs between ₹500 and ₹1,400.“The test was well-received by the medical fraternity and healthcare workers including doctors, who were among the first to be vaccinated. With the vaccination drive open to the public, there has been a growing interest among common people to go for the spike protein antibody test. Between February and April, there has been a three-fold increase in people opting for the test. They are keen to know how their bodies are reacting to the vaccine in terms of development of antibodies,” said Anand K, chief executive officer (CEO), SRL Diagnostics.Thyrocare Diagnostics has recorded almost 100% growth in the demand of testing between February and April. It has also been observed that the antibodies remain in the body for three to 12 months, though the lab has not made any study on it.“The beneficiaries are interested to know how their bodies are producing the antibodies in reaction to the jab. This provides an assurance to the public. Though the test does not help to determine the efficiency of any vaccine, it helps understand the level of immunity obtained,” said Chandrashekhar Mani, vice-president (operations), Thyrocare.Antibodies are protective proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance. These antibodies are produced in the body in two ways — when it is exposed to a virus and after getting a vaccination. The antibody produced after the vaccination neutralises the virus.“Viruses have two different types of proteins — spike protein and nucleo-capsid protein. Spike protein remains on the surface of the virus while nucleo-capsid protein is found inside the virus. The viruses generally enter the human cell through the spike protein domain. Thus, most vaccines such as Covishield have been designed to target the spike protein. This antibody test helps in the detection of the presence of antibodies specific to the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein,” said Dr Sanjay Ingle, zonal technical head (west) and consultant pathologist, Apollo Diagnostics.Spike protein antibodies are generally developed after two weeks of taking the second dose. Dr Anupa Dixit from Suburban Diagnostics said, “To get an assured report, the test needs to be done after 15days of taking the second jab.”No need to do spike protein test post-vaccinationHowever, a certain section of the medical fraternity has advised not to take the test after taking the jabs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on its official website, has not recommended the test post-vaccination to determine the level of immunity or protection from Covid-19.Dr Rahul Tambe, senior consultant, Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, said, “Individuals should not use the antibody test as a tool to gauge their immunity. Antibody level alone is not a reflection of one’s immunity or protection against Covid-19. Several other physiological factors play a vital role in building an immune response.”Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has an efficacy rate of 81%, preliminary data from its phase three trial shows. Clinical trials of Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine showed that when people were given a half dose and then a full dose, the effectiveness hit 90%.“These vaccines have undergone clinical trials and then been given approval from the Drugs Controller General of India, so there is no point in undergoing spike protein antibody tests after vaccination,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the state’s Covid task force.Rise in IgG antibody tests in second waveLast year, a large number of people underwent Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody tests to understand if they had ever been infected with the virus.As per the data shared by Thyrocare, on an average around 2,400 people undertook the test daily last year. However, with the fall in the pandemic curve, the number decreased to 1,000 tests per day in January. Since February, when the second wave started, the number rose to an average of 3,000 tests per day. In April, they conducted 4,000 tests per day.When the body comes in contact with any diseases-causing pathogens, the first antibody produced by the internal system is Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and later IgG is produced by the immune system. IgG plays a role in creating memory cells that remain in the body to help fight the virus in case of reinfection.“Last year, many Covid-recovered people increasingly opted for IgG antibody tests. The major motivation behind opting for IgG antibody test was to ascertain whether they could qualify to be plasma donors. However, as the impact of the first wave tapered and cases decreased, the demand went down. With the current wave of Covid-19, the demand for antibody testing has again gained momentum,” said Anand K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-surge-in-spike-protein-antibody-tests-among-vaccine-beneficiaries-101621794783760.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to get mobile app, vaccine dashboard for Covid vaccine||In a bid to improve the experience of Covid vaccination in the city, Mumbai civic body plans to develop a web portal-based vaccination dashboard on the lines of its Covid-19 management dashboard along with a mobile application which will help citizens get information on vaccination in the city. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also plans to develop a web portal-based chat bot where citizens can get answers to their queries about vaccines. However, citizens will not be able to book appointment for vaccination using the dashboard or the mobile application. Registration and booking of appointments for vaccination will continue to be done on the CoWIN app.According to BMC officials, this plan is similar to its Covid-19 dashboard that is available online for citizens to understand the spread of the virus in the city along with analytical data. For details on vaccination, they are going to develop a mobile application. BMC officials said the app and web portal will help citizens in getting details on vaccine availability, vaccine consumption pattern, adverse effects count etc. The information will also be made in such a way that citizens will be able to share it via social media platforms like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.BMC has already floated bids for the same and the system is expected to go live next month, if all goes as per the plan, civic officials said.The bid document floated by BMC reads, “In order improve citizen experience of getting inoculated, BMC is looking for an application, which will work with close integration with Government of India’s CoWIN application, for vaccination programme management in Mumbai city, primarily focusing on helping efficient logistics for the vaccination drive in the city and transparently sharing real-time vaccination-related information with various stakeholders and citizens.”According to the bid document, features of the mobile app and dashboard will include inventory tracking, centres where vaccination is out of stock, daily consumption, among others. The app will also send notifications to the administration via SMS about changing consumption patterns of vaccine in the city.Dr Managala Gomare, head of BMC’s public health department, said, “We are planning to come up with vaccine dashboard like our Covid dashboard. However, in this dashboard, the information displayed for the administration and the citizens will be divided. Few details displayed will be useful for citizens, whereas the information requirement of the administration might vary.”Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner BMC, said, “We will have the option of both web-based dashboard giving vaccination information and a mobile application. However, both of these will only be for information and not booking of appointment or registration. Citizens will have to continue using CoWIN for registration and booking vaccine appointments.”He added, “In the coming days, we plan to have more vaccine doses by importing from international bidders. The bidding process is on and once we get more vaccine doses, the vaccination drive will get scaled up and the use of these features will be useful at that time.”After receiving additional doses from the international market, BMC plans to take up the vaccination drive aggressively by starting mobile vaccination centres in the city apart from the current over 300 vaccination centres. BMC had, on May 12, floated global expression of interest for procuring 10 million vaccine doses from the international market. Around three parties have expressed their interest for supplying Russia’s Sputnik vaccine to the city. The last day for submitting proposals is Tuesday.Meanwhile, as of Saturday, 2,955,267 citizens have been vaccinated in the city, of which 80,077 are aged between 18 and 44, 1,045,005 are from the 45-59 age group, 1,172,755 are senior citizens and the remaining are healthcare and frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-get-mobile-app-vaccine-dashboard-for-covid-vaccine-101621794724314.html
24-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: School students raise funds for mucormycosis patients||Amid growing cases of mucormycosis during the ongoing second wave of Covid-19, two school students from Cathedral and John Connon School, Fort are raising money for the treatment of patients suffering from the black fungus infection.Mucormycosis is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes, and causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death if not treated on time, said doctors. Since the beginning of the second wave in February, more than 160 Covid-recovered patients have contracted mucormycosis in the city and 20 of them lost their lives to the infection.With the aim to help such patients financially in their treatment, two Class 10 students — Arnav Gupta and Ranai Loonkar, both aged 15 years — have started an initiative to raise ₹2 lakh. In the past one week, they have been successfully raised over ₹1.89 lakh on the crowdfunding portal Impactguru.It all started when two weeks back, Arnav went for a check-up to an ENT specialist who is associated with the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central. While having a general discussion, his doctor told him about the growing cases of mucormycosis among patients who have recovered from Covid-19. This motivated him to raise money to help the patients with treatment along with his friend Ranai.“The treatment is quite expensive, which many people cannot afford. The price of the life-saving antifungal injection, Liposomal Amphotericin B, ranges from ₹5,000 to ₹8,000. So, I decided to help the patients within my own limit by raising the money,” said Arnav.The two teenagers did their research and contacted Impactguru for the campaign. Along with the crowdfunding portal, they are trying to raise awareness through their social media accounts.“Through WhatsApp, we have been dispersing information to our friends and families to raise money. Since the campaign started seven days ago, 30 people have already contributed,” said Ranai.The money will be donated to BYL Nair Hospital to be used towards treatment of patients suffering from mucormycosis.“After starting the campaign, we have been receiving calls from several patients. In fact, we got a call from Jabalpur seeking help with medicines. This shows how people are struggling to get treatment and medicines. This is the least we could do for the society in this pandemic,” said Arnav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-school-students-raise-funds-for-mucormycosis-patients-101621794663707.html
24-05-2021||Other||Facilitate return to Chinese varsities, say medical students||With no response from the Chinese government so far, Indian students enrolled in medical programmes in China have written to the ministry of external affairs as well as to the Indian and Chinese governments to facilitate their return to campuses. On Thursday, students wrote open letters to both the governments, stating that the looming uncertainty over their return to campus has led to mental strain. They have requested the governments to prioritise the return of the students who need to complete their hospital shifts and clinical rotations in order to graduate by September, at the earliest. “Studying online for prolonged period of time is exacting an immense mental toll on students. An increasing number of students are suffering from anxiety and stress due to uncertainty in the tentative date of return,” read the letter. The students have demanded clarity on return dates, proposal for possible chartered flights for sending them, facilitation of visa application, recognition of vaccination certificates of immunised students and facilitating inoculation of students in China. Students of Chinese universities returned to India last year amid the pandemic as their universities imposed lockdowns. More than a year on, they have not been able to return to the campuses as China continues to impose a travel ban for international students. Last month, students pursuing their degree in Chinese universities approached the United Nations (UN) hoping for a positive development. In a letter signed by over 20,000 medical, graduate and undergraduate students studying in the universities in China, Japan and Australia have urged UN to intervene in the matter and help lift the border restrictions which has left thousands of students stranded in their home countries for the past one year. The Indian Embassy in Beijing, China, in a statement on March 22 clarified that the Chinese government’s recent decision related to visa facilitation for foreigners does not apply to students.“Chinese authorities at various levels continue to maintain their position that on account of last year’s announcement by the ministry of foreign affairs of the People’s Republic of China to suspend temporarily the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese visa and residence permits following the outbreak Covid-19 in many countries, the visa suspension on foreigners stays until further notice,” read the official statement released by the embassy. Students are now gearing up to complete their courses online without having any practical experience. A third-year student from Jianghan University in Wuhan, said, “Our teachers are sending us videos of practical classes and assignments. Medical education without practical experience is incomplete.” According to data from Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in 2018 and 2019, China received around 500,000 international students each, the third highest in the world after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Over 23,000 Indians were enrolled in various programmes in China in 2018, shows data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/facilitate-return-to-chinese-varsities-say-medical-students-101621794603702.html

24-05-2021||Pune||Only 70 per cent pre-monsoon work complete, PMC sets June 10 deadline||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is claiming to complete the pre-monsoon work before June 10, however, till date only 70 per cent work has been completed. The biggest concern for residents in the Ambil odha vicinity is that the retaining wall construction work is still underway along with cleaning and deepening nullahs of different parts of the city especially the 11 merged villages. Normally, the PMC begins pre-monsoon work in the month of April and finishes it off by the end of May. In some years, the deadline is extended up to June 7 for the completion of the pre-monsoon works which includes cleaning, removing sludge, widening and deepening of nullahs, cleaning storm water drain, chambers, culverts cleaning of drainage lines among other things. However, this year, the administration is claiming to complete the work before June 10. The PMC had floated 22 tenders of cleaning nullahs in the last week of April. The amount of each tender was around ₹65 lakh. Besides this, the PMC floated 15 ward wise tenders each of ₹15 lakh. In Ambil odha which has emerged as the most affected part of the city since the last three years in the monsoon season, the PMC identified 19 spots to construct a retaining wall to restrict the flood water to flow into the slums or residential areas. However, the work of the retaining wall construction is still underway. The cleaning work at the Bhirobha Nullah has also not completed yet. Due to Tauktae, the PMC will have to clean the storm water drain in the Sinhagad road areas once again. On Saturday, additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar along with the drainage department and ward officers visited Kalas dhanori, Yerawada and Wadgaonsheri areas. The city has 236 major and small nullahs in the total 526 kilometre nullahs network in the city including the 11 merged villages (166 kilometres). Of that, 170 kilometres of nullahs are passing through high flooded areas which include Katraj, Wadgaonsheri, and all peth areas, Hadapsar, Pashan, Dhanori-Vishrantwadi, Hingne, Dattwadi, Aundh and Kothrud. Sunil Jadhav, a resident of Kharadi area said, “The nullah of Spring glory society is yet to be cleaned. The small stretch of nullah passing through Thite areas is also not clean. Last year, we had faced a problem of water logging in this area.” In Kothrud, Shastrinagar areas, Bavdhan area, PMC depot areas, Ramnadi area has also not completed the pre-monsoon work. The Hill side society and NDA Pashan road near Bank of India are some of the critical spots. Ramesh Patil, a resident of Kothrud area said, “I reside near NDA Pashan road area. The PMC hasn’t started the work of cleaning nullahs yet. We face water logging problems in the monsoon season.” Sameer Pathan, a resident of Kondhwa said, “There are nullahs passing through the Kondhwa police station. The PMC has not begun the work of cleaning the nullahs in Bhagodhaya Nagar and Survey number 42, 43 Prithviraj Sutar, a Shiv Sena corporator from Kothrud said, “In the Kothrud area, there 20 hotspots where we face water logging problems. The administration started the work late. It is not completed yet. Every year, the PMC is spending a lot of money on the same spots to clear water logging. We need a permanent solution on the water logging and monsoon-related problems.” Sushmita Shirke, superintending engineer, sewerage, maintenance and repair department said, “We will complete the work before June 10. The work is ongoing; we will carry out the work in monsoon which comes from outskirt of city in the nullahs. We have completed 70 per cent chamber cleaning work. We are facing some problems of manpower due to Covid-19 in chamber cleaning as it is completely manual. We use machinery to clean the nullahs. So, there is no problem, we will complete it before monsoon. At present, there are around ₹15 crore worth of pre-monsoon work going on in the city.” According to Shirke, the cleaning of nullahs in the 11 merged villages will begin from Monday. “We have almost 15 days to complete pre-monsoon work,” she said. ============================ Header: Job half done Info: Only 70 per cent of the pre-monsoon work in the city has been completed.

With latest tally, the average weekly positivity rate between May 16 and May 22, has been under 10%, at 9.26%. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “The number of positive cases have been going down. The positivity rate has come down to 8%. Now, beds are available and necessary medicines are available. We hope this trend continues. People need to keep following the norms and should continue Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said the situation is in control in the city now, but people should not stop observing appropriate behaviour. “On April 18, the number of active patients in the city was 56,636. It was reduced to 12,330 on May 22. In the last one month the number of active patients has come down by 44,000 and is a silver lining for the city.” The week also saw Pune record less than 1,000 fresh cases for four days in a row. On April 8, Pune city had recorded its highest daily positive caseload of 7,010, with the positivity rate crossing 35%. With caseload dropping below the 1,000 mark, traders and hoteliers have started pushing for reopening of the markets and easing of existing restrictions. Responding to this demand, Mohol said that the administration will have to be cautious while easing curbs. “We cannot reopen everything in a hurry. It will have to be in the phases. Otherwise, there can be a resurgence of the infection. The discussion will take place in this week’s Covid review meeting. We need to tackle the soaring cases of mucormycosis and there is the possibility of the third wave,” Mohol said. The downward trend of Covid positive cases has also been observed in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The number of active patients recorded on Saturday in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits was at 7,800. According to Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, in the last 10 days, the average positivity rate in Pimpri-Chinchwad has been 11%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-positivity-rate-below-10-per-cent-for-four-successive-days-101621781103041.html

Ruby Hall clinic, Noble hospital and Sahyadri hospital, have confirmed the on-campus drives.The hospitals have priced each dose of Covishield for corporates at Rs1,200, following a decision taken on the price by the Pune Hospitals Association. Private hospitals are charging regular citizens ₹900 per dose of Covishield, to get their jabs.“We have received the vaccine doses and have already started vaccinations from our hospital. We have signed MoUs with several corporates like TCS and Tech Mahindra to vaccinate their employees. These firms have already taken all the necessary permissions and approvals. From Monday onwards, we will start the vaccination drive on their campuses,” said Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent, Ruby Hall Clinic. Ruby Hall, along with Noble hospital, began vaccinating the 18-44 age group from Friday. “We would like to highlight that the government should should allow those within the age group of 18-44 years to walk-in. Currently, this facility is only allowed for the age group of 45+ people. The number of youngsters coming in for vaccination is huge. We have already sent a request letter in this regards to the Pune district administration,” he added. Noble hospital in Hadapsar is also starting vaccination inside Magarpatta city from Monday. “We are checking our logistics and other preparations to start the vaccination at Magarpatta city. It will be for everyone including employees of corporate firms and local residents, along with staff of the township. First a dry run will be done on Monday and once everything goes out smoothly, the process will accelerate as per the supply of doses.” said Dr H K Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital. Currently, at least 12 hospitals in the city have started inoculation for the 18-44 age group. All those getting jabs are required to register on Cowin given that walk-ins are not allowed. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “We have started the vaccination from our hospital for citizens. However, we have not yet received any demand from any of the corporates. We can offer them service as per the requirement.” All these hospitals from the city have procured doses directly from the Covishield manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), based in Pune. Questions sent on email to SII, on whether it has started supplying Covishield doses directly to corporates and number of doses being provided to private hospitals to inoculate the 18 to 44-year age group went unanswered until the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pvt-hospitals-to-start-on-campus-vaccination-drives-for-corporate-firms-from-monday-101621780503118.html

He has been on duty ever since the lockdown kicked from April 5. The check post has been this canine’s home for the last 50 days. “Ever since the lockdown started, he has started to stay at the check post. He is not an aggressive dog. All enjoy his company. Raja has turned out to be a companion for us, bringing a smile to our faces,” said Murlidhar Karpe, inspector, Deccan Police Station. A tweet from Pune Police Commissioner Amitabh Gupta, read: “An ode to our Special Police Officer: Raja, the three-legged dog at the Balgandharva nakabandi - a vigilant companion and a true friend who has been with our Officers, throughout the lockdown.” The tweet generated a lot of traction among Puneties. Sushma Date, a pet lover and head of Deccan Gymkhana Animal Welfare Association, tweeted, “This is our sweetheart Tridev! So happy to see he is assisting the police”. ‘Tridev was the name given to the “tripawd” dog when he was found by Deccan Gymkhana association members – Ashlesha Pathak, Gauri Bopatkar and Anjali Kudale, at Dnyaneshwar Paduka chowk, as he has three legs,” says Date. “Since the lockdown started, we have continued to feed him.

24-05-2021||World||Quad members step up Covid-19 support for countries in neighbourhood||India’s partners in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) have stepped up efforts to bolster the Covid-19 response of countries in the neighbourhood, scouring other parts of the world for surplus stocks of the AstraZeneca vaccine and providing funds for emergency relief.The moves by the other members of the Quad – Australia, Japan and the US – have come at a time when China is seeking to take on a greater role in the region by providing Covid-19 vaccines and other supplies.The US is already looking for surplus stocks of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe and other regions that can be used to help Bhutan, Nepal and other countries in the neighbourhood whose vaccine supplies were affected once India curtailed exports in March to focus on its second wave of Covid-19 infections.Australia recently announced $17.5 million in funding for emergency relief to support Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka in their response to increasing Covid-19 infections. Japan is providing 25 portable ultrasound image diagnostic systems to hospitals in Nepal and has plans to send 160 oxygen concentrators and six ambulances.The Indian government’s decision to curtail vaccine exports had a major impact on vaccination drives in countries such as Nepal and Bhutan, which used doses supplied by India to provide the first shots to hundreds of thousands of people. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that close to three months had elapsed since many people received the first shot in Nepal. During a phone conversation on Monday, the Nepalese foreign minister requested US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman to “accord due priority” to his country in the distribution of surplus vaccines among developing nations. Cooperation in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic was a key part of the conversation, according to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry.With vaccine exports from India unlikely to resume any time in the immediate future, the US is looking at the possibility of sourcing AstraZeneca doses from other parts of the world so that people in Bhutan and Nepal can be provided with the second doses. “Some countries may even resort to starting over with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but obviously if we could solve this by providing a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, that would be the simplest and best solution,” US chargé d’affaires Daniel Smith told a news briefing earlier this month.Acknowledging the risk to the second round of vaccination in countries such as Nepal, Smith said the US is looking to partner with other countries and boost vaccine production in India to make up the shortfall.Australia is providing emergency funding to countries in the neighbourhood for support to be delivered by on-the-ground partners. This will include oxygen and ventilators and improving contact tracing.In Bangladesh, Australia will provide $5 million to partners such as the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society for purchasing essential supplies, including oxygen and related equipment. This is in addition to $5.7 million provided earlier for equipment and training.In Nepal, Australia will provide $7 million for purchasing essential equipment through the UN and NGO partners. Australia is already providing equipment to hospitals in Nepal’s most severely affected areas bordering India, as well as testing kits and training for health workers.Australia will provide $5.5 million to the UN SDG Fund in Sri Lanka for critical supplies and health systems. It already provided more than $6.2 million in Covid-19-related support to Sri Lanka during 2020-21. Australia has also delivered oxygen and related supplies through the UNICEF, including 291 oxygen cylinders and 342 oxygen regulators.India and its partners in the Quad have been keeping a close eye on China’s moves in the neighbourhood, including the supply of vaccines as grants. Bangladesh received 500,000 doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine as a gift on May 12 and the Chinese embassy in Dhaka has announced that the second batch of doses will be donated soon. On Monday, China’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Wang Yu, announced on Twitter that Beijing will donate 700,000 doses of vaccines to Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-members-step-up-covid-19-support-for-countries-in-neighbourhood-101621878428149.html
24-05-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden doubling spending to prepare for hurricanes, storms||President Joe Biden is doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impacts of climate change.The $1 billion in spending being announced Monday is a small fraction of what the US spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.2021 has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states and underscore the damage caused by climate change.Forecasters predict the Atlantic hurricane season will be busier than normal, but is unlikely to be as severe as 2020’s record-shattering year.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the hurricane season, which runs from June through November, will likely see 13 to 20 named storms, including at least six that will become hurricanes and three to five categorized as major hurricanes with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kilometers per hour).Biden will make the funding announcement during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s headquarters Monday afternoon, where he will receive a briefing on this year’s outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season.As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events such as increased floods, sea level rise and intensifying droughts and wildfires, the White House said it is the government's responsibility to better prepare and support communities before disasters occur, rather than simply respond afterward.Under Biden's announcement, FEMA will provide $1 billion for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which helps states, local communities, tribes and territories to develop projects to prepare for and reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards.Officials pledged to increase investment in climate research to improve understanding of extreme weather events and hone decision-making on climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation. The new funding should help ensure that communities have the resources they need to build resilience prior to these crises, the White House said.The steps being announced Monday are part of Biden's pledge to elevate the importance of climate change as a major priority. Biden has set a target to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by up to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economywide by 2050.Just last week, Biden directed federal agencies to develop a comprehensive strategy to identify and manage financial risks to government and the private sector posed by climate change. An executive order he issued Thursday calls for concrete steps to mitigate climate risks and could result in new regulations on the banking, housing and agriculture sectors, among others.“Extreme weather related to climate change can disrupt entire supply chains and deprive communities of food, water or emergency supplies,″ the White House said. Snowstorms can knock power grids offline, while floods made worse by rising sea levels can destroy homes and businesses.The executive order directs White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and economic adviser Brian Deese to develop a government-wide strategy within four months to identify and disclose climate-related financial risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-doubling-spending-to-prepare-for-hurricanes-storms-101621877197196.html

24-05-2021||World||TLP's rising radicalism changing Pakistan's political structure: Report||Although religion has yet to play a dominant role in Pakistani politics, observers note that the country's current political structure may be changing with the rapid rise of the proscribed radical group - Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).In April, anti-France protests broke out in Pakistan where the supporters of now banned TLP took to the streets to protests against France over caricatures of Prophet Muhammad. The protests soon turned violent and exposed the grim security situation in Pakistan.During the violent protests, hundreds of protesters and police personnel were injured and thousands of TLP activists and supporters were arrested and booked for attacking law enforcement personnel and blocking main roads and highways.Several police vehicles were torched, buildings were attacked and policemen were kidnapped and tortured by the activists of the TLP across the Punjab province, with at least six policemen killed and over 800 injured.The banned party, led by cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi gained popularity over the issue of blasphemy among the masses, specifically concerning Mumtaz Qadri, the killer of former Punjab governor Salman Taseer over blasphemy accusations, writes Sulman Ali in an opinion piece for Pakistan Daily."They have presented themselves as the sole flag bearers of the blasphemy issue... Violence is a currency which sells in today's times. They have proven that they can also kill and be killed for their cause," said columnist Khurshid Nadeem.Surprisingly emerging as the fifth largest party of the 2018 general elections, the party even defeated the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the recently held National Assembly elections in Karachi, thus showing its immense popularity in Pakistan.According to Pakistan Daily, the TLP is weaponised the Barelvi sect, which was presented as an example to the world as the face of Islam, a sect that believes in love, tolerance, and peace. Khadim Rizvi, has since changed that whole out look and now the sect has emerged as radical, as it has blocked roads, halted daily life, broken citizens' cars, destroyed property and causing the loss of millions of rupees.The party successfully disrupted life in twin cities in 2016, then again in 2017, protesting against a change in Election Act in 2017.Experts note that the recent anti-France protests led by the TLP are not a good sign for Pakistan, which is already on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey-list over terror financing.The international body has kept Pakistan on the grey list, and with the incidents and violent protests by TLP, experts say it will be again hard for Islamabad to fight its case, wrote Sulman Ali."There is still an absence of authenticity in Pakistan wanting to make a clean break with religious extremism. The action, somehow, feels insufficient to shut down the massive jihadi infrastructure and to limit the radical Islamist sentiment that backs it," noted Pakistan's former ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani.Pakistan government's mishandling of the anti-France protests, as well as the initial tacit support of Prime Minister Imran Khan and other members of his cabinet to the blasphemy charges levelled by the TLP against French President Emmanuel Macron, has not gone down well in Paris, said Roland Jacquard, Chairman of Roland Jacquard Global Security Consulting (RJGSC) in an opinion piece last month.With anti-French sentiments running high, Jacquard said that french diplomats should not expect the Pakistan government to take a rational stand on the issue.

The crash occurred in a section of tunnel about 100 metres (330 feet) away from the KLCC station outside the Petronas towers."We are still investigating the incident..., but we suspect that perhaps there was a miscommunication from the trains' operations control center," Mohamad Zainal said.Videos and photos of the incident posted on social media showed several bleeding commuters and broken glass panels inside the trains, operated by Prasarana Malaysia Berhad.Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong said the collision was the first major accident in the metro system's 23 years of operation, and he pledged a thorough investigation.The 88-storey Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin towers in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-200-injured-when-two-trains-collide-in-malaysian-capital-101621871515888.html

Geneva is now expected to be the choice for Biden first face-to-face meeting with Putin as president, according to a second official.An official announcement was expected in the coming days.The summit would come at the end of Biden’s first foreign trip as president, a week-long swing through Europe that includes a stop in the United Kingdom for a Group of Seven summit of leaders of the world’s richest nations, and then a visit to the Brussels headquarters of NATO, the longstanding military alliance built as a bulwark to Russian aggression.A spokeswoman for the National Security Council declined to comment on the summit logistics.But, in a statement, the NSC said this week's meeting between Sullivan and the Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, “was an important step in the preparation for a planned US-Russia summit” and deemed the discussions “constructive” despite “outstanding differences.”The Biden first administration called for the summit last month after Russia engaged in a series of confrontational actions: temporarily amassing troops on the Ukrainian border, the SolarWinds hacking, reports of bounties placed on US troops in Afghanistan and the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-and-kremlin-working-to-arrange-biden-putin-summit-in-geneva-101621869327971.html

24-05-2021||World||China denies WSJ story on researchers falling sick at Wuhan lab||China on Monday accused the US of hyping the theory that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in the central city of Wuhan after a new report said three researchers from the facility sought hospital treatment for fever in November, 2019.Citing US intelligence, a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were admitted to a hospital a month before Beijing reported the first cases of Covid-19.The WSJ report came on the eve of a meeting of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision-making body, which is expected to discuss the next stage of a probe into the Covid-19 origins. “The report that you mentioned about three people getting sick, that is not true,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a briefing on Monday in Beijing when asked to comment about the WSJ story.Saying the report was “completely untrue”, Zhao said: “The United States continues to hype up the lab leak theory. Does it care about traceability or is it just trying to distract attention?”Separately, Yuan Zhiming, director of the lab, also told Chinese state media that the report was not correct. “I’ve read it, it’s a complete lie,” Yuan told Global Times on Monday about the WSJ story, which was published on Sunday titled “Intelligence on Sick Staff at Wuhan Lab Fuels Debate on COVID-19 Origin”.“Those claims are groundless. The lab has not been aware of this situation [sick researchers in autumn 2019], and I don’t even know where such information came from,” Yuan said.China has consistently denied the lab leak theory and has accused the US of using it as a distraction from its own handling of the pandemic.The WHO-led investigation into the origins of Covid-19 said it was “extremely unlikely” the coronavirus came from a laboratory leak.At the same time, international scientists have sought more data from China on early cases.The WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said following the probe that it didn’t adequately analyse the possibility of a lab accident. “As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table. This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,” he said after the report was published.Earlier this month, a group of 18 prominent scientists called for further investigations into the origins of the SARS-CoV2 virus, including that it could have been created in the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab.The letter, which was published in the journal Science, was helmed by David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford University, and Jesse Bloom, virologist at the University of Washington, gave weight to growing calls to include all hypotheses about natural and laboratory spillovers.“Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable. Knowing how Covid-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks,” the scientists wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-wsj-story-on-researchers-falling-sick-at-wuhan-lab-101621857067547.html
24-05-2021||World||France, Germany back efforts to improve WHO as meeting opens||French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday were among leaders rallying around efforts to strengthen the World Health Organization and the world’s ability to prepare for and defend against pandemics.It came as the UN health agency opened its annual assembly, with a draft resolution in the works that acknowledges missteps in the response to Covid-19. The sweeping proposal would seek to boost pandemic response, stabilize WHO's funding and ensure greater access to health care — including to vaccines, tests and treatments linked to the coronavirus.The European Union and Vanuatu were behind the resolution, which was to be considered during the eight-day assembly. It would create a working group on strengthening WHO’s readiness and response to health emergencies.“We have to have institutions that are up to the task, that meet our ambitions,” Macron said by video during the mostly virtual meeting. WHO, he said, must be “robust” and “flexible” in times of emergency and crisis. “And it must be completely transparent to make sure that people trust the organization.""There must not be any political pressure and there must not be any suspicion of pressure that has been exerted,” he added.Merkel threw her backing behind the idea of a “global health threat council” and said leaders should provide WHO with “lasting financial and personal support.”“We have been talking about this for years, but now it is all the more important to act,” she said.The resolution — a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press — cites Covid-19 two dozen times. It breaks little new ground and aims mostly to garner consensus and commonality of purpose in the aftermath of the economic and human devastation wreaked by the pandemic.The resolution, which would set up a six-person working group to report to the assembly next year, acknowledged “serious shortcomings” in the world’s ability to prepare, prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies.The text, if approved, would ask WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to make “concrete suggestions” for levels of alert in times of health emergencies, “with clear criteria and practical implications for countries.”Diplomats behind the measure said they hoped it could garner consensus among WHO's 194 member states.The WHO chief, after leading a round of applause for health care workers who have battled the pandemic in often-agonizing conditions, said the world remains in a “very dangerous situation” — and that while he was speaking 400 people would die of Covid-19.He reiterated his concerns about unequal access to vaccines, saying that over 75 percent of vaccines have been administered in 10 countries. He called for a “massive push” to ensure the vaccination of 10% of the population of all countries by the end of September — and at least 30% percent by year end.“There is no diplomatic way to say it: A small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the world’s vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-germany-back-efforts-to-improve-who-as-meeting-opens-101621851983171.html
24-05-2021||World||Myanmar junta leader casts doubt on return of Rohingya refugees||Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing cast doubt on the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled to Bangladesh in comments made in his first interview since taking power in a Feb. 1 coup.Min Aung Hlaing was asked by Chinese-language Phoenix television whether the Muslims could be allowed back to Rakhine State - from where most fled an army crackdown in 2017 that UN investigators said had "genocidal intent"."If it doesn't comply with Myanmar's laws, what else is there to consider? I don't believe there is any country in the world that would go beyond their own country's refugee laws to accept refugees," Min Aung Hlaing responded, according to a transcript of the interview.When asked whether that meant vocal international appeals on behalf of the Rohingya were to no avail, he nodded.Min Aung Hlaing, who headed the army in 2017 when some 700,000 Rohingya fled from advancing troops, reiterated the view of nationalists in Buddhist-majority Myanmar that the Rohingya are not one of its ethnic groups.He said the term Rohingya had only emerged since independence from Britain in 1948."After we gained our independence, the census also registered the words 'Bengali', 'Pakistani' and 'Chittagong', but never the word 'Rohingya', thus we never accepted it," Min Aung Hlaing said.Rohingya have been widely referred to as Bengali by Myanmar authorities - implying that they are outsiders from Bangladesh, although some can trace their roots in Myanmar back for centuries.Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was overthrown by Min Aung Hlaing on Feb. 1, had also come under international criticism for defending the army against charges of genocide relating to the Rohingya.She and the military rejected accusations of genocide saying the security forces were engaged in legitimate operations against Rohingya insurgents when the refugees fled to Bangladesh.Not long after the coup, Min Aung Hlaing said efforts to repatriate refugees from Bangladesh would continue, but there has been no sign of progress while the junta has struggled to impose control in Myanmar.Bangladesh is keen to see the Rohingya go back to Myanmar from the huge camps in which most of them are living in southeastern Bangladeshi border districts.Bangladesh's Dhaka Tribune journal reported on Monday that efforts were underway to restart talks on the repatriation between Bangladesh and Myanmar with the help of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-leader-casts-doubt-on-return-of-rohingya-refugees-101621852146124.html
24-05-2021||World||Minutes to touchdown: The moment a Belarusian dissident knew his time was up||Ryanair Flight 4978 had already begun its descent into the Lithuanian capital when the pilot announced that the plane would be suddenly diverting to Minsk, capital of neighbouring Belarus.There was no explanation.But one of the passengers aboard the Boeing 737 reacted immediately, standing up from his seat, reaching into the overhead locker, pulling a laptop computer from his hand luggage and passing it to a female companion along with his mobile phone.Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who is wanted in Belarus for his role in broadcasting huge opposition protests in Minsk last year, did not have much time. Minsk is less than 200 km (125 miles) from Vilnius. The diversion would take minutes."When it was announced they were going to land in Minsk, Roman stood up, opened the luggage compartment, took luggage and was trying to split things," said a Lithuanian passenger, who gave his name only as Mantas."I think he made a mistake. There were plenty of people so he could give the things to me or other passengers and not the girlfriend, who was also I think arrested."Outside the plane - although not visible to Mantas - was a Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jet, on orders from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to force the plane to Minsk.Mantas was speaking to Reuters after a day-long ordeal that began in Athens and finally ended late in the evening in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, after a stopover of more than seven hours in Minsk.Another exhausted passenger, speaking to reporters without giving her name, said Protasevich looked "super scared"."I looked directly into his eyes and he was very sad," she said.Belarusian authorities had diverted the flight as it passed over the country because of a suspected bomb alert, state news agency BelTA said. The alert later turned out to be false.'STANDING ALONE'Protasevich, 26 was immediately separated on arrival in Minsk and checks of luggage using sniffer dogs turned up nothing."We saw that Roman was stopped due to some things in the luggage," Mantas said, adding that the other passengers also had their luggage checked and were taken by bus to the terminal where they spent several hours waiting to reboard the plane."We saw from the window that Roman is standing alone, and one policeman with dog was trying to find something (in his luggage)."Another passenger, who also did not give his name, told Lithuanian media that Protasevich had identified himself to Belarusian security officials on arrival. "I saw how his passport was taken away. He took off his mask and said: 'I'm so-and-so and I'm the reason why all this is going on.'"The European Union called for Protasevich's immediate release, with the head of the EU's executive European Commission and the Polish prime minister describing the incident as a hijacking.The other passengers looked weary on arrival in Vilnius, with Mantas saying they had spent hours in queues for luggage and passport checks in Minsk before being allowed into a lounge to await takeoff.He said he could not be sure if Protasevich's companion, who took the laptop and phone, had also been detained in Minsk, but there appeared to be more empty seats on the final Minsk-Vilnius journey than when it took off from Athens."It means that more than one person was (taken) out of the plane - but (it's) difficult to say exactly."Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told a news conference late on Sunday that Protasevich's female companion had also not re-embarked the flight from Minsk to Vilnius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minutes-to-touchdown-the-moment-a-belarusian-dissident-knew-his-time-was-up-101621832297542.html
24-05-2021||World||China accuses US of hyping theory Coronavirus escaped from lab in Wuhan||China accused the US of promoting theories that the coronavirus escaped from a high-security lab in Wuhan, as a fresh report about sick workers at the facility prompted Beijing to reaffirm denials.“The report that you mentioned about three people getting sick, that is not true,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing Monday in Beijing. Zhao was responding to a Wall Street Journal report that a trio of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology -- a lab in the city where the first Covid-19 outbreak was identified -- had fallen ill and sought hospital care in November 2019.The facility has previously denied claims of workers getting sick, including a US State Department fact sheet publish in January that asserts that several researchers from the institute became sick in autumn 2019. Zhao said the US has been hyping the lab-leak theory.China has sought to frame the claims as conspiracy theories created to divert attention from the US government’s own handling of the coronavirus, and suggested that the Fort Detrick military base in Maryland should be investigated.While the World Health Organization-led investigation in China earlier this year found it was “extremely unlikely” the coronavirus came from a laboratory leak, scientists have sought more data from China on early cases. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said following the probe that it didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab accident, adding that he is ready to deploy additional resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-hyping-theory-coronavirus-escaped-from-lab-in-wuhan-101621845683204.html
24-05-2021||World||Pressure to accept China vaccines intensifies as Taiwan battles Covid-19 surge||A surge in domestic Covid-19 cases in Taiwan after months of relative safety is intensifying pressure on the government to accept vaccines from China, as the island has vaccinated just 1% of the population with no immediate sign of new shots arriving.The Chinese-claimed island and Beijing have repeatedly sparred over the pandemic since it began.Taipei accuses Beijing of spreading fake news and preventing its full participation at the World Health Organization, while Beijing says Taipei is playing political games with its people's lives by refusing Chinese vaccines.Taiwan has only received about 700,000 vaccine doses to date, all from AstraZeneca Plc, which are rapidly running out. It has millions more on order, including from Moderna Inc.Over the weekend, Hung Hsiu-chu, a former head of Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said the government should allow in Chinese vaccines as soon as possible, saying that they are internationally accepted and that Taiwan cannot wait."At this moment, lives are at stake, and we respectfully tell the Tsai government: the real enemy is the virus, not the mainland," she said, referring to President Tsai Ing-wen.The KMT, always wary of being painted as pro-China, has not explicitly backed or rejected the idea, but has called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) not to tar as Communist Party sympathisers those who are trying to obtain more vaccines.Pressure is growing from industry too to address the issue, especially after China's Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said on Saturday it was willing to provide Taiwan with BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccines.A source familiar with the situation said major Apple Inc supplier Foxconn was exploring directly approaching Fosun for the shots to vaccinate its employees and their families, though the company had not formally started discussions with the Chinese firm or Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre.Fosun has 10 million shots that are expiring in August and is anxious to offload them, the source added. Fosun did not respond to requests for comment.Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, told Reuters that information on vaccines should come from the command centre."If we can do what we can to prevent the epidemic in Taiwan, then our company is willing to assist," it added.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said on Sunday that if companies wanted to buy vaccines they had to talk to his ministry.Chen has said that China has not provided enough evidence that its vaccines are safe, and that most Taiwanese would not want to take them anyway. Chen has also said the law prohibiting the imports of any Chinese vaccine would need to be revised.Beijing has called on Taiwan to cast aside political prejudices."Most Taiwanese compatriots are eagerly anticipating the use of mainland vaccines," China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement to Reuters, without offering evidence. "The pressing task is to remove artificial political obstacles on the island."Taiwan's government has kept vaccine purchase details under close wraps, but has promised more are on the way.Chen met virtually with his US counterpart, Xavier Becerra, last week and discussed vaccines, but no announcements of any US help have come yet, even after President Joe Biden said the country would release stocks to other parts of the world.However, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the United States was trying to help speed up deliveries of the vaccines Taiwan has already ordered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-to-accept-china-vaccines-intensifies-as-taiwan-battles-covid-19-surge-101621842907819.html
24-05-2021||World||World Health Assembly under lens as demand for fuller probe into China link to Covid-19 grows||Amidst a US intelligence report that advocates a larger probe into the possibility that the Covid-19 virus could have leaked from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, the World Health Assembly is meeting today to pass an anodyne resolution on setting up of an inter-governmental working group to further discuss the submitted three reports investigating the origins of the global pandemic and take further action. The WHA may also consider a global pandemic treaty to plug the gaps found by the three reports and make it legally binding on nations to prevent any future pandemic outbreak.According to diplomats based in Geneva, not much is expected out of the WHA except for a resolution and asking the WHO instituted group of experts to launch the second phase of investigation into the origins of the virus as the experts in its report had given a clean pass to Wuhan laboratory for possible leakage of the deadly virus. The group of experts had pointed fingers towards a zoonotic origin and possible leakage through food packaging. "Under the Presidentship of Bhutan, the WHA will meet at 10am today (1.30pm IST). Not much is expected from the deliberations despite 1.6 billion people have been affected and 3.4 million people have lost their lives to the disease," said a diplomat.The WHA meeting comes at a time when Wall Street Journal has reported that three researchers of the China’s Wuhan Institute became so sick that they had to be admitted to the hospital in November 2019. A State Department fact sheet had earlier said that several researchers at the lab developed symptoms "consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness," WSJ reported.The report further provides fresh details on the number of researchers affected, the timing of their illnesses, and their hospital visits.The Wall Street Journal reported that the current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment.One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration.Another person described the intelligence as stronger. "The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn't tell you was exactly why they got sick," he said, referring to the researchers, according to the report.The WHO report on the origins of coronavirus was released in March and concluded it is "extremely unlikely that coronavirus, which has killed millions across the world, originated in a lab in China".The report found that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario."Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover (from animals to humans) both remain viable, more investigation is needed to determine the origins of the pandemic," the letter from the WHO scientists who visited Wuhan in February read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wha-under-lens-as-demands-for-fuller-probe-into-china-link-to-covid-19-grows-101621840459052.html

The vaccination programme also came as a ray of hope for many," Lyonchhen said adding "But look where we are today."He said that it was inevitable that Bhutan too felt the impact of the worsening situation in the region, adding that despite all the preparations, there was no guarantee that the country would not experience what India was going through."The threat from the southern borders has now reached the east. If we are not careful, we will suffer the same fate as our neighbours." he said during his address.Lyonchhen said that this was because the SARS-CoV-2 virus was fast mutating and it was becoming more transmissible and overwhelming. He said that the country was being slowly surrounded from all corners and if adequate control measures were not put in place and if people did not adhere to the preventive measures, the country would be overwhelmed within no time."We will be wiped out in no time if we cannot control the spread now," the prime minister said.Meanwhile, Trashigang town was put under a lockdown starting at 7 pm on May 21. All flights to the Yonphula domestic airport were also suspended.The country reported 1,392 positive Covid-19 cases with one death so far, as per World Health Organisation on Sunday. A total of 482,038 vaccine doses have been administered during the said period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/well-be-wiped-out-if-we-can-t-control-covid-now-bhutan-pm-101621833604006.html
24-05-2021||World||Viral video drew hundreds to California party; 149 arrested||A birthday party invitation that went viral on TikTok brought hundreds of people to a raucous celebration on a Southern California beach Saturday night, prompting police to declare an unlawful assembly and arrest nearly 150 people after they refused orders to disperse.The massive gathering began with a now-deleted video posted on the popular social media app from a user named adrian.lopez517, who invited anyone to his birthday party by Huntington Beach's fire pits Saturday night, The Orange County Register reported Sunday. The hashtag “AdriansKickBack” received more than 180 million views on TikTok.One partygoer told a New York Times reporter: “It's the first lit party since Covid.”At least 400 people showed up to a pre-party Friday evening around a lifeguard tower, police Lt. Brian Smith said. When people in the crowd began to launch fireworks near the fire pits, he said, officers declared an unlawful assembly and the partygoers scattered.Huntington Beach's police department announced the next day that they were preparing for a surge of visitors due to the promoted party and warned that they will enforce local rules, including no alcohol or drug use on the beach and no fireworks.But an even larger crowd overtook the beach Saturday evening. Police estimated that at least 2,500 people gathered at the beach before moving to the downtown area. Videos posted on social media showed fistfights breaking out, people jumping from the Huntington Beach Pier's pedestrian bridge to a cheering crowd below, people jumping atop slow-moving cars and shooting more fireworks.Officers again ordered the crowd to disperse and issued an overnight curfew as they received backup from other law enforcement agencies. Video footage shows officers dressed in riot helmets shutting streets to control the crowd and, in some instances, firing less-lethal rounds. Police said some people threw bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers.A woman dining at Duke's Hawaiian restaurant by the pier said she heard fireworks while she was eating, and when she went to the window to see what was happening she saw hundreds of people running away from the beach.“People climbing walls and screaming, more and more fireworks, mobs running. They were asking us to let them in the restaurant, banging on the windows,” Sonya Gronning said. “When we went to leave there was a wall of police protecting the restaurant.”The people arrested included 121 adults and 28 juveniles who were booked for vandalism, illegally setting fireworks, failing to disperse and violating curfews, said police spokeswoman Jennifer Carey.A number of downtown businesses, police vehicles and a lifeguard tower were damaged, but no significant injuries were reported, she said.Huntington Beach, which connects a vibrant business district to an 8-mile (13-kilometer) stretch of sand, has been the site of large gatherings in the last year as pandemic-related restrictions, the 2020 presidential election and the Black Lives Matter movement drew protesters who sometimes clashed with police in the downtown area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/viral-video-drew-hundreds-to-california-party-149-arrested-101621832660596.html

Hundreds died then and more than 100,000 people were left homeless. But in outlying villages closer to the volcano, Sunday was marked by grief and uncertainty.Also Read | Indian peacekeepers help civilians evacuate after volcano erupts in CongoAline Bichikwebo and her baby managed to escape when the lava flow reached her village, but said both her mother and father were among those who perished. Community members gave a provisional toll of 10 dead in Bugamba alone, though provincial authorities said it was too soon to know how many lives were lost.Bichikwebo says she tried to rescue her father but wasn't strong enough to move him to safety before the family's home was ignited by lava.“I am asking for help because everything we had is gone,” she said, clutching her baby. “We don’t even have a pot. We are now orphans and we have nothing.”The air remained thick with smoke because of how many homes had caught fire when the lava came.“People are still panicking and are hungry,” resident Alumba Sutoye said. “They don’t even know where they are going to spend the night.”Elsewhere, authorities said at least five other people had died in a truck crash while they were trying to evacuate Goma, but the scale of the loss had yet to be determined in some of the hardest-hit communities.Residents said there was little warning before the dark sky turned a fiery red, sending people running for their lives in all directions. One woman went into labor and gave birth while fleeing the eruption to Rwanda, the national broadcaster there said.Smoke rose from smoldering heaps of lava in the Buhene area near the city Sunday.“We have seen the loss of almost an entire neighborhood," Innocent Bahala Shamavu said. “All the houses in Buhene neighborhood were burned and that’s why we are asking all the provincial authorities and authorities at the national level as well as all the partners, all the people of good faith in the world, to come to the aid of this population.”Elsewhere, witnesses said lava had engulfed one highway connecting Goma with the city of Beni. However, the airport appeared to be spared the same fate as 2002 when lava flowed onto the runways.Goma is a regional hub for many humanitarian agencies in the region, as well as the U.N. peacekeeping mission. While Goma is home to many U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers, much of surrounding eastern Congo is under threat from myriad armed groups vying for control of the region’s mineral resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-15-killed-in-volcanic-eruption-in-congo-over-500-homes-destroyed-101621831892775.html

They have much better weapons than us."He said the Myanmar military had launched helicopter air strikes in the evening at Demoso, a town in Kayah state about 40 kilometres south.Another civilian fighter at Demoso said at least 13 Myanmar soldiers had been killed Sunday, while four of his men were wounded."We intended to seize their police station, but they used air strikes and we could not stop their reinforcement trucks getting into the town," he said."We had to withdraw our troops from fighting."The fighting continued through Sunday night, according to a senior leader of the Karenni National Progressive Party -- an ethnic armed group with a stronghold in Kayah state.He confirmed that the military was using tanks, helicopters and mortar attacks in Demoso and Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state.Meanwhile, military chief Min Aun Hlaing, who removed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi from power in the coup, gave a two-hour interview to Hong Kong's Phoenix Television, with the full programme yet to air.In a snippet released Sunday, he offered reassurances to Chinese investors after a spate of arson attacks at factories in the commercial capital Yangon."Our citizens don't hate China," he said. "It happened for political reasons."Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since she was placed under house arrest.She has been hit with a string of criminal charges including flouting coronavirus restrictions during last year's election campaign and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies.Suu Kyi is expected to appear in person in court on Monday for the first time, after weeks of delays to her legal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-and-soldiers-killed-in-eastern-myanmar-amid-heavy-fighting-101621825320326.html
24-05-2021||World||George Floyd's family holds rally, march in brother's memory||Members of George Floyd’s family, and others who lost loved ones to police encounters, joined activists and citizens in Minneapolis on Sunday for a march that was one of several events planned nationwide to mark the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death.Hundreds of people gathered for the rally in front of the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis where the Chauvin trial concluded a month ago, many carrying signs with pictures of Floyd, Philando Castile and other Black men killed by police.Amid chants of “no justice, no peace!” and “Say his name,” Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter watched alongside a dozen of Floyd's family members as speakers called for justice for families of Black men slain by police.“It has been a long year. It has been a painful year,” Floyd's sister Bridgett told the crowd on Sunday. “It has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye — I still don't know why.”Tuesday will mark one year since Floyd, who was Black, died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Chauvin, who is white, has since been convicted of murder and manslaughter for Floyd’s death, which sparked worldwide protests and calls for change in policing in the U.S.Speakers at the event included several local activists, Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who called on the U.S. Senate to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation, which would bring about the most significant changes to policing on the federal level, would ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.“We want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law,” Sharpton said. “There's been an adjournment on justice for too long. It's time for them to vote and make this the law.”The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit based in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where Floyd was born, is hosting a series of events in Minneapolis this weekend and early next week to honor Floyd on the anniversary. Those events include the rally and a march downtown on Sunday that will be led by Floyd’s family and other families of victims of police violence.The nonprofit was launched by Floyd’s siblings in September 2020 to help combat racial inequities in Black and brown communities in their brother’s honor.Other events in Minneapolis ahead of the anniversary include a virtual “day of action” that encourages people to organize remotely and two panels with the families and other activists on Monday, followed by a community festival and candlelight vigil on Tuesday.In New York on Sunday, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, attended a Brooklyn gathering in his brother’s memory organized by Sharpton and told supporters not to forget his brother or victims of racist violence.“If you keep my brother’s name ringing, you’re going to keep everybody else’s name ringing,” Terrence Floyd said. “Breonna Taylor, Sean Bell, Ahmaud Arbery, you could go through the whole list. There’s a lot of them.”Executive director Jacari Harris said the group has received donations from the Minneapolis Foundation, Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation and athletic shoe and apparel retailer Finish Line, among others. Despite large grants from corporations and other organizations, Harris the average donation to the nonprofit was $47.Harris said the group has also funded an initiative in Fayetteville to help reduce homelessness, a scholarship program for law school students and an internship program at Texas A&M University, where Floyd went to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-george-floyd-s-family-holds-rally-march-in-brother-s-memory-101621817657320.html
24-05-2021||World||Michigan governor Whitmer 'sorry' for violating social distancing guidelines||Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer apologized Sunday after apparently violating state-mandated social distancing guidelines at an East Lansing bar and grill.It was the latest pandemic-related misstep for the Democratic governor, who waited weeks to disclose partial details of a private jet trip she took to visit her father in Florida after two of her top aides headed south as coronavirus cases surged in in Michigan and residents were cautioned against traveling south for spring break.A photo circulated on social media of Whitmer with a large group of unmasked people at an East Lansing bar-restaurant, The Landshark Bar & Grill, the Detroit Free Pres s reported Sunday. The Free Press reported that photo, which shows Whitmer seated with about a dozen, was posted on social media by one of the attendees, but later deleted.“Throughout the pandemic, I’ve been committed to following public health protocols,” Whitmer said in a statement Sunday. “Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant. As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together. Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it. In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.”Michigan restaurants and bars remain subject to capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Current orders require six people or fewer at tables and distances of 6 feet (1.83 meters) between tables.Whitmer, who received her second vaccination dose April 29, is considered fully vaccinated. But she is not the first public official to draw criticism for defying pandemic-related rules.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who won plaudits for issuing the first statewide stay-at-home order in the U.S. back in March, 2020, later drew criticism after he broke the state rules. Newsom and his wife were caught dining with 10 others at the posh French Laundry restaurant in Napa in early November with lobbyists and others from numerous different households, sitting close together, mask-less.Newsom quickly apologized, saying he “made a bad mistake” but noting the gathering was outdoors. Within days, photos emerged showing the group in a room that was enclosed on three sides with a sliding glass door on the other, maybe meeting the technical definition of outdoors, but perhaps not the spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-governor-whitmer-sorry-for-violating-social-distancing-guidelines-101621816176895.html
24-05-2021||World||Outrage as Belarus forces plane to land, arrests journalist on board||The U.S. and Europe reacted with outrage after Belarus ordered a Ryanair Holdings Plc flight transiting its airspace to land and arrested a journalist on board, an unprecedented violation of European air travel protocols.“The United States strongly condemns the forced diversion of a flight between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Roman Pratasevich,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.“Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation.”The forced landing drew sharp and unified condemnation from across the European Union, with France and Greece, Poland and Germany among those rushing to express their anger. Further sanctions on Minsk may result. EU leaders due to meet in Brussels for a two-day summit starting Monday will discuss the consequences of what EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called an “unacceptable” action.Europe’s fury was triggered after a Boeing Co. 737-800 carrying scores of passengers from Athens to Vilnius was diverted to the Belarusian capital on Sunday under the escort of a Mig-29 fighter jet. The plane’s crew was notified by authorities in Minsk of a “potential security threat on board,” a Ryanair spokeswoman said. Once in Minsk, authorities arrested a journalist who covered protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, whose election to a sixth term last year was internationally disputed.Authorities boarded the plane and arrested Pratasevich, the former editor-in-chief of one the most popular Telegram news channels in Belarus. Pratasevich wasn’t on the plane when it was allowed to take off again for Vilnius, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said in a recorded statement.“This is a serious and dangerous incident, which requires international investigation,” NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter.A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry in Minsk declined to comment.Potential measures when EU leaders meet could include sanctions against individuals and entities, suspending all flights by EU airlines over Belarus, banning Minsk’s carrier Belavia from landing at airports in the bloc, and the suspension of all transit, including ground travel, between Belarus and the EU, according to an official familiar with the discussions. The steps would be on top of a sanctions package Brussels was already working on and was aiming to present next month.A post-election crackdown by Lukashenko’s administration on the opposition already resulted in U.S. and EU sanctions and pushed the president, in office since 1994, closer to Russia. Sunday’s events risk deepening the international isolation of a country that former U.S. Secretary State of Condoleezza Rice referred to in 2006 during a visit to Lithuania as the last dictatorship in Europe.The latest incident has the potential to influence already strained ties between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as the two leaders move toward a potential first summit as soon as next month.Lukashenko is slated to meet with Putin this week in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Rossiya-1 television reported Sunday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t respond to a request for comment after hours in Moscow.U.S. State Department officials have been talking to Brussels, Vilnius and Athens all day long, according to a person familiar with the diplomacy who asked not to be named talking about internal discussions.Lukashenko gave an unconditional order to turn the plane around, the state news service Belta said, citing the unofficial Pool Pervogo telegram channel, which is widely seen as run by people close to the presidential press service.An adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Pratasevich, 26, had been bundled off the flight in Minsk by police. “At first he panicked, then calmed down a bit, but still was trembling,” Franak Viacorka said on Twitter, citing passengers. “He said he’ll face the death penalty here. He was taken aside, his belongings dumped on the runway.”Pratasevich and his NEXTA colleague Stsiapan Putsila were accused of organizing mass unrest and group actions severely violating public order, the Investigative Committee said on Nov. 5. They were also accused of stirring “social hatred” against law enforcers via their Telegram channels.Nauseda called the Ryanair forced landing an unprecedented “kidnapping of a person by use of military force” and urged NATO and the EU to react to the threat posed by the Belarusian leadership to civil aviation.Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Belarus’s neighbor Poland, urged sanctions against Lukashenko for committing an “act of state terrorism.” Greece called it a “state hijacking.”German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass denounced Belarus’s actions, saying that forcing a plane to land under the pretext of a bomb threat was a “severe interference into civil aviation travel.”“Such an act cannot remain without consequences from the side of the European Union,“ Maas said.There were conflicting reports of the number of people who were on board. The foreign ministries of Greece and Lithuania said there were 171 passengers from at least 18 countries. The Belarusian state news agency Belta reported that there were 123 passengers.Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte arrived at the airport in Vilnius with a prosecutor to question the arriving passengers, and the prime minister announced an investigation.U.S. lawmakers joined with counterparts from seven other countries in calling for an inquiry by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization into a “clear violation of free transit between states and the threats to the aircraft.”“Until ICAO has reported, we call for Belarus to be suspended from the organization and a ban on all overflight of Belarus including flights to and from the country,” Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.Blinken said the Biden administration supports the earliest possible meeting of the ICAO to review Sunday’s events.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-as-belarus-forces-plane-to-land-arrests-journalist-on-board-101621815603291.html
24-05-2021||World||12 killed, 49 injured in weekend spate of US shootings||A dozen people were killed and about 50 injured in shootings across the United States over the weekend, after President Joe Biden last month branded the country's gun violence an "epidemic."The spate of shooting incidents included deaths in New Jersey, South Carolina, Georgia, Ohio and Minnesota.In total, the attacks claimed 12 lives and wounded at least 49 others.Two people died when gunfire broke out at a house party in Camden, New Jersey on Saturday night, and at least 12 people were injured, according to police.In South Carolina, one 14-year-old girl was killed and 14 people wounded at a concert.Police in Atlanta, Georgia, found three gunshot victims early Sunday after responding to a call about shots fired. All three victims were pronounced dead at the scene, US media reported.Three others were killed and eight injured outside a bar in Youngstown, Ohio, early Sunday morning, while a 16-year-old girl was killed and seven people injured in a park in Columbus.A deadly shooting also occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the night before supporters and relatives of George Floyd, the Black man killed by a white former police officer last spring, held a march Sunday on the first anniversary of his death.One person was killed and eight injured, with one victim in critical condition.Minneapolis police told AFP that one suspect in the shooting had been arrested, while a second suspect had died.The United States has suffered a series of mass shootings in recent months, including at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, an office building in California, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado -- as well as a birthday party in the same city a few weeks later -- and at several spas in Atlanta.Biden has introduced six executive measures aimed at tamping down the crisis, including a proposed rule to halt "ghost guns," as firearms built from home kits are known, and boosting support for agencies involved in tackling community violence.In addition to mass shootings, gun violence in general -- including less-publicized incidents often involving family members or acquaintances -- has surged across the United States last year.Gun sales jumped at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, 2020 was one of the most violent years in the United States in decades.So far this year, there have been at least 200 mass shootings in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-killed-in-weekend-spate-of-us-shootings-101621815208053.html

The person was not authorized to discuss the plan by name and requested anonymity.The Pentagon announced earlier in the week that an extension of the Guard presence — 2,149 troops — had not been requested.The planned departure came as Democrats and Republicans sparred over how to fund fortifications of the Capitol and whether to form an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the attack that sought to overturn former President Donald Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Some Republican lawmakers have begun downplaying the event despite the handful of deaths, injuries to scores of police officers, hundreds of arrests, damages to the building and shouted threats against lawmakers from many of those who stormed the building. Much of the violence was caught on camera.Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who oversaw a security review in the wake of the rioting, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the Capitol itself will be secured by Capitol Police but that the complex will remain closed to the general public because of the strain on the police force.“God bless the National Guard,” Honore said. “They've done significant work.”The House on Thursday approved — by a single vote largely along party lines — a $1.9 billion measure to fortify the Capitol. The next day the House approved with 35 Republican votes the formation of an investigative commission. Both measures face an uncertain future in the evenly divided Senate.Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he opposes the commission proposal, which would need significant Republican support to advance under Senate rules. Republican opponents say the commission would become a political tool as midterms elections approach, though the proposal requires its work to be concluded by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-mission-to-provide-security-at-capitol-set-to-conclude-101621814522572.html
24-05-2021||World||Suez Canal ship fiasco: Court decision stalled as dispute over fault continues||An Egyptian appeals court on Sunday said it lacks jurisdiction to look into the Suez Canal Authority’s demands to uphold financial claims that led to the the seizure of the massive Ever Given ship after it blocked the waterway in March.The authority and the ship's owner are in dispute as to whose fault it was that the ship ran aground in the canal linking the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea - and how much compensation should be paid.The appeals chamber of the Ismailia Economic Court referred the case to a lower court to decide on the legality of the seizure of the Ever Given until the settlement of compensation claim between the the Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the ship’s Japanese owner, according to Hazem Barakat, a lawyer representing the vessel’s owner.The Ever Given was on its way to the Dutch port of Rotterdam on March 23 when it slammed into the bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.A massive effort by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, freed the skyscraper-sized ship six days later, ending the crisis and allowing hundreds of waiting vessels to pass through the canal. The Suez Canal Authority on Sunday revealed for the first time that a salvage boat capsized during the operation, leaving one worker dead.Since it was freed, the Panama-flagged vessel, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, has been ordered by authorities to remain in a holding lake mid-canal as its owner and the canal authority try to settle the compensation dispute.At first, the Suez Canal Authority demanded $916 million in compensation, which was later lowered to $550 million, the head of the canal authority, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, said in comments on a television program on Sunday.The compensation amount would account for the salvage operation, costs of stalled canal traffic and lost transit fees for the week the Ever Given blocked the canal.The ship’s technical management company, Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement, said in April the Suez Canal Authority had not provided a detailed justification for the compensation claim, calling it “extraordinarily large.”The Suez Canal Authority said it provided documents detailing the compensation amount. It did not provide additional details.Barakat, the lawyer, said the next court hearing on the case will take place on May 29.In a separate lawsuit, the appeals chamber rejected Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd.' appeal against a lower court decision to bound the vessel until solving the financial dispute.On Saturday, lawyers representing the ship's owners blamed the canal authority for the vessel’s grounding, claiming that the canal authorities did not provide evidence faulting the ship’s crew. They also argued that the canal authority should not have allowed the he vessel to sail in the waterway amid bad weather.Evergreen Marine Corp., a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, had said that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea.Barakat said the Voyage Data Recorder, also known as a vessel’s black box, had recorded a debate between canal pilots and its control center over whether it should allowed to transit the canal. There were two pilots from the canal authority aboard the vessel to guide it when the grounding happened.Barakat also confirmed that the vessel’s owners, had, for their part, demanded $100,000 in initial compensation for losses related to its seizure.The canal has repeatedly denied wrongdoings. It said in a statement Sunday that that while its pilots typically board ships to guide them through the waterway, the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel and that the pilots' role is an advisory one.The six-day blockage disrupted global shipment. Some ships were forced to take the long alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, requiring additional fuel and other costs. Hundreds of other ships waited in place for the blockage to end.About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, a pivotal source of foreign currency to Egypt. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-ship-fiasco-court-decision-stalled-as-dispute-over-fault-continues-101621800337882.html
24-05-2021||World||UN urges 'political process' amid Gaza reconstruction||A UN official in war-battered Gaza Sunday called for a "genuine political process" to avert further bloodshed, after the military conflict between Israel and Islamist group Hamas that ravaged the Palestinian enclave.As thousands of Gazans slowly tried to piece back together their lives, top UN staff visited the territory after an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire Friday halted 11 days of mutual bombardment, where they warned of the deep psychological trauma of the violence.On Sunday, in a badly-damaged district of Gaza city, volunteers swept up clouds of dust at the feet of collapsed buildings, while others shovelled debris onto the back of a donkey-drawn cart.Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip since May 10 have killed more than 200 Palestinians, rendered thousands homeless and laid waste to buildings and key infrastructure across the blockaded territory.It was the latest such bombardment to hit the crowded coastal strip of some two million people, after three previous wars with Israel since 2008.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the reconstruction needed to go hand in hand with efforts to create "a different political environment"."We need to have a genuine focus on human development," on proper access to education, jobs and livelihoods, he said."But this needs to be accompanied by a genuine political process".Speaking earlier to a group of journalists, he said "the layers of hardship in Gaza keep getting thicker", because the root causes of the conflict have not been addressed.- 'No pause to breathe' -US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking ahead of an imminent trip to the region, reaffirmed Washington's support for a two-state solution so Israelis and Palestinians can live "with equal measures of security, of peace and dignity".Israeli strikes on Gaza killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and have wounded over 1,900 people, the Gaza health ministry says.Rockets from Gaza claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, an Israeli soldier, one Indian, and two Thai nationals, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel have been wounded.There is controversy about how many of those killed in Gaza were combatants, and how many were civilians. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the bombing campaign had killed "more than 200 terrorists" in Gaza.Lynn Hastings, of the UN aid agency OCHA, said the intense bombing had devastated people's mental health.During the last war in 2014, "we had humanitarian pauses, where people were able to get out," she said."That really speaks to the amount of trauma that was experienced this time, where there was absolutely no pause for people to breathe."The comments that I have heard are not 'I need access to water' -- even though there are 800,000 people who don't have access to clean water right now -- but about the impacts on their lives overall and how they are ever going to recover from this," she said.- 'Here is my home' -Sitting drinking coffee under an olive tree near his destroyed house in Gaza, Abou Yahya was furious."If I had 50 sons, I would tell them to go and fight Israel," he said.An Israeli air strike hit his home last week, reducing it to rubble, and he has vowed to sleep on top of the debris."My family has asked me to leave it, not to sleep here, but I won't budge," he said. "Here is my home".Authorities have begun distributing tents and mattresses in the Gaza Strip, as the UN said at least 6,000 people had been made homeless by the bombardment.Lorries bringing much-needed medicine, food and fuel entered Gaza Friday through the Kerem Shalom crossing after Israel reopened it.Peace talks have stalled since 2014, including over the status of occupied east Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.The latest military escalation started after violent clashes in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, which is also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.Israeli forces had moved in on Palestinian worshippers at the site, toward the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.They had also sought to quell protests against the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, to make way for Jewish settlers.The clashes prompted Hamas to launch rockets from Gaza towards Israel on May 10, and Israel responded with air strikes.On Sunday, Jewish visitors entered the Al-Aqsa compound for the first time in about three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-political-process-amid-gaza-reconstruction-101621800360433.html

In a recent conversation with Oprah in the series, he told that Markle did not act on suicidal impulses while pregnant with their son because she did not want her husband (Harry) to be hurt by the loss of "another woman" in his life."The thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now be put in a position of losing another woman in my life, with a baby inside of her, our baby," he said, as per Page Six.In the interview with Oprah, Harry further claimed that Markle did not go through with suicide because she did not want the history to repeat itself."The scariest thing for her was her clarity of thought. She hadn't 'lost it, she wasn't crazy, she wasn't self-medicating, be it through pills or through alcohol. She was absolutely sober. She was completely sane. Yet in the quiet of the night, these thoughts woke her up," the duke told Oprah.Harry also admitted that he did not go to his family to seek help because he was ashamed of the situation and felt the royals would likely not be able to help."That was one of the biggest reasons to leave, feeling trapped and feeling controlled through fear, both by the media and by the system itself, which never encouraged the talking about this kind of trauma. Certainly, now I will never be bullied into silence" said Harry, as per Page Six.On a related note, the 'The Me You Can't See' series announcement came after Harry and his wife Meghan Markle stepped away from their roles within the royal family and relocated to California in 2020.

24-05-2021||World||Israel reopens borders to small groups of foreign tourists||Israel reopened its borders to foreign tourists on Sunday after a fall in Covid-19 infections but said it would take time for visitors to start arriving and to revive the tourism industry.Under an easing of coronavirus restrictions, the government went ahead with a plan to start letting in small groups of tourists from countries using vaccines it has approved.Foreign airlines are also resuming flights they suspended when Palestinian militants began rocket attacks on Israel this month. A ceasefire has now halted the fighting, helping the government meet Sunday's target date for starting the plan.But registration for the Tourism Ministry's plan opened only last week, so the number of visitors will initially be limited."It is unlikely that the first groups will arrive before the beginning of June," a Tourism Ministry spokeswoman said.Tourism in 2019 hit a record high of 4.55 million visitors, contributing 23 billion shekels ($7.1 billion) to Israel's economy, mainly via small and mid-sized businesses.Under a pilot programme due to continue until June 15, Israel gave the green light to visits by 20 groups of between 5 and 30 tourists from countries including the United States, Britain and Germany.Another 20 groups were chosen to be on standby if any of the first 20 tour operators did not meet Israel's conditions.Tourism Minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen said the ministry was working to allow more tourists to enter to "rehabilitate the tourism industry and bring hundreds of thousands of people back into the workforce".Israeli authorities believe that initially limiting tourism to small groups is the best way to monitor and contain the spread of Covid-19, especially new variants. The plan is to boost the number of groups in June and allow individual tourists to start visiting in July.Visitors will need to show negative PCR tests before flying and to undergo further tests on arrival.Israel has fully vaccinated about 55% of its population and Covid-19 cases have dropped sharply.El Al Israel Airlines Chairman David Brodet said separately on Sunday that he would step down. The government approved a $210 million bailout package for El Al this month that was conditional on steep spending cuts and the airline's owners injecting more cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reopens-borders-to-small-groups-of-foreign-tourists-101621768314400.html
24-05-2021||India||'Need more information': WHO tells Bharat Biotech for Covaxin emergency use listing||The World Health Organisation (WHO) said “more information” is “required” from Bharat Biotech, which is seeking emergency use listing (EUL) for its Covaxin vaccine for Covid-19.The latest ‘Status of Covid-19 Vaccines within WHO EUL/PQ evaluation process’ guidance document dated May 18 on the WHO website said Bharat Biotech submitted EOI (Expression of Interest) on April 19 and that “More information required”. A pre-submission meeting is expected “to be planned May-June 2021,” the guidance document said.According to the WHO, submissions to it for prequalification or listing under the emergency use procedure are confidential.If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, WHO will publish the results widely. Duration of the emergency use listing process depends on the quality of the data submitted by the vaccine manufacturer and on those data meeting WHO criteria, according to the agency.Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) has conveyed to the government that it has already submitted 90 per cent of documents to WHO for obtaining emergency use listing (EUL) for the Covaxin vaccine, sources said on Monday.The remaining documents are expected to be submitted by June, the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech Ltd told the Central government during a discussion on obtaining the World Health Organisation's authorisation for emergency use listing for Covaxin, sources said."BBIL is confident about obtaining WHO's emergency use listing," said a source.Noting that Covaxin has already received regulatory approval from 11 countries, sources said there was also interest from other 11 companies in seven nations for technology transfer and production of Covaxin.The company is in the final stages of negotiations with the Food and Drug Administration of the US for conducting small-scale phase-III clinical trials of Covaxin in the United States, sources said.Sources said the meeting with BBIL on the EUL was attended by the company's managing director V Krishna Mohan and his colleagues besides senior officers of the Ministry of Health, Department of Biotechnology and Ministry of External Affairs.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was among those who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-more-information-who-tells-bharat-biotech-for-covaxin-emergency-use-listing-101621880247795.html

The facility is also equipped with oxygen concentrators.He requested Modi to talk to the farmers immediately to resolve all their grievances and said there is no scope for "egos" in a democracy.Only "dictatorships adopted an intransigent attitude towards people", he added.The farmers have been demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops.In a statement, Badal said instead of listening to the farmers, the central government "broke" talks with them and is trying its best to break up the agitation by tiring them out."I want to state unequivocally that the SAD is a representative party of the farmers and the poor and will always stand up to support them. I urge party workers to hoist black flags on their houses on May 26 to demand justice for the farming community," the SAD chief said.On Friday, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the protest against the farm laws, had written to Modi seeking the resumption of talks.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government in the past have failed to break the deadlock over the legislations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-talk-to-agitating-farmers-urges-sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-101621880230837.html
24-05-2021||India||Stop release of Amazon Prime web series The Family Man 2, Tamil Nadu govt to Centre||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government on Monday backed groups demanding the Centre step in to stop the release of The Family Man 2 web series on Amazon Prime OTT platform. In a letter to Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, the state government said the web series “depicts the Eelam Tamils in a highly objectionable manner’. Information Technology Minister T Mano Thangaraj’s letter called the web series “condemnable” and “malicious”.The second season of the action-drama which revolves around an official of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was previously scheduled to be released in February but was deferred. It is set to be released on Amazon Prime Video on 4 June. The trailer of the second season - the first season was released in 2019 - was released last week.In a statement announcing the state government’s opposition to the The Family Man 2, the government said it was “aimed at discrediting and distorting the historical struggle of Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka.”“For example, branding Tamil speaking actress Samantha as a terrorist in the serial is directly an attack on the pride of Tamils living around the world and no one will tolerate this kind of motivated and mischievous campaign.” Samantha Akkineni plays the role of a Sri Lankan Tamil rebel in The Family Man 2, a 9-episode series.The criticism of the web series on social media started soon after the trailer was released. Soon, political parties started extending their support.The first to call for a ban on the The Family Man 2 was Tamil nationalist and chief of Tamil nationalist and Naam Tamizhar Katchi chief S Seeman who considers LTTE’s Prabhakaran as his idol. In the 2021 polls, his party emerged as the third largest after DMK and AIADMK. He said the The Family Man 2 portrayed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation and Tamils as violent people.The LTTE, founded by Velupillai Prabhakaran in 1976 to create an independent Tamil Eelam out of Sri Lanka, was banned in India after former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assasination in May 1991.“If they refuse to ban the show and if they release it country-wide to try and create a false impression about Tamil people, I warn that they will have to face dire consequences,” Seeman said in a statement last week.On Sunday, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko also wrote to Javadekar to stop the release of The Family Man 2, saying that it depicted Tamilians as terrorists and ISI agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-release-of-amazon-prime-web-series-the-family-man-2-tamil-nadu-govt-to-centre-101621879448656.html

However, the Congress has denied the allegation and claimed that the BJP is propagating a fake 'toolkit' to defame it.Last week, Twitter labelled as "manipulated media" a tweet by Patra on the alleged 'toolkit'. Twitter says it "may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-murder-freedom-of-speech-cong-on-twitter-india-office-searches-101621879231736.html

24-05-2021||India||Hisar clash: Haryana Govt agrees to withdraw cases registered against farmers||The Hisar administration on Monday agreed to withdraw cases registered against over 350 farmers after a clash escalated between them and the police on May 16 during Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s visit to inaugurate a Covid hospital.Thousands of farmers, including women and youths, on Monday started assembling at four toll plazas on the outskirts of Hisar to start a protest march in front of the divisional commissioner’s office. From there, the farmers went to Krantiman Park where a farmer, identified as Ram Chander Kharab of Uglana village, died of heart attack.As many as 4,000 rapid action force personnel and Haryana armed police staff of Bhiwani, Hisar, Sirsa, Jind, and Fatehabad were deployed to restrict the entry of protesters inside the city.Anti-riot vehicles and a wall were erected to stop the movement of farmers but the protest ended peacefully. No untoward incident was reported in district.The farmers’ march was stopped at Fawara Chowk, nearly 1km from the commissioner’s office and a 26-member farmer delegation was invited by the district administration to hold talks.Farm leaders including BKU spokesman Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Balbir Singh Rajewala, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Vikas Sisar and others moved ahead for discussion with the district officials.To avoid any mishap, Tikait led the protest and his SUV was at the forefront during the protest march.After attending the meeting with the district administration, Tikait said the administration has agreed to revoke cases registered against peasants in connection with the May 16 incident and will take legal course of action to withdraw the cases.“It was decided to withdraw cases within a month’s time. If the Hisar administration tries to betray us again, we will start a ‘pucca morcha’ here,” he said.“The administration has accepted our demand to give government job to the kin of Ram Chander, who died of heart attack during the march. We will observe black day on May 26 on completion of six months of the farm agitation. The government should accept our demands and end this deadlock,” he added.Tikait said 12 opposition parties supported them in the media but none of them sat in the tents during the agitation.Hisar SDM Jagdeep Singh said the administration and farmers have agreed to withdraw the cases registered against farmers within a month.“We have agreed to provide job to the deceased farmer’s family member on DC rate,” the SDM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hisar-clash-admn-agrees-to-withdraw-cases-registered-against-farmers-101621876569567.html
24-05-2021||India||CPEC will not affect China's stand on Kashmir issue: Zhao Lijian||China on Monday again defended its controversial USD 60 billion CPEC project with Pakistan, disregarding India's protests as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, saying it is an economic initiative and has not affected its principled stand on the Kashmir issue.Leaders of China and Pakistan have praised the progress of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in recent days as the two close allies celebrated the establishment of 70 years of their diplomatic relations.India has protested to China over the CPEC, the flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The massive infrastructure project connects China’s Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.China has been defending the CPEC, saying it is an economic project not aimed at any third country.Answering questions on the CPEC at a media briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that "since its launch, the CPEC, as an important pilot project of the BRI, has made significant and positive progress in such areas as transportation infrastructure, energy, ports and industrial parks”."At the same time, it is also actively reaching out to Afghanistan and other regional countries," he said in updated comments on Chinese Foreign Ministry website.Asked how China sees regional prosperity being furthered by the CPEC in view of India's position that it passes through Indian territory illegally occupied by Pakistan, Zhao said the project has not affected China's principled position on Kashmir."As for whether the CPEC involves the Kashmir issue, China has made it clear on many occasions that the CPEC is an economic cooperation initiative, which is not targeted at any third party, has nothing to do with disputes over territorial sovereignty, and will not affect China's principled position on the Kashmir issue," he said.On the CPEC's extension to Afghanistan, he said, "as for China's discussions with Afghanistan and other third parties on extending the CPEC, I can tell you that China, Pakistan and Afghanistan have been in communication through diplomatic and other channels"."We have also noted that Afghanistan imports and exports relevant goods through Gwadar and Karachi ports. The three parties are discussing the extension of the highway and expressway in Pakistan to Afghanistan," he said.In a message to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Pakistan diplomatic relations, President Xi Jinping said the CPEC has achieved remarkable results.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said at a high-level meeting in Islamabad that the CPEC will bring economic progress not only to Pakistan but the entire region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpec-will-not-affect-china-s-stand-on-kashmir-issue-zhao-lijian-101621876287523.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid fear making people wary of shifting to cyclone shelters in Odisha||With the Odisha government launching a massive evacuation drive to save people from the fury of Cyclone Yaas, many people in the coastal districts of Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur are reluctant to move to government shelters as they are scared of catching coronavirus, an official said.It is an enormous challenge for safeguarding people this time amid the raging pandemic, the official said."Maintaining social distancing norms while carrying out evacuation has become an uphill task. Still we are trying to convince the people not to take chances and shift to cyclone shelters and pucca houses," said the official who is monitoring evacuation work in Erasama block of Jagatsinghpur district.The seaside block was battered by the 1999 super cyclone as an estimated 10,000 people had perished then."We are planning to begin the evacuation work on Monday evening or early morning on Tuesday. There are signs of reluctance among some sections of people. The fear of getting infected with Covid-19 in cyclone shelters is bothering them."But we have sensitised the locals for adhering to Covid-protocols while evacuating people. Those who were unwilling are slowly evincing interest to shift to safer places" said Rabindra Pradhan, Block Development Officer, Rajnagar block in Kendrapara district.Around 100 people have so far been shifted to Okilopal cyclone shelter while 20 pregnant women from Talchua and Rangani were shifted to Rajnagar Community Health Centre, he said.The block administration has readied 46 cyclone shelters and 51 school buildings, he said.Around 35,000 to 40,000 are being planned to be shifted to temporary shelters."If those residing in vulnerable pockets do not volunteer, we may opt for forced evacuation because of the anticipated severity of the cyclone this time," he added.Cyclone Fani had battered coastal Odisha in May 2019. However, the evacuation exercise was not difficult as there was no Covid-19 scare then.In May last year, Odisha had faced the threat of cyclone Amphan when the state was battling the first wave of Covid-19.The cyclone had largely spared the state hitting the West Bengal coast, the authorities had not faced the challenges of massive evacuation last year.With the Covid surge being much more pronounced than last year, the fear of contracting the infection remains uppermost in peoples minds."Shifting to a shelter house is a safer option. Thats why we moved to the building in the evening hours. We are aware of the Coronavirus threat but we will abide by Covid safety protocols."Our village is quite vulnerable to tidal surge if the cyclone strikes. So we have made up our mind to battle Covid and cyclone simultaneously," said Gouranga Rout, a native of Ambiki village in Jagatsinghpur. Cyclone Yaas is likely to cross Odisha-West Bengal coast on May 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-fear-making-people-wary-of-shifting-to-cyclone-shelters-in-odisha-101621874905372.html
24-05-2021||India||‘3.6% of hospitalised Covid-19 patients had fungal, bacterial infections’: ICMR study||Just as cases of black fungus are being reported in Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic, secondary bacterial and fungal infections affected at least 3.6% (ranging from 1.7% to 28% between hospitals) of the hospitalised patient with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the last wave, found a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) published on Monday.The mortality in patients with these secondary infections increased to 56.7% as against 10.6% among the hospitalised patients in the ten network hospitals from where data was collected. The mortality in those with secondary infections was as high as 78.9% in one of the hospitals, the data shows.“What we found was that most of these secondary infections, 78% of them, were acquired at the hospital; the indication for infections started two days after hospitalisation and most of the samples had gram-negative bacteria showing that they were hospital-based infections. This could be because infection control policies at the hospitals went for a toss amidst the pandemic. Hand hygiene wasn’t as good because of double gloving and use of PPE kits in the hot weather also added to it,” said Dr Kamini Walia, corresponding author of the paper and scientist with the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the (ICMR).She added, “The most common pathogens causing the infections were Klebsiella pneumonia and Acinetobacter baumannii; usually E Coli is the most common pathogen found as per the previous ICMR reports. Both infections are very difficult to treat because they have acquired a lot of resistant genes over time. The treatment will further become difficult post-Covid. Hospitals must invest in infection control and rationalise antimicrobial prescriptions.”Interestingly, the hospitals did not report cases of the fungal infection mucormycosis, cases of which have exploded during the second wave.“We have a double whammy; Covid-19, along with the secondary infections, increases mortality significantly. We saw primarily bacterial infection as reported in the study; mucormycosis cases being reported after the second wave is largely to do with the overuse of steroids. At the peak, steroids had vanished from the market. This has never happened before; it is one of the most common medicines available,” said Dr Chand Wattal, head of the department of microbiology at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, one of the ten centres that were included in the study.More importantly, the study cautions about the increase in antimicrobial resistance in the coming years due to excessive use of stronger medicines. Around 74.4% of the total antimicrobials prescribed in the hospitals were from the Watch and Reserve category of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The WHO classifies all antibiotics in three categories – Access drugs that can treat commonly encountered pathogens and have lower resistance potential, Watch drugs that have higher resistance potential and are critical for treatment, and Reserve drugs that need to be saved as last resort for drug-resistant microbes and given only once an infection is confirmed.“Around 47% of the infections were found to be multi-drug resistant but more than 74% of the antimicrobials prescribed were from the Watch and Reserve category. And, the ten hospitals from where we have collected data are in the ICMR network, they have been trained in infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. We can only imagine what is happening in other hospitals,” said Dr Walia.“These hospitals are backed by good lab facilities and many of these antibiotics should be prescribed only after the culture test comes positive. However, a very low number of samples were collected for microbial culture,” she said.Of the 17,534 patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ten hospitals between 1 June 2020 and 30 August 2020, only 7,163 samples were sent for microbial culture – with multiple samples being from the same patients. The low sampling, doctors said, was because of the practical problems, not many healthcare workers wanted to collect these samples during the first wave when not much was known about the disease.“The sample size decreased considerably because people were scared to take the samples, especially those that generate aerosols such as lavage (a procedure where the lower respiratory tract is flushed with fluid which is collected for diagnosis). The sampling has increased now that people are aware of how to protect themselves,” said Dr Wattal.“This is the chicken or the egg situation. We use stronger antibiotics because there are many resistant infections, but because we use these antibiotics we put more pressure on the pathogens to become further resistant. Say, we send out samples of 100 patients for culture, only 40 come back positive but the others have the signs and symptoms of an infection, so we prescribe antibiotics to all depending on the type of pathogens found in the 40 samples. Second, the culture takes a couple of days but in the meantime, we have to prescribe medicines empirically. But, there is no doubt we use a lot of antibiotics,” said Dr Sumit Ray, critical care specialist from Holy Family Hospital.“We need to de-escalate once the culture report comes, we need to prescribe based on whether the infection was acquired in the community or the hospital, there should be a restricted antibiotic policy where the doctor has to explain to a committee why the higher antibiotics are being used. There have to be several levels of checks and balances,” he said. There are no guidelines on the rational use of antimicrobial in Covid-19 patients by the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/36-of-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-had-fungal-bacterial-infections-icmr-study-101621875188360.html
24-05-2021||India||FIR filed in Arunachal against Punjab man for racist remarks in YouTube video||The Arunachal Pradesh Police on Monday registered a First Information Report against a Punjab-based YouTuber for racial slurs against a former Union minister Ninong Ering and people of the northeastern state in a video uploaded on Sunday.Paras Singh’s video had gone viral soon after he uploaded the video on his YouTube channel “Paras Official” on Sunday, provoking massive outrage and support for demands for stringent action against him.In his video, Paras Singh commented that Ering, a sitting MLA, doesn’t look like an Indian and even his name “sounds foreign”. He also said people from Arunachal Pradesh don’t look like Indians and the state was probably a part of China. Paras Singh was sore that Ninong Ering had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek a ban on a gaming app called Battlegrounds Mobile India, saying it was a new version of PUBG, another game which was banned in India earlier. His YouTube channel, which focuses on video and online games, has 4,55,000 subscribers.As the chorus for action against the young Punjab man became louder, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu stepped in on Monday to announce that a FIR had been filed against him. “Based on the video that aims at inciting ill will and hatred towards the people of Arunachal Pradesh, police have already initiated action,” Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu tweeted on Monday. He said a police case under sections 124A, 153A and 505(2) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for sedition, promoting hatred or ill-will between racial or regional groups and public mischief with intention to incite a community, was registered.“Social media account of the person is being thoroughly investigated for details about his activities. Technical resources are being employed to gather his current whereabouts. Use of social media should be with due caution and any infringement will lead to action as per law,” Khandu said in another tweet. Following the reaction on social media platforms, Paras Singh deleted the video and posted a new one to apologise for his remarks. Later in the evening, his mother also posted another video to make the same point. She said her son had been picked up by some people who identified themselves as policemen and asked people to forgive “my only child”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-filed-in-arunachal-against-punjab-man-for-racist-remarks-in-youtube-video-101621873868009.html
24-05-2021||India||Bharat Biotech to provide documentation for Covaxin’s emergency use listing by June||India’s Bharat Biotech intends to provide additional documentation needed for WHO’s emergency use listing of the Covaxin vaccine by June and is in final negotiations with American authorities for conducting small-scale phase III clinical trials in the US.The status of the application for emergency use listing of Covaxin by the World Health Organization (WHO) was assessed at a virtual meeting on Monday that was joined by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, senior officials of the health ministry and Bharat Biotech managing director V Krishna Mohan.WHO’s latest update on emergency use listing (EUL) of Covid-19 vaccines, issued on May 18, shows Bharat Biotech submitted an expression of interest for EUL on April 19. The UN’s health agency sought more information from Bharat Biotech following the submission.“On the issue of WHO’s authorisation of EUL for Covaxin, Bharat Biotech officials noted that the company had submitted 90% of documentation required to WHO. The remaining is expected to be submitted in June,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Bharat Biotech is “confident about obtaining EUL, given its experience of getting its other vaccines pre-qualified by WHO,” the person added.The Hyderabad-based biotechnology company is in the final stages of negotiations with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct small-scale phase III clinical trials of Covaxin in the US, people familiar with developments said.Covaxin, billed as the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).WHO’s emergency use listing will allow countries to expedite regulatory approvals for Covaxin and also make the vaccine eligible for supply to the WHO-backed COVAX facility, which was set up to distribute vaccines to low and middle-income nations.The external affairs and health ministries are playing key roles in facilitating the EUL of Covaxin. A total of 19 firms from around the world have sought EUL for their vaccines from WHO, and the listing has been finalised for seven applicants, including the Serum Institute of India (SII) which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine with the brand name Covishield.The matter has gained urgency after several countries, especially the 27 members of the European Union, announced they would allow the entry of fully vaccinated travellers. While the AstraZeneca vaccine is among those approved by these countries, Covaxin doesn’t figure on their list.“It is important to note that no country has instituted a vaccine passport. Countries have their own requirements for approval, which in most cases involves travel by carrying a negative RT-PCR report,” a second person said.Monday’s meeting was also informed that Covaxin has received regulatory approval in 11 countries. Eleven companies from seven countries have shown interest in technology transfers for the production of Covaxin, the people cited above said.India has so far supplied Covaxin under its Vaccine Maitri initiative, either as grants or commercial sales, to Myanmar (200,000 doses), Mauritius (200,000 doses), Iran (125,000 doses), Paraguay (200,000 doses), and Zimbabwe (35,000 doses). However, there have been no exports of Covaxin since March and the people said supplies to foreign countries were unlikely in the immediate future.Bharat Biotech is currently in the final stages of submitting documents for Covaxin’s regulatory approval in Brazil and Hungary, and the firm has held extensive consultations with both countries. The firm has also said that all regulatory approvals have “retrospective and prospective effect”, the people said.“Bharat Biotech is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in several countries, and it is confident about the robustness of its dossier as it has data for anti-body persistence after six months as well as eight months,” the second person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-to-provide-documentation-for-covaxin-s-emergency-use-listing-by-june-101621871533572.html

The chief minister also said that vaccines procured should be distributed free of cost to the states.In the letter, Vijayan said that universal vaccination drive is the only way to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus disease in the long run. He also said that the scarce supply of vaccines in relation to the vast demand is the biggest hurdle for achieving universal vaccination.Vijayan also said that the vaccine prices would increase if states decide to procure individually via global tenders. “Based on the circumstances narrated above, I request that the Union Government may kindly take the lead in assessing the vaccine demand of each State and float a global tender taking into account the cumulative need. This will help in reducing the prices.

EUL helps the United Nations in procurement agencies and WHO member-states in determining if any necessary unlicensed medical product should be approved for use. The rotavirus, polio, and typhoid vaccines produced by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech have been pre-qualified by WHO.Bharat Biotech is also in the final stages of submission of documents for regulatory approval of Covaxin in Brazil and Hungary, who are reportedly confident about the efficacy of the vaccine as they are in possession of data to show that antibodies following immunization persist even after 6-8 months after vaccination.“BBIL is in the final stages of submission of required documents for Covaxin’s regulatory approvals in Brazil and Hungary,” sources told news agencies.“BBIL is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in Hungary & Brazil. They're confident about the robustness of their dossier, as they've data for antibody persistence after 6 as well as 8 months,” the source added.Bharat Biotech held a meeting with government officials to discuss the EUL listing of Covaxin, sources told agencies. The meeting was attended by the managing director V Krishna Mohan, senior officers of the Ministry of Health, department of Biotechnology and Ministry of External Affairs.Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was also in attendance, reported PTI. The manufacturer conveyed to the government that 90% of the required documents asked for by WHO for emergency listing has already been handed over and the rest will be submitted in June.Individuals inoculated with both Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik V may not be allowed to travel as WHO is yet to include either in its emergency use listing. Covaxin needs to be included in WHO’s EUL to be eligible for procurement through global vaccine alliance Covax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-confident-of-covaxin-making-it-to-who-emergency-use-listing-sources-101621868431232.html

Frontline teams have identified overhead Optic Fibre Cables (OFC) that need to be safeguarded and teams kept at standby for quick repair and restoration of the networks and services."COAI and its members, along with Infrastructure Providers (IPs), ISPs, are closely monitoring the situation. We are also coordinating with NDMA, state and local authorities. Preventive measures and steps to minimise the impact of cyclone Yaas on telecom infrastructure in West Bengal and Odisha are being undertaken," the COAI said.Barely a week after cyclone 'Tauktae' battered the western coast leaving behind a trail of destruction, the country is bracing for cyclone Yaas on eastern coast.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said on Sunday that the cyclone is likely to make landfall on May 26 evening between Paradip in Odisha and Sagar islands in West Bengal after intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm with wind speed ranging from 155 kmph to 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph. It will start bringing heavy rain in coastal areas from Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/steps-being-initiated-to-minimise-impact-of-cyclone-yaas-on-telecom-infrastructure-in-west-bengal-odisha-coai-101621867911145.html

He also said that people should be aware of the fact that Mucormycosis is not contagious and is not communicable as well.“90-95% of patients getting infected by Mucormycosis were found to have been either diabetic or were using steroids during their Covid-19 recovery. There are several types of fungal infections like candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity,” Guleria further added.The Aiims director also said that people who have developed warning signs of Mucormycosis should immediately consult doctors and seek treatment. “Some warning signs for Mucormycosis such as headache, rusting or bleeding from nose, swelling below the eye, lowering of facial sensation, if observed in high-risk patients or those taking steroids should be informed to doctors so that early diagnosis and treatment can be given to the affected patients,” Guleria said.Mucormycosis cases have become a cause of concern for the Centre as well as state governments as a rise in the number of cases led to several states declaring it as an epidemic. The disease has a mortality rate of 50% if it remains untreated. The disease happens due to a fungus called Mucormycetes which is present around us but most people with strong immune systems are able to ward off its effects under normal circumstances. The treatment of Mucormycosis is costly which is causing problems for families of persons affected with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/identifying-fungus-by-its-colour-leads-to-confusion-guleria-on-mucormycosis-101621866622945.html
24-05-2021||India||See if you can give Covid vaccine free, Kerala high court to Centre||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala High Court on Monday asked the Centre why it wasn’t giving the Covid-19 vaccines free to people, adding that it could use part of the ₹99,000 crore dividend announced by the Reserve Bank of India to fund the initiative.Justice Vinod Chandran made the suggestion during a hearing of a petition that challenged the differential pricing adopted for the vaccines, depending on who buys the dose. The judge said the free vaccines would cost the central exchequer about ₹34,000 crore, pointing that the Centre could dip into the ₹99,122 crore dividend announced by the central bank last week.“You have an additional income from the RBI, why don’t you use it for this purpose. We are asking you to ask your policy makers about this,” the court told Raj Kumar, the standing counsel for the Union government.Raj Kumar said the pricing of the vaccines was a policy issue and he needed time to get back on this.But he also underlined that the Centre was giving the vaccines free of cost to people above 45 years of age and about 80 lakh vaccines had already been given to Kerala.At this point, the court said this was not the time to get into matters of federalism and centre-state relations. In Kerala, 20 lakh people have received both doses of the vaccine. Another 60 lakh have got the first jab. But the state has been able to get only 5 lakh vaccines on payment basis. It has placed orders for 1 crore vaccines; 70 lakh Covishield and 30 lakh Covaxin doses.The Supreme Court is already hearing a petition that has questioned the differential pricing for the vaccines. At a hearing earlier this month, the top court observed that the existing policy will “result in a detriment to the right to public health” and indicated that there were several aspects of the vaccine pricing policy adopted by the Central government which require that policy be revisited.West Bengal and Rajasthan governments have already announced plans to approach the Supreme Court to seek a new policy that adopts uniform pricing and distribution for Covid-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, Kerala reported 17,821 new cases on Monday when 87,331 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 20.41 per cent. The state also reported 196 deaths and active covid-19 cases are 2,59,179, according to the data released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/see-if-you-can-give-covid-vaccine-free-kerala-high-court-to-centre-101621866848028.html

Many states and Union territories (UTs) have begun to ramp up their health infrastructure to brace for another wave of infections.However, the Centre said on Monday that there is no clear indication whether children will be severely affected in the third wave of the pandemic. Addressing a press conference on the coronavirus situation in India on Monday, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said, “It has been said that children will be infected the most in the third wave, but the Paediatrics Association has said that this is not based on facts.

They are the backbone of the society and the future of the country. Some of the challenges include stress and mental issues, smartphone dependence and addiction, interrupted education opportunities and nutritional issues.” the AIIMS director said and urged citizens to form help groups to address these issues.Guleria’s remarks came two days after Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said on Saturday that children can spread Covid-19 but they experience only mild symptoms and the mortality rate is very low among them.

After the Centre's announcement, Gujarat Health and Family Welfare Department issued a statement saying this new feature of "on the spot registration" will not be applicable in the state for now. The state government will continue to follow the present system of "prior registration" wherein beneficiaries are given the date, time and place of vaccination after they complete the online registration process, Principal Secretary, Health, Gujarat, Jayanti Ravi said in the statement. Ravi said there was no change in this system as of now and people who wanted to get inoculated should get themselves registered through the official mobile application or website. She also denied some media reports suggesting that instead of prior registration through a mobile application or official website, people in the 18-44 age band can now opt for "on the spot" registration by just walking in vaccination centres in Gujarat. Earlier in the day, the Union Health Ministry said that on-site registration and appointment has now been enabled for the 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for Covid-19 vaccination. However, this feature is being enabled only for government Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs) at present, it said. This feature will not be available for private CVCs and they will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments. This feature will be used only upon decision of respective states and UT governments.

A 57-year-old from Delhi who recounted her experience to news agency PTI said there was a scarcity of doctors, with hardly any one coming to check on the patients initially. She said three patients died before her eyes on the bed right across from hers."Hardly any doctor attended to us for the first two days. There were six of us -- women and men -- in the same Covid-19 ward. I watched at least three people die on the bed right across from mine," the woman told PTI.The staff was overworked and overburdened and patients had to clamour for medical attention by throwing empty bottles out of the door. The patients had to rely on each other to be able to do regular things like going to the washrooms, which were unisex and kept in a terrible condition.“We had to throw empty plastic bottles out of the door to catch the staff's attention,” she said.“There was no one to take us to the washroom and we, the patients, would hold each other's hands and go to that very unhygienic toilet, which was down the hall and unisex.” she added.She also recalled how apathetic the staff had grown after a while and when an aged patient took off his oxygen mask the staff replied that if anything happened to him the latter won’t be affected."When the old man right across from my bed would take off his oxygen mask repeatedly, the ward boy would shout at him and say 'Uncle ji, this won't affect us. So, you can keep doing this'," she recalled.Miles away in Puducherry, another patient, Alamelu, had a similar experience at the Covid care centre she was admitted to. Her daughter Siva Shakthi got her discharged from Indira Gandhi Medical College owing to unhygienic conditions and lack of separate toilets for men and women."The hygiene was pretty bad. That's why she had to come back in just three-four days. Both men and women had to use the same toilet. It was very disturbing,” Shakthi narrated.Alamelu, who suffers from heart issues and a high-blood pressure, received medication in the hospital but not drips, and had to take care of herself because of a shortage of staff."Medication was given but drips weren't. You had to take care of yourself which is the case with a lot of hospitals in the country today," she added.As the second wave shows signs of slowing down and states gear up to prevent a third wave, experts are calling for more attention to be paid to the mental toll the pandemic has taken on survivors and their families alike.Dr Rajiv Mehta, who is a part of the psychiatry department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in the national capital told news agency ANI that families should keep in touch with their ailing members and talk at least 2-3 times a day to help bolster their spirits. He also asked doctors to give their patients adequate time and listen to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-survivors-recount-harrowing-tales-of-death-and-neglect-at-hospitals-101621861583346.html

Guleria said there are many patients who will experience several symptoms even after recovering from the coronavirus disease and they need to be treated for them. “If the symptoms are seen for 4-12 weeks, it is called ongoing symptomatic Covid or post-acute Covid syndrome. If symptoms are seen for more than 12 weeks, it is called post-Covid syndrome or non-Covid,” Dr Guleria said during a routine press briefing.Among the common symptoms recovered patients experience are trouble in breathing despite normal lung function and capacity, cough for weeks, chest pain, anxiety and increased pulse rate, the senior doctor said. “These symptoms are post-Covid or Covid are due to the body’s immune system or inflammatory response,” he said.Also read | 3.6% of hospitalised Covid patients had fungal, bacterial infections: ICMR studyAnother common symptom is chronic fatigue syndrome, with people complaining of joint pain, fatigue body ache and head ache, and requires symptomatic treatment, Guleria said. “There's another symptom, generally termed as 'brain fog' on social media, seen in those recovered from Covid who find it difficult to concentrate and suffer from insomnia and depression,” he said.He suggested multi-disciplinary post-Covid clinics to rehabilitate people who have recovered from the viral disease. “I want to stress that as the recovery rate goes up, post-Covid patients will also go up and we should prepare so that we are able to manage them."Also read | Top Delhi doctor gives tips to combat black fungus amid alarming rise in casesAccording to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, India’s daily recoveries outnumbered new Covid-19 cases for the 11th consecutive day on Monday and the cumulative positivity rate stood at 8.09 per cent.

According to India Meteorological Department, the cyclone is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar islands around noon of May 26, this Wednesday, as a very severe cyclonic storm.Though the impact on Andhra Pradesh is expected to be minimal, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy told Union home minister Amit Shah during a video conference on Monday that the state’s official machinery was being vigilant. Chief ministers of Odisha and West Bengal, and the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands were also present at the meeting.Reddy said the cyclone could impact north coastal Andhra Pradesh and a few other coastal districts. A high alert was sounded in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam district, he said. “The process of evacuation of people in the vulnerable areas had commenced in Srikakulam district, bordering Odisha. The process will be followed in other districts as well,” the chief minister said.

He also directed the officials to be ready to make alternative arrangements if there was any difficulty in procuring oxygen from Odisha due to the cyclone. There should be further adequate reserves of oxygen. An official release said Andhra Pradesh is largely dependent on supplies from steel plants located in eastern India -- Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela. Any disruption of the supply from these places can cause severe distress in the state. The state government has tried to step up oxygen supplies from Odisha in the last two days using express trains in order to maintain buffer stock, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-braces-for-cyclone-yaas-cm-holds-review-meeting-101621858687457.html

24-05-2021||India||Vaccination key to controlling Covid-19, but Centre doesn’t seem to care, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday criticised the government for not “paying necessary attention” to slow pace of the vaccination drive across the country and reiterated that it is the only way the Covid-19 pandemic can be controlled.“Vaccination is the key to controlling the pandemic but GOI doesn’t seem to care,” tweeted Gandhi on Monday.Vaccination is the key to controlling the pandemic but GOI doesn’t seem to care. pic.twitter.com/iazLYEXHY3The Wayanad MP’s words come close on the heels of states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi closing vaccination drives for those in the age group of 18-45 years due to the shortage of vaccine doses. Congress hit out at the Centre on Sunday over its handling of the vaccination drive and asked the Union health ministry to produce district-wise, and not state-wise, data of the jabs being delivered every day, citing the latter as a tactic to hide “alarming facts”.Also Read: Modi government cannot say it didn't anticipate consequences, it has been forewarned: Chidambaram on vaccine crisis"The Union health ministry should put out a daily statement on the number of vaccines administered district-wise every day. The number for the whole state hides many alarming facts," Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram tweeted.“Will Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who had said that there is 'no shortage' (of vaccines), please respond to the facts emerging from Delhi and Telangana?" he added.The Centre implemented a liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy from May 1, where 50% of the required vaccine doses are supplied by the Union government and 50% are to be acquired by the states through direct procurement. To this end the states had started floating global tenders for procurement of vaccines but the US pharma giants Pfizer and Moderna Inc declined to sell directly to the states. The Centre has promised states a total of 5,86,29,000 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin between May 1 and June 15.The opposition parties have been hitting out at the Centre for shortage of vaccines and its handling of the pandemic in general. News agency Reuters reported on Sunday that the recent government directive on delaying vaccination by 3 months for those who have recuperated from Covid-19 was done to buy some time for ramping up vaccine stocks. Citing Narendra Kumar Arora, head of the government's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the report said the vaccination drive was prematurely opened up to all adults without inoculating the most vulnerable groups first. India has so far completely inoculated just 3% of its 1.35 billion people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-key-to-controlling-covid-19-but-centre-doesn-t-seem-to-care-says-rahul-gandhi-101621854782168.html

24-05-2021||India||Amid raging Covid-19 pandemic, Telangana villages remain free from virus||At a time when the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been wreaking havoc in the entire country, some villages in Telangana remain unaffected by the dreaded infection, at least till now, HT has learnt. Take the case of Dammayyapeta, a small village of Kodimyal block in Jagitial district. Tucked away a little deeper from the main road and surrounded by hillocks, this village, with 293 houses and a total population of 1,144, has not reported even a single case of Covid-19.“Most of the youth in the village are educated and have been reading about the Covid-19 in the newspapers and watching it on the television. But we have been following the suggestions given by the health department officials to keep the virus at bay,” Dammayyapeta sarpanch Tuniki Narsaiah told HT.The villagers have been following strict Covid-19 restrictions ever since the first wave of Covid-19 struck the country in March 2020. “We held a meeting of gram panchayat and adopted a resolution on how to follow the rules and avoid spreading of Covid-19. It has yielded good results; touchwood, we haven’t witnessed even a single case of the infection in our village till now,” Narsaiah said.Interestingly, the houses in the village are built in a peculiar pattern for several decades. There is at least 10 metres gap between any two houses. “This has made things easy for people to maintain adequate social distance. We made wearing of masks compulsory for all the villagers,” the sarpanch said.There have been no public gatherings and community celebrations in Dammayyapeta for the last year. “It was a collective decision by the entire village. The weddings are confined only to the families of the grooms and the brides. Unlike in the past, no relatives or friends are allowed and no marriage feasts,” K Sudhakar, a village youth, said.The gram panchayat officials have been sanitising the village with sodium hypochlorite solution once in three days. “We are not permitting any outsider to enter the village unless there are valid reasons and only if the person has no Covid-19 symptoms. However, we are not insisting such people produce a Covid-19 negative certificate,” Narsaiah said.The villagers have also been asked not to go out of the village unless it is very essential. “They are following all the Covid-19 protocols when they go out and return to the village. Even those running provision stores in the village go out of the village to fetch commodities only once or twice a month,” he said.Most of the villagers are farmers and about 200-250 people work as labourers who regularly go on work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme. They wear masks and maintain strict physical distancing. “We did not have a problem in selling our agriculture produce as the agriculture department officials set up a procurement centre near the village,” Venkataiah, a farmer, said.Another tribal village Jagannathpur of Raikal block of the same district has also managed to remain free from Covid-19 in the second wave. This village, inhabited by the Gond tribes, has a population of around 1,000 people and none of them have tested positive for Covid-19 till date.“The credit goes to the villagers who take collective decisions to follow strict Covid-19 guidelines,” said Vijaya, sarpanch of the village.When contacted, Jagitial district medical and health officer Puppala Sridhar said the medical teams had been visiting the villages regularly to conduct fever survey and identify Covid-19 patients. “It is really commendable that some of these villages have been following the Covid-19 guidelines sincerely to avoid the spread of the virus – a sense which is lacking in many urban areas,” he said.Unconfirmed reports said three tribal villages in Nirmal district, Pentadari, Ippacharmi and Lakshmi Nagar of Saarangapur block, besides Gollapalli village of Devaruppula block of Jangaon district, and Chainpaka village of Chityal block in Jayashankar Bhupalpalli district, have also reported zero Covid-19 cases this year so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-raging-covid-19-pandemic-telangana-villages-remain-free-from-virus-101621855027614.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid vaccination: Centre enables on-site registration for 18-44 age group||Union ministry of health on Monday enabled on-site registration for 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for all government Covid vaccination centres. This was in addition to the facility of online appointments provided for this population group, it said in a statement.“…based on the various representations given by the states and inputs received by Union Health Ministry for the vaccination of 18-44 years age group, the Union government has now decided to provide facility of on-site registration/facilitated cohort registration on CoWIN digital platform for 18-44 years age group,” the statement said.As per government data, 10 million beneficiaries in this population group have currently been vaccinated across the country.“Even though CoWIN provides for features such as registration of up to 4 beneficiaries with a mobile number, facilitated registration and appointments through applications, such as ArogyaSetu and Umang and through the Common Service Centres etc., people requiring cohort’s facility and those without access to internet or smart phones or mobile phones may still have limited access for vaccination. Therefore, the feature of on-site registration and appointment is now being enabled for 18-44 years age group on CoWIN,” it added.The service, however, currently is allowed only for government-run vaccination centres, and private centres will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments.Also Read | Pleas on ex gratia for Covid victims: SC seeks Centre’s replyWith the launch of phase 2 of the national Covid-19 vaccination drive on March 1, this year, facility for only online registration and appointment of citizens aged 45 years or more was offered on CoWIN digital platform. Later, the Central government expanded the drive to include people in the age group of 18 to 44 years from May 1, under the implementation of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 vaccination strategy. Initially, the facility of only online appointment mode was offered to people in this age group in order to avoid overcrowding at the vaccination centres.However, the ministry has also allowed the vaccination centres offering online slots only to take some walk-ins at the end of the day against cancellations, to avoid vaccine wastage.“… In case of sessions exclusively organised with online slots, towards the end of the day, some doses may still be left unutilised in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on day of vaccination due to any reason. In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage,” the ministry statement read. The Centre has also directed states to issue clear instructions to all district immunization officers, to strictly adhere to decision regarding the extent and manner of using the on-site registration and appointment feature for this age group. The ultimate decision, however, will be of the state whether to offer this facility for 18-44 years category or not.“State/UT must decide on opening of on-site registrations/facilitated cohorts’ registration and appointments for 18-44 years age group based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage and for facilitating vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in the age group 18-44 years. Also, abundant caution should be exercised and extreme due care should be taken while opening up of on-site registration… in order to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccination-centre-enables-on-site-registration-for-18-44-age-group-101621854247231.html

24-05-2021||India||Full-scale production of Sputnik V in India this summer: Russian developers||The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine and Panacea Biotec announced on Monday that full-scale production of the doses in India will start this summer. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) or Russia’s sovereign wealth fund has tied up with Indian pharmaceutical firms such as Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech to manufacture more than 850 million doses a year. Sputnik V has been granted approval for emergency use by India’s drug controller. “The first batch produced at Panacea Biotec’s facilities at Baddi will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center [in Russia] for quality control. Full-scale production of the vaccine is due to start this summer. Company’s facilities comply with GMP [good manufacturing practice] standards and are prequalified by WHO,” RDIF said in a statement. Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorisation procedure on April 12 and use of the Russian vaccine started on May 14. Also Read | Covid-19: When citizens protect the right to lifeRDIF and Panacea Biotec have agreed to produce 100 million doses a year of Sputnik V. RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said: “Launch of production in India in partnership with Panacea Biotec marks an important step in helping the country fight the pandemic. Production of Sputnik V supports efforts of India’s authorities to leave behind the acute phase of Coronavirus as soon as possible while the vaccine will also be exported at a later stage to help prevent the spread of the virus in other countries around the world.” Rajesh Jain, managing director of Panacea Biotec, said: “This marks a significant step as we initiate production of Sputnik V. Together with RDIF, we hope to help bring a sense of normalcy back to people across the country and around the world.” The Russian side has also announced plans to ship 18 million doses of Sputnik V to India, including three million doses in May, five million doses in June and 10 million in July. However, some questions have arisen about the Russian side’s ability to meet these commitments due to the production facilities in Russia being stretched by demands from around the world. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has tied up with RDIF for the distribution of Sputnik V in India, including both made-in-Russia doses and locally manufactured shots. Sputnik V has so far been registered in 66 countries with a total population of more than 3.2 billion. RDIF and Gamaleya Center have said the efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6%, based on analysis of data on coronavirus infection rate among those vaccinated in Russia with both doses of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021. The vaccine is based on the platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two doses, which RDIF says provides immunity “with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fullscale-production-of-sputnik-v-in-india-this-summer-russian-developers-101621852627656.html

Patients of kidney disease, cardiac and liver disorders are also at a high risk of getting infected.Also Read| 5,424 cases of Mucormycosis reported in 18 states and UTs: Harsh VardhanSpeaking to news agency ANI, Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital said, “Black fungus occurs in people who have poor immunity or are suffering from diabetes. Use of steroids increases blood sugar and due to this, the fungus enters through breath. It then spreads to the lungs and the entire body and also damages the kidneys.”Dr Kumar added the only way to prevent Mucormycosis is by keeping blood sugar levels under control, consuming steroids only on the advice of doctors, and keeping the face masks clean. He also suggested against using dry oxygen.The LNJP hospital has so far reported 36 cases of Mucormycosis, Dr Kumar said, adding 30 of them are Covid-19 patients. More than 300 cases have been reported across Delhi.

It is further expected that the remaining population in the 45+ age category will be covered within a few days,” the spokesperson said.On Saturday, UT’s lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha had directions district commissioners (DCs) to scale-up the drive after reports of low vaccination rate in some districts.As many as 51 people lost their lives to Covid-19 on Sunday in the UT, taking May’s fatalities to 1,282 and overall death toll to 3,564. The region also recorded 3,308 fresh infections, taking the overall cases to 2, 70,621.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-to-accelerate-vaccination-of-18-to-45-years-age-group-101621851788250.html
24-05-2021||India||Plea on ex gratia for Covid victims: SC seeks Centre’s reply||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre if there was any policy or scheme under the National Disaster Management Act 2005 to pay ex gratia compensation to kin of persons who succumbed to Covid-19 pandemic.Two petitions, filed by Reepal Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal respectively, were heard by the Supreme Court where a reference was made by the petitioners to Section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA) providing for ex gratia monetary compensation for the families of those who have lost their lives during a notified disaster. A notification issued on April 8, 2015 by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) under this very provision fixed this amount at ₹4 lakh to be paid out of the State Disaster Response Fund and National Disaster Response Fund. However, this notification was applicable for the period 2015-20.By a Central notification of March 14, 2020, Covid-19 was declared a ‘notified disaster’ under DMA. Relying on the same, the two petitions made out a case for compensation to be paid to all persons (including frontline workers) who had died due to Covid-19. More than 300,000 persons have died in the country due to Covid-19.Kansal’s petition demanded that death certificates issued to Covid-19 deceased must specify the cause of death as Covid-19 and not complications related to it. Agreeing with this view, justice Shah asked Centre’s additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, “Is there any uniform policy for issuance of death certificate. If benefit is to be given under Section 12 of DMA, then there must be uniform guidelines.”Also Read | Guarantors liable if firms fail to repay: Supreme CourtThe court directed the Centre to produce all relevant documents regarding the compensation scheme envisaged under Section 12 of DMA, the letter issued on April 8, 2005, and guidelines governing issuance of death certificate for patients affected by Covid-19. The court also sought the guidelines framed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) presently adopted in many states. The next hearing of the case is on June 11.The bench was alive to the reality that in most cases of death due to Covid-19, the municipal authorities or hospitals show cause of death as lung infection or heart ailment occurring due to Covid-19. “If benefit is to be given to such persons who died due to Covid-19, how will they be identified? Often the families of deceased do not know about such benefits. They may have to run from one end to another for getting these benefits,” the bench remarked.Kansal, in his petition filed through advocate SR Harisha said, “It is the right of the family to know the real cause of death of their family member/ relative on any official document.” In most deaths, the medical officers are not conducting post-mortem examination, he added.Making out a case for compensation under Section 12 for frontline workers, Bansal pointed out, “At a time when personnel from healthcare sector, police department, municipal boards, Nagar Nigam, etc are acting as backbone of our country in fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, it is the very basic and fundamental duty of Centre to provide social security to those families whose members are losing their lives.”Section 12 of the DMA provides “Guidelines for minimum standards of relief” which states as follows: “The National Authority shall recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster, which shall include,— (iii) ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life as also assistance on account of damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood.”The April 8, 2015 MHA notification that fixed ₹4 lakh ex-gratia stated, “ ₹four lakh per deceased person including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities, subject to certification regarding cause of death from appropriate authority.” This was the reason the petitioners demanded death certificate to reflect Covid-19 as cause of death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-on-ex-gratia-for-covid-victims-sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-101621850167232.html

State/UT must decide on opening of on-site registrations/facilitated cohorts’ registration and appointments for 18-44 years age group based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage and for facilitating vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in the age group 18-44 years,” the health ministry added.Also read | 6 things you should not do before or after vaccination, Centre issues guidelineThe ministry said the facility of only online appointment mode initially to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years helped to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres. The Centre expanded its massive vaccination drive for people in the age group of 18 to 44 years on May 1.“In case of sessions exclusively organized with online slots, towards the end of the day, some doses may still be left unutilized in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on day of vaccination due to any reason. In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimize the vaccine wastage,” the health ministry said. It added that even though CoWin provides for registration of up to four members with a mobile number, facilitated registration and appointments through applications such as Aarogya Setu and Umang and through the Common Service Centres etc, people need “facilitated cohort’s facility and those without access to internet or smart phones or mobile phones may still have limited access for vaccination.”Also read | Centre to supply over 5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to states and UTsThe Union health ministry has advised states and Union territories to issue clear instructions to all district immunisation officers to strictly adhere to decision of respective state and UT government “regarding the extent and manner of using the on-site registration and appointment feature for 18 to 44 years age group”. “Fully reserved sessions can also be organised for providing vaccination services to beneficiaries belonging to facilitated cohorts. Wherever such fully reserved sessions are organized, all efforts must also be made to mobilize such beneficiaries in sufficient numbers,” the ministry said.Also read | CoWin to now allow bookings for 2nd Covishield dose only after 84 daysThe ministry also advised states and UTs that “abundant caution should be exercised and extreme due care should be taken while opening up of on-site registration and appointment for 18-44 years age group, in order to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres”, the statement said.According to the health ministry, the cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group under the third phase of the vaccination drive crossed 10 million on Monday.

24-05-2021||India||Will not arrest Param Bir Singh till June 9: Maharashtra govt tells high court||The Maharashtra government has assured that it will not arrest former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a case filed against him under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act till June 9 if he cooperates with the probe and doesn’t seek relief related to this case from the Supreme Court, said senior counsel Darius Khambata, who is representing the state government.The assurance came during the hearing of a petition filed by Singh in Bombay high court, seeking to quash the FIR registered against him on a complaint of police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. The vacation bench of justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar was hearing the matter.Singh last week filed a petition in the apex court, alleging that he is being hounded and continuously harassed with multiple cases instituted against him by the Maharashtra government as vendetta, after he complained to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.He urged the SC to shift all the enquiries set up against him to another state and also sought for the FIRs registered against him to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Khambata on Monday told the HC that Singh “cannot ride two horses” at a time and seek reliefs from both the high court and the Supreme Court in the same case.The bench accepted the state government’s statement that it would not arrest Singh till June 9, and directed him to not seek reliefs pertaining to this particular case before the SC. Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani agreed to the directive.Ghadge’s advocate Satish Talekar opposed the interim protection from arrest granted to Singh.The court, however, noted that the case dates back to 2016. “The FIR has been filed after five years. You (complainant) waited for so long…nothing will happen if you wait for two more weeks. He (Singh) has not been arrested for all these years. What purpose will it serve if he is arrested now,” the court said.The bench also noted that Singh is still in service and is an officer of the government’s police force.Justice Shinde also expressed his displeasure with Singh’s statement before the SC claiming he was constrained to approach the apex court as the high court was not hearing the matter.Khambata said Singh’s submission before SC made an unfounded accusation against the HC by suppressing facts. He pointed out that on May 13 the high court had heard and adjourned the matter after the government assured to take no coercive action against Singh.Ghadge’s advocate Satish Talekar said it seemed that Singh was resorting to forum shopping, an approach disapproved by the SC.Jethmalani apologised to the bench and said the statement was incorrect. “We will withdraw the statement from the petition filed in the Supreme Court,” he said.The vacation bench adjourned the case to June 9 so that it could be placed before a regular bench of the high court to avoid rehearing of the matter.The FIR against Singh is based on a complaint filed on April 29 by police inspector Ghadge, now posted at Akola in Maharashtra.Ghadge made a series of allegations of corruption against Singh and other officers when Singh was posted in Thane.The FIR, which is now transferred from Akola to Thane, claimed that Singh during his term as Thane police commissioner in 2015-16, pressured Ghadge to drop the names of some developers from Kalyan-Dombivali area from a corruption case and when he refused, the IPS officer framed him up in false cases.Ghadge also claims in the FIR that though he had complained against Singh to various authorities including the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, they were not acted upon forcing him to file a case under the SC/ST Act against Singh in 2021. Ghadge belongs to the Mahar community, a scheduled tribe. The state CID is conducting a probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-arrest-param-bir-singh-till-june-9-maharashtra-govt-tells-high-court-101621848007021.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Centre enables on-site registration for beneficiaries of 18-44 age group on CoWIN||The Centre on Monday opened on-site registration and appointment for Covid-19 vaccination for beneficiaries between the age of 18 to 44 years on its CoWIN platform, the ministry of health and family welfare said in a release. Earlier, only online registration was allowed to avoid crowding at the vaccination centres.However, the facility to register at the site is restricted to only government vaccination centres, for now. "Private Covid vaccination centres will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments," it stated.The ministry also said that that the action has been taken in order to minimise vaccine wastage as some doses may be left unutilised in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on the day of vaccination due to any reason. "In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage," it stated.The move also aims to expand the inoculation drive to people eligible for the vaccine shot but may not have access to the internet or mobile phones to book the appointment through CoWIN, the official portal created by the Centre to book vaccination slots at both government-run and private hospitals.People in priority groups are already allowed to register at the vaccination centre to receive the jab.The central government opened the immunisation drive for all above 18 on May 1 in the third phase. In previous phase, people above 45, and with comorbidity were allowed to receive the shot.India rolled out the nationwide vaccination drive on January 16. However, it hit a roadblock to maintain its pace in the past couple of months owing to shortages of vaccines and beneficiaries across the country facing difficulty in finding slots on the CoWIN.The government is currently using Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech's indigenously manufactured Covaxin for vaccinating the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-centre-enables-on-site-registration-for-beneficiaries-of-18-44-age-group-on-cowin-101621846345819.html

Of these, 18,043,015 million vaccine doses are still available with the states and the UTs to be administered, the health ministry said.More than 4.80 million vaccine doses are still in the pipeline and will be distributed to states within the next three days, the health ministry said. "Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India for containment and management of the pandemic, along with Test, Track, Treat and COVID Appropriate Behaviour," the health ministry said in a release on Monday. In addition, the government is also facilitating direct procurement of vaccines by the States and UTs, it also said.As of May 23, the total consumption, including wastage, is 200,008,875 doses, the health minister also mentioned.This comes as several states in the country, including the national capital, halted the vaccination drive for the people in the age group of 18-44. The Centre opened the immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease for all above 18 on May 1. However, it is yet to pick a pace in the country due to the shortage of vaccines leading to the unavailability of slots.On Saturday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the Centre to increase the quota of Covid-19 vaccine for the national capital as it faces a huge crunch of the shots. Kejriwal also cited the temporary halt in the vaccination of people in the age group of 18-44 years to flag the shortage of doses in Delhi. Vaccine stocks for the age group are over and the centres where they were being administered have been shut, Kejriwal said.Kejriwal further said that Delhi requires 80 lakh vaccine doses per month; "However, we only received 16 lakh vaccine doses for May," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-4-80-mn-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-be-distributed-to-states-uts-centre-101621843883331.html

All these cases have been reported from 18 states and Union territories, the health minister also said, adding, out of the total, 4556 patients have a history of Covid-19 infection and 55% of them had diabetes, as per the ANI report.With Covid-19 cases now below record levels, doctors in India are battling with the black fungus epidemic. The infection attacks the immune system of the patient and most likely to have fatal results in patients with comorbidity like diabetes.Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. Sometimes, doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.Doctors are suspecting that the sudden surge in mucormycosis may be linked to the rapid use of steroids to treat Covid-19 patients. Mucormycosis has a high mortality rate, however, it is not contagious but its frequency in the last month has left doctors worried.On Saturday, Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadananda Gowda announced an allocation of 23,680 additional vials of Amphotericin-B, a key drug to treat the raging infection amid complaints by many chief ministers regarding the shortage.India's death toll from Covid-19 crossed 300,000 as the number of daily fatalities hovered above 4000. The country’s Covid-19 tally, meanwhile, has increased to 26,752,447 after 222,315 positive cases were detected in the 24-hour period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5424-cases-of-mucormycosis-reported-in-18-states-and-uts-harsh-vardhan-101621842809723.html

Vardhan was speaking at the 27th group of ministers' (GoM) meeting on Covid-19."When we talk about genome sequencing, over 25,739 samples have been sequenced by INSACOG and 9,508 were found with variants of concern. Out of these, B.1.617 variant was found in almost 65 per cent of the samples making it one of the most common variants," said Vardhan.Also Read: All that we know about the B.1.617 variantThe INSACOG is a consortium of 10 institutes of the Centre, that is involved in the genome sequencing of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.The health minister also said that state governments have been requested to send the samples regularly for genome sequencing.Vardhan further highlighted that depite being a Sunday, more than 19 lakh samples were tested for Covid-19 on May 23, taking the cumulative total across the country beyond 33 crore.The B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 is primarily found in India. It has emerged as a global concern following its infectivity and transmitting capacity.There are three sub-lineages too of the variant - B.1.617.3, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2. The last two were first detected in December 2020 whereas B.1.617.3 was the first sub-lineage of this variant to be detected in October 2020 in India.In case of all the three sub-lineage, it has the potential to reduce antibody efficacy.The variant spreads so fast that both doses of two-dose regimen Covid-19 vaccines are needed to provide strong protection against symptomatic infection from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b1617-variant-found-in-65-of-samples-sequenced-says-health-minister-101621837559379.html

These, along with the forensics test report conducted by the state government, have ruled out poisoning, which was suspected by some as a probable cause of deaths. The final investigation report on the May 13 deaths at Kanduli Hills area of Nagaon district is expected in the next few days. “We received report of the histopathology tests conducted by the department of pathology, College of Veterinary Science, Assam Agricultural University (AAU), on Sunday. This more or less confirms lightning as cause of the death of the elephants,” said Vasanthan, divisional forest officer, Nagaon. The report prepared by Prof SM Tamuli and assistant professor A Deka mentions “lesions are suggestive of high voltage electrical burn injury” as the tentative diagnosis of the tests. “We examined the tissues and other materials provided by the forest department and found desquamation of the keratinized layer (peeling off of the external layer of the skin,” said Prof Tamuli. The report accessed by HT also mentions “distortion and separation of intra epidermal tissues” and “separation of epidermal and dermal layers, highly dilated and congested blood vessels and severe haemorrhage observed in the dermal papillae as well as in the sub-epidermal region”. A preliminary technical report on incidents of lightning over and around the site where the elephants’ bodies were found by North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC) says that many lightning strikes took place in the area between 5.30am on May 12 to 5.30 am on May 13. “A large number of lightning strikes were reported around the area where the elephant bodies were found. The total number of lightning flashes reached 350 and CG (cloud to ground) flashes were 150 every 2 hours. That is a clear indication of the high flash rate over the area and its severity,” the report accessed by HT mentions. Officials said the report of the forensic tests conducted at the Assam government laboratory in Guwahati has also ruled out poisoning as the likely cause of the deaths. HT hasn’t seen its contents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lightning-killed-18-elephants-in-assam-says-pathology-report-101621836426592.html

The post of CBI director has been lying vacant since February 3 when Rishi Kumar Shukla completed his tenure. Additional director Praveen Sinha has been holding the post since then as the interim chief of the premier agency. People cited above said a list of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from 1984 to 1987 batches was given to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after clearance by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and department of personnel and training (DoPT). However, there is a possibility that officers from 1988 batch might also be considered for the post. The meeting is likely to take place at 7 pm at Prime Minister’s residence, when the panel will deliberate on the names given to them, officials said. Also Read | Rajasthan may move Supreme Court for uniform vaccine policyAmong the top contenders for the coveted post are 1984 batch IPS officers YC Modi (currently director general of National Investigation Agency), and Rakesh Asthana (director general of Border Security Force); and 1985 batch officers Subodh Jaiswal (director general of Central Industrial Security Force), Loknath Behera (Kerala police chief), and HC Awasthy (Uttar Pradesh police chief). Modi, Asthana, Behera and Awasthy have had considerable experience in CBI in the past and have investigated some crucial cases. One of the officers said that if the panel decides to consider 1988 batch as well for the post, then Praveen Sinha may also be a strong contender to lead the agency permanently. “There are high chances that the panel doesn’t agree on one name today and there could be another meeting,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmled-panel-to-decide-cbi-director-s-name-today-101621833006229.html
24-05-2021||India||Lunar eclipse, Supermoon and Blood Moon: All coming together on May 26||People around the world will witness a supercelestial event as the first lunar eclipse of 2021 will take place on May 26. What will make this even more special as it will coincide with a supermoon, a lunar eclipse and a red blood moon all at once!According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the US, the total lunar eclipse would start at 4:47:39 am EDT. In India, it will be visible at around 2:17 pm and will end at 7:19 pm.What is a Super Moon?NASA defines Super Moon occurrence as when a full or new Moon coincides with its closest approach to the Earth. The closest point on the orbit is called "perigee," and when the full Moon appears at the perigee, it looks slightly brighter and larger than a regular full Moon, hence the name "Supermoon"Normally it is difficult to differentiate between the normal Moon and a supermoon, but if you compare it with two pictures side by side, it shows a difference in size.What is lunar eclipse?A lunar eclipse is when the earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight from falling on the Moon. There are two kinds of eclipse, partial and total, depending on how much earth's shadow has covered the Moon. This can only happen during the full Moon.May 26's eclipse is a total lunar eclipse when the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of Earth, forming a straight line and completely covering the Moon.Best places to see Lunar EclipseThe best place to see the eclipse will be the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Australia, the east coast of Asia and the west coast of America. It will be visible on the eastern half of the US, but only the very earliest stages before the Moon sets.What is red blood Moon?During the eclipse, when the Moon is covered by the earth's shadow it goes darken, however, it doesn't go completely black. Instead, the Moon takes a red colour, therefore total lunar eclipse is often called red or blood moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lunar-eclipse-supermoon-and-blood-moon-all-coming-together-on-may-26-101621832055881.html

The arrested politicians are sitting ministers of Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool Congress legislator Madan Mitra, and former MLA Sovan Chatterjee.The CBI has also challenged the high court orders putting the leaders under house arrest, and constituting a larger bench to hear the bail plea of the accused leaders. “The CBI has moved the Supreme Court when the high court has already constituted a larger bench to hear the case. We will oppose it,” said Kalyan Banerjee, advocate and Trinamool Congress MP. Also Read | Narada case: Sovan Chatterjee in house arrest after release from hospitalOn Friday, the high court put the four politicians under house arrest and constituted a larger bench to hear the bail plea after a difference of opinion split the two-judge bench on granting them an interim bail in a corruption case. The four were in judicial custody since May 17 after the CBI arrested them in connection with the Narada case. Though a special CBI court granted them bail, the high court stayed the order and the four were sent to judicial custody. Since Friday, however, they have been put under house arrest. While Hakim and Chatterjee returned home and are now under house arrest, the other two are admitted in state-run hospital. “It is CBI’s effort to delay the hearing. But we have already filed a caveat in the Supreme Court and the hearing can’t be one-sided,” said another advocate. The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. TMC has linked the arrests to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss in the recently concluded assembly polls. It has questioned why the CBI didn’t arrest Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were also seen in the sting videos but have since switched from TMC to BJP. CBI’s plea to transfer the Narada trial out of the state is also pending before the high court. The CBI has named West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the trial of the case from the lower court. It claimed violent protests orchestrated by the TMC against the arrests hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts. Banerjee staged a six-hour dharna at the CBI’s office in Kolkata after the four were arrested last Monday. Ghatak led nearly 3,000 workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside CBI’s office, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest and threw bricks, bottles, and shoes at central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-sting-5-judge-bench-to-hear-leaders-bail-plea-cbi-moves-sc-101621831506395.html

They have known each other for a long time and share a close and easy relationship, going back to their previous avatars as India’s foreign secretary and deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration respectively. Blinken had also visited India during Jaishankar’s tenure as foreign secretary.Also Read | US Congressional committee passes resolution to express solidarity with IndiaJaishankar is also expected to meet National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, another old acquaintance. But there was no word yet about his meetings with other cabinet members, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the first, and only, Biden cabinet member to visit India so far, in March, when he had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Visiting foreign ministers don’t always get a meeting with the American president. And in these times of social restrictions, though it’s being rapidly wound down in the White House because of rising vaccinations and dipping case, Americans have been even less willing to break the protocol.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne was in Washington DC in March. She met Blinken and Sullivan and others but, did not get a meeting with President Biden. And Australia has been a treaty ally of the US since 1951 and a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance with the US, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada.Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh became the first Indian ministers to meet an American president in 15 years when they had a “courtesy call” with then President Donald Trump in 2019, after wrapping up their 2+2 ministerial dialogue meetings with their then counterparts Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.The two before them were former cabinet members of the Vajpayee government — home minister LK Advani and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha. Advani got a “drop by” meeting with President George W Bush in 2003 when he was in a meeting with then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Sinha got an Oval Office meeting the year after, in 2004.Jaishankar’s DC itinerary is still evolving. But, as stated in the announcement of his visit by the external affairs ministry, a major part will be meeting with the business community. He will meet representatives and members of the US-India Business Council (USIBC), an arm of the powerful US chamber of commerce, and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a competing group backed by most major companies invested in India.It is also understood that Jaishankar will meet some members of US congress at a dinner hosted by Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. This will be a key part of the visit as well because of the overwhelming bipartisan support ties with India in US congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-in-us-talks-to-cover-covid-bilateral-ties-101621829646187.html
24-05-2021||India||Very severe cyclonic storm Yaas to cross Odisha-Bengal coasts on May 26 evening||The depression over eastcentral Bay of Bengal has intensified into cyclonic storm, Yaas, and is likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm (wind speed of 118 to 166 kmph) during the subsequent 24 hours, according to India Meteorological Department.Yaas would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach northwest Bay of Bengal near north Odisha and West Bengal coasts by Wednesday morning. It is very likely to cross north Odisha -West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar islands by Wednesday evening as a very severe cyclonic storm.Though oceanic and atmospheric conditions over Bay of Bengal are favourable for intensification of Yaas, experts hope it will not intensify to an extremely severe cyclone because it has formed close to the coast and has less time over the unusually warm ocean.“The north Bay of Bengal where the cyclone is forming, is very warm, with the temperatures reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius (°C), 1-2°C above normal. The subsurface ocean heat content is also warm and conducive for the system to intensify into a cyclone. However, since the distance between the location of cyclogenesis and landfall is short, the cyclone won’t spend much time over the ocean. This will prevent it from intensifying to an extremely severe cyclone. In contrast, Cyclone Tauktae spent several days in the Arabian Sea, drawing the energy in the form of heat and moisture from the warm waters below. We won’t see this happening for cyclone Yaas,” said Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.Also Read | How India is bracing for another ‘severe cyclonic storm’ Yaas“#CycloneYaas will become the second intense tropical cyclone (severe cyclonic storm or above as per the IMD scale) to have formed to the north of 15°N latitude & west of 88°E longitude in the month of May since 1980. Previously, Cyclone Aila had formed over this region in 2009,” tweeted Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and researcher at the University of Reading, England.“Since tropical cyclones generally form further to the south over the Bay of Bengal, #CycloneYaas will become the most intense tropical cyclone that formed so close to #Odisha & #WestBengal coasts in the month of May since 1980 & made landfall over these regions,” he added.A comparatively shorter time over sea could prevent Yaas from intensifying into an extremely severe cyclone (wind speed of 167-221 kmph) or a super cyclone (over 222 kmph), said IMD scientists but did not rule out the possibility of further intensification.“Comparatively, its time over sea is less. Fani had formed over Andaman Sea, Amphan also formed towards south. After Aila, this is probably the first to be comparatively closer to coast. The landfall location of Yaas will be slightly to the west compared to Amphan which made landfall over Sunderbans,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones at IMD.She said warm waters of Bay of Bengal could still provide a lot of energy to Yaas for further intensification. Taking a more intense form cannot be ruled out at the moment, she added. Over Andaman and Nicobar Islands, light to moderate rainfall is likely at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at isolated places on May 23 and 24.

24-05-2021||India||Covaxin trials on children expected to start in June: Bharat Biotech||Bharat Biotech, the maker of coronavirus disease vaccine Covaxin, is expected to start paediatric trials from June, the company's Business Development and International Advocacy Head Dr Raches Ella on Sunday."We focused on developing the product last year. Now our focus is on ramping up our manufacturing capacity. Kids vaccine trials of Bharath Biotech may get the license in the third quarter of this year," Dr Ella said during a virtual conversation with members of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Hyderabad.Responding to a question from one of the participants, Dr Ella said that Bharat Biotech will be ramping up the manufacturing capacity of Covaxin to 700 million doses by the end of this year."We are happy to have the full support of the government because of which we are able to stand where we are today in this journey. The vaccine is co-developed by us and ICMR. The government placed an advanced purchase order of ₹1,500 crore. This will help us to increase our risk appetite. That is why we are expanding to Bangalore and Gujarat," he added.The young executive of Bharat Biotech also said that the company expects approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) for Covaxin by the end of the third or fourth quarter. Since the vaccine is not included in WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL), people who have been fully vaccinated by both doses of Covaxin might not be allowed to travel internationally.Meanwhile, on Covid-19 prevalence among children, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr VK Paul said on Saturday that seropositivity rate between 10-17 years is roughly the same as between 30-40 and children can also spread the infection."Whenever children contracted the infection then almost always symptoms are minimal, very mild disease or they are asymptomatic and because it is mild the mortality is very very less in them," he said."Protecting children from infection is equally important so that they do not become part of the transmission chain," he further said.Indigenously produced Covaxin, along with AstraZeneca's Covishield and recently approved Sputnik V from Russia, is being used in India for inoculating people against Covid-19.So far, India has administered about 195,004,184 doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease, the most after China and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-trials-on-children-expected-to-start-in-june-bharat-biotech-101621826763212.html

He also said the decision of imposing lockdown was a tough call that has brought the situation under control. “I chose to impose lockdown by going against people’s wishes. It was the harshest decision to take as it brings restrictions on their livelihood, but I was ready to face their discontent. Today, the situation has come under control, but we are yet to get success. The success is of the people who have shown restraint, not mine,” Thackeray said.He was addressing an open virtual meeting of expert doctors from the state task force to guide other doctors and parents over dos and don’ts in case a child is found infected with the Covid-19 virus.

It is expected to make landfall on Wednesday evening between Paradip in Odisha and Sagar islands in West Bengal. The storm packs in winds with speed ranging between 155 kmph and 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph."It would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach Northwest Bay of Bengal near West Bengal and north Odisha coasts by 26th May morning," the Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD said. From Tuesday, it will start bringing heavy rain in coastal areas, the weather department also said.In view of the severity of the cyclone, the army and navy have kept their resources on standby, including military aircraft and warships. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the coast guard teams are also ready to be deployed to assist civil authorities at short notice, officials said.On Sunday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) airlifted 21 tonnes of relief materials and 334 NDRF personnel to Kolkata and Port Blair, as Andamans are also threatened by the cyclone which formed in the Bay of Bengal. According to a report by PTI, the IAF has kept 11 aircraft and 25 helicopters ready to carry out relief work.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Sunday to review the preparedness of the state and central agencies ahead of the expected landfall of the cyclone. During the meeting, PM Modi called for a timely evacuation of those involved in offshore activities.He also asked officials to work in close coordination with the state authorities to ensure people living in high-risk areas are evacuated safely.PM Modi also stressed on the need to ensure that the time duration of outages of the power supply and communication network is minimum and these links are restored swiftly, PTI reported citing PMO statement.In Odisha, the navy has positioned eight flood relief teams and four diving teams. Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has set up a control room at the state secretariat Nabanna to monitor the situation. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will stay in the control room during the period.The neighbouring Bangladesh which also shares a border with West Bengal, is also monitoring the situation. "All the boats and fishing trawlers have been ordered to come close to the coast as a precautionary measure. Tomorrow (Monday) we will have a better idea where it is heading," new agency AFP quoted Bangladesh Meteorological Department senior weather forecaster Bazlur Rashid, as saying on Sunday.Cyclone Yaas is set to hit days after the severe cyclonic storm, Tauktae, wreaked havoc along India's west coast, leaving a trail of destruction behind.The storm left over 100 people dead and damaged thousands of houses in Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. Besides at least 70 people died after a barge sank in the Arabian Sea during the storm.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-is-bracing-for-another-severe-cyclonic-storm-yaas-101621824750126.html

"External Affairs Minister will have two interactions with business forums on economic and Covid-related cooperation between India and the US," said the ministry statement.India is engaged in talks with various US entities involved in Covid vaccines production and is looking forward to procuring and subsequently producing these vaccines. The issue of vaccine procurement is expected to be a key agenda item during Jaishankar's interaction with US leadership and other stakeholders.The US has already announced that it is going to distribute 80 million vaccines from its stockpile to countries in need.With India hit badly by the second Covid wave, efforts of New Delhi will focus on getting the maximum and also looking for tie-ups with vaccine developers to produce in India.US has a stockpile 60 million Astra Zeneca vaccine doses and also Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines.US is playing a lead role in assisting India's fight against the Covid-19 virus.

24-05-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear PIL over financial stress to borrowers due to Covid-19||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the financial stress faced by the borrowers during Covid-19 time. The PIL has been filed by a lawyer Vishal Tiwari and seeks directions to the Centre to take measures to overcome the financial stress.The petition will be heard by a two-judge vacation bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah.The PIL sought direction to the Centre to permit all the lending (financial) institutions to grant interest-free moratorium period for term loan and defer the payment of loan instalments for a period of six months or till the situation from Covid-19 normalises.It has also sought a direction from the Centre to banks and other financial institutions to not take strict action against the property of a borrower for six months, citing the tough lives of daily wage earners which has been affected by lockdown-like measures imposed due to the pandemic."Their financial burden should be decreased and citizens should not lose their dignity. Financial policies are made by the government but in the present time above financial policies, the question is of survival. And the population of our nation should survive with dignity and without any stress," the petitioner said in his plea.In March this year, the Supreme Court ordered banks against charging borrowers any penal interest or compound interest (interest on interest) on loans during the moratorium on repayment of loans from March to August 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.It rejected a request by individuals and traders’ associations for waiver of complete interest during the moratorium.The court clarified any penal interest or compound interest charged by banks for non-payment of any loan amount during moratorium shall be refundable. And if the bank is not in a position to refund, the same shall be adjusted in the loan amount, it added.The bench said decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-pil-over-financial-stress-to-borrowers-due-to-covid19-101621819972118.html

Sandhu, the nephew of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, died recently due to post-Covid complications."When the government wants to talk, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will talk,” Tikait said, asserting that it has to be about repealing the Centre's new farm laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 protesting farmer unions, on Friday had written to the prime minister, urging resumption of talks over the three farm laws they have been agitating against since November last year.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three central laws.A government panel had met farmers leaders on January 22. There have been no talks between the two sides since January 26 when the farmers' tractor rally in the national capital turned violent.Tikait said May 26 will mark six months of the farmers' protest at Delhi borders."For six months, farmers have been protesting at border points, but the government is not listening,” he said.Twelve major opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, Left parties, SP, NCP and the DMK, on Sunday extended their support to a countrywide protest call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on May 26.According to Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni, farmers in large numbers from Karnal district on Sunday left for the Singhu border as farmers will be observing May 26 as "black day" to mark six months of their protest.Farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.The government, however, has maintained the three central laws are pro-farmer.

24-05-2021||India||Wrestler Sushil arrested over colleague’s murder in stadium||Double Olympic medallist, Sushil Kumar, wanted in the murder of fellow wrestler Sagar Dhankad, was arrested by the Delhi Police on Sunday morning from the outskirts of the Capital after being on the run for 19 days and sent to police custody for six days by a city court.Kumar and his five associates are wanted by the police after Dhankad, a former junior national champion, was beaten to death inside the Chhatrasal Stadium, the wrestling hub in northwest Delhi, on May 4. Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for Kumar’s arrest.The Chhatrasal Stadium has virtually been Kumar’s home since his early days in the sport. He is the only Indian to win two individual Olympic medals, bronze at 2008 Beijing and silver at 2012 London, where he was the flag-bearer. He is also the only Indian to win a world championship, in Russia in 2010.Delhi Police deputy commissioner (special cell), Pramod Kushwah, announced the arrest of Kumar and his accomplice Ajay. “Both have been charged with murder, attempt to murder, assault, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and under other relevant sections, including the Arms Act,” Kushwah said. Police said the two were arrested from Mundka in outer Delhi when they came on a scooter to borrow money from a contact. The Delhi Police special cell acted on information received from Punjab, where the two men had taken shelter.“As per our information and surveillance, hours after the murder took place, Kumar along with his associates had fled to Haridwar. They had switched off their cell phones and were frequently changing locations to evade arrest. In the past 19 days, they went to Rishikesh and then to Dehradun. They then stayed at a few places in Haryana and went to Punjab. Late on Saturday night, we got information that Kumar will come to Mundka along with another of his wanted associate. We set a trap and arrested both soon after they were spotted near a metro station,” said an investigator, who was part of the operation but did not wish to be named.Another officer said questioning the two men and detailed analysis of call logs and other technical evidence will lead the police to the remaining accused. A non-bailable warrant was issued against Kumar and six others on May 15 and a lookout circular on May 10.Dhankad and his two friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, were allegedly assaulted by Kumar and his friends inside the stadium. Dhankad subsequently died. Police believe the two groups clashed over a disputed flat in Model Town area that Kumar had rented to Dhankad. Investigators believe a dispute over rent snowballed into the clash. The day after the clash, police arrested one Prince Dalal and recovered a video clip from his phone that purportedly shows Kumar and others assaulting Dhankad and his friends.Sagar’s father, Ashok told ANI: “There is strong evidence against him (Kumar), severe punishment should be given to him. I have full faith in law.”Kumar’s father-in-law and wrestling coach Satpal Singh did not respond to calls. A person close to the wrestler’s family said: “The family is naturally very disturbed. It’s not only the family, but when something of this sort has happened, relatives and people who are close to him are also worried.”Delhi Metropolitan Magistrate, Divya Malhotra, sent Kumar to six days in police custody saying the “allegations against the accused are grave in nature”. The court allowed police to interrogate Kumar and co-accused Ajay, noting that a number of persons, including notorious gangs based outside Delhi, are involved and are yet to be arrested.“The CCTV installed at the place of incident has allegedly been tampered with and there is no sign of its DVR. All these points require detailed investigation by the police,” the order said. The police had sought custody for 12 days.Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that five persons, including Dhankad, were abducted from Model Town and Shalimar Bagh, brought to Chhatarsal Stadium and mercilessly beaten up by the accused persons and their associates with sticks and fire arms.He submitted that more than 15 people are suspected to be involved. A loaded gun with live cartridges was recovered from a vehicle parked outside the stadium, and subsequently some sticks were also recovered. Kumar’s interrogation was required to ascertain motive, recover the weapon used and the clothes he wore during the incident.“We have to establish the chain of incidents and need the custody of Kumar for recreation of the scene of crime. We have to recover the mobile and SIM of the accused…. The camera at the stadium was dismantled and he took away the DVR of the place. This has to be recovered.”BS Jakhar, Kumar’s advocate, opposed remand and said all the things could be recovered in 3-4 days. He said the pistol found in Kumar’s car is a legal weapon issued by the Delhi police.He said Kumar is a celebrated wrestler and not some notorious criminal who may flee from justice. “Rather he has clean antecedents and has been falsely implicated in the case only to extort money. Moreover, both the accused persons are ready to cooperate in the investigation,” he said.Kumar, a senior commercial manager with Northern Railway, is on deputation to the Delhi government and was posted as Officer on Special Duty at the Chhatrasal Stadium. He is also president of the School Games Federation of India.“Sushil Kumar is one of our star wrestlers; he has been a motivation for so many young wrestlers. To see him in this situation is very sad and disappointing,” wrestling federation assistant secretary, Vinod Tomar, said.(With inputs from Avishek Roy)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrestler-sushil-arrested-over-colleague-s-murder-in-stadium-101621813978996.html
24-05-2021||India||Now, Ghaziabad hospital reports 7 cases of ‘white fungus’ infection||As many as seven recovered Covid patients have been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis, commonly known as white fungus, so far in Ghaziabad.According to the health department, while cases of white fungus are new, as many as 41 patients of mucormycosis or black fungus are being treated in the district as of now. However, at least three patients in the district have developed both the fungal infections, doctors said.The Harsh ENT Hospital in Raj Nagar has a total of 26 such patients – seven are patients of white fungus while the rest are black fungus patients.Doctors at the hospital said that white fungus in the patients was confirmed on the basis of histopathology reports.“Invasive aspergillosis or white fungus or is a post-Covid complication in which the infection goes to the lungs and causes pneumonia, while black fungus takes a different route and goes to the sinus, eyes and further to the brain. Three of our 26 patients have developed both the fungi. These infections develop in the post-Covid stage in patients, after 15-30 days (of testing negative),” said Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT surgeon, who is treating the patients.Invasive aspergillosis is a rapidly progressive, often fatal infection that occurs in patients who are severely immunosuppressed. In this case, doctors said, most patients are those who have recovered from Covid who had low immunity because of steroidal drugs they were administered to fight the coronavirus disease.“These are mostly found in diabetic patients. While black fungus can be operated upon and taken out from the eyes and sinus, the white fungus has only one mode of treatment – through injections as – parts of the lungs cannot be taken out. While patients are administered Amphotericin injections, those suffering from white fungus are also given posaconazole injections and tablets, in addition. All seven patients suffering white fungus have mild to moderate symptoms,” Dr Tyagi added.Eleven of the mild to moderate symptoms of black fungus and getting treatment through the OPD and staying in home isolation, the doctor added.Doctors at Max Hospital, Vaishali said that they have 13 patients getting treatment for black fungus and two of these are likely to be discharged Monday.“Of these, a couple of patients have mild mucormycosis while others have sino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis, where eyes and brain are involved. In a couple of cases, enucleation (removal of eye) was needed. There is another patient who would need mandibular (lower jaw) reconstruction, like the one needed in cancer patients. Two patients, who had mild symptoms are to be discharged after successful endoscopic treatment,” said Dr Sharad Joshi, principal consultant, department of pulmonology at Max Hospital, Vaishali.The district’s chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, said that the 41 patients in Ghaziabad getting treatment for these fungal infections include those from outside the district as well.“The drug posaconazole is effective in cases of white fungus, and is easily available. It has been seen that such infections have developed in Covid-recovered patients. We have directed hospitals to ensure proper hygiene and proper cleaning of equipment, including oxygen pipelines,” Dr Gupta said.“For cases of black fungus which require the drug amphotericin b, we have asked hospitals to refer patients to higher centres,” the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-ghaziabad-hospital-reports-7-cases-of-white-fungus-infection-101621813575801.html
24-05-2021||India||Call on Class 12 exam by June 1 after state inputs||A high-level meeting called by the Union ministry of education on Sunday to discuss the feasibility of conducting CBSE Class 12 exams remained inconclusive, even as officials said there was “broad consensus” that the test must be held for a limited number of subjects and with a shorter duration after the Covid-19 situation comes under control.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” said a decision on the matter was likely to be taken by June 1.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has proposed to conduct exams between July and August, tentatively, and results may be announced in September, an official with knowledge of the matter said. Around 1,400,000 students are scheduled to appear in CBSE Class 12 exams this year.At least two states, Maharashtra and Delhi, were of the opinion at the meeting that the exams should not be conducted amid the pandemic. Several states also raised the demand for vaccinating students and teachers before conducting the exams, the official said on condition of anonymity. The Centre has asked states to submit their detailed suggestions on the matter by Tuesday.The virtual meeting was convened to decide on the Class 12 board exams and subsequent entrance examinations that were postponed earlier due to the second wave of Covid-19 across the country.Pokhriyal said that an “informed” and “collaborative” decision will be taken on Class 12 exams at the earliest. During the meeting, he also discussed “how important Class 12 exams are to decide the future of students”.“The meeting was extremely fruitful as we received immensely valuable suggestions. I have requested the state governments to send me their detailed suggestions by May 25. I am confident we will be able to arrive at an informed, collaborative decision regarding the exams and remove the uncertainty among students’ and parent’s minds by informing them of our final decision at the earliest. I want to reiterate that both students’ and teachers’ safety, security, and future are supremely important to us,” he tweeted.The education ministry issued a statement that said: “Various options regarding the methodology, process, duration and timings of the exams were discussed. While a broad consensus was there, however, it was decided that States and UTs may like to further examine the matter and send their feedback in writing by the 25th of May, 2021.”The meeting was chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by several other ministers including Pokhriyal, minister of women and child development Smriti Irani, and information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar. CBSE officials, education ministers of all states, education secretaries, and chairpersons of the state examination boards were also present at the meeting.During the meeting, two options proposed by CBSE for conducting Class 12 exams were discussed at length. In the first option, the examination for major subjects may be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format” like previous years, and for the minor subjects, “marks can be calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects.”Nineteen of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. “Conducting exams in this mode will only be possible if the board has three months and another 45 days for compartment exams,” according to the document.The second option involves multiple changes, including conducting exams at schools where the students are enrolled, reducing the duration of examination, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer type questions. The process, as per the second proposal, can be completed in 45 days and results can be declared within 15 days of completion of the exams.According to the tentative timeline provided by CBSE, under the first option, the pre-exam activities may take place from July 1 to July 31 and the exams will be held from August 1 to August 20. The tentative result date will be September 20.Under the second option, the pre-exam activities will tentatively take place between July 10 and July 15. The first phase of the examination will be held between July 15 and August 1, while the second phase will take place between August 5 and August 26. The tentative date for the result will be September 5.A senior official who attended the meeting said that at least eight states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, demanded vaccination for children and teachers before exams are conducted. “Majority of the states suggested that the exams could be conducted for only the main subjects in shorter duration as suggested by the CBSE in its option B… The ministry will compile all the suggestions received by the states and UTs and then a final call will be taken after consulting with the higher authorities,” the official said.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also attended the meeting, said his government was not in favour of conducting exams amid the pandemic. “The consensus of the entire education community is that conducting exams is important but not by putting our students and teachers at risk. As a guardian of the State, Delhi Government is taking a stand to keep the safety and security of our students as the first and most important priority. Until we are able to vaccinate our students, we should not even think of administering the 12th Board Exams,” Sisodia said.Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad said: “Keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic situation ..., the option of a ‘no-examination route’ for class 12th students should be actively examined...Our focus should now be in evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers & eligible students, and safe resumption of schools, colleges campuses for the next academic year.”Among the states that were in favour of conducting the exams were Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Bihar. Punjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla suggested that the exams of only three elective subjects be held. “If the education boards conduct examinations for elective subjects, it will be easy to maintain social distancing and other mandatory protocols in view of the pandemic,” he said.Officials in the Bihar education board suggested that exams should be conducted in the online mode.Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Sunday assured the Union education minister that their government was fully prepared to conduct the CBSE Class 12 examinations. “Since only a few thousands appear in the CBSE examination from Uttar Pradesh, there will be no problem in conducting the examination the manner in which the CBSE board wants.”Many students have been running social media campaigns demanding the cancellation of Class 12 exams amid the pandemic. A plea has also been filed in the Supreme Court asking for directions to the Centre, CBSE, and the CISCE to cancel the Class 12 examinations.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-class-12-exam-by-june-1-after-state-inputs-101621812020403.html

24-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Union government, and the governments of many states (Uttar Pradesh is a case in point, but the list includes even progressive states such as Tamil Nadu) have been accused of turning a blind eye to (in the case of the former) or actively orchestrating (in the case of the latter) the under-reporting of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).How do you under-report deaths from Covid-19?Technically, this is possible in two ways, one generic and the other, specific.One, every year, in India, a certain number of deaths do go unreported. The dead are buried or cremated locally and informally (which means a graveyard or cemetery is rarely their final resting place) and the families do not bother to register the deaths, because there is nothing to be gained by doing so. In fact, applying for and receiving a death certificate may actually involve costs. Conversations I have had with government officials, volunteers at NGOs, and statisticians all converge on the point that these numbers have been coming down over the years. Over the past seven years, especially, India’s efficiency of welfare-delivery has greatly improved, with at least some of this welfare being in the form of a cash transfer into an Aadhaar-enabled bank account. In such cases, should the next of kin want to claim the balance lying in these after the account-holder’s death, they need a death certificate. It’s a simple cost-benefit equation.Two, in the current scenario, where states want to showcase their effective handling of Covid-19, it’s easy to misreport a cause of death. For instance, some of the same government officials and volunteers at NGOs tell me that, anecdotally, they are seeing a spike in deaths from diseases such as typhoid in some of India’s most backward states. HT’s own reportage shows that in many rural areas, testing is inadequate, and when someone dies, local health officials can pretty much decide how they died.Few states follow Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines on testing the dead for Covid-19. And even when those who test positive for Covid-19, and are hospitalised for the illness pass on, death audit committees — most states have one — often ascribe Covid-19 deaths to co-morbidities.Apart from the sheer dishonesty involved, such under-reporting affects our understanding of the pandemic itself, and its current and future trajectory in the country. I also believe lying about this disrespects the dead more than publishing photographs of funeral pyres or hundreds of shallow graves on river-beds. For reasons that have to do with morality, good governance, and science, both the federal government and the states need to address this issue (this is definitely more worthy of their attention and time than an editorial in The Lancet or the nomenclature of a variant of the virus).I’d like to suggest that the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner work with the states (which, in turn, will have to work with municipalities and corporations) on compiling a 12-year database of deaths. The long period average, between 2010 and 2019, by district and cause, can be the base. The deviation from these in 2020, irrespective of the mentioned cause of death, represent the excess deaths on account of Covid-19. And it is important to start updating this year’s deaths in the database too. Only this will provide a true picture of the pandemic’s cost, in terms of human lives, in India. And only this will provide an accurate epidemiological perspective of the pandemic’s run through the country — and help prepare for the third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101621811046286.html

A huge cache of weapons were recovered...,” he added.With Agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-dnla-militants-killed-in-assam-encounter-101621810808792.html
24-05-2021||India||PM Modi reviews steps ahead of Cyclone Yaas||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reviewed the preparedness of states and central government agencies ahead of the expected landfall of Cyclone Yaas – a low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal has intensified into a depression that will cross the West Bengal and Odisha coasts on May 26 as a “very severe cyclonic storm” – and called for the timely evacuation of people.India has placed its military aircraft and warships on standby for rescue and relief ahead of Cyclone Yaas making landfall on the country’s eastern coast on May 26, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. Army, navy and coast guard relief teams are also ready to be deployed to assist civil authorities at short notice, the officials said.At a high-level meeting, the Prime Minister asked officials to work in close coordination with states to ensure the safe evacuation of people from high-risk areas, and to ensure that the time duration of outages of power supply and communication network are minimum, a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.The Centre and states likely to be affected by Yaas have enhanced their vigilance and preparedness amid fresh memories of Tauktae – the strongest Arabian Sea cyclone in over 20 years – and the havoc wreaked by Amphan last year. The fact that the crossing of the cyclone, by current estimates, coincides with the spring tide (which could mean more storm surges) is worrying, according to experts.“It is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal between the Paradip and Sagar islands by evening of 26th May as a very severe cyclonic storm,” it added. The state governments as well as the Centre are preparing for the cyclone that will bring winds with a speed ranging 155-165 kmph and gusting to 185 kmph.At the meeting, Modi asked officials to ensure proper coordination and planning with state governments so that there is no disruption in Covid-19 treatment and vaccination in hospitals. He called for involving various stakeholders such as coastal communities and industries, and reaching out to them and sensitising them, the PMO said.The ministry of home affairs is reviewing the situation and is in touch with the state governments, union territories and the central agencies concerned. It has released the first instalment of SDRF in advance to all states, and the National Disaster Response Force has pre-positioned 46 teams which are equipped with boats, tree-cutters, telecom equipment in five states and UT. In addition, 13 teams were being airlifted on Sunday for deployment and 10 teams were kept on standby, the PMO said. Union home minister Amit Shah, other ministers and senior officials attended the meeting with the PM.The Indian Air Force has kept one C-17, one IL-76, three C-130s, four An-32s and two Dornier transport aircraft on readiness for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, IAF spokesperson Wing Commander Ashish Moghe said on Sunday. “Additionally, 11 Mi-17 V5s, two Chetaks, three Cheetahs, two Dhruvs and seven Mi-17 helicopters are also on alert for any eventuality,” he said.As of Sunday, the IAF airlifted 950 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel and 70 tonnes of cargo from Jamnagar, Varanasi, Patna and Arakonnam to Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Port Blair in 15 aircraft.The navy, which was at the centre of rescue and relief efforts in Arabian Sea in the aftermath of Cyclone Tauktae, has also shifted into overdrive to respond to the situation likely to unfold along the eastern coast.The armed forces have commenced preparations to mitigate the impact of Cyclone Yaas, the defence ministry said.“The Indian Navy, fresh from HADR and rescue operations on the western coast, has moved 10 HADR pallets to Bhubaneswar and Kolkata, while five HADR pallets are ready at Port Blair. Eight ships of the Eastern Naval Command and Andaman and Nicobar Command have been embarked with HADR bricks (relief material) to provide succour to the people likely to be impacted,” the ministry said in a statement.Four diving teams and 10 flood relief columns are ready in Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Chilika for providing assistance to the civil authorities at short notice, the officials said. Also, seven flood relief teams and two diving teams are ready at different locations in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Naval aircraft and helicopters in Visakhapatnam and Port Blair are on alert to carry out search and rescue missions, the officials said.“Eight flood relief columns and three engineer task forces of the Indian Army are ready for immediate deployment on requisition by the civil administration. The armed forces are in constant touch with the civil administration of the affected states. Armed forces teams are aware of the need to keep the road and rail links open to ensure uninterrupted supply of life saving oxygen and drugs required for treatment at Covid hospitals,” the statement added.The ministry said the Indian Coast Guard has also mobilised its assets.“All ashore, afloat and aviation units are on high alert and ICG ships and aircraft have been deployed in Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea,” said another statement.“In addition, 31 coast guard disaster relief teams with inflatable boats, lifebuoys and lifejackets are on standby. Medical teams and ambulances have also been kept on standby for swift mobilisation,” it added.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-steps-ahead-of-cyclone-101621810110207.html
24-05-2021||India||Aashritha V Olety is India’s 1st woman flight test engineer||In yet another first for women in the Indian military, an officer of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has graduated from the Air Force Test Pilot School as the country’s first woman flight test engineer, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday.Squadron Leader Aashritha V Olety is the first and only woman in the IAF qualified for the role, and as a flight test engineer, she will be responsible for evaluating aircraft and airborne systems before their induction into the armed forces, said one of the officials. Olety, a native of Karnataka, has graduated as part of the 43rd Flight Test Course after completing a one-year course at the pilot school.Excluding the medical wing in which women have been serving for decades, the army accounts for 6,807 women officers, the IAF 1,607 and the navy has 704 women officers. In percentage terms, women still form a small part of the military -- 0.56% of the army, 1.08% of the air force and 6.5% of the navy.Test pilots, test engineers and test instrumentation engineers form an important team in test flying, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), a former test pilot and test flying instructor. “It’s a challenging avenue that requires theoretical and practical experience to test aircraft,” Bahadur said.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened for them at a steady pace. There are a total 9,118 women serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament in February.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. The navy has also opened more avenues for women in recent years . Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aashritha-v-olety-is-india-s-1st-woman-flight-test-engineer-101621808906610.html

24-05-2021||India||Kamal Nath booked for ‘maligning image of India’ with variant remark||Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath was booked on Sunday for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by claiming that the “Indian variant” of the coronavirus was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic, police said.The case was registered on the complaint of medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang, and other BJP leaders. BJP leaders alleged that Nath held a virtual press conference and blamed the “Indian variant” for the second wave. BJP leaders also lodged the complaint on a video in which Nath is seen addressing Congress MLAs on the issue of shortage of fertilizers and other issues and telling them it is the right opportunity to start a fire so that farmers would get justice.The case has been registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and section 54 (punishment for false warning) of the Disaster Management Act by crime branch, said Irshad Wali, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police.According to the FIR, “Kamal Nath said corona started with Chinese variant but now it is Indian variant of Covid-19 which is responsible for the second wave and many countries have suspended flights due to the Indian variant. Nath also said Indians who are working and studying in foreign countries are facing trouble due to it. But in real, foreign countries are trying to help India by sending important things to fight against the epidemic. Nath tried to misguide people and to create disturbance in the country.”“Nath also violated the norms of WHO in which the organisation clearly said no variant of virus should be named after a country, person, organisation or bird’s name,” the FIR said.The FIR also mentioned that Nath tried to spread anarchy by telling the Congress MLAs to start a fire to ensure justice for farmers.Minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Nath and other Congressmen are trying to create unrest in India and Madhya Pradesh by doing dirty politics as they had done during the 1984 riots. Nath insulted our country internationally and he should have been booked under sedition charges.”After the FIR, Nath said, “People who lost family members due to shortage of oxygen, injections, beds and other facilities during the second wave should also register an FIR against the heartless chief minister and other ministers of MP. People, who lost their family members due to Covid 19 and their deaths have not been included as Covid deaths, should also register an FIR against the CM and his cabinet ministers.”Former minister and Congress MLA Jitu Patwari said, “The BJP-led state government is misusing power to hide the data and the real pain of Covid-infected people. They are not concerned about India’s image but they are more concerned about the Prime Minister and BJP’s image. They should book all the Congress leaders because we will not keep mum on this lie of the state and the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-booked-for-maligning-image-of-india-with-variant-remark-101621807675370.html
24-05-2021||India||Unified agency mooted for cross-border crimes||India should have Integrated Law Enforcement Centres (ILECs) on all its borders on the lines of the United States’ Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the UK’s Border Agency and the European Union’s Frontex to deal with cross-border crimes including infiltration, terrorism, smuggling of drugs, cattle, fake currency, arms, etc., the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has recommended to the Centre.In a detailed report, prepared by IPS officer Santosh Mehra (additional director general – BPRD) and submitted recently to the ministry of home affairs (MHA), it was stated that the ILECs, working inside the existing Integrated Check Posts (ICPs), will have the mandate to register, investigate and dispose of all types of cross-border crimes with jurisdiction clearly defined and coinciding with government regulations with respect to border guarding forces.They will maintain a wealth of cross-border crime data and process it for short-, medium- and long-term trends. “Various factors affecting border security, such as political, economic, social, technological and legal environments etc. will be monitored. The data will be collated from different stakeholder agencies, mass-and-social-media, as well as cross-border sources,” according to the report, reviewed by HT.Subsequently, the ILECs will establish a situation room, where on the basis of collected, collated and analysed information from various sources, near real-time situation of the borders will be built up; and on the basis of continuous inflows of information, such situation will be updated. “On the basis of time-series data, the trends of border-crimes in a particular sector of border will be analyzed and utilized for planning routine operations by border guarding forces,” the report said.It has been recommended that each ILEC can have small self-sustaining investigative units of Customs, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), National Investigation Agency (NIA), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), local police, Anti-Trafficking (Human) Cells, Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Bureau of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and wildlife wing of ministry of environment, apart from officials from border guarding forces.Currently, all these agencies work in silos when it comes to border crimes.“There are different agencies active on (India’s) land borders operating within the silos of their specific mandate striving for agency[1]specific micro-level optimization with lesser degree of inter-agencies cooperation, coordination and complementarity. In fact, many a time, inter agencies competition leads to sub-optimal outcome at national level. There are instances of both gaps as well as overlapping in the role, jurisdiction and working of the agencies,” the report said.Citing examples of the US and Europe, the BPRD pointed out that following the 9/11 attacks, the US underwent the biggest government reorganisation by merging 22 agencies from different departments (equivalent to ministries in India) into Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Similarly, Frontex is the main institutional arrangement for the external border management of the European Union; it covers all border-related threats of the EU. Likewise, the UK Border Agency was formed in 2008 by the merger of Border and Immigration Agency, UK Visas and Port of entry functions of HM Revenue and Customs, to look after all border crimes. Australia and Canada, too, have similar institutions.Mehra has stated that the ILECs will lead to synergy in efforts of different agencies. “The overall effectiveness of agencies while working in unison is likely to scale up in comparison to the existing situation, where they are working in their respective silos. For example, the powers of interception and electronic surveillance available with IB/RAW etc. can be complemented with the expertise available with NCB, the reach and manpower availability of BSF, the investigative skills and experience of the local police (all available under one roof) to detect and destroy modules focused on narco-terrorism,” the report prepared by him said.The report recommends preparing a draft act for the implementation of ILECs.Sameer Patil, fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said: “India has been lacking synergy when it comes to border security management. The ILECs would be very helpful in bringing all agencies together to tackle the border crimes, like Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) - formed after 26/11 Mumbai attacks, has been a success when it comes to counterterrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unified-agency-mooted-for-cross-border-crimes-101621807374018.html

Five male cheetahs and three females will be donated by Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) of South Africa, said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (Wildlife).The translocation of African Cheetah is a part of Government of India to reintroduce the fastest land animal in India after extinction of the Asiatic cheetah in the 1950s.The final call was taken after EWT national Cheetah Metapopulation manager Vincet Van Der Merwe visited Kuno eight days ago to assess the preparations and suitable habitat for cheetahs, said Kumar.Merwe found Kuno National Park to be one of the best habitats for translocation of cheetah in India. He gave a few minor suggestions including fencing to make it more suitable for the cheetah by September, said Kumar.Divisional forest officer, Sheopur, PK Verma said, “The expert, Merwe said Kuno has a perfect grassland and prey base for cheetahs. We have started preparation for translocation.”The central government has allocated ₹14 crore for the project. The state government had earlier projected an estimated expenditure of ₹22 crore under Annual Operation Plan (AOP, said a forest official, who didn’t wish to be quoted.“We don’t want to take any risk because it is a matter of pride for our country and the success of this project will decide the fate of translocation of more cheetahs in India,” said the officer.Additional PCCF (wildlife) JS Chauhan said: “The money will be used for the development of fencing, cutting thorny trees, cages for cheetah and transportation of cheetah from South Africa.”The Supreme Court approved the project in January 2020 and formed a three-member committee comprising of former director Wildlife of India Ranjit Singh, DG of Wildlife of India Dhananjay Mohan and DIG, Wildlife, Ministry of Environment and Forests to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority in translocation of the African cheetah from South Africa and Namibia to India.The expert committee visited four sites in MP and one in Rajasthan to select the suitable habitat for cheetah.

Distinguishable by their long snout, the gharials are considered to be among the most critically endangered crocodiles with an estimated 200-400 remaining in the rivers of Uttar Pradesh as their habitat is threatened due to human encroachment and disruption of population through fishing activities. They are also genetically weak as compared to salt water crocodiles and muggers. Gharials caught accidentally in fishing nets are either hacked to death or have their snout chopped off by fishermen.Divisional forest officer of the Mahanadi wildlife division, HB Udgata said this is the first time in the past 15 years that gharials were seen breeding in natural conditions away from the artificial breeding centres.“Though we have been trying hard to get them to breed, it was not possible due to boating and fishing activities. In the last one year, four forest divisions around the gorge worked together to make the western part of Satkosia totally inviolate by stopping fishing and boating activities. Three of our research assistants also monitored the gharials and their courtship, which paid off,” said Udgata.The DFO said this is the first time that gharials have bred in natural conditions south of the Chambals where they are normally found. “The key was minimising human interference and it worked. They eat only fish and once fishing stopped they had plenty to eat. Given a chance, wildlife can make a stunning comeback,” he said.Only 14 gharials were spotted at the Satkosia gorge in 2019. A gharial project was started in Tikarpada in 1975 with the aim to increase their population as they are not considered as dangerous as other crocodiles.The state forest department in June 2019 released six gharials fitted with radio transmitters from the Nandankanan zoo into the Mahanadi river to track their migratory routes in order to save them from extinction. While two gharials died, one moved to the Luna river in Kendrapara district and covered around 150km. In December 2019, another radio transmitter-fitted gharial was killed by some fishermen in the Mahanadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-instance-of-gharial-breeding-in-natural-habitat-reported-in-odisha-101621806730677.html
24-05-2021||India||12 Opposition parties extend support to farm unions’ stir on May 26||Leaders of twelve major opposition parties, including the Congress, Trinamool Congress, the Left, Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, on Sunday extended their support to a nationwide protest call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha -- a platform of farmer unions -- on May 26, to mark six months of the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws.Farmers have been protesting at five sites in large camps near Delhi’s borders: Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and at Shahjahanpur on the Rajasthan-Haryana border, demanding the rollback of three laws passed in September last year to lift restrictions on trade in farm produce.In a joint statement, signed by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister HD Devegowda, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief ministers Mamata Banerjee, Uddhav Thackeray, M K Stalin and Hemant Soren, said: “We extend our support to the call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to observe a countrywide protest day on May 26 marking the completion of six months of the heroic peaceful Kisan struggle.”The leaders demanded “the immediate repeal of the farm laws and the legal entitlement to the Minimum Support Price of C2+50 per cent as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission”. “The Central Government must stop being obdurate and immediately resume talks with the SKM on these lines,” it said.Other signatories are former CMs Farooq Abdullah and Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, D Raja and Sitaram Yechury.Reacting to the statement, SKM leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said: “Our movement is apolitical but we welcome the support of opposition parties. However, only farmers will participate in our movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-opposition-parties-extend-support-to-farm-unions-stir-on-may-26-101621806443172.html
24-05-2021||India||Barge P305 tragedy: Four more bodies recovered; toll touches 70||The Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) found four more bodies of crew members of barge Papaa305 (P305), which capsized in the Arabian Sea hours after cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast on May 17, on the seventh day of search and rescue (SAR) operation. The toll of the mishap has now touched 70. Meanwhile the wreck of barge P305 was located on the sea bed.Barge P305, which was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the sea, sank about 40 nautical miles west off Mumbai. As Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast, the barge got de-anchored on the night of May 16, and hit a platform while drifting in the rough sea. It sank around 7pm on May 17 in choppy seas amid rough weather, which made search and rescue one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades. Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that chartered the barge and hired its crew, said 261 members on board and Indian Navy and ICG rescued 186 members and found 70 bodies. A tugboat Varaprada carrying 13 crew members also capsized the same day. Two of its members were rescued by the Navy, while 11 are still missing.The agencies claimed on Sunday they found 17 more bodies at different beaches in Raigad district, Palghar and Valsad at Gujarat. Four of them were found to be of the P305 crew. Officials said seven bodies were recovered from Valsad, one from Daman at Gujarat, one from Arnala beach in Palghar district and eight bodies were found at Alibag, Murud, Nagaon and Sasawne in Raigad district, Maharashtra.A police team from Yellow Gate police station, along with those rescued from P305 and Varaprada, went to Valsad to establish the identities. “We are co-ordinating with the local authorities in Raigad, Daman and Valsad to check if the bodies are of any crew members of the cyclone-hit barges or other fishing boats. The team has also gone with rescued crew members for identifications,” said Suhas Hemade, senior inspector, Yellow Gate police station.Some of the bodies are in decomposed condition and bloated so DNA tests are being conducted to ascertain the identity, said an officer from the Yellow Gate police station.“Barge P305 was located on the seabed after systematic search by INS Maker employing advance side scan sonar. The diving started in the morning and managed to pinpoint the sunken wreck of P305 by specialised teams on board INS Maker and no bodies have been found,” said a Navy officer.INS Maker is proceeding to locate the wreck of tug Varaprada and diving operation will be conducted on Monday, added Navy officials. The search and rescue operation by naval and coast guard ships and helicopters will continue in the area to locate the remaining crew of the sunken vessels, said the officer.So far, 45 bodies have been identified in JJ hospital and 44 handed over to their respective families. Several other recovered bodies are in JJ hospital, but the police are securing DNA samples to ascertain their identity for the families, said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barge-p305-tragedy-four-more-bodies-recovered-toll-touches-70-101621804063276.html

24-05-2021||India||Foodgrain stock highest since 2016: Govt data||India registered the highest food grain stock since 2016 this month due to record procurement of wheat from Punjab and Haryana, according to food ministry data.Food Corporation of India (FCI) said it had procured 850.3 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat and rice from farmers across India till May 18; another 260 MT of un-milled rice was also acquired, taking the total stock of grain in government warehouses to over 1,000 MT. This was 38% higher than 2016 when FCI had procured 527.9 MT of wheat and rice. This steadily went up over the years, with 524 MT acquired in May 2017, 607 MT in 2018, 642 MT in 2019 and 642 MT in 2020.A food ministry official said on condition of anonymity that most of it was acquired during the second wave of the pandemic, in April and May, through doorstep collection.Economists, however, questioned why the government couldn’t expand the public distribution system (PDS) to help more people hit hard by the second wave of the pandemic. “To be honest, I am shocked that though the stocks are so high, the central government has not expanded the PDS even though it was abundantly clear last year that many more people needed the food subsidy,” said Reetika Khera, development economist with Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.The government procures grains from farmers across the country to provide rice and wheat under PDS to fulfil its obligation under National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, which mandates that 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population should be provided subsidised grain. Some states such as Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand provide additional food items such as pulses under NFSA to ensure food security of poor families.The ministry website showed that the highest wheat procurement was from Punjab, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Wheat was sown in 31.5 million hectares, 10% higher than last year due to good monsoon. The highest paddy procurement was from Punjab, followed by Haryana, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the ministry said.Haryana said it had, till May 13, transferred ₹14,693 crore as minimum support price (MSP) for wheat directly into the accounts of farmers. In the same period, the Punjab government transferred ₹24,000 crore as MSP to the farmers.Higher procurement has resulted in the lifting of more food grains under PDS. Food ministry data shows 548.04 MT of wheat and paddy was allocated, of which 310.04 MT was distributed to the states. Till May 21, 146 MT of food grains had reached the people.But Khera said it wasn’t enough. “The government is showing no sign of using the food stocks to help the people during this unprecedented crisis that has gone on for a year now, and for which the government is partly responsible,” she said.Several reports coming from different states of people not getting subsidised food grains without ration cards seem to buttress the IIT economist’s argument.PDS covers roughly 800 million people — about 60% of the population — even though NFSA says it should cover 66% or a 100 million more people. This is much less than the government’s own claim made on June 4 last year that a billion people were covered under PDS.Right to Food Campaign, an informal network of organisations and individuals striving for food rights in India, believes that this under-coverage is because of the central government using 2011 population data to fix PDS coverage. As a result, over 400 million people are left to manage without any food support from the government, which is huge considering the loss of livelihood during the pandemic, the network had said in a statement on May 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foodgrain-stock-highest-since-2016-govt-data-101621803171869.html

24-05-2021||India||How Covid-19 scaled Mt Everest||There’s a storm brewing in the Himalayas, and it’s not the usual kind.After nearly a year of no climbs, just a few in early winter, and now a return of climbers from around the world, three things have started to happen. Nepal’s Department of Tourism has given out hundreds of permits, eager for a return to business as usual. Cases of Covid-19 have begun to dot the trails, including the first recorded cases on Mt Everest. And climbers, who have paid upwards of ₹25 lakh for their chance to summit, are waiting it out despite the risk, because there’s been no announcement that permits will be honoured at a later date if they leave.The final touch: The only Covid testing being done at the base camps is informal, conducted by doctors accompanying larger expeditions, and almost all these tests are of the relatively unreliable rapid antigen variety.While international climbers are required to take the more reliable RT-PCR test on arrival in Kathmandu, this protocol isn’t followed uniformly. And there is no protocol for the testing of the Nepali staff who accompany climbing teams. This means that Covid-positive climbers and staff are mingling with others at the base camps, as well as making their way from camp to camp, kitchen to kitchen, and from one mountain to another.Among those caught in this perfect storm were Keval Kakka from Mumbai and Bhagwan Chawale from Pune. They arrived in the mountains in March and watched as things grew steadily worse. In April, they were among 70 climbers to summit Annapurna I, the first mountain to be attempted in the spring season (and incidentally the tenth-highest in the world).The plan had been to attempt multiple summits but amid the rising cases and bad weather, Kakka, a 30-year-old professional mountaineer and trekking guide, gave up and returned home, saying it felt unsafe. Chawale, a 38-year-old officer with the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), waits on.In Kathmandu, meanwhile, lockdown was enforced once again earlier this month, with about 8,000 new cases reported every day. In the mountains, Covid-positive climbers and Sherpas have had to be airlifted mid-climb and put on ventilators. And the climbing community is abuzz with the news of what’s being called an “outbreak” on Everest. (Again, there are no numbers available to quantify the spread because there is no organised testing at the base camps).“Only the teams that had come with their own doctor and testing kits are able to conduct tests,” says Harshvardhan Joshi, 25, a mountaineer from Mumbai, who finally summited Everest on May 23. “Anxiety was rife. It felt like we were sitting on a Covid time-bomb.”He remained on the mountain nonetheless, he adds, because he’d invested years of training and ₹55 lakh in the expedition, and the government showed no signs of extending existing permits.Frozen freewaysThe lack of testing has taken climbers from around the world by surprise. Kakka and Chawale say they first became concerned when no tests were conducted as they and about 15 others made their way from Annapurna to the Dhaulagiri base camp in April end.The first symptoms of Covid-19 at Dhaulagiri surfaced in a team of Sherpas who had spent time together at Tatopani, a village en route the Annapurna I base camp, adds Kakka. (The two mountains are in close proximity; Dhaulagiri is the seventh-highest mountain in the world; incidentally, the Himalayas are home to 9 of the world’s 14 highest peaks).Spanish mountaineer Carlos Soria Fontan’s team had brought a few rapid antigen kits, and it was they who started testing people at the Dhaulagiri base camp. “About 50 people tested positive, of the 80 present. They were short on kits but more were made available by their agency,” says Kakka.Worse, he adds, there were no precautions being taken. “Four or five Sherpas were sharing tents, when there’s no need to do so at base camp. Those who had tested positive were walking around and touching things in the kitchen. Supplies coming in by helicopter were not sanitised or sterilised. And while evacuating people from base camp, they were putting the healthy ones with those who had tested positive, saying the latter had mild symptoms.”Between the shortage of manpower after key members of the rope-fixing team tested positive, and heavy snow dumps and avalanche conditions, most abandoned their climb on Dhaulagiri. Kakka, who was to also climb Makalu, the fifth-highest mountain in the world, decided to drop all plans and return to Mumbai.He is fortunate that he could — there is still a weekly flight operating from Kathmandu to Delhi. All other international flights have been cancelled until May 31. Some mountaineers are trying to charter private planes instead. “It’s not worth risking your life there. I just didn’t feel safe,” Kakka says. “They gave out so many permits just to run businesses and forgot about what could happen.”A red zone on EverestEverest, meanwhile, looks set to become a red zone for Covid-19. Nepal’s Department of Tourism (DoT) has issued a record 408 permits for Everest this season; another 125 permits have been issued for neighbouring Lhotse, which uses the same base camp and follows most of the same route (a number of climbers will be attempting both; among those attempting Lhotse is Chawale from Pune). Add in the support staff, and that’s more than 1,500 people at base camp since April.“Even the big expeditions that have their own doctors and kits have only rapid antigen tests,” says Dr Hemant Leuva, 48, a climber and general surgeon from Ahmedabad who is attempting Everest this season.When he realised the Everest ER team from the non-profit Himalayan Rescue Association had no provisions for testing (WhatsApp messages to an ER official at base camp have gone unanswered), he asked his wife Surbhi, also a doctor and mountaineer, to bring rapid antigen test kits with her when she arrived in early May.Surbhi arrived with 25 kits and so far, five of the staff and one climbing member have tested positive and been evacuated. “But there won’t be any official record of how many tests have been conducted, how many have tested positive or how many were evacuated,” Dr Leuva points out.Climbers are known to descend from base camp to villages lower down to rest, before returning for the summit push. That poses an added risk to both sides. Those who have the facility have been testing members on return. The rest simply continue up the mountain.Storms aheadCiting Covid-linked safety concerns, a number of teams have called off their Everest expeditions and left. On May 10, Spanish mountaineer Alex Txikon in a statement said he and his teammates Sendoa Elejalde and Inaki Makazaga were abandoning their climb “out of a feeling of responsibility” after “assessing the health situation.”Another agency, Mountain Trip, suspended its expedition on May 22, saying in a statement that their Sherpa team was “hit hard with Covid” and they saw “no opportunity to summit within safety margins”.China has called off all expeditions on Everest from the north side in Tibet. Pakistan has announced that Nepali citizens won’t be allowed in for the start of the climbing season that begins there in June, adding that any climbers who have been in Nepal in the three weeks prior won’t be allowed into Pakistan either.After calling off his Everest expedition, Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who runs Furtenbach Adventures, painted a grim picture in a social media post on May 16. “We tried to do everything right... We were even more careful when the Covid outbreak in basecamp started, when we heard from the first teams with Covid cases, the government denying these cases... I was calling for a mass test in base camp. The call was ignored,” Furtenbach wrote.Status quoThe Nepal authorities have continued to deny a Covid-19 outbreak in the Himalayas since reports of the first case there emerged in mid-April. Mira Acharya, director of the DoT, visited the Everest base camp and told Reuters: “Doctors at the base camp said the situation was not as serious as it was reported. I did not see any terrible situation there.”A press release dated May 7, posted on the website of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, refutes news of Covid-19 cases at base camp, calling them “rumours”. There has been no word from the government on this since.The lack of acknowledgement has a lot to do with the revenues and livelihoods linked to climbing in Nepal. A permit to climb Everest costs each climber $11,000 (about ₹8 lakh); the most affordable price for an entire climb would be about $35,000 (about ₹25.5 lakh). The tourism industry overall suffered losses of $330 million last year, according to Nepal government estimates.“So many of the staff didn’t announce any symptoms of Covid because they didn’t want to lose their income,” Joshi says. “But there are choppers flying in each day and they could easily carry samples back to Kathmandu.”While Joshi’s expedition is done, the wait continues for many others, with now no hope that permits will be extended as they’ve been in the past. The climbing season ends on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-19-scaled-mt-everest-101621799223405.html
24-05-2021||India||Panic buying in Tamil Nadu as shops open ahead of intense lockdown||Hundreds of people thronged markets and showrooms as the Tamil Nadu government came under criticism for opening up all shops except malls, over the weekend, ahead of the one-week intense lockdown that will be imposed from May 24. To allow people to stock up provisions and vegetables, the government relaxed restrictions on May 22 and May 23 and allowed shops to remain open till 9 pm during which public transport also functioned. This not only led to panic buying but people were also seen shopping for textiles, jewellery, visiting salons and heavy traffic jams were seen in Chennai, Madurai and Trichy among other districts. During the extended lockdown, no shops will be allowed to open and the horticulture department will supply vegetables and fruits through 4,380 mobile carts. Only drug stores will remain open and supply of milk, water and newspapers will continue. The state’s on-going lockdown was from May 10 to 24 which has been extended on the advice of medical experts who estimate Covid-19 cases to peak by the end of May. Following that, chief minister MK Stalin also led an all-party meeting of legislators before making the announcement on Saturday. “It is sad that people treated the lockdown like a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid-19,” said Stalin at the meeting. He added that health and frontline workers cannot be burdened more and that the pandemic had to be brought under control so that educational institutions can also function soon.The expert committee had recommended extending the lockdown by at least two-weeks and to make it stringent as cases and deaths are continuing to rise and the time can be used for increasing health infrastructure, testing and surveillance. “We give strategic advice based on the disease. But how the government implements a lockdown is their administrative decision,” said one of the members on the condition of anonymity. “There is no other choice except going for a continued lockdown as cases are rising fast in the districts. Though Covid-19 cases in Chennai aren’t rising anymore, 99% of ICUs are occupied, hospitals are unable to shift people from oxygen support to ICUs, so the decline isn’t enough.”Doctors are concerned that the crowding over the weekend will lead to a spike. “By giving the people a free hand to do anything today and sending a message that it will be strict tomorrow onwards has given a sense of less fear,” said Dr Deepak Subramanian, deputy medical superintendent, GEM hospital, Chennai. “This crowding is not right at this stage. This is going to have an impact in the coming days. Chennai was flattening the curvebut I hope this doesn’t make it worse.”Public health experts are of the opinion that the state could have extended the lockdown by continuing the existing restrictions as they were and shouldn’t have permitted non-essential services. “It is a miscalculation. I don’t see malice, they just botched up,” says Dr J Amalorpavanathan, a public health expert and former member secretary of the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu. “The lockdown was beginning to show its results and they could have continued allowing essentials like buying vegetables for a few hours every day. Everybody will not have bulk cash when a government cart comes, you don’t know at what time it will come and it can’t enter narrow slums. Opening for 24-hours and then closing for a week isn’t logical. The government may not have anticipated what happened today. It’s frightening. I think the workers inside textile and jewellery shops would be the super spreaders because they were exposed to the crowds for more than 8-hours. Most of them wouldn’t have been vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-buying-in-tamil-nadu-as-shops-open-ahead-of-intense-lockdown-101621797664874.html

While the toll jumped to 25,282 across the state, the positivity rate stood at 2.40%, according to the bulletin of the state health department.Bengaluru accounted for 362 fatalities while Bengaluru rural recorded 30 deaths.Despite a dip in daily caseload, fatalities have increased over the last few days, which experts said was bound to happen as there would be a time lag between infection and death.“Deaths come 14 days after the infections are reported. So the deaths you are seeing now are patients from early May when we were at the peak. When infections come down, deaths will be high,” Dr. V. Ravi, neurovirologist and member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) told Hindustan Times in a recent interaction.Karnataka, particularly its capital Bengaluru, has seen a decline in the number of daily caseloads over the last one week. The state reported 25,979 new infections, including 7,494 in Bengaluru. The total number of active cases reduced to 472,986 across Karnataka and 255,842 in Bengaluru. The positivity rate also saw a decline and stood at 20.76%.“Many positives from today’s Covid numbers: Large blue diamond recoveries (35k) continue to outnumber new cases (25k), Large blue diamond new cases fall to 25k after a long time. Large blue diamond positivity rate falls to 20%, Large blue diamond daily testing continues to be robust at 1,25,000,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a post on Twitter.However, the health crisis continues to deteriorate in several districts of Karnataka as the surge moves towards rural regions of the state.There were 18 deaths in Ballari, 11 in Hassan, 15 in Kalaburagi, 12 in Koppala, 13 each in Mandya, Shivamogga and Tumakuru, 22 in Mysuru, 17 in Uttara Kannada, according to the health bulletin.Karnataka reported 195,463 new infections in the last one week till 5 pm on Saturday, according to data from the state Covid-19 war room. The recovery rate is at 78.83%, according to government data.However, the positivity rate across the state has increased, data shows.Belagvi, the border district, had a positivity rate of 44.55% while Ballari, Uttara Kannada, Mysuru, Hassan, Tumakuru, Dharwad, Koppal and Chamarajanagar reported 37.30%, 37.08%, 36.53%, 32.89%, 32.63%, 30.94%, 30.17% and 30.17% respectively.The positivity rate in Karnataka (till 5 pm on Saturday) was 23.61% and 18.84% in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-covid-toll-crosses-25k-with-626-new-deaths-101621796523865.html
24-05-2021||India||Health infra ramped up to fight Covid: Karnataka govt||Bengaluru Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education on Sunday said that the state’s healthcare infrastructure has been ramped up significantly to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.“(The) capacity to test 1,50,000 to 2,00,000 samples per day, availability of 1,015 MT oxygen, availability of more than 22,000 oxygen beds, supply of Remdesivir as per requirement and various other measures initiated by the state government to control the pandemic has invariably ramped up the health infrastructure in the state,” according to a statement from Sudhakar on Sunday.The statement comes at a time when Karnataka is seeing a sharp spike in fatalities even though the daily caseload appears to have stabilised.The state recorded a new high in fatality rate at 2.40% and one of its highest single-day death toll as 626 more died, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Karnataka, particularly its capital Bengaluru, has seen a decline in the number of daily caseloads over the last one week. The state reported 25,979 new infections, including 7,494 in Bengaluru. The total number of active cases reduced to 472,986 across Karnataka and 255,842 in Bengaluru. The positivity rate also saw a decline and stood at 20.76%.Though, Sudhakar maintained that testing has been ramped up from 60,000-70,000 all the way to almost 100,000 per day, experts, however, have attributed the decline in cases to decrease in testing.A senior official of Karnataka’s health department said that it is doing “targeted testing” which prioritises primary and secondary contacts among others.Talking about oxygenated beds, the minister said that the total number of such beds have also been ramped up.“In March 2020 Department of Health and Family Welfare Karnataka had only 1970 oxygenated beds, 444 ICU beds and 610 beds with ventilators. Over the past one year additionally 22,001 oxygenated beds, 1,248 HFNC beds, 701 ICU beds and 1,548 beds with ventilators have been created. These facilities which were earlier restricted to district headquarters have been extended upto taluk and CHC levels,” the minister said.The statements come amid a growing demand for ICU and oxygenated beds as the surge continues in most parts of rural Karnataka.He also added that the state now has sufficient medical oxygen supplies. Karnataka had faced an acute shortage of medical oxygen until about a week ago and there have been arrests of people involved in black marketing of cylinders.Stating that there is no shortage of Remdesivir, Sudhakar said, “In the month of April 2021, purchase order has been given for 2,74,00 vials and (the) received quantity is 1,80,700 vials till date. Again in the month of May 2021, purchase order given for 51,360 vials and received quantity 11,000 vials till date,” he said. He added that a global tender for 5,00,000 vials and tender opened on May 17.He also said that the state government is working towards a comprehensive plan to ensure vaccination for every citizen by November or December.The BS Yediyurappa-led government has announced and cancelled vaccination for people in the age groups between 18-44 years at least three times due to critical shortage of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-infra-ramped-up-to-fight-covid-karnataka-govt-101621796403760.html
24-05-2021||India||Political tensions stare at Karnataka govt as Covid subsides||Bengaluru: The calming of the Covid-19 crisis is likely to make way for resurgence of simmering political tensions in the state of Karnataka, according to people aware of the developments, who hinted at imminent changes within the B S Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.The persons cited above also suggested the possibility of a change in leadership, a topic that has lived through several news cycles ever since the 78-year-old leader assumed the chief minister’s role in July 2019.“Both corona (Covid-19) and by-election results have become a problem for those at the top,” a three-time BJP legislator from Karnataka said, requesting not to be named.Although Yediyurappa did see some success initially, his government came under fire in recent times over the management — or lack of it — of the pandemic from opposition parties, public and its own party in which its image and perception have taken a strong beating, people aware of the developments said.The theory that the BJP does not have a credible replacement for Yediyurappa or the support he enjoys from the Lingayat community, believed to be the single-largest caste group in Karnataka, has withered away with names of persons like Pralhad Joshi being mooted as possible alternatives.The chief minister has also spent a considerable amount of time dousing one crisis after another within his own cabinet to help assuage dented egos of his council of ministers, the persons cited above added.Ever since the pandemic broke out, Yediyurappa’s first biggest task in late March last year was to calm growing tensions between then health minister B Sreeramulu and Dr K Sudhakar, who only had the medical education portfolio then, in which the latter prevailed. However, since then, Sudhakar has also seen his position diluted further and has had his wings clipped, people aware of the developments said. Yediyurappa has changed the head of the state’s task force at least three times with Dr C N Ashwath Narayan now helming affairs. Narayan was made incharge of medicines, Basvaraj Bommai and R Ashok in charge of managing hospital beds, Jagadish Shettar to manage oxygen supplies and Arvind Limbavali handle call centres and war rooms, leaving little for Sudhakar to do.“The final step of implementation goes to the health ministry itself,” a senior party leader said, trying to downplay the alleged marginalising of Sudhakar.Like all his stints in the top chair, Yediyurappa’s fourth tenure as chief minister has been a turbulent one wherein the 78-year-old spent more time tackling the mushrooming political crisis over the pandemic.“Not that there is any lack of capability but there were some issues with the way in which some of them worked,” a minister said, requesting not to be named.The allegations of “bribe-for-bed scam” by Bengaluru Member of Parliament, Tejaswi Surya, was also considered as one of the instances of the party targeting its tallest leader in the state.The relations between Yediyurappa and the BJP’s top brass in Delhi too has soured over the last few months, people aware of the developments said, making it harder for the chief minister to manage the expectations of the population who were, during the 2018 and 2019 elections, made to believe that a common party in state and Centre would be beneficial to the state. But awaiting relief for floods, droughts and even aid during the pandemic from Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre has added to the challenges of the chief minister. Though rebel voices like that of Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur (Vijayapura), appears to have fallen silent over the last few weeks, lack of action against him has bolstered several others to voice their concerns in candid conversation, if not in full public view.No action has been taken against Yatnal so far despite a show-cause notice issued to him in February, according to the party.“There were some initial problems but everything is fine now and there is nothing to state that there will be a change in leadership,” a BJP legislator and spokesperson for the party said on condition of anonymity.The most noticeable disgruntlement is directed towards B Y Vijayendra, the son of the chief minister, who has been accused of running a parallel administration under his fathers aegis. After aiding in two by-poll victories in KR Pete and Sira, the loss at Maski in which turncoat Pratapgouda Patil of the BJP was defeated served as a set back to his political debut. Vijayendra, who enjoys significant clout within the government, is also the state BJP vice-president.“It appears as though imminent decisions are being rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University, told Hindustan Times.He added that there seems to be indications that some kind of ground is being prepared for significant changes, even though it was not being done in a straightforward manner.Legislators and analysts pointed out that by this time next year, Karnataka would be in full poll mode for the 2023 assembly elections.“The longer it takes for them to replace, it may get more expensive,” Narayana added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-tensions-stare-at-karnataka-govt-as-covid-subsides-101621796283829.html
24-05-2021||India||Stalin writes to Rajnath, seeks ‘urgent action’ to trace 16 missing fishermen||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday sought Union defence minister Rajnath Singh’s “immediate intervention” to locate 16 fishermen who went missing near Mangalore coast when cyclone Tauktae led to severe storms in the Arabian Sea and adjoining areas last week. While 12 fishermen belonged to Tamil Nadu, the remaining four hailed from West Bengal. Officials said the mechanised fishing boat named Ajmeer Sha, with a Kerala registration, had ventured from Beypore fishing harbour in Kerala on May 5. “It has been informed that after Tauktae cyclone, there has been no contact with the crew of this boat,” Stalin said in his letter. The state had earlier requested Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC), east, west and the Indian Coast Guard station in Cochin to search and rescue the fishermen but there has been no update on them so far. “This has caused anxiety and distress among the families and fishermen community in the state,” Stalin said, requesting the defence minister for his ‘immediate intervention’ and ‘urgent action’ to rescue the missing fishermen.The letter comes a day after the families of the missing fishermen in Tamil Nadu wrote to the chief ministers of the state, Kerala and West Bengal, seeking assistance in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-writes-to-rajnath-seeks-urgent-action-to-trace-16-missing-fishermen-101621796163810.html
24-05-2021||India||Crowds throng markets as TN eases curbs before complete shutdown||The Tamil Nadu government on Sunday came under the criticism of health experts as hundreds of people thronged markets and showrooms amid a weekend relaxation on services ahead of the complete week-long lockdown from Monday.Barring shopping malls, all shops, delivering both essential and non-essential services, were allowed to run till 9 pm to allow the public to gather enough supplies ahead of the shutdown. However, the decision not only led to panic buying but people were seen shopping for textiles, jewellery among other items, leading to intense traffic in areas such as Chennai, Madurai and Trichy. Shops selling groceries and vegetables will remain shut during the lockdown period. Only the horticulture department will be allowed to supply vegetables and fruits through 4,380 mobile carts.Medical stores will remain open while services such as milk supply, water and newspapers will continue to function. On Sunday, the state recorded 35,482 cases and 422 deaths, according to the daily health bulletin. Expressing concerns over the government’s decision to open all shops, doctors said they feared that the weekend crowding would lead to a Covid spike. “By giving the general public a free hand to do anything today and sending a message that it will be strict from tomorrow onwards has created a sense of less fear,” Dr Deepak Subramanian, deputy medical superintendent, GEM hospital, Chennai, said. “The crowd is not right at this stage. This is going to have an impact in the coming days. The Covid curve in Chennai was flattening but I hope this doesn’t make it worse,” he added. Public health experts opined that the state could have extended the lockdown by continuing with the existing restrictions and shouldn’t have permitted non-essential services to function. “It is a miscalculation. I don’t see malice, they just botched up,” Dr J Amalorpavanathan, a public health expert and former member secretary of Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu, said. “The lockdown was beginning to show its results and they could have continued allowing essentials like buying vegetables for a few hours every day. Everybody will not have bulk cash when a government cart arrives, you don’t know at what time it will come and it can’t enter narrow slums. Opening for 24-hours and then closing for a week isn’t logical. The government may not have anticipated what happened today. It’s frightening. I think workers inside textile and jewellery shops could act as super spreaders because they were exposed to the crowds for more than eight hours. Most of them wouldn’t have been vaccinated.”Reacting to the criticism, P K Sekar Babu, minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, who is also in-charge of Covid-19 control in Chennai, said the weekend relaxation was to ensure people did not suffer or ran out of supplies during the shutdown. “The chief minister gave this two-day window so that people do not suffer during the intense lockdown. If we didn’t allow this time, we would have been criticised for suddenly announcing a lockdown and we would have been questioned over what people would do for food and how they would go back to their hometowns,” he said.The state’s on-going lockdown was imposed from May 10 to 24, which was later extended with no relaxations on the advice of medical experts who estimated Covid-19 cases to peak by the end of May.Chief minister M K Stalin also held an all-party meeting of legislators before making the announcement on Saturday. “It is sad that people treated the lockdown like a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid,” Stalin at the meeting. He added health and frontline workers cannot be burdened further and that the pandemic had to be brought under control so that educational institutions could also resume functioning. The expert committee had recommended extending the lockdown by at least two-weeks and to make it stringent as cases and deaths continued to witness a surge in the state. They believed that the lockdown period could be used for increasing health infrastructure, testing and surveillance. “We give strategic advice based on the disease. But how the government implements a lockdown is their administrative decision,” one of the members said on the condition of anonymity. “There is no other choice except going for a continued lockdown as cases are surging in the districts. Though cases in Chennai aren’t rising anymore, 99% of ICUs are occupied, hospitals are unable to shift people from oxygen support to ICUs, so the decline isn’t enough,” the member added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crowds-throng-markets-as-tn-eases-curbs-before-complete-shutdown-101621796104783.html
24-05-2021||India||TMC MP asks people to file police complaints against Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar||Adding to the acrimony between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Raj Bhawan, the party’s Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee on Sunday asked Bengal citizens to file complaints against governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at every police station in the state so that he can be prosecuted after his term comes to an end. “He is the butcher of the Indian Constitution. I urge people of Bengal to file complaints against him at every police station. I know that a case cannot be started against a governor. But we can do it after his tenure ends. Former governor Jagdeep Dhankhar can be lodged in the Presidency Jail,” Banerjee told reporters. Banerjee, a lawyer, represented urban development minister Firhad Hakim, panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee and Kamarhati legislator Madan Mitra before the Calcutta high court this week after they were arrested on May 17 by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the 2016 Narada sting operation case in which they are accused of taking bribe. They were remanded in judicial custody and taken to Presidency correctional home. Former TMC leader Sovan Chatterjee was also arrested on the same charge. A charge sheet was filed against all four. TMC leaders targeted Dhankhar after the arrests because he sanctioned the prosecution. They alleged that he bypassed the assembly speaker whose sanction is necessary to prosecute MLAs. On May 9, the Raj Bhawan said in a statement that the governor had accorded prosecution sanction to the CBI against the three TMC MLAs and Chatterjee who was an MLA when the offence allegedly took place. This empowered the CBI to file the charge sheet. On May 10, Mukherjee and Hakim were sworn in as ministers by the governor at Raj Bhawan. Mitra took oath at the assembly on May 6. Dhankhar reacted to Banerjee’s comments saying he was stunned. “He is senior functionary @AITCofficial @MamataOfficial. He is senior parliamentarian @LokSabhaSectt. He is senior advocate @barcouncilindia @barandbench. Just stunned but leave the matter to sound discretion of cultured people of West Bengal and media,” tweeted Dhankhar. He also posted a video clip in which Banerjee could be heard making the statement. “Banerjee is a lawyer who represents the state in court. He is directly attacking the Constitution. His statement can be seen as that of the ruling party. The TMC has lost faith in the Constitution,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. TMC leaders did not comment on Banerjee’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-asks-people-to-file-police-complaints-against-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-101621796104332.html
24-05-2021||India||As cases drop in cities, TN shifts Covid fight focus to hinterlands||As the Covid-19 tally in Chennai, which was witnessing the highest number of daily cases in Tamil Nadu, remained static for a week, all concerns have now shifted to the number of infections and disproportionate death rates in smaller cities and hinterland with less healthcare facilities. On May 20, a two-tier city like Coimbatore reported 3,335 new cases and 20 deaths while a small district like Dindigul reported 389 new cases and 19 deaths. While Thiruvallur reported 1,791 cases and 20 fatalities, Vellore registered 567 cases and 36 deaths on the same day.While intensive care units (ICUs) and oxygen beds were available in Dindigul’s single Covid hospital, three government hospitals in Coimbatore had none of them available. “This is an indication of not just the state of the health infrastructure but also delay in detecting cases and timely-transportation of patients to hospitals. Our test-trace-isolate strategy has to be strengthened in rural areas and small towns,” Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology, said. “We did a lot in Chennai, everyone knows where to go for tests. There is so much awareness that the moment a person develops a symptom, they think maybe it is Covid. They get tested or if there is reluctance, they consult a doctor immediately. But that doesn’t happen in small towns and rural areas.”In Trichy district, for instance, fresh cases reported in its rural blocks have surpassed the urban areas in the past one week. From an average of 300 new cases, the figures jumped to 800 cases per day. “As the virus shifts from the major cities to smaller districts, I feel we are not prepared enough as the resources are less compared to Chennai to scale up. We need to assess the capacity, man power, oxygen beds, ICUs, testing capacity in smaller districts,” Kaur said, adding that the government could consider introducing rapid antigen tests in areas with limited laboratories to conduct RT-PCR testing.State health secretary J Radhakrishnan also said that though the Covid tally is static in Chennai and adjoining districts, the government is concerned of rising cases in major cities and towns like Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Thoothukudi, Madurai and Trichy as well as smaller towns like Ariyalur. “We are currently increasing oxygen-supported beds in the districts and we are planning to bring in a district-level containment plan,” Radhakrishnan said. The state has also decentralised its Covid-19 war room, presently functioning in Chennai, and has opened a Unified Command Centre in each of the remaining 36 districts. The helpline will triage patients and find oxygen and ICU beds for them. Tamil Nadu has been witnessing a rapid rise in cases among India’s 20 most populous regions even as the curve is on a downward trend in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. In the past one week, the state has reported the fourth highest number of daily cases in the country in absolute numbers – only Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala are reporting more infections on a daily basis right now. On Tuesday, with 33,059 infections in 24 hours, Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of infections in terms of daily count across the country. No ICU beds but a few oxygen-supported ones were available across Chennai’s government and private hospitals as of 7 pm on Friday.On Sunday, the state reported 35,483 cases and 422 deaths, taking the overall tally to 1,842,344 and 20,468, respectively. Chennai alone reported 5,169 cases and 81 fatalities.“We are decentralising oxygen centres across the city where patients can be supported with oxygen until a hospital bed is vacant. At least 3,000 such beds are being planned,” Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagan Singh Bedi said. Civic officials attributed the drop in cases in Chennai to surveillance and a change in strategy in triaging. For those below 60 years of age and no comorbidities, the corporation’s health team triaged the patients at home to prevent them from coming to screening centres and therefore, reduce the risk of further spread and exposure. “The state has a pragmatic triaging protocol that empowers the primary healthcare system to take care of mild, moderate patients,” Kaur said. “They initiate treatment even for severe cases while they are being transported which means the delays get reduced. This should help especially in the rural areas and smaller districts so one doesn’t have to wait till they reach the hospital to start treatment. This should help in reducing deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-drop-in-cities-tn-shifts-covid-fight-focus-to-hinterlands-101621795983779.html
24-05-2021||India||India may firm up plans to export Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin||New Delhi: India has received enquiries from other countries for the export of the indigenous Covid 19 vaccine Covaxin jointly developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), according to government officials aware of the development.New Delhi has been approached by at least two countries, Hungary and Paraguay for the commercial export of 1 million doses of Covaxin, with the first holding forth the possibility of access to the EU.To be sure, decisions on exprts are commercial ones that will have to be taken by Bharat Biotech. In February Bharat Biotech announced that it has signed a pact with Ocugen Inc, allowing the US-based biopharmaceutical firm to co-develop, supply, and commercialize the Indian vaccine maker’s Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin in the US market.According to the Union government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court, in May, Bharat Biotech has increased its capacity from 9 million to 20 million a month now, which will increase to 55 million units by July 2021. according to the government’s latest vaccine policy, half of these will be sold to the Centre and the other half to the states and private hospitals.“The govt of Hungary approached the government in mid- April for supply of 1 million doses for Covaxin by around May end on priority. It was also informed that they would grant EU Good manufacturing practice (GMP) certification to Bharat Biotech facilities that would also open India’s vaccine exports to the wider EU markets if the government would consider supplying the 1 million doses. This would not only open up India vaccine exports to the wider EU market (as certification granted by Hungary would be recognized in EU) in future but may also facilitate BBT’s negotiations with Brazil and other markets that they may be exploring as well…,” one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.“The Covaxin samples received from Bharat Biotech had already been approved by the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition and the Hungarian National Drug Authority. We were informed that the expert team that visited India last month to audit BBT facilities had also returned and given its report. They were ready to grant emergency use authorization for Covaxin. It was also noted that certain issues were found during the expert team’s visit to BBT facilities. The Brazilian team that had visited BBT around the same time had also flagged these issues... ,” the official added.In March Brazilian health regulator Anvisa denied permission to import Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin into the country after its authorities found that the plant in which the vaccine is being made did not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements. Bharat Biotech in February said it had signed an agreement with the Brazilian government for supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of the current year. The vaccine maker then said: “the requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled,” and that the timelines for fulfilment were under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon.’’Bharat Biotech did not respond to a detailed questionnaire sent on May 12.The government has also been approached for commercial contracts for Covaxin by Paraguay, according to a second official. According to the external affair ministry’s Vaccine Maitri portal. Paraguay has thus far received 2 lakh doses of vaccines as a gift.“ They (Paraguay) have thanked Prime Minister Modi for gifting the vaccines under its vaccine Maitri initiative. We were informed last month that negotiations were on between Paraguay, which is looking to sign a contract with Bharat Biotech for procurement million doses of Covaxin,” the second official added. A third official from the external affairs ministry confirmed this.On May 1 HT reported that Centre is also exploring the possibility of offering the locally developed coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin for production abroad through a technology transfer between commercial entities, according to government officials aware of the development.India’s indigenous vaccine, Covaxin is developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.In a statement issued on April 20, Bharat Biotech said it was exploring manufacturing partnerships with partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment.The company also said Covaxin has received Emergency Use Authorisation in several countries across the globe with another 60 in process. It has been granted EUAs in Mexico, Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana, Zimbabwe, among several other countries. It is in the process of getting EUAs in the US and Europe, according to Bharat Biotech.Earlier this month, a joint statement on the India- EU leaders’ meeting said: “Recognising the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good and concurring that the vaccination process is not a race amongst countries but a race against time, we welcomed the EU’s and its Member States’ contribution to vaccines’ production and their substantial support to the COVAX Facility, as well as India’s efforts to produce and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to over 90 countries through its ‘Vaccine Maitri’...We are committed to working together to better prepare for and respond to global health emergencies. We agreed to cooperate on resilient medical supply chains, vaccines and the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and on the application of international good manufacturing standards to ensure high quality and safety of products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-firms-up-plans-to-export-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-101621795924954.html
24-05-2021||India||Rajasthan to move SC for uniform vaccine policy||Jaipur: The Rajasthan government is planning to approach the Supreme Court to ask for a new policy that ensures uniform distribution and pricing of Covid-19 vaccines, said a senior official familiar with the development. It will be the second state to do so after West Bengal, which had on May 7 moved the apex court for the exact same reason and demanded that the states be given the vaccines free of cost.Rajasthan’s vaccination programme has been slowed down by a shortage of jabs. So far, only 1.26 crore of its total population of 8 crore has been administered the first dose, and just 31.2 lakh have received the second. Of those vaccinated fully, 16.34 lakh are over the age of 60 and 7.48 lakh are in the 45-59 age-group. The state government is also spending ₹3,000 crore to inoculate people in the age group of 18-44 years. For this, it has ordered 3.75 crore vaccine shots from the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has been struggling to meet the huge demands raised by all states. So far, over 12.59 lakh people in this age-group have been vaccinated. The state has also floated a global tender to procure 1 crore doses but says that this should have been done by the Centre. “The state can bear the expenditure, but the tender should be floated by the government of India. The Centre can negotiate for a uniform rate, and check the credentials and credibility of the vendors,” said the aforementioned official on the condition of anonymity, adding that so far six to eight vendors have participated in the tender and some of them have been asked to provide more additional documents. The differential pricing, the official said, will result in competition among states, as the vendors participating in the global tender are quoting more than twice the price of vaccine — ₹300 per dose plus GST. Vaccine manufacturers SII and Bharat Biotech have been charging ₹150 per dose from the Centre, and ₹300-400 per dose from the states. The price should be capped at a uniform rate of ₹150, the official said. Centre’s announcement of differential pricing for vaccines was opposed by many states, and had led the Supreme Court to observe, in a suo motu case, that the policy was violative of a citizen’s constitutional rights and the Centre should revisit it. The Centre had asked the court not to interfere with an executive decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-to-move-sc-for-uniform-vaccine-policy-101621795383760.html
24-05-2021||India||Moderna refuses to send jabs directly, says Punjab||Chandigarh US pharmaceutical company Moderna has refused to supply its Covid vaccine directly to Punjab, saying that its policy allows it to entertain such requests only from the government of India, a senior state official said on Sunday. The development came after the Amarinder Singh government reached out to several manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Gamaleya (maker of Sputnik-V), for direct purchase, said state nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg. The state government said last week that it has storage space for 3.5 million Sputnik-V vaccines, which requires temperature of -18 degrees Celsius. But so far, only Moderna has replied to the request, Garg said. The company’s vaccine has so far inoculated over 90 million people. Moderna could not be reached for comments.Earlier, the Punjab government approached Covax, the global vaccine sharing programme, but was told that it would not directly deal with the state, Garg said. The Punjab government has said that it has so far received 4.4 million vaccine doses from the Centre, and the first dose has been administered to 3.66 million people while 730,000 have received the second shot. But due to the non-availability of jabs, the state has had to stop phases 1 (above 60 years) and 2 (above 45 years) of its vaccination programme in the last three days. “We are seeking more vaccines from the Centre. They will also advise how to deal with such manufacturers who directly deal with the Centre,” said Garg. Punjab had a tepid response to the programme as not many people turned up for vaccination in the early days. But the brutality of the second wave triggered panic, leading to rush at vaccination centres, especially in rural areas. Punjab registered nearly 5,300 fresh Covid cases and 201 deaths on Saturday, taking the death toll in the state to over 13,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moderna-refuses-to-send-jabs-directly-says-punjab-101621795323750.html

24-05-2021||India||Nath booked for ‘maligning image of India’ with variant remark||Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath was booked on Sunday for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by claiming that the “Indian variant” of the coronavirus was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic, police said.The case was registered on the complaint of medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang, and other BJP leaders. BJP leaders alleged that Nath held a virtual press conference and blamed the “Indian variant” for the second wave. BJP leaders also lodged the complaint on a video in which Nath is seen addressing Congress MLAs on the issue of shortage of fertilizers and other issues and telling them it is the right opportunity to start a fire so that farmers would get justice. The case has been registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and section 54 (punishment for false warning) of the Disaster Management Act by crime branch, said Irshad Wali, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police. According to the FIR, “Kamal Nath said corona started with Chinese variant but now it is Indian variant of Covid-19 which is responsible for the second wave and many countries have suspended flights due to the Indian variant. Nath also said Indians who are working and studying in foreign countries are facing trouble due to it. But in real, foreign countries are trying to help India by sending important things to fight against the epidemic. Nath tried to misguide people and to create disturbance in the country.”“Nath also violated the norms of WHO in which the organisation clearly said no variant of virus should be named after a country, person, organisation or bird’s name,” the FIR said.The FIR also mentioned that Nath tried to spread anarchy by telling the Congress MLAs to start a fire to ensure justice for farmers. Minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Nath and other Congressmen are trying to create unrest in India and Madhya Pradesh by doing dirty politics as they had done during the 1984 riots. Nath insulted our country internationally and he should have been booked under sedition charges.” After the FIR, Nath said, “People who lost family members due to shortage of oxygen, injections, beds and other facilities during the second wave should also register an FIR against the heartless chief minister and other ministers of MP. People, who lost their family members due to Covid 19 and their deaths have not been included as Covid deaths, should also register an FIR against the CM and his cabinet ministers.” Former minister and Congress MLA Jitu Patwari said, “The BJP-led state government is misusing power to hide the data and the real pain of Covid-infected people. They are not concerned about India’s image but they are more concerned about the Prime Minister and BJP’s image.

24-05-2021||NA||Covid-19 LIVE: Rajasthan govt imposes three-tier lockdown from May 24 to June 8||The Union government announced on Saturday that the second wave if Covid-19 is stabilising in the country, with only seven states that are reporting more than 10,000 cases and six states with 5,000-10,000 cases a day. However, states continue to extend Covid-19 lockdown amid a surge in the number of daily cases. Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have all extended ongoing curbs. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) said on Sunday that at least 420 doctors from all over the country have succumbed to Covid-19 during the second wave. Delhi-NCR reported 100 deaths of doctors, Bihar recorded 96, and Uttar Pradesh 41. 747 doctors had succumbed to the first wave of Covid-19. As cases continue to decline the national capital is gearing up to conduct its sixth zero survey once lockdown restrictions are lifted. The total sample size for this round of zero survey has been fixed at 28,000.Follow all the updates here:Punjab logs 5,094 new Covid-19 cases, 172 deaths in last 24 hoursPunjab reports 5,094 new #COVID19 positive cases, 8,527 recoveries, and 172 deaths in the last 24 hours.Total positive cases: 5,38,994Active cases: 57,505 pic.twitter.com/1yZvQfGyjWWith 5,094 new Covid-19 cases and 172 deaths in last 24 hours, Punjab's cases tally reached 538,994 and the death toll reached 13,281, reports ANI.

24-05-2021||Today's||Expanding Quad to encompass public-private partnership||External affairs minister S Jaishankar’s ongoing visit to the United States (US) is focused on how the two countries can work to find solutions to global issues, with the pandemic and vaccines topping the list. That message — coming ahead of the G-7 summit in June and an expected in-person summit meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) later this year — acknowledges how US-India cooperation in response to Covid-19 provides a template for regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.The evolution of Quad reinforces a broader reality as the world confronts the coronavirus pandemic. While the revival of the arrangement, termed Quad 2.0, is motivated by geopolitical and defence imperatives in the Indo-Pacific, it has natural roots as a template for structured cooperation in non-military domains, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief that can and should run parallel to and strengthen the wider geopolitical agenda. This soft power element harks back to Quad’s origins as a response to the Asian tsunami in 2004.Recent Covid-19-focused bilateral cooperation between the US and India further testifies to the importance of this humanitarian aspect. When the US was encountering a spike of Covid-19 infections in 2020, India pitched in by providing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, masks and disposables as well as mobilising the production of hydroxychloroquine by Indian drug manufacturers. This support was deeply appreciated by Americans and the US government. In a back-to-the-future moment in Quad, India is now facing a tsunami-level challenge from a second wave and the US has responded in kind, mobilising aid. The US government, American companies and the Indian-American community have coordinated efforts and provided oxygen tanks, oxygen generators, drugs and disposables as well as technical support.A defining feature of this two-way collaboration is the contribution from corporations and industry associations in both countries to support their respective government initiatives. The sense of responsible business playing a core role in international humanitarian and disaster relief – that is compassionate and rises to the needs of the moment – will define the new corporate social responsibility paradigm and should be sustained by a more structured public-private partnership.The experience of regional cooperation during the 2004 tsunami became the cornerstone of geopolitical interactions among the four democracies in the Indo-Pacific. Later, it also evolved as a keystone building block of trust enabling a strengthened US-India defence partnership. Deepened trust resulted in new annual military exercises, trade and technology initiatives that would not have been possible just years earlier.This new level of public-private coordination is a win-win strategy for all stakeholders in the US-India relationship. It also provides apt balance to the heretofore more dominant defence and trade narratives. This effort should be extended to Quad. Doing so will benefit all the four democracies with enhanced capacity, shared best practices, advanced research and shared experience for an immediate response to any emergency that requires humanitarian aid and disaster management.Such cooperation should then be expanded as needed to support countries in need across the Indo-Pacific. Covid-19 vaccine and drug development and production, already embedded in the Quad agenda, is an obvious starting place for a private-public partnership incorporating the US, India and others.Building on the momentum of Jaishankar’s visit this week, the time is right to take this US-India relationship innovation regional, particularly elevating the private-public level cooperation to Quad. Stakeholders should shape the evolving agenda as momentum builds for the first-ever Quad in-person summit. Key members of the private sectors of the Quad countries should be invited to join a discussion with the leaders and prepare for the summit with their government counterparts.Ernie Bower is president & CEO of BowerGroupAsia.

24-05-2021||Today's||In seven years, how Modi has changed India||Interim assessments are naturally tentative and heavily defined by their context. A report card of Jawaharlal Nehru would have differed had it been written in 1959 — when he was at the pinnacle of his power and popularity — or 1963 — after India stood humiliated in the war with China. Even present-day assessments of Nehru vary according to the political and other preferences of the authors. Since the past is intertwined with the perspective of the present, there will never be any finality in history — and certainly not India’s history.Ever since he assumed charge in May 2014, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has been enveloped in controversies. These had less to do with specific measures of his government than with his permanent estrangement from the class of Indians who saw themselves as the certifying authorities of correctness. Since he became chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, Modi was labelled a “polarising” figure and his journey to national politics was viciously challenged by an entrenched ecosystem that saw itself as the custodians of an established consensus.Also Read | Export boom aids businesses, not farmersYet, paradoxically, the rising tide of shrillness against Modi for being the proverbial outlander resulted in him being enthusiastically embraced by those Indians who saw him as the agent of real change, a change that would unsettle a self-serving consensus centred on privilege, entitlement, cronyism, inefficiency and low national self-esteem. This polarisation has persisted all through the seven years of his premiership, and is guaranteed to endure even after he enters the history books. Polarisation has become a self-fulfilling prophecy and has coloured every judgment of his public life.In the case of Modi, however, there is a common thread running through the divided perceptions of his ongoing term. He was twice endorsed by voters because he promised change. His opponents feared and loathed him not because they doubted his sincerity, but because they imagined the new order would be unpalatable. Consequently, any assessment of Modi must go beyond specific policies of his government, regardless of their electoral impact. For Modi, the key question is — how much has India changed in seven years?Also Read | Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: GovtOn the face of it, the country displays outward continuity. Yet, it is striking that most of Modi’s critics — particularly those located in the Left-liberal bubble overseas —invariably preface their indictment of India’s public life or governance with the label “Modi’s India”. This gratuitous tag indicates a belief that India has changed unrecognisably and for the worse. The recent explosion of nostalgia over Delhi’s post-Lutyens embellishments is a prime example of this phenomenon, as were the fulminations over telling Pakistan that bilateral friendship minus good conduct was not India’s obligation.India, it would seem, has indeed changed under Modi — not unrecognisably, but substantially. Perhaps the biggest change is the marginalisation of those associated with the ancien regime. In today’s India, those who matter are rarely the inheritors — the post-Independence aristocracy of politicians, civil servants and fixers with the right lineage and cultivated connections. They have been replaced by a new dispensation — people with less outward polish and whose cultural assumptions are, for the want of a better expression, more vernacular. They are less cosmopolitan and assertively nationalistic. They are not squeamish about being Hindu but are equally at ease with technology and science. This is the new India that define the landscape of “Modi’s India” and make up the social foundations on which the thrust on efficient delivery, entrepreneurship and competitive markets are based.The second big change is the receding tide of corruption. When Modi assumed charge, political corruption had touched dizzy heights. The fear was that the scale of corruption would march in tune with new wealth creation and distort public life hideously. Modi hasn’t ended corruption, but through example, he has purified decision-making at the top and used technology to ensure that entitlements to the poor don’t suffer transmission losses. The success rate is still patchy and there is still miles to go, but at least India has at least begun rolling back corruption. It is political will that has made the difference.The third big change heralded by the Modi government, particularly in his second term, is in forging an alternative nationalistic consensus. Before Modi, India’s politics was guided by the assumption that whatever the colour of the government, the yardstick of acceptability would be guided by the Nehruvian consensus. With the triple talaq legislation, the abrogation of Article 370 and the changes to the Citizenship Act, Modi converted facets of the BJP manifesto into state policy.The rights and wrongs of each move may well be debated, but what was striking was their audacity. Along with the Supreme Court sanction for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Modi successfully forged a bond between the government and those who felt that there was an alternative idea of India. The alienation between the government and its ideological base that so troubled Atal Behari Vajpayee has disappeared, a reason why the Modi regime has demonstrated amazing internal coherence. It may also explain why, despite all the ups and downs of politics, the energy and vibrancy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains unaffected. Modi has made the larger parivar a stakeholder in his government and in a state of permanent anticipation of the time India can be fully recast.In seven years, Modi has changed many of the assumptions that have governed public life. However, it is still work in progress. To endure, Modi’s India will have to define the new heights to scale in 2024.Swapan Dasgupta is a BJP leader, former Rajya Sabha MP, and author and commentatorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-seven-years-how-modi-has-changed-india-101621861207480.html
24-05-2021||Today's||Vaccination a globally integrated enterprise: CLs are not a quick-fix solution||Many presume that vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) are “Indian vaccines” by default. Covishield, the mainstay of India’s vaccination programme used in more than 85% of India’s inoculations, is the result of a mutually beneficial international collaboration. At least half of the doses SII produces are paid for by other countries and global platforms, but manufactured in India. The deadly second wave created an unforeseen emergency and disrupted India’s role as a global supplier of vaccines.A recent analysis of company filings by the top four global vaccine manufacturers found that 90% all the vaccines produced in 2021 Q1 in the United States (US) and Europe were administered on populations within North America and Europe. Even in Q2, the situation is going to be the same. This brings to the front the importance of creating and expanding vaccine production capacity in the developing world.India’s restriction of vaccine exports was not the first; countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) and the US had virtual bans on vaccine exports, and by invoking the Defense Production Act, the latter has also been hoarding vaccine components and raw materials. Such supply chain disruptions across the world have both created vaccine shortages as well as impacted the ability of other countries to produce vaccines.The joint proposal for global patent waivers introduced in October 2020 before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by South Africa and India is getting a push back from European Union (EU), despite a conditional support from the US. A delay in reaching a consensus seems inevitable, and in parallel, there is demand from civil society to invoke Compulsory Licenses (CLs) to allow Indian companies to produce Covid-19 vaccines.Also Read | Moderna, Pfizer said they’ll deal only with Centre, not states: Delhi govtA limited global supply of vaccines is mopped up by richer countries, forcing the global health leadership to warn that the world is on the brink of a “catastrophic moral failure”, which needs to be addressed fast. However, given the urgent need, decisions to not enforce intellectual property (IP) rights, CLs at the country level, or a global patent waiver on vaccines may have only a limited success. In the current situation, a looming threat of waivers or CLs in key markets may be more useful than actual waivers and CLs per se, to force the hand of innovator companies to get into voluntary licensing agreements with developing country manufacturers and actively share technology and know-how.As opposed to drugs, whose reverse engineering has been successfully done by many Indian generic manufacturers for decades, vaccines are much more complex biological products, where process information and technology transfer are key. Yet another roadblock linked to technology transfer will be that of a complex supply chain. Reportedly, Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine alone is made out of 280 components, sourced from 86 suppliers across 19 countries. A CL of a vaccine would mean potentially a mapping of all the patents involved with these components and licensing them, which creates a mighty barrier.For example, Moderna had announced in October 2020 that it will not sue any company across the world that manufactures its vaccine. Seven months have passed but no company has tried manufacturing the sought after vaccine. This means that in the case of vaccines, any promise of legal protection of manufacturers may have limited meaning unless active collaborations, voluntary technology transfer and knowledge sharing are involved. In view of the complex interdependencies, the immediate answer may not really be in adversarial actions which may not change the ground situation, but in ensuring — by strong acts of persuasion — voluntary action by the companies that goes beyond “not suing”.Vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Novavax and Gamaleya Research Institute (Sputnik-V) have voluntary arrangements already in place with Indian companies, involving licenses and technology transfer. However, even with an active collaboration and sharing of know-how, this is a time consuming process. Sputnik-V production is to start in India only by August 2021. The Indian made J&J may take even longer. Even after the technology transfer is initiated, it is reported that the Indian company Biological E will take up to five months to start production.Also Read | Plea on ex gratia for Covid victims: SC seeks Centre’s replyThe limitations of CLs in the short and medium run, despite its being a somewhat popular solution among commentators for the Covid-19 vaccine problem, can be further examined through the case of Bharat Biotech (BB) voluntarily allowing three public sector companies — Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL), Bharat Immunologicals & Biologicals Corporation (BIBCOL) and Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation (HPC) — to manufacture Covaxin. Despite active technology transfer and knowledge sharing, IIL and BIBCOL will start production only by August-September, and HPC has sought a year to start production.To manufacture a range of vaccines in the coming months, Indian companies will need hundreds of components from dozens of companies spread across the world. This complex network of manufacturing partnerships cannot be wished away. Restoring India’s role as a global supplier of vaccines is key in ensuring functioning supply chains. Autarky or one-sided, heavy-handed action may not yield results immediately to defeat a pandemic. India’s international cooperation has not been a one way street — the country has given to the world and also gained from it.While the world works towards a waiver that brings in predictability and security to manufacturers in the developing world, voluntary licenses will have to be granted, supported by active technology transfer as well as capacity expansion, multiplying the global output of Covid-19 vaccines many times over in the quickest possible time.Oommen C Kurian is senior fellow, health initiative, Observer Research FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/vaccination-a-globally-integrated-enterprise-cls-are-not-a-quick-fix-solution-101621854547402.html
24-05-2021||Today's||Quad and an opportunity to define India’s economic statecraft||In the last week of April, India, Japan and Australia formally launched the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) to build resilient supply chains in the Indo-Pacific region to reduce their dependence on China. This development comes against the backdrop of the Joe Biden administration, in its first 100 days, expanding the scope of the Quad grouping from a limited conventional security grouping to one with an economic dimension through multiple trade, aid and supply chain initiatives.In the month of March, President Biden hosted the first-ever Quad summit with leaders of Japan, Australia and India, committing to provide one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine to South East Asia. The salient feature of that commitment was the division of roles — India will manufacture, Japan will finance, the United States (US) will provide the technology and Australia will assist with the logistics. This division of roles sets a template for future economic cooperation among the Quad nations and one for India to define its economic statecraft in the region.The shifting patterns of aid Economic statecraft is the use of economic means such as foreign aid, trade and commerce to attain foreign policy objectives. Since India’s independence from British rule, India has been the recipient of such foreign aid and trade privileges. While it continues to be a recipient of those aid and privileges, the size and scale of aid received has significantly dropped over the past 20 years (despite the current, enhanced level of dependence due to the second wave of the pandemic) and India has evolved into a conferrer of aid and medical supplies.Furthermore, it is no longer a mere spectator of world affairs but an active participant, if not a leading voice on issues of global concern – pandemics, climate, terrorism, and cyber security. As the second most populous nation in the world with a talented labour pool, India can leverage the Quad security grouping to address its national security threats, in particular China by using tools of economic statecraft.Also Read | In its hour of need, Quad members stand with IndiaChina’s exponential rise and its use of its own economic statecraft to win friends in India’s neighbourhood have the potential to morph into a perennial national security threat. From the shores of Hambantota to the hills of Papua, China has successfully used its state owned enterprises (SOE) and development banks to grant aid, loans and provide infrastructure to countries of South and South East Asia as part of its flagship trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).To give credit where it is due, India has responded proactively by building its own connectivity programmes through its East and Northeast states with initiatives such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and through maritime infrastructure initiatives such as the Sagar Mala project to enhance India’s logistics capabilities.However, as with any government project in India, the pace, scale and execution of these initiatives have been the major impediments to mounting any form of significant challenge to the China led Initiative. In order to rise up to the challenge of taking on China’s SOEs , the Indian government should engage its vibrant private sector.Quad and Indian industry Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a vocal proponent for supporting India’s enthusiastic private sector leaders. And in the past few weeks, India’s industrialists have proved that they can address the government’s deficiencies and step in during a time of crisis by converting their industrial oxygen into supplies for the ones in need. India’s vaccine behemoths have a role not just in inoculating the Indian population but also serving foreign policy objectives by manufacturing for over 70 countries, including the ones in South East Asia part of the Quad Initiative.Also Read | Quad an exclusive ‘clique’, working against China: Foreign ministryIn the past, India and Japan have worked together on projects in Sri Lanka, on development initiatives in India’s Northeast, and the US has played a vital role in creating a coalition of nations to address China’s overtures in the Indo Pacific region. The Gujarat-based Adani group is involved in the port project in Sri Lanka, and is building the container terminal along the Yangon river in Myanmar. The New Delhi-based GMR has been working on infrastructure projects in Nepal, Indonesia and the Philippines and Tata Group is engaged in several energy and infrastructure projects in Vietnam. While it is not new for the Quad nations to partner on infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific, a concerted effort on a much larger scale with the Indian private sector will prove to be an effective strategy in countering China’s foray into these markets.Zaibatsu or Chaebols and not Soviet Era OligopoliesOver the course of 30 years, East Asian economies of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have successfully leveraged aid and their private enterprises to attain foreign policy goals. While the model could be emulated by India, the Modi administration in particular would have to tread the path carefully with it already being accused by its critics of favouring few conglomerates such as Adani Group and Reliance Industries. To avoid further criticism, the government should select companies that do not have highly leveraged balance sheets and create a consortium of India’s Navratnas or best managed companies such as the Chennai-based Larson & Tubro (L&T), Tata Power and Wipro, to name a few.Also Read | Chinese firm’s Covid-19 drug claims draw scientists’ skepticismIndia shaping its economic statecraft using the Quad security grouping and its private sector will first, revive and sustain Indian infrastructure companies by providing the much needed capital infusion to take on greenfield projects that are capital-intensive and also reduce their risk exposure through public-private partnerships with the Quad nations. Second, it will integrate India into the Asian trade architecture without having to commit to a China centered trade bloc such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. And third, it will pose a formidable challenge to China’s Belt and Road Initiative acts of economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific region.The Biden administration’s measures in its first hundred days in office have set the stage for India to capitalise on its geo-economic and geopolitical comparative advantages in the Indo-Pacific region.

24-05-2021||Today's||In Kathmandu, a threat to democracy||Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s decision to dissolve the lower House of Parliament, on the advice of the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister (PM) K P Oli, is a subversion of constitutional governance, and will push the country into further turmoil and potential conflict. Coming as it does on top of a virulent pandemic that Nepal is struggling to cope with, it does not augur well for future stability.The situation has come full circle from the time the president dissolved the House in December 2020 after Oli lost majority support, following dissensions within his party, a decision that was ruled ultra vires of the constitution by a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court (SC). However, another ruling of the court, on a separate matter, nullified the merger that had formed the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and established the pre-merger status quo.Accordingly, the NCP stood dissolved and the erstwhile Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) or UML, and NCP (Maoist Centre) were restored. The bulk of the opposition to Oli had come from the Maoists, led by former PM Prachanda, and a faction of the UML, headed by another former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal. Restoration of the pre-merger situation implied that the opposition to Oli within the UML was limited to the rebel faction, which comprised a mere fifth of the total number of party Members of Parliament (MPs).Oli was, however, unable to secure the confidence of the restored House. The opposition parties, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the NCP (Maoist Centre), voted against him, and others belonging to the Madhav Nepal faction of the UML and a faction of the Terai-based Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) absented themselves/remained neutral during the vote. Though Oli lost the confidence vote, the opposition parties, the NC and the NCP (Maoist Centre) were unable to muster the requisite numbers to form a government immediately, since the JSP was divided.Faced with this impasse, the president again appointed Oli, in his capacity as the leader of the single-largest party in Parliament, as PM, in accordance with the constitution. In no democratic country would a PM who has just lost confidence be reappointed and again asked to prove his majority within 30 days, a sure signal for horse-trading and corruption.Instead of seeking a fresh vote of confidence, Oli now recommended to the president that another provision of the constitution be invoked to identify a member of the House who could gain majority support and form a government. He did so without resigning his post. Even without a legal vacancy, the search for a new PM was instituted.Despite having only a deadline of 21 hours, the opposition — which included the NC led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, MKN faction of the UML, Prachanda-led Maoists, and a faction of the JSP led by Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai — mustered 149 signatures, a comfortable majority, with Deuba staking claim for leadership. But in another twist, Oli, who had asked the president to explore government formation just the preceding day, staked claim and said he had the support of 153 MPs, but neither were they physically present nor did he present all their signatures. But this included those JSP MPs who had outlined their preference for Deuba. Both lists had some overlapping names.Instead of judging the claims on merit and inviting Deuba, the President decided to reject both applications and, on the advice of the Cabinet, dissolved the House late during the night of May 21. Fresh elections have now been scheduled for November 2021. All executive power is concentrated in the hands of the PM and the president without parliamentary accountability.Given the raging pandemic, there is a big question mark on whether elections will be held as scheduled. If they are, the situation would hopefully revert to normal. But this is unlikely, for the opposition parties have already announced a political and legal battle against the Bhandari-Oli unconstitutional move, and may not be willing to participate in elections presided over by the current PM. Nepal is also likely to witness public protests, especially after the pandemic is brought under control. If elections are not held, Nepal will be staring at yet another constitutional crisis. While petitions challenging the dissolution will be heard by SC, it is not clear when and what the judgment of the court will be.India has always supported multiparty democracy and progressive change in Nepal. The perception today is that India is backing an autocratic and unpopular regime. This is partly due to the fact that a series of high-level visits have taken place between the two countries. Nepali observers are also linking the surprising support extended by a faction of the JSP, led by Mahant Thakur and Rajendra Mahato, to their erstwhile bête noire, KP Oli, who symbolised opposition to Madhesi demands during the drafting of the Constitution in 2015, to Indian influence, particularly since this faction has traditionally been close to India.Durable political stability in Nepal is in India’s interest. Instability will only render Nepal vulnerable to inimical external influences. Already, the goodwill generated by supplying the first tranche of Covid-19 vaccines to Nepal has dissipated as India is now seen as reneging on its commitment to supply additional doses. China is stepping into the breach.India must publicly articulate its position in support of constitutional governance. India should supply the contracted dose of vaccines to Nepal, a neighbouring country that shares open borders with India with free movement of people. Finally, we should engage fully with all political actors in Nepal, including those in opposition to Oli and not be seen to be partisan.Ranjit Rae is a retired diplomat who served as ambassador to NepalThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-kathmandu-a-threat-to-democracy-101621781046854.html
24-05-2021||Editorials||From Belarus, a threat to global media freedom||On Sunday, Belarus’s government, under its authoritarian leader, Aleksandr G Lukashenko, in an audacious move, warned an airline passing through its skies that it faced a bomb threat. It then sent a military jet to get the plane to land in Belarus’s capital, Minsk. No bomb was found, and it turned out that the objective was never to secure the plane. It was to arrest a passenger, a dissident journalist, Roman Protasevich, who was picked up by authorities and taken into custody.Across the world, illiberal regimes have found new ways to exert pressure on the media — from directly threatening the lives of journalists to deploying more subtle forms of pressure. But Belarus’s action, supported by Russia, is outrageous by any standards. Mr Protasevich, an editor of a Telegram channel, one of the few platforms where criticism of the regime can still be articulated, was living in exile in Lithuania and now stares at the possibility of 12 years in prison. The arrest violates the letter and spirit of the universal declaration of human rights; the “apparent forced landing”, is, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a violation of the Chicago Convention which governs international aviation; and European leaders and the United States have strongly condemned the move, with governments terming it variously as “state hijacking”, “act of state terrorism”, “abhorrent”, and calling for a unified response.Also Read | Minutes to touchdown: The moment a Belarusian dissident knew his time was upTo India, this may appear like a distant development where it has little at stake. But as a democracy, committed to the rule of law and press freedom, India must speak up against Belarus’s action. The international community, especially democracies, the international aviation industry, and all global human rights organisations need to come together to ensure that Mr Lukashenko is not allowed to set a precedent or get away with this shocking assault on global media freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/from-belarus-a-threat-to-global-media-freedom-101621857068849.html
24-05-2021||Editorials||Scrap the Class 12 exams||A meeting convened by the Centre on Sunday to discuss the feasibility of conducting the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other Class 12 exams remained inconclusive. A final decision will be taken on June 1, after state governments send their suggestions. In the backdrop of the pandemic, CBSE has proposed two options on the methodology, process, duration, and timings. The first entails examination for “major subjects” to be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format”, with marks “calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects” in the minor subjects. The second involves conducting exams at schools where students are enrolled, reducing the duration of exams, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer-type questions. While most states preferred the second option, Delhi and Maharashtra said exams should not be held. Several states also raised the demand for vaccinating students and teachers first.Also Read | CBSE starts tele-counselling for 10th, 12th students and their parentsWhile deciding on the fate of exams, the safety of all stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, who can’t be prevented from congregating outside exam centres) must be the top parameter. To be sure, the second wave will ebb at some point, but large-scale movement of students, parents, teachers and officials will put them at risk, and also could lead to a fresh spike in cases. Not all students will have the luxury of private transport and many will use public transport to reach their schools/centres. And while some states have demanded vaccination for students, vaccines are not easily available and many students in Class 12 are below 18 years of age, and will not be eligible for the jab. Also remember that these students have been in Class 12 since last March — and even if one of the two options outlined by CBSE is picked, exams will be held only in July, with results out in August, leaving them in the same class for almost 18 months. Schools, too, are struggling with two batches of Class 12 students. If at all the exams needed to be held, the only window when this could have been done was in late February end-early March, but the government chose to announce state elections then.Purely to prevent a possible super-spreader event, the government must scrap the Class 12 exams and formulate an evaluation process that responds to the need of the extraordinary situation and gives students space to recuperate physically and mentally. It could arrive at a fair formula of using Class 11 results and internal assessments or use mock exam results to assess students. It’s time to focus on alternative evaluation methods to enable the 2021 batch of Class 12 students to move to the next stage of their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/scrap-the-class-12-exams-101621856467628.html
