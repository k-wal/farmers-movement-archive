However, two people carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 each are still at large. Chaudhary has political connections and is said to be the kingpin of the spurious liquor trade in the area. To note, dozens of people died, and many were hospitalised after allegedly consuming spurious liquor purchased from a government-run liquor shop in Karsua, Andla, Chairath and Jawan villages of Aligarh on Friday. “Cases have been registered at five police stations of Aligarh district and of those named, 11 have been arrested. Police are in hot pursuit of two absconders, Rishi Pal Sharma and Bipin Yadav, on whom reward of Rs. 50,000 each has been declared,” said DIG Aligarh range Deepak Kumar.

The average AQI of Uttar Pradesh in May was recorded below 150 , similar to that recorded last year and one of the lowest since 2000.The average AQI recorded in Lucknow between May 1 to May 30 this year, was around 150. In 2020, when country-wide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19, the city had recorded a similar AQI. However, in 2019 the average AQI in Lucknow was recorded at around 300 in the month of May. According to CPCB classification, AQI between 101 to 200 is categorised as moderate with very little impact on human health and AQI between 201 and 300 as poor. AQI between 301 and 400 is categorised as very poor and that above 400 as severe. According to experts, beside corona curfew curbs, the above average rainfall across the state also led to improvement of air quality. The state recorded more than 60 mm of rainfall in May, almost double than the normal rainfall “The state recorded around 12 days of rainfall caused by western disturbances or conditions caused first by Tauktae and Yaas cyclones. There were rain, thunderstorms and strong winds in most parts of the state,” said state MeT department director JP Gupta. These weather conditions helped AQI of major UP cities to improve considerably. Cities like Lucknow, Agra, Noida, Moradabad, Kanpur and Baghpat which record the worst AQI in the country showed considerable improvement in their AQI this month. Meanwhile, experts warn that the improvement is temporary which will subside as the curbs are relaxed in the state. “The improvement in AQI of UP cities in May is a positive sign but these changes are temporary that will subside quickly with relaxation of corona curfew norms. The citizens and decision-makers must try to make arrangements so that we can have cleaner air all around the year,” said senior environmentalist Devesh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/corona-curfew-curbs-rain-help-improve-air-quality-of-up-cities-101622398962764.html
30-05-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: 25% of all Covid-19 cases reported in May||Ghaziabad: Both April and May have become the months with the heaviest caseload since the pandemic first hit the district in March last year, with the health department data showing that while the cases reported in April accounted for 23% of all the cases, May accounted for nearly 25% of cases. According to the records of the district health department, the data indicates that April this year recorded 12,859 positive cases, while the month of May saw 14077 fresh cases. Upto May 30 this year, the district recorded a total of 55,010 cases so far.“The cases started to rise considerably from the middle of April, and there were occasions when the daily new case count crossed 1,000. However, the strategy of aggressive tracing, testing and treatment paid off and we were able to control the spike within a month. The daily cases nowadays have fallen below 200,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.The spike has been the highest since March last year when first Covid-19 cases started to come in. Earlier, the highest cases recorded in a month were in September last year when the city observed its peak and the district saw 5,915 new cases.“The first wave which started March last year peaked gradually till about September, and then went on a gradual decline. This year, the second wave spiked considerably and also declined at a fast pace. But all this happened within one month, starting from April-mid to May-mid. So, April and May have higher cases which come in at a very fast pace,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter.“The complications in patients this year were more due to severity of infection and hospitals admitted L2 and L3 category patients. Last year, most patients had mild symptoms and were admitted to L1 category hospitals,” Dr Jindal added. The L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals were created in UP under the government’s three-tier Covid healthcare infrastructure. While L1 category hospitals admitted patients with mild symptoms, patients having moderate symptoms were admitted to L2 category hospitals. The L3 category hospitals admitted patients having severe symptoms. As of now, fresh case counts have slowed down and the sample positivity rate is also on a decline. The district registered its peak positivity rate on May 6 when the positivity rate was 19.3% while it declined to a monthly minimum level of 9.09% on May 27 and further declined to 8.66% on May 28 and 7.85% on May 30, as per district health department data.The same was 2.8% as on April 15, which further peaked to 8.84% on April 30.“With a decline in positivity, our discharge rate is also increasing. It is about 96% at present and registered a decline when cases started to rise in April. It is an encouraging trend that more patients are recovering,” the DM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-25-of-all-covid-19-cases-reported-in-may-101622398663018.html

30-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC intervention clears way for laying pipeline to reduce flooding at Hindmata||Following an assurance from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that the problems faced by Tata Mills (NTCL) at Parel would be taken care of by the authorities if the laying of a 325-meter-long stormwater pipeline through their property was allowed, the Bombay high court (HC) permitted the BMC to start work after an agreement between Tata Mills and the civic body was completed.Tata Mills had approached the HC after members of the ruling Shiv Sena government had barged onto the property in April 2021 along with the contractor to start the pipeline work forcefully.The vacation bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing two petitions filed by Tata Mills and BMC, respectively, was informed that both petitions dealt with the laying of a stormwater pipeline, 1,200mm in diameter, to drain the rainwater which flooded both the Hindmata junction and the mill compound during the monsoons.Senior advocate RS Apte for the general manager Tata Mills informed the bench that the head office had received a letter from BMC through the F-South ward office in March seeking permission to lay the SWD through the mill premise. The petition submitted that while the correspondence was going on between the two, on April 28 the local corporator along with a member of parliament from Shiv Sena barged into the premise along with the contractor and equipment to commence the pipe laying work.Apte submitted that earlier on April 19 the Disaster Management Authority had issued the mill a notice under the Act and even Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar had visited the mill premise on April 30 and had given an oral order to commence the work. Aggrieved by the notice and high-handedness of the politicians who were not willing to wait for the correspondence to come to its logical conclusion Tata Mills had approached the HC seeking a restraint on the authorities from taking action against the mill or entering their premise forcefully.The BMC has undertaken the building of silos and underground water tanks at the Hindmata junction as every year there is waterlogging due to the monsoons and brings traffic to a halt due to the three feet of water that gets collected there. The SWD pipeline proposed by the BMC is meant to drain away from the water that is collected in these underground water tanks. Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh for the Union of India informed the bench that the Centre had cleared the proposal of BMC and had no problem with the pipeline being laid through the mill land.In an earlier hearing, the HC had directed the BMC to file an affidavit and work on a solution to resolve the problem amicably.On May 28, senior advocate NV Walawalkar for BMC submitted an affidavit stating that on May 26 the NTC head office had conveyed its agreement to the pipe laying on certain terms and conditions and the agreement between the mill and BMC was being finalised, wherein the civic authority would compensate the mill for the losses it would suffer while work on the pipe laying was on.After hearing the submissions, the HC permitted commencement of the work after the agreement was in place and said, “We expect that after taking possession of the plot, the municipal corporation will start the work immediately under the agreement being entered into between the parties,” and disposed of both petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hc-intervention-clears-way-for-laying-pipeline-to-reduce-flooding-at-hindmata-101622398002632.html

The committee members will visit such buildings, check their status and make a list,” said Raja Dayanidhi, commissioner, UMC. This move by the UMC comes after the two slab collapse incidents in the past 15 days, killing 12 residents. Both the Mohini Palace building that killed five and Sai Shakti building that killed seven residents were built in 1995 using inferior quality sand. The civic body will also put up the ward level helpline numbers for the resident’s to raise their grievances regarding such buildings. “These buildings were built during 1994-95 before the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation was established, in 1996. This is the reason why there are no proper records of such buildings. After Mohini Palace building collapse, we had initiated checks on such buildings. Now the committee formed will be inspecting them,” added Dayanidhi.The civic body will also form a fresh panel of structural auditors. They will conduct audits of buildings at the request of the residents.The civic body claimed that it has vacated all the extremely dangerous buildings within its limits. Those buildings which are dangerous, have been served with notices to take necessary steps. There are 23 extremely dangerous building in Ulhasnagar.Meanwhile, the civic body has also identified 80 possible places where the tenants who are vacated from these buildings, can be relocated for at least 10 days.“We have identified community temples and school which can be used as temporary rehabilitation. Meanwhile, we have also asked the all party elected representatives to help in finding such places where they can be relocated temporarily,” added Dayanidhi.The challenges faced civic body while identifying such buildings in Ulhasnagar, are that such buildings are not visibly dangerous, there are no proper records of these buildings and some have ongoing court cases.“We will closely work with the electricity board to find out when a particular building was built. This will give us an idea of its history. Based on that the committee will visit the entire building because from outside these buildings look perfectly fine. Internally, there are a lot of slab cuttings done and reconstruction made. We will take advice from the legal experts to figure out the court cases of these buildings,” said UMC chief.The civic body chief will be submitting a proposal with necessary changes to the state government to speed up the process among the residents and get it imposed without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-two-slab-collapses-panel-to-survey-ulhasnagar-s-old-structures-101622397944106.html

The 84-year-old who was shifted from Taloja jail to Holy Family Hospital at Bandra following an order of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday night was tested for coronavirus on Saturday. While sources said that Fr Swamy’s report that was received on Sunday had come positive, Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, Fr Swamy’s friend said he was unable to confirm the same and said that he was awaiting an update from the hospital. However, jail authorities confirmed the same and said that Fr Swamy’s lawyer had informed them about his test result coming positive on Sunday morning.According to Kaustubh Kurlekar, jail superintendent of Taloja jail, Dr Swamy’s lawyers had communicated his positive status on Sunday morning. He added that jail officials have also sought an update on the health status of Fr Swamy from the private hospital.Kurlekar added that two inmates including co-accused Arun Ferreira, who were Swamy’s attendants in prison, had tested negative for Covid. Fr Swamy was given the first vaccination jab at an in-house prison vaccination camp on May 18. The jail official also said that Covid tests had been conducted on Fr Swamy earlier in the prison hospital from time to time.Meanwhile, Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, a friend of Fr Swamy said, “We are very relieved after Fr Swamy was shifted to Holy Family Hospital as his condition had deteriorated at Taloja jail.

The curfew will be lifted if active Covid-19 cases fell below 600, it added.The other districts that will continue to be under the partial curfew are Lucknow, Meerut, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, GB Nagar, Bulandshahr, Baghpat and Moradabad, among others. The curfew had been imposed since April 30. “In these 20 districts there will be no relaxation as of now. If the number of daily active cases falls below 600 on the basis of report by district health department, then relaxations mentioned in the order will automatically apply. In case any district has relaxed, but the number of active cases move more than 600, then the relaxations will cease to exist for it,” the order issued by UP chief secretary on Sunday, read.

Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “We will meet with traders, bus operators, auto unions beside RWAs and will seek their active participation to ensure that protocols are adhered to. If the cases rise, everyone will get affected as partial curfew will come into effect. So, we have now directed for strict surveillance, regular monitoring of patients in hospitals so that they recover fast and even strict adherence to containment protocols.”GB Nagar did not make any estimates and said it would depend on recoveries. “It is generally seen that patients in home isolation (mild cases) recover within 10 days while there are other patients (moderate and severe cases) who take longer recover. So, it depends on recoveries,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. Experts said that bringing down the number of active cases will be a major challenge. “People have to ensure social distancing and wearing of masks besides maintaining personal hygiene. Enforcement against offenders must continue strictly otherwise there is every possibility that cases may rise. Further, testing should also be maintained at the same level and tracing should be expedited,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/curfew-to-stay-in-noida-ghaziabad-for-now-101622396202760.html

Addressing a press conference through the virtual mode, the CM said the movement of those connected with the agitation to and from dharna sites had led to the spread of the infection in villages, some of which have seen “more deaths than the average” number. He said that though Hooda is seeking an all-party meeting on Covid, not once had he appealed to farmers to suspend their stir. Referring to Hooda’s open letter to the people of Haryana, Khattar asked why could he not make a similar appeal to farmers. “Can the dangers posed by Covid be ignored,” he asked. The CM Khattar said in the letter written to him by Hooda, it was apparent that his attitude was only to criticise the state government’s handling of the situation rather than extending cooperation. “I thought his letter did not deserve even a reply, I just ignored it. He wants to do politics more rather than extend cooperation,” said Khattar, hitting out at the Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-hits-out-at-hooda-for-not-appealing-to-farmers-to-call-off-stir-amid-covid-crisis-101622395245437.html

He was adopted by them when he was a child. He has been orphaned once again... Now, the Haryana government will take care of his upbringing, and others who lost their parents to Covid-19 and are living at Deep Ashram shelter home.

30-05-2021||Gurugram||Palwal is only Haryana district to fully screen population||Strapped without modern health facilities, Palwal managed to become the only district in Haryana to screen all its people in both rural and urban areas for Covid-19, according to district officials.The district has just over a million people and had reported 10,047 cases and 133 deaths, including three on Sunday. According to covid19india.org data till May 29, the case fatality rate (CFR, number of deaths per 100 cases) of the district was 1.26%, higher than the national average of 1.17% and the state average of 1.07%.The higher-than-average CFR could be attributed to Palwal, around 54 kilometres from Gurugram, not having large private or public hospitals.“The district is not equipped with modern ultra-modern facilities. The health infrastructure right now is one government hospital, two sub-divisional level hospitals, three community health centres and nearly 15 private hospitals,” said Palwal deputy commissioner Naresh Narwal. The district had only 350 oxygen beds.This meant that Palwal had to act early.The strategy was to contain the spread with a proactive approach of the minimum crowd with maximum utilization of mask and sanitization in April when the second wave hit.Rural areas were divided into different segments and incident commanders were deputed to have first-hand information. A weekly survey was conducted parallelly through patwaris and village secretaries of villages twice a week—Tuesday and Friday—with details of symptomatic persons under the supervision of concerned sub-divisional magistrates. The youth committees kept tab on all villages on daily basis.Narwal said a caseload of 50 was enough to place a village under strict lockdown.“A meeting of all market associations was convened, and all were persuaded to close the market on Sunday to avoid overcrowding and get the area sanitized, this worked well and all three cities Palwal, Hathin, and Hodal agreed to the proposal,” he said.On Friday, they commenced a door-to-door screening drive.“We covered 183,166 households with 920 dedicated teams and 3,000 youth committees constituted from various departments and volunteers,” said Narwal. The survey helped in shifting people to hospitals before their condition worsened.The screening involved deploying rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests and those who tested positive were immediately home isolated. Ayurvedic medicines were distributed and Ayush doctors provided counselling.Narwal said the supplies were ensured in the village itself and complete barricading with police deployment was ensured. Similarly, five macro-containment zones were declared in urban areas, where the surge was observed. The positivity rate, which was observed as 40% in some villages and urban colonies at the beginning started reducing with the macros containment strategy. “The tele-counselling and telemedicine dedicated four phone lines with 24X 7 service pressed into service with the deployment of MBBS doctors at Civil Hospital. The cases started reducing after May 20,” he said.The rural health survey (HVGHCS) which started on May 15 with 920 dedicated teams has covered the entire population and the district was the first to be screened across the state.The district has redressed 15781 people through Arogya Setu App and 150056 people were provided with psychological services through helplines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/palwal-is-only-haryana-district-to-fully-screen-population-101622395243058.html

30-05-2021||Gurugram||Slum residents find it hard to get vaccinated due to lack of smartphones, digital illiteracy||Lack of digital literacy and unavailability of smartphones are proving major obstacles for slum residents, mostly domestic workers and daily wagers, to get vaccinated.The district health department earlier held walk-in vaccination camps in slums but suspended the process due to a shortage of vaccines and asked residents to register on the Co-WIN app to book vaccination slots. However, many said that they do not know how to access the portals and complained that the process is complicated.Hasina Bibi, who lives in Tigra village and works as a domestic help, said that until she gets the jab, she will not be allowed to enter the residential societies where she works. This, she said, has made her family’s survival in the city difficult.Bibi visited three primary health centres in the last 15 days but could not get vaccinated. “The officers at the primary health centre (PHC) asked me to register online, but I don’t have valid documents to upload. I will lose my job if I didn’t get my first vaccine dose as the resident welfare associations have strictly passed orders to produce vaccination certificate for entering the premises,” she said.Many of the slum residents who are migrants and are working in the city, said they do not have Aadhaar cards and that their ration cards were issued in other states, due to which they were facing problems.Regina Mandal, who lives in Badshahpur and works as a domestic help, said she was not able to get vaccinated despite making efforts on multiple occasions and is planning to return to her home town of Bagdogra in Siliguri of West Bengal to get vaccinated. “Firstly, the registration process is difficult and secondly, only limited people get vaccinated. Each time, they ask us to come back again, so we have dropped the plan,” she said.Officials of the administration and health department said they are working on a plan to inoculate slum residents.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The government has been formulating guidelines for covering domestic helps and those who have no access to mobile and internet. It is likely that by the next week, guidelines will be issued.”Yash Garg, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner, said that the access issues as well as vaccine shortage were raised with the state government and are likely to be resolved soon. “Due to shortage of vaccines, many people are unable to get vaccinated. The issues are not only at the state level but at the central level too and all are aware of the situation. We can’t make changes on the portal but can try to resolve the issue at the earliest,” he said.However, in some slum clusters in Wazirabad, Bajghera, Chauma and Mullahera, the initial hurdle of vaccine hesitancy has not been overcome yet. “Most people here are not willing to get vaccinated because they have heard that there are side effects from the vaccines. My neighbour was vaccinated but still died due to Covid-19. Two more people who got their first dose were unwell for almost a week. We cannot take chances as all our family members are back in the village and we can’t risk our lives here,” said Bhure Lal, a Wazirabad resident who works at a construction site.Domestic workers and support staff also sought help from their employers but to no avail as camps are yet to resume in residential areas. “It is important to get domestic helps, car cleaners and security guards vaccinated at the earliest as they could also be carriers and cause the transmission to residents or other staff in the area. We are trying to tie up with private hospitals to organise a camp for domestic helps and support staff,” said Rajeev Asthana, general secretary, Orchid Petals residents’ welfare association.Amit Jind, the president of Vipul Greens RWA on Sohna Road, said that their security guards, domestic helps and ground staff is yet not vaccinated. “We have registered them on Co-WIN but they are yet to get a slot due to shortage of vaccines. We have restricted entries of help, drivers and other support staff in our society. The guards are delivering groceries which are brought by delivery boys to ensure minimum contact with outsiders,” he said, adding that the society is now Covid-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/slum-residents-find-it-hard-to-get-vaccinated-due-to-lack-of-smartphones-digital-illiteracy-101622395181716.html

The four were identified as Dr Smita Ghatkar, Dr Rahul Sonawane, Dr Seema Gawli, and Dr Ramesh Ghatkar. The accused doctors work at Chakan Criticare hospital. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Dr Nanda Ganpat Dhawale (58), medical superintendent at Maharashtra state government rural hospital, Chakan, Khed. The doctors and their hospital charged the relatives of a man named Vijay Lakshman Pokharkar form Ozar, Pune, ₹2, 53,300 for Covid-19 treatment between September 2, 2020, and September 16, 2020. Pokharkar was on ventilator and succumbed to the infection at the end of his term at the hospital. The deceased person’s wife Pushpa Pokharkar had cleared the hospital bill after her husband’s death. However, in accordance with the state government rules, she had approached the district collector office machinery with the bill for an audit. “The woman had complained to the collector’s office. The collector’s office informed it to Aundh district hospital. The Aundh hospital authorities asked the Chakan rural government hospital to look into the matter and get an audit done. Whatever excess amount was found, that was to be returned. Two notices have been sent to the hospital in that regard by Chakan government hospital. Copies of both the notices have ‘received’ stamp from the accused persons’ hospital,” said assistant police inspector (API) Prakash Rathod of Chakan police station who is investigating the case. When asked about the amount of excess money levied through the bill upon the Pokharkar family, the complainant was not forthcoming. “We have no information about the patient. We had received orders of audit from our seniors. A court case was done in the matter and as per further orders, a police complaint was lodged. Since the matter is subjudice, I cannot comment on the specifics of the case,” said Dr Dhawale. In May 2020, the state government had announced a cap on the private hospital bill for Covid-19 treatment. Every bill over ₹1.5 lakh was audited by local authorities. However, on Saturday, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that all Covid-19 treatment bills by private hospitals will be audited to avoid trickery by private hospitals. A case under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 34 (common intention) and 188 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Chakan police station against the four doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/private-hospital-doctors-booked-for-overcharging-deceased-covid-19-patient-s-kin-101622391221449.html

30-05-2021||Patna||Bihar CM directs officials to complete all flood protection works by June 15||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday directed the officials of four key departments to complete the flood protection work and strengthen the communication network by June 15. The CM issued instructions to the officials of water resources, minor irrigation, road construction and rural works department to carry out anti-erosion and flood protection works, as suggested by the members of the state legislature and parliament in their respective area, before the outbreak of monsoon. As the state is still under lockdown phase, the CM held the meeting with ministers and officials of various departments through video conferencing and said that the scheme to heighten the embankments and fortify them with proper quality should be finished within the set deadline. “Small bridges and culverts, which serve as a passage to the floodwater, must be cleared to minimise the risk of washing away of roads,” the CM said. WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, who briefed the CM about the state of preparedness of different departments, said that majority of anti-erosion schemes have been completed and residual work would be done by the first week of June. “All embankments are being monitored for minimal damages during the cyclonic rains and unprecedented release of water in rivers from Nepal,” said the minister, adding that the flood protection work got slightly delayed owing to lockdown and spread of Corona pandemic. The CM also asked road construction department (RCD) minister Nitin Navin to ensure repair of all roads, bridges and culverts within the deadline, so that road communication remained smooth during the rains. Jha said that it was for the first time that the department was carrying out anti-erosion work and strengthening embankment following the suggestions from elected leaders cutting across the party lines. WRD Secretary Sanjeev Hans, while making presentations about the department’s activities, informed that opinions of MPs, MLAs and MLCs were sought during the division-level review meeting held between May 13 and 21. However, the opposition parties questioned the departments’ claim of having sought the views of elected leaders regarding the anti-erosion work and said that they were not consulted by any department in this regard. RJD leader and Maner MLA Bhai Birendra and MLC Ram Chandra Purbe categorically said that they were not consulted. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief and MLC Madan Mohan Jha and Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma also countered the government’s claim. Sharma said that the government’s scheme runs on paper only. “Officials might have misled the CM and ministers regarding the opposition parties’ consultation on flood preparations,” said Sharma. Deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, minor irrigation minister Santosh Kumar Suman, rural works minister Jayant Raj, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani, additional chief secretaries Amrit Lal Meena and Pratyay Amrit, principal secretary to CM Deepak Kumar, also joined the video conferencing from their respective places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-directs-officials-to-complete-all-flood-protection-works-by-june-15-101622390981466.html
30-05-2021||Pune||Mula-Mutha river anti-encroachment action only on paper: activists||Despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order and letters send by the Pune irrigation division since the past decade, the Mula-Mutha river anti-encroachment action is still on paper. On one side, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has claimed that there is regular action against encroachments, however, environment activists and the Pune irrigation division is not satisfied and demands a proper action plan rather than limited pre-monsoon activity. In 2019, Yadwadkar had filed a petition in the NGT and mentioned the 12 dumping spots in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The NGT had taken serious note of the issue and appointed a five-member committee with the MPCB as the nodal agency. NGT had also warned the municipal commissioners of PMC and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) that they should ensure that no further dumping of debris or any other waste, including the construction of waste, is disposed of in the river. However, the Pune irrigation division wrote letters to all agencies (PMC, PCMC and PMRDA) before monsoon and instructed to remove all encroachment which creates obstacles to the river flow and avoid flooding and agencies carried out minor actions. This exercise has been carried out since the last one decade. Anti-encroachment drive is only on paper Yadwadkar, said, “All agencies are carrying out cosmetic work on the issue of removal of encroachments along the river side and bed. There should be proper planning and a time bound program. In 2019, we had handed over 12 spot lists of encroachment in the riverside and bed. Most of the encroachments still exist like the Sangamwadi area, Shivane, Deccan Gymkhana area.” He further stated, “The state government had issued an order to carry out high resolution satellite images on a regular basis of corporation areas with the help of Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC), Nagpur and identify encroachments, remove it and stop it. But nothing substantial happened from any of the agencies.” Avinash Surve, former secretary of state water resource department and who was also former chief engineer of Pune irrigation division said, “Pune city had faced a flood situation in 2005. After that, we had started sending letters to PMC to remove encroachment from Mula-Mutha river. Every year, we send letters to agencies and remind them about encroachment. But, noting substantial has happened till date. It has become only a formality.” H V Gunale, chief engineer of water resource department, Pune division said, “Agencies are not responding to our letter. We provide the location of encroachments or dumping of debris. They removed encroachments partially. Lack of drainage system is also responsible for inundation. We have decided to conduct a meeting of the PMC, PMRDA, Metro and PCMC and instructed them to clear the carriageway and submit a report. At present, they don’t give any report to us. The cleaning exercise should be carried out regularly and throughout the year. It should not be limited or considered as only pre-monsoon work.” Suhas Divase, chief executive officer of PMRDA said, “Since last year, encroachment action was stopped due to a court order. Now, we will start removing encroachments from the river side. However, since the PMRDA is a planning authority and agencies such as civic bodies, gram panchyat should have to conduct a drive on a regular basis. Irrigation also has a duty to remove and track encroachment in the riverside and bed.” PMC starts work to remove encroachments Kunal Khemnar, PMC additional municipal commissioner said, “We have started removing debris from the riverside as well as garbage dumping. We have 10 JCBs to remove encroachments. The building permission department is also carrying out encroachment drives. We have also sent a letter to the Metro to remove debris from the river. We have started visiting encroachment spots along with the concerned ward officers along the riverside. We are also serving notices to private landowners along the riverside for dumping waste or debris in their premises.” “In most of the river sites, owners have dumped debris and level the areas and it has settled down now. Right now, we have decided to stop fresh dumping and after that, we will also remove old riverside dumping with the help of our machinery,” he added. ================================= BOX Total length of Mula, Mutha in PMC jurisdiction- 44 km. Mula River: Mumbai-Pune Bypass to Sangam Bridge (22.2 km). Mutha River: Mumbai-Pune Bypass to Mula-Mutha Sangam (10 km). Mula-Mutha River: Mula-Mutha Sangam to Kharadi (11.8 km). ======================================== Encroachments causes flood like Sangli and Kolhapur Sangli and Kolhapur districts in particular were the worst affected due to the floods and waterlogging in the first week of August 2019. State government set an expert committee which observed that encroachments and construction in the river basin were the key factors responsible for these floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mulamutha-river-anti-encroachment-action-only-on-paper-activists-101622390921568.html

30-05-2021||Pune||PMC to remove at least 50 dangerous gantries||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has identified and decided to remove around 50 old and dangerous gantries across the city to avoid any calamity. Last year, the PMC sky and sign department conducted a survey of gantries across the city as an overhead gantry near Sancheti hospital collapsed due to the gusty wind and rain. However, there was no causality since there was no vehicular movement on that road when the incident took place due to lockdown. According to the PMC sky and sign department statistics, there are more than 2,000 traffic sign gantries, billboards and advertising hoardings in the city area. Of that, the civic body has found around 50 gantries which are as old as 10 to 15 years. Vijay Landge, deputy commissioner of PMC sky and sign department said, “During a survey, we found that there are 50 gantries old and weak in the structure. There are chances of collapse. Therefore, we have floated a tender to demolish such old gantries and remove them, collect material and store them in the PMC godown.” He further said, “We have already removed around 26 gantries and now we want to remove another 23 gantries.” One of the officials of the sky and sign department said, “Most of the dangerous and old gantries belong to the PMC and were raised during the Commonwealth Games in 2008 which are located on the main city roads such as Nagar road, Satara road, Paud road, Baner-Balewadi, Fergusson college road, Jangali Maharaj road, Shivaji road, old Mumbai-Pune road, Airport road.” In 2018, four people were killed and seven suffered injuries after a large hoarding frame collapsed in Managalwar peth area near the Pune railway station. The incident led to action against the contractor. According to the rules and regulations of the PMC before October 2018, the hoarding owners had to submit these audit reports once every two years. However, post the incident of the hoarding collapse near the Regional Transport Office (RTO) chowk last year, the decision to submit such reports every six months was made mandatory by the civic body. ------------------------------------------------------------- Name of ward office Number of hoardings and billboards Aundh 285 Bhavani peth- 24 Bibvewadi- 54 Dhankwadi- 35 Dhole patil- 304 Hadapsar- 87 Kondwa- 92 Kothrud- 111 Nagar road- 276 Sahakarnagar- 91 Shivajinagar- 356 Tilak road- 135 Visharambaugwada- 156 Warje- 74 Yerawada- 64||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-remove-at-least-50-dangerous-gantries-101622390741468.html

After the threats, Kulkarni lodged a police complaint at Kothrud police station, and police has lodged a non-cognisable complaint against two persons in this case. 61-year-old Kulkarni is a retired professor from SNDT College in Pune, he was also a senate member of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) for 10 years and is currently working as an education activist about various education related issues. Last month, the state government declared to cancel the Class 10 exams due to the increase in the number of Covid cases. After which a petition was filed at the Bombay High Court by professor Kulkarni challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision cancelling the Class 10 board exams this year due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “I got a threat message from two persons through my Facebook account against the demand which we have raised to conduct Class 10 exams in the high court. They have said that if the exams are held and anything happens to children then I would be held responsible and have threatened me. Also, I am getting personal messages and calls through some students and parents threatening me to take back the petition,” said Kulkarni. On Friday, May 28 Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad held a press conference and announced that SSC results for this year will be declared on the basis of marks obtained by the students in their Class nine and 10 internal exams in the absence of physical board exams. “The decision taken by the state government about assessment of Class 10 students is confusing and on June 1 the state government is going to submit their affidavit in the court. Also, they are going to demand two weeks extension and we are going to oppose it as well as the new GR about the Class 10 exams assessment. Then as per the further orders given by the HC, we will follow up the case, but I think it will go in the Supreme Court and then some firm order will come over this issue,” added Kulkarni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/retired-professor-who-filed-petition-for-class-10-exam-gets-death-threats-101622390681300.html

A number of changes are being make to tackle the third wave,” Dr Baliwant added. “Contact tracing is a tool for slowing down the transmission of infectious. By tracing the interactions the civic body can quickly identify infected persons in case of an outbreak in the workplace. With the right information on hand, one can take the necessary preventive measures, like asking infected persons to self-isolate and not come to work.

In the first Covid wave in 2020, the slum had 300 confirmed cases. While the district authorities are yet to sift through the numbers to confirm this, corporators from the area and social workers believe the slum has been Covid-free in the second wave.Ambarnath Kamble, corporator, from ward 31, Pimple Gurav, the area under which the slum exists, said, “There are zero cases in the Rajiv Gandhi slum.”Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) said, “The cases in slum areas reported have been fewer than the first wave, but we are yet to compare the data.”Dr Viajya Ambedkar, medical health officer, PCMC, said, “The cases in Pimple Gurav have been lower, but we are yet to segregate the data area wise.”The slum has a population of 6,000, and residents decided not to break the rules and only ventured out in an emergency.“The people responded to all the rules and regulations. No major steps were taken, but we made sure those going out sanitised themselves completely before entering their homes,” said corporator Kamble.As per data provided by the PCMC’s Covid-19 war room, active cases in the ‘D’ zone currently stand at 669. This includes Punawale, Pimple Gurav, Pimple Saudagar, Pimple Nilakh, Tathawade and Wakad . “Overall, if you look at Pimple Gurav, the cases were fewer as compared to the first wave,” said Kamble.Ashok Dendhe, a resident of Shankar Apartment in the Rajiv Gandhi slum, said, “All essential shops in the area are very prompt about timings and make people maintain a social distance while standing in queue.

The radio, which reaches 225 villages regularly, relays information about vaccinations from the district administration, chief medical officer and other influencers. Officials claim the initiative, which started 15 days ago, has helped increase the number of villagers reaching the vaccination centres in the district. Officials said that the villagers were reluctant to take the vaccine due to several rumours that it is poisonous and may lead to impotency. “When health workers visited some villages to appeal to the locals to take the vaccine, the villagers emerged with sticks, threatening to attack them. Some even assaulted them and pushed them out of the village, alleging that the vaccine is poisonous,” said a senior official on the condition of anonymity. Only 75,225 people of the 14 lakh population of Nuh have been vaccinated till now, said officials on Friday.Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata admitted that they have been facing stiff resistance from a few villages in the districts. “Many villagers had stopped coming out of their houses and had locked themselves inside after health workers insisted that they take the jabs,” he said. Khadgata said to tackle the reluctance, the administration roped in influencers, political leaders and village sarpanchs to spread awareness. “Our idea was to reach out to maximum villagers and to bust the myths so that more and more people get vaccinated. Radio broadcasting has helped us in a big way and the numbers are increasing. This initiative will play a pro-active role in creating awareness about the pandemic and why vaccination is important,” he said. An official said that in 224 villages, which had seen zero vaccinations till at least two weeks ago, at least 50 people each had turned up for the jabs after the radio outreach commenced.In addition to vaccine awareness, Alfaz-e-Mewat is also keeping its listeners informed about the total number of Covid cases, how the pandemic is shaping, and also local events in the district related to vaccination and testing. Pooja O Murada, principal lead, Alfaz-e-Mewat, said that they have a team of three regular staff and seven broadcasting programmers, in addition to local advisers. “We have faced a challenge in terms of vaccination drives and awareness programmes as people have different myths and were not ready to listen. We started connecting to more and more people and found ‘village heroes’, who introduced themselves on the show and narrated the story of how they were misled and what their experience of vaccination was,” she said. Murada said they invited over a dozen doctors who talked about the myths surrounding the vaccinations. Sanjay Singla, sarpanch of Pinangwan, said that of the nearly 20,000 population in his village, 4,000 have been vaccinated. “The radio has helped us in spreading awareness and motivating people to get vaccinated. It has also helped bust several myths... There are nearly 9,000 people above 45 years and 50% have been covered. The drive is in process and now villagers are coming up to get vaccinated and approaching me. Earlier they had refused and did not even open the doors for us and health workers,” he said, adding that they were against him for joining the drive with administration. Rajender Kumar, sarpanch of Rehpua village, said they had launched regular awareness campaigns with the assistance of district administration to motivate the villagers to take the jabs. “Now the villagers are still listening and getting vaccinated but earlier they used to threaten people and take out weapons if anyone forced them,” he said. Khadgata said the villagers should not believe in misleading information about the vaccine. “We are announcing through loudspeakers that the vaccine is safe and has no side-effects. The vaccine will protect them from coronavirus infection. Also, we are announcing that villagers should follow the Covid protocol even after getting vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/in-vaccine-outreach-nuh-finds-a-community-radio-to-drive-message-home-101622383662050.html
30-05-2021||Other||World No-Tobacco Day: Study infers those directly exposed to tobacco at higher risk of Covid-19 complications||PUNE A Pune-based medical firm, to mark World No-Tobacco Day on May 31, has released results of a sample study of males and females directly exposed to tobacco, either through active use or through passive smoking. Based on its study, Indus Health Plus, infers that persons with tobacco exposure are more likely to suffer Covid19 complications.The study was conducted between April 2018 and January 2021. Of the 29,548 people tested in Maharashtra, 4,124 are from Pune. Across the state, 38% of males and 42% females studied displayed lung abnormalities, while in Pune, 48% of males and 53% of females showed abnormalities. The report suggests that the increase in the female population is due to a trend of smoking or consumption of tobacco amongst women. Besides that, exposure to passive smoking is also a significant reason.Amol Naikawadi, joint managing director, Indus Health Plus, said, “Smoking along with pre-existing lung ailments can exacerbate the conditions significantly. Moreover, in the current Covid-19 scenario, the situation becomes critical as it can have an adverse outcome, especially in terms of the time taken to recover from the disease. When we say passive smokers, all of us constitute that group, however, our study found that those who are directly exposed to smokers either at home or in offices for a prolonged period are more likely to show such abnormalities.” He added, “Consumption of tobacco in any form increases the risk of developing severe Covid-19 outcomes. In addition, it also increases the risk of diseases like COPD, brain stroke, heart attack, asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease (respiratory disease), and diabetes. The younger generation consumes smoke and smokeless tobacco due to peer pressure, to make a style statement and due to stress. A strong will power, medical counselling and oral medication help overcome smoking.”“People consuming tobacco or smoking have a higher risk of being infected with the virus through the mouth. If smokers contract Covid-19, they face a greater risk of a severe infection as their lung health is already compromised. Apart from that, the psychological and economic effects of smoking are also very adverse. Therefore, quitting tobacco consumption in any form will reduce the risk of various ailments and will lead to wellness and a healthy lifestyle,” said Naikawadi.The World Health Organisation (WHO), based on multiple studies, concluded that available evidence suggests that smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Although related to severity, there is no evidence to quantify the risk to smokers of hospitalisation with Covid-19, or of infection by Sars-CoV-2, as per peer-reviewed literature. Indus Health Plus provides preventive healthcare services and is headquartered in Pune. Indus has also partnered with hospitals and diagnostic labs in 78 Indian cities, across more than 122 centres. The company was set up in 2000 and is ISO certified. It mainly deals with diseases caused by environmental changes and sedentary lifestyles, which have resulted in a rising number of non-communicable diseases, affecting all age groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/world-no-tobacco-day-study-infers-those-directly-exposed-to-tobacco-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-complications-101622383600660.html
30-05-2021||Lucknow||UP records 95% drop in Covid-19 cases in a month, state govt credits 'Yogi model'||Uttar Pradesh recorded 1,908 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a span of 24 hours, according to the state government on Sunday. This is the first time in the last two months that the state's daily caseload fell below two thousand, the release from the state government said, adding that daily cases have registered a decline of 95 per cent from its peak.It also said that the number of active cases in the state has dropped by 87 per cent from its peak of 3,10,783 on April 30 and currently stands at 41,214.Calling it "remarkable", the Uttar Pradesh government said this signals control over the deadly virus.The state government's release also compared the state's positivity rate with other badly-hit states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu during similar time period. It said that while other states failed to control their positivity rate, Uttar Pradesh brought its test positivity rate to 0.5% with the help of the ‘Yogi Model’. “Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra with high number of fresh cases have miserably failed to show any reduction in their positivity rate that stands at 19%, 16.4% and 16.51%, respectively,” the government release said.“The ‘Yogi Model’ of Test-Trace-Treat (T3) testifying its success in curbing the spread of coronavirus resulted in the fall of the positivity rate of Uttar Pradesh to 0.5 per cent, the lowest so far. The positivity rate has been maintained below 1 percent for five straight days now," it further added.The government claimed that due to alertness of government officials coupled with bold decisions and swift measures taken by them, Uttar Pradesh saw its recovery rate shoot up to 96.4%, with more than 6,000 recoveries in the last 24 hours. It also said that due to the implementation of the T3 regime the administration was able to contain the spread of Covid-19. Uttar Pradesh tested 340,096 people on Saturday out of which at least 140,000 of those were RT-PCR tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-records-95-drop-in-covid-19-cases-in-month-state-govt-credits-yogi-model-101622377275457.html

As per the proposal, those people, who do not have a family to look after following the vaccination, can stay in the hotel after inoculation...Here 500 people have been vaccinated," the mayor said.The hotel is not to be blamed, but the hospital has not adhered to the norms concerning the cold storage of vaccines, she said."How did they get Covaxin doses when many BMC centres don't have them? I found doses, which were stored in a normal fridge. This can result in side-effects to those vaccinated. The recovered vaccines have been sealed and an inquiry will be carried out," Pedkenar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-finds-covid-19-vaccines-stored-in-normal-fridge-at-hotel-in-andheri-101622377144257.html
30-05-2021||Delhi||Amid Covid crisis in cities, air ambulances put far-flung hospitals within reach for many||New Delhi/Mumbai: As a Beechcraft Super King Air B-200 air ambulance touched down in Sahnewal, 7.5 miles southeast of Ludhiana, after a 50-minute flight from Delhi, paramedics hurriedly shifted a Covid patient out of the plane to an ambulance and rushed him to a hospital where his family members reserved a bed for him. With the oxygen saturation of the patient dropping precariously, and no beds available in any Delhi-NCR hospital, the family started exploring options in cities in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. As soon as they managed a bed with oxygen support in Ludhiana, they booked an air ambulance and took the patient there. The fourth Covid wave completely overwhelmed the healthcare system in the national capital with hospitals first running out of beds and then oxygen supply. For a couple of weeks there were no beds available in any hospital, especially in the ICUs. With health care resources stretched to their limits, desperate families did whatever they could to arrange hospital care for their relatives. According to Lakshay Rescue air ambulance services based in New Delhi, when the cases of infection surged many folds recently, at least 70% of the flights they operated were between Delhi and cities such as Ludhiana, Patiala, Jalandhar, Lucknow and Varanasi. “We operated almost one flight every day. The situation was so bad that we even had patients who consumed 5-6 oxygen cylinders in an hour-long flight. Usually, we travel only with one or two oxygen cylinders. Because of the shortage, we had customers wanting to take their patients to tier-2 and tier-3 cities, mainly in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh as they are closer to Delhi. People were ready to take their patients wherever they could arrange an oxygen bed or ventilator,” said Birendra Kumar Mishra, marketing head at Lakshay Rescue. Shaju Kumar, the chief executive officer of air ambulance service AEROMED International Rescue Services Ltd, said when Delhi was reeling under severe oxygen shortage and hospitals were running full, his company operated many fights to cities that would not be people’s first choice when it comes to availing medical facilities. Such a trend was, however, not only limited to Delhi. Accretion Aviation that is based out of Mumbai and Indore witnessed a similar trend. Rahul Mucchal, owner of the firm, said due to the extreme stress on the medical infrastructure and non-availability of hospital beds in metro cities, many families shifted their Covid patients to smaller or less developed cities, wherever they managed to book a bed or medical care, as required. “We transported patients from bigger cities to cities like Indore and Ranchi. Some of these are migrants while others have friends or family members running hospitals in these tier 2 and tier 3 cities. The booking volume too, this year, has been unprecedented,” he said. DEMAND At the time, Mucchal’s Accretion Aviation was completely booked and was committing to bookings only 24 to 28 hours ahead of the departure. “We get 30-35 enquiries per day, sometimes even 50. Of these, only four to five are converted to bookings. The demand is ever increasing April onwards. We operate Covid air ambulances which are bed to bed; implying that we provide an ICCU ambulance to the airport, then isolation pods in the aircraft, along with medical teams and ICCU equipment on board and then ground ambulance at the destination,” he said.AEROMED’s Shaju Kumar said his firm had witnessed a 100% hike in demand. “When there was severe oxygen crisis in Delhi and other places, we were flying three flights a day. Usually we used to fly one flight every day. This is a three-fold rise. All are Covid patients and we have three pods available. Covid patients are only kept in pods which helps us contain the spread when there are others (staff and paramedics) travelling along in the same plane,” he said. At the same time, Lakhsya Rescue also had a tough time dealing with the steep surge in the number of enquiries and calls per day. “From 25 to 30 calls, our daily enquiries had gone up to roughly about 100-120 queries a day. People, most commonly, ask about the charges, facilities included, availability of flights and most importantly safety and precautions taken onboard,” the firm said. However, on the contrary, in the current situation, it has also been observed that bookings of air ambulances for non-Covid patients have drastically fallen. According to Amit Kumar, the founder of Flaps Aviation that runs Book Air Ambulance fleet of aircraft, they receive about 50 enquiries for air lifting only Covid patients daily, whereas the calls for air lifting non-Covid patients have gone down. “The overall demand for air ambulances even in tier II and III cities has gone up for Covid patients, as the relatives of the patients want to shift them to hospitals in other cities for better treatment and as per the bed availability,” he said. COST With increased demand, the cost of hiring air ambulances has also gone up. Operators said factors that have led to a rise in cost are expensive charges of medical team that takes the risk of travelling along a Covid patient, arrangements of pods – in which a Covid patient is kept to contain the spread of the virus and availability – as service providers often pay extra to arrange for an aircraft at a shot notice. Prices also vary depending upon what kind of aircraft is being used, how much crew is needed onboard and how many family members will travel along. According to Accretion Aviation, for a Goa to Mumbai flight, a patient might need to shell out as much as Rs. 1.8 lakh for a twin engine turboprop C 90, whereas a flight from Delhi to Chhattisgarh will cost around ₹8.5 lakh on a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. Similarly, charges from Indore to Delhi will be aroun dRs 10-12 lakh and between Indore and Mumbai, may go up to Rs. 13.5 lakh for a Super King Air B-200 plane. The isolation pods, which are mandatory to carry Covid patients, also affect the pricing. Shaju Kumar of AEROMED, which has three isolation pods available, said the cost of renting a pod has gone up due to a major spike in demand. “While an air ambulance between Delhi and Mumbai would cost around ₹9 lakh earlier, it is now ₹14-15 lakh. Isolation pods which used to cost ₹50,000 earlier, will cost upwards of ₹1.5 lakh,” he said. AVAILABILITY Even as families may be willing to pay the sky-high rentals, the availability of air ambulances is another challenge amid the rise in demand. Among the reasons cited for shortage include mandatory protocols that need to be followed while ferrying a Covid patient. Besides, industry veterans also point out rostering of crew to be one of the challenges, as they are bound to undergo mandatory quarantine after flying an infected passenger. According to veterans, the country has around a dozen air ambulance operators. “India has 12 to 15 air ambulance operators, and it is important to note that not all air ambulance operators are flying Covid patients due to logistical issues,” said a member of Business Aircraft Operators Association (BAOA). Highlighting the difficulties, he added, “Strict protocols are to be followed while flying a Covid infected person. Currently, the demand is much more. An aircraft needs to be thoroughly sanitised every time after a Covid patient is flown, not allowing more than five operations per day. Moreover, the shortage of isolation pods that is mandatory for carrying Covid patients is also a major drawback.” Accretion Aviation’s Rahul Mucchal said apart from the aircraft, many a times, ground ambulances aren’t available. “Because of the shortage, we try to accommodate the most critical first. We have now started to tie up with various ground ambulance providers, which we use for distances up to 400-500 km to increase our service and ensure availability,” he said. AEROMED also said that the availability is an issue even now. “It depends on aircraft providers. We only provide for medical services and equipment. Whoever needs to book an air ambulance needs to make booking in advance as planes are not available at short notice. Once the booking is made, we arrange for everything and this may take up to a day or two,” said Shaju Kumar, the CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-covid-crisis-in-cities-air-ambulances-put-far-flung-hospitals-within-reach-for-many-101622376459956.html

Mehta said also introduced one mobile dental OPD in the district.He also elaborated how a newly-introduced protocol has helped the district save huge amounts of medical oxygen everyday at a time when its shortage was resulting in deaths and panic around the country.“The administration has put in place a combination of best practices, spanning from correct identification of oxygen requirement in patients, monitoring the use of oxygen based on actual need, plugging leakages and irregularities in supply and forecasting the demand,” said the Bikaner collector.He added that 200 Oxygen Mitras were deputed to monitor oxygen usage in wards of Covid care facilities, resulting in saving of over 200 oxygen cylinders out of 18,000 cylinders used daily. Mehta said the practice had reduced the usage of oxygen helping save 6,000 cylinders in a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bikaners-oxygen-mitra-model-gets-pm-narendra-modi-s-praise-101622375922842.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A beacon in the bleakness||Patram Sharma lays no claim to a cultivated interest in bird watching. All he knew were pahari names of common birds and snatches of conversation the affable general-store owner overheard while serving tea and snacks to photographers from the tricity touring the birding hotspot of Chakki Modh in the Solan hills. But beneath Patram’s mofussil modesty, an infectious toothy grin and a balding visage lay a heart of gold. Two birds had died while pecking and banging their heads at the reflective glass windows Patram recently installed in his residential quarters constructed above the store. The razzle-dazzle of the glass was quite a novelty in Patram’s modest neighbourhood. As horrified birders watched, an Indian Golden oriole would go hammer and tongs at the windows, hell-bent on ending up in a sad, crumpled sheaf of feathers in the drain below. A concerned birder, Jatinder Vijh of Chandigarh, was having his customary tea at Patram’s last month. Vijh gently suggested to Patram that he should somehow discard the vanity of his flashy windows and save the suicidal oriole. “Birds peck at windows ferociously mistaking their reflection for a rival bird’s presence in the area during breeding season. Covid curfews kicked in and I could not visit his shop for a month. I got a Covid e-pass and reached his shop last week. Patram had nailed curtains from the outside and covered the windows. The oriole had stopped pecking at the windows, had calmed down and was at a nearby nest. Patram developed an interest in birds and photographed the Indian paradise flycatcher and Asian barred owlet with his cellphone during the April-May lockdown. Birds have begun to excite his curiosity, he engages us passionately and is eager to learn their English names,” an elated Vijh told this writer. It was by no means an easy decision, a ‘charity of convenience’ for Patram to veil his windows from the outside and disfigure the architectural aesthetics. The windows were installed to lend privacy to his family as the reflective surfaces were limited to a one-way view. “My new residential quarters are on the main road, so privacy is an issue. The builder recommended the windows and they cost ₹12,000 for six sheets. But birds started dying and Vijh planted the seed of understanding and compassion in me. I was troubled and cast my thoughts into the future: here I was building a house and if deaths (of birds) occur at the start, it would not be a good omen for my family,” Patram told this writer. Patram’s benevolence for birds can partially be traced to sub-conscious influences exerted by traditional pahari cultures. He vaguely remembers the grannies putting out grains and water for small birds that expressed an accommodation of creatures in human lives. Shopkeepers around him still allow barn and wire-tailed swallows unfettered access to their buildings as they feel a nest serves as a good omen. Grateful swallows construct pot-shaped nests of scraped mud clinging to ceiling corners in shops, where their chicks remain relatively safer. However, environment-friendly structures and cultures of the Himalayas are unravelling at the seams due to allurements such as cement, air-tight buildings and reflective glass. Canny builders hard sell such glitzy, ultra-modern lifestyle choices to the simple, hardy folk. Millions of birds die globally by crashing into windows, especially in glittering cities protruding into the skies like sore thumbs. Various measures (via a Google search) can be adopted by householders —at some sacrifice to their comfort, purse and lifestyle dazzle — to remedy gardens and windows to more bird-friendly modes. The simple, benevolent soul of Patram shines in the hills above us like a beacon of inspiration. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-a-beacon-in-the-bleakness-101622373462474.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Conquering Covid in rural areas||As the coronavirus continues its ravenous march, the infection has started rapidly spreading in rural areas as well. This is a worrisome development as 70% of India’s population of 1.36 billion, lives in 6,64,369 villages, where medical facilities are scarce. The fight against Covid in villages has to be fought on a war-footing since the rural health infrastructure is weak and collecting information is problematic. India has around 23,390 primary health centres (PHCs) and 1,45,894 sub-centres. The disease will be harder to manage in villages as compared to cities. While combating the virus in the villages, the health departments should involve the headman and local panchayats, the five-man committee that administers the village. Villagers have to be briefed sensitively about the dangers of Covid and how to manage it. The panchayat should maintain records of infections and recoveries in the village. Since data collection is weak in the villages, it is possible that we may not know the extent of the problem in the rural areas in time. Doctors will not be easily available in villages even on phones. Thus, the panchayats will have to liaise closely between the villagers and health departments. Local governing bodies should form an auxiliary volunteer force ‘Covid Warriors’, comprising youngsters who will brief people of the precautions to be taken. Medical students from the state should lead this exercise. Social distancing should be practised in weekly markets, which attract hundreds of villagers. Opinion leaders Opinion leaders in villages — school teachers, priests, and doctors — should be roped in to raise awareness. These opinion leaders have credibility and thus should take the responsibility of educating villagers. This awareness is vital for many afflicted persons may not even know they have Covid. They may mistake it for an ordinary cold. The key message should be that the disease is curable and patients should report any symptoms at the earliest. The facilities in the primary health centres in the villages need to be augmented to conduct Covid tests. It will be a challenge to get vaccines, oxygen, oximeters and drugs such as Remdesivir in adequate quantities to primary health centres in the villages due to the current shortages. Nevertheless, district authorities need to establish robust supply chains at the earliest. Doctors and scientists have underscored the importance of face masks in the fight against Covid. Yet, many villagers do not use masks. Some just wear it around the chin. Many people find it inconvenient to wear a mask, because it reduces the oxygen intake. Research is needed to improve the mask, so that it protects and also ensures adequate oxygen. Free distribution of masks by the governments can also help fight Covid. The corporate sector can also produce masks and distribute them free of cost in villages, as part of their corporate social responsibility initiatives. They can print the names of some of their brands on the masks for advertising mileage. One out of every three 4G subscribers lives in villages in India, as per a study by CyberMedia Research. With the use of smart phones and internet leapfrogging in villages, advertising agencies should prepare special Covid rural campaigns for mobile phones. Mobile phones, television and radio can be aggressively deployed by state governments to guide villagers on fighting Covid. Vaccine distribution A major challenge being faced by the authorities is the transportation of vaccines to the 2,36,004 small villages, with a population of 500 or less. It will be an enormous undertaking, to transport the vaccine to tiny villages. Governments should network with companies such as Nestle, Unilever and Colgate to distribute the vaccine. These companies have distribution reach even in villages with a population of 1,500 or less through their vans. Companies engaged in products such as frozen foods and ice-creams can assist in logistics of vaccine distribution in villages. Health departments can deploy vans with freezers to transport the vaccines to villages. It will also be useful to create songs, based on the local folk music, incorporating fight Covid messages. The song can be played during mask distribution and demonstrations on social distancing. There is an urgent need to augment health facilities in primary health centres in terms of beds, health facilities and oxygen. The battle against Covid in villages should commence right now. We should not be caught unawares.(The writer is a Mumbai-based management consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-conquering-covid-in-rural-areas-101622373280092.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Pigeon pair or two of a kind?||Change is the only constant. As I transition from the hustle-bustle of my residency in Bangalore to life as a consultant in a government hospital , I see change everywhere. A self-confessed Chandigarh aficionado, a particular pattern ticks me and compels me to write this piece. Recently while on call, I was told that an emergency caesarean section had to be performed and the mother had been diagnosed with postpartum haemorrhage (complication of a placenta position). Being a paediatrician, I reach the scene, that is, the operation theatre, early to take history and ensure safe delivery of the newborn . The mother was a 28-year-old Kharar resident with two healthy daughters and no other complications. Our team, comprising an anaesthetist, a gynecologist and nurses, stabilise the evidently nervous patient. As the baby let out its first cries (the best moment for any paediatrician), the mother even more panic-stricken, kept asking the gender. Her disappointment was palpable when she saw the baby. Even semi-conscious, she kept mumbling that the baby needed to be a boy.Confused, I kept thinking of the incident throughout my rounds. Later, I checked on the baby and ended up asking the inevitable: Why do you not want a girl child? I hear about the pressure she is under to provide her husband with a male heir. Saddened, I finish and head home thinking where are we wrong as a society? A lady gave birth to a healthy female child, in a OT full of female staff still feels vulnerable to these pressures? Born in a home where my mother, an only child, had two daughters, and my elder sister also has two beautiful girls, I do not understand where this school of thought stems from. My mom, the driving force behind us, tells us that we are her entire world and that if there is a place for us with no entry or exit time, it is hers. Is a family not complete with two daughters ? We are the sugar and the salt of our family. My sister is known for her sound advice and literary skills and I for a solid vote, sharing a laugh and lightening the mood. The four of us neatly fit into each other’s lives. Is this the norm in business families? It does not resonate, seeing as my nieces are the darlings of the family and my mother-in-law longs for a daughter. I sit down as a doctor, daughter, granddaughter, wife and daughter-in-law to understand why investment in ‘my clan’ is ‘zero investment’? Why right to breathe, celebrate and educate is a tribulation . Everything today is as an asset or liability but education, values and love to your girl is a long-term investment with 100% return. Equal division of tasks between children, irrespective of gender, in the south is responsible for their high sex ratios. With Punjab’s ratio being 895: 1,000 we are far behind states like Kerala. Blame the government ? Negative stereotypes surrounding the girl child make people do cruel things but organisations such as Nanhi Chhaanprovide basic education, healthcare and livelihood opportunities . With schemes like Mai Bhago for education and Bebe Nanki Ladli to curb female foeticide. Where are we failing? My father says, “No one can love you in this world as much as daughters.” They are a ray of hope and sparkle of sunshine. From miles away, they can tell your mood is off by the way you sound. Carrying your legacy forward, your values to another household, they will make someone’s house a home, while still making yours their home for life. So why stop them? Let them live, give them wings, and allow them footprints in the map of the world. Educate them instead of investing in dowry. Yet to start a family, I do not know whether we will have a pigeon pair or two of a kind, but we will value and cherish the healthy baby not the gender. bubbutir@yahoo.com( The writer is senior resident at civil hospital in Mohali)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-pigeon-pair-or-two-of-a-kind-101622372920011.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Lend an ear to Nature’s symphony||Unwrapping a rustic envelop addressed to me, I came upon a white cardboard, nestled within which lay a white-jacketed book: bright as the daylight. The cover was embossed with a green rectangular image of a leaf glistening with beads of dew, like a necklace of peals, adding serenity and grace to the book. The book, Patte, Patte Likhi Ibarat (A Message On Every Leaf), an episodic and illustrated collection intertwined with poetry and pictures, has been co-authored by eminent poet Gurbhajan Singh Gill and ace photographer Tej Partap Singh Sandhu. It echoes Nature’s beauty, bounty, secrets, sublimity, sensitivity, sensibilities and its relationships with humans, mirroring in some ways their emotions, and reflecting their deeds and spiritual needs. Given the hurried pace of our lives, we often miss or ignore the bounties Nature has bestowed upon us. We are forever in pursuit of peace, harmony, happiness and prosperity. However, all these remain elusive, a mirage, because we do not know how to or where to find them. We stand blinded by life’s daily grind. The poetry and snapshots in the book are a gentle reminder, a nudge that there is a beautiful world beyond materialistic wants. If it is so, the book provides enough cues to lead towards peace, harmony and happiness in life, matched, as if it were, by the whiteness of each page that radiates, signifies and amplifies Nature’s purity and simplicity. It is a palette of colours and couplets, which stirs and stimulates emotions and draws us to Nature. Each page speaks out and stands out. Each page is different. It is difficult to decide whether to first look at the picture or to read the juxtaposed couplet. It is not just the leaves’ ibarat, it is the authors’ ibadat to God - the creator. The two have tried to read the lines (veins) of leaves, as one would do in palmistry! All pictures are home-grown, literally, as Sandhu clicked them in his garden: the little world in an oyster that he nurtures and nurses. It is his tribute to the Divine. He seems to have felt, heard the rustle, the whispers, the sighs, and the smiles of the leaves - fresh, young, old, dying or dead; the flowers, the petals and the sepals. He seems to have followed the swaying branches’ shades, and shadows to capture their silence. Gurbhajan seems to have felt their impulse, pulse, anguish, and laughter and, in return, given voice to their feelings of silence, agony and ecstasy. As one softly turns each page, lest one disturbs the tranquillity or leave smudge marks on the pages, one is drawn towards Nature, which is so close, yet we make it seem so far, so distant. Involuntarily, compulsively, one turns to look at the green surroundings, flower beds and plantations: ever smiling, ever beckoning! In our daily run-of-the-mill lives, we miss the sky-kissing trees, the beauty and grace of the majestically swaying multi-shaded foliage in the geometrically-designed leaves of different contours: broad, slender, and conical; some with serrated edges. There are myriad flowers, a riot of colour, and, of course, edible and inedible fruits. It is sheer beauty to see and observe old leaves leave the parent plants, new leaves sprout on bare branches, change colours, flutter in the wind, while the rays of the rising or setting sun give these leaves rainbow hues. Just as blossomed flowers and lush green leaves have their own beauty, so do the wilted, dry fallen flowers and leaves that blow away with every whiff of air. Gurbhajan has explicitly expressed this emotion in one of the couplets accompanying a picture of a wilted rose. The rose plant attributes its wilting to ‘termites’ in the soil. And, with sarcasm, he echoes rose’s agony: I am a habitat of Punjab! Sensitive, informed would know what has been conveyed, so succinctly! One singular feature of the book, apart from its printing, is the use of the handwriting font. It looks as if Gurbhajan has written the lines himself! Each picture and couplet has a unique and matching colour combination as well. A reader or viewer will have a choice of her own to tick a picture or a couplet. The success of the two master craftsmen would be achieved even if one reader or viewer gets inspired while savouring just one of the 103 pages. Maybe, even a generation of readers will be inspired and motivated to pause, observe, think, preserve and protect Nature. The book is a concert of nature, a symphony that reminds us how oblivious we are of its beauty and secrets!

30-05-2021||Pune||Curtain call: A story enacted in pauses||So, while we are on the subject of adapting plays, I thought of sharing one more experience before moving on to something different. Though it didn’t run for as long as the other two did, it is very important for me personally. We used to have reading sessions of our old theatre group when we were not rehearsing for plays. I remember that a team member had read this story from a magazine. It was a letter written by a man to his father, who he hasn’t met in the last sixteen years. The father left one day after charges of corruption were filed against him. He had always been a family man, providing well for his wife, and doting on his son and young daughter. After he leaves without informing them, the family goes through a turbulent phase. Not financially as they are well cared for by their relatives, but it leaves a huge vacuum emotionally. Especially in the life of this boy who considered his father as his role-model. It has been sixteen years to this incident and they haven’t heard from his father still. The son is now successful in his career, has a family of his own but this incident still keeps him awake during some nights. The only respite he has is writing about this in his journal. This particular entry is in the form of a letter addressed to his father. After I heard the story, I kept thinking what will happen if the father finally met his son? The story was told from the point of view of only the son. I would have loved to hear what the father had to say about himself. He must have experienced a huge gap in his personal life as well. The letter mentioned that he had an affair with another woman. But there must have been times when he missed his wife and kids. It could not have been all rosy for him. Was there any guilt for his actions? If yes, how did he deal with it? This was one major character that I had to add. And it was interesting to imagine his world and the life that he must have lived for the past sixteen years. There were also many details about the son’s life that we had to imagine as well. But the thing I loved doing the most was their actual confrontation. There were two options – the audience sees the father enter and introduce himself or the father and son have already met. I chose the latter. While choosing the first option was a far easier route in terms of exposition, I thought the second option opened up a possibility of awkwardness. Such extreme awkwardness will cause discomfort to the audience too. And so after the curtain rose and the play started, we showed these two characters sitting in a similar position. A pose that is simple – sitting on a chair with their right leg on their left and hands folded, with their heads slightly tilted to the left – but most certainly imprinted in their genes. It just made the audience believe that these two are related to each other. The actors and I believed that once the father meets his son, there will be more than a few moments of silence, where both of them won’t know what to say to each other! We decided to start our play there. So, right at the beginning, there was absolute silence for about a minute. Where both of them are waiting for the other to speak. And I think we were successful in adapting their relationship from the story to the stage in that one minute. The dialogues were minimal. The script was hardly twenty pages long. But the play was full of awkward pauses and even the information flowed in bits and pieces. I always treat the audience as intelligent and do not believe in spoon-feeding them at every moment. If all their questions are answered by the end of the play, then that should be fine. By the end of the play we have understood both sides. While the father is able to explain why he disappeared, there isn’t and cannot be any excuse for leaving his family and not connecting with them for so many years. While the man helps his father financially and is grateful that he has finally got closure and that he might be able to sleep well at night, he refuses to be available for him emotionally. His decision might change in the future but not right now. The father understands this and leaves. After the man leaves, his son, who has maintained a strong stance in front of him, hugs his own child and breaks down uncontrollably. I had not named the play till the last moment as I could not come up with a suitable name. It was hardly a surprise that my mother suggested the most appropriate name. Later, I borrowed that name for a film of mine, which had a completely different storyline, but dealt with the same relationship. Baapjanma – the birth of a father. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or inperson||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-a-story-enacted-in-pauses-101622371480357.html

One of the patients was “overcharged” ₹2 lakh.A special committee was constituted and it found out that the hospitals had indeed charged more fees from these patients, when compared to the rates fixed by the state government.As per the committee report, in one case, Paras Hospital, Panchkula, had charged ₹8,09,447 from a patient, ₹2,50,962 over the fixed rate. In other two cases, Paras Hospital was found to have charged ₹26,135 and ₹18,100 in excess.The fourth complaint was against Alchemist Hospital, which had charged ₹1,85,600, ₹3,200 was in excess.Hospitals were directed to reimburse excess amountsDr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said: “To ensure that patients are not fleeced by private hospitals during the pandemic, the state government had fixed rates for Covid treatment. Last year, we got four complaints of overcharging, following which a committee was constituted, which had directed the hospitals to refund the excess amount.”She added: “They have not reimbursed the amount yet.”A spokesperson from Paras Hospital said: “We have refunded all bills and none is pending. One of the patients was Chanderkanta, who was charged over ₹8 lakh, and we have refunded around ₹2 lakh.”Spokesperson of the Alchemist Hospital said: “The excess amount was ambulance charges and it has been refunded.”Dr Jasjeet Kaur said: “I have checked with Sanjay Chanderkanta and three other patients. They have not received any reimbursement yet.”Kaur said that this year, they have received at least five complaints of overcharging by various private hospitals including Alchemist, Paras, Wings and others. One patient was charged as high as ₹14 lakh for Covid treatment.Most of the complaints were received by Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta, who also wrote to the chief minister of Haryana. On May 28, a committee headed by additional deputy commissioner Mohd Imran Raza indicted the two private hospitals in five complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/overcharged-during-first-wave-4-covid-patients-still-await-refund-panchkula-cmo-101622370640015.html

It was dehydrated but the cyclone or the consequent flooding of the forest is not the cause," Yadav said, adding the post-mortem would reveal the exact reason.The last tiger census of Sunderbans (2019-20) put the number of Royal Bengal Tiger population in Sunderbans to 96.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tiger-dies-while-being-taken-to-sajnekhali-camp-for-treatment-101622365013657.html

30-05-2021||Lucknow||UP govt launches welfare scheme for children who lost parents to Covid-19||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday launched a welfare scheme for children who have either lost both of their parents to Covid-19 or the earning parent.The move by the UP government comes a day after the Supreme Court observed that it cannot even imagine how many children in this large country have got orphaned due to the devastating pandemic, and directed the state authorities to immediately identify them and provide relief.Elaborating about the scheme, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, "Children who have lost both of their parents to Covid-19, a surviving parent, legal guardian in case the parents have already died earlier, will be included in this scheme. Children, who have lost the earning parent of their family will also be included in the scheme. The state government is committed to better health, better education and for the bright future of the children."Under the Uttar Pradesh Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, the state government will provide financial assistance to a child's guardian while those who do not have anyone to look after them will be sent to children's homes, an official spokesperson said.Launching the scheme here, Adityanath said the state government will take care of the upbringing and education of children orphaned by Covid-19.As part of the scheme, the government will provide a monthly financial assistance of ₹4,000 to a child's guardian or caretaker till he or she attains adulthood, the spokesperson said.A senior official said that UP is the first state in the country to come up with a welfare scheme for children who were orphaned due to Covid-19.Children below 10 years who do not have any family member will be taken care of by the state government children's homes. Currently, such homes are functional in Mathura, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Agra and Rampur, he said.A minor girl child will be housed in Kasturba Gandhi Girls (Residential) Schools run by Government of India or children's homes (girls) run by the state government. Currently, there are 13 such children's homes in the state.Apart from this, they will be taken care of in 18 Atal Residential Schools being set up in the state.The state government will also provide an amount of ₹1,01,000 for the marriage of such girls.The spokesperson said there are 197 children in the state who have lost both their parents to Covid-19. As many as 1,799 children have lost either their father or mother to Covid-19 but the annual income of the surviving parents will be evaluated.Around 1,000 children are likely to benefit from the Uttar Pradesh Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, he said.The state government will also provide tablets or laptops to all such children studying in schools, colleges or pursuing vocational education, according to the spokesperson.The top court had asked state governments to understand the agony of children starving on the streets and directed district authorities that they be immediately taken care of without waiting for any further orders from the courts.A vacation bench of Justices L N Rao and Aniruddha Bose directed district administrations to identify the orphans in their areas and upload their data on the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) website by Saturday evening.The top court's direction came on an application filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal in the pending suo motu case seeking identification of orphaned children due to Covid-19 or otherwise and providing them immediate relief by the state governments.The bench said state governments must inform it of the position of these children and the steps they have taken to provide them immediate relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-launches-welfare-scheme-for-children-who-lost-parents-to-covid19-101622353773158.html

He added that if people follow the regulations, there will be no need to extend the lockdown. All districts of Karnataka are currently under a lockdown till 6 am on June 7.While lockdown announced initially was supposed to end on May 10, experts insisted to impose lockdown from May 10 to 24, which was later extended till June 7.Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, Yediyurappa said: “The lockdown will be in effect till June 7 and we will assess the situation and decide what happens next. The strict restrictions will be in place till then and depending on Covid-19 cases reducing, we will take the next decision. If people cooperate, the question of extending the lockdown may not arise but people have to cooperate, that is all.”Yediyurappa on Saturday also announced the CM Baalaseva scheme for children who lost their parents due to Covid-19. Under this scheme, the government will provide ₹3,500 to guardians of the children who lost both their parents in the pandemic. Similarly, for children who have passed standard 10, they will be given laptops and girl students above the age of 21, will be provided ₹1 lakh for marriage, higher education, or entrepreneurship, the government said.“Children who don’t have any guardians will be taken care of in the childcare institutions and to provide then quality education children will be admitted to (government-run) residential schools,” Yediyurappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-decision-on-extending-lockdown-saysyediyurappa-101622351325157.html
30-05-2021||Bangalore||'Don’t lower guard': Experts warn against Covid 3rd wave in Karnataka||The daily Covid-19 numbers reported in the past few days in Karnataka point at the downward trend of the second wave of the pandemic, with experts saying the spike in cases would stabilise by mid-June. They, however, warned against lowering the guard, and added that the third wave was inevitable by the end of October. Looking at the experiences of the European countries, experts said, the third wave could be deadlier than the first two.“It is a clear indication that by the third wave, we have to strengthen the medical infrastructure in order to treat higher number of patients than the second wave. The next few months should be used for that,” said Giridhar Babu, a professor of epidemiology and member of the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19.However, the preparation for the third wave has to go beyond just medical infrastructure and oxygen supply, experts said, adding that the younger population might be the most vulnerable group in the third wave. Babu said with most senior citizens getting vaccinated by then, those below 18 years, if not vaccinated by then, would be the most vulnerable. He also said that infections among children would be a bigger concern.In Karnataka, during the first wave between March and September 2020, as many as 19,378 children under the age of 10 were infected. From then until May this year, 49,257 in the age group have tested positive for Covid-19. As many as 68,635 children under the age of 10 have been infected till May 20 this year, according to state health department data.The case was similar in the 10-19 age group as 41,895 tested positive for the virus between March and September 2020, while another 131,391 got infected since then, taking the total to 173,286 so far, the state data suggests.State health director Om Prakash Patil, who held consultations with 17 experts and members of the state unit of the Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP) on Friday, said Karnataka will come out with guidelines on handling paediatric Covid-19 infections. “We discussed what can be done to prevent spread among children and how we can ramp up our infrastructure and train manpower to handle paediatric cases if at all the projections come true,” Patil said.Shivananda, former director of the state-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, who attended the meeting, said the state needs more manpower trained in handling child cases as the existing number of paediatricians may not be adequate. “Only a fraction of the infected child cases may require ventilators. Most of the new ventilators come with settings that can be adjusted for paediatric use. What the state may require is more paediatric BIPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines and paediatric ICU beds,” he said.“Also, as home isolation of infected children is very difficult without parents’ supervision, we have asserted that vaccination of parents should be given priority. If they are immunised, the risk of them getting infected while handling Covid positive children will be minimal,” Shivananda added.Another point of concern has been the deaths among the 30-45 age group, experts said. Compared to the first wave, more deaths were reported in this age category in the second wave. Babu said in many cases undetected comorbidities could have been the reason for deaths. “As we are expected to witness the third wave, it was important that people get themselves tested to understand the various comorbidities they have. In India, people get these comorbidities at least 10 years before other countries,” he said.Babu added that the pace of vaccination will be a key factor in preparing for the third wave. “We are vaccinating elderly, and it is showing results, but it important that we vaccinate the younger population as well. We can’t emphasise this enough,” Babu said.The Karnataka government has formally announced a 13-member committee of medical experts, headed by noted cardiac surgeon Devi Prasad Shetty, to prepare a roadmap to tackle the possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced Shetty’s name on May 14, after the Karnataka high court asked the government to submit its plans to tackle the pandemic.Experts also said it was important to increase the number of beds in hospitals and other infrastructure, referring to the countless reports of patients dying without getting a hospital bed. In the second wave of Covid-19, the proportion of people who died without getting a hospital bed increased exponentially. While 3.8% of all deaths in the first wave were reported outside of hospitals, in the second wave, it jumped up to 9.3%, or one in every 10 Covid fatalities in Karnataka, shows the analysis of health bulletins released by the Karnataka state health department on so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dont-lower-guard-experts-warn-against-covid-3rd-wave-in-karnataka-101622351330146.html
30-05-2021||Noida||Rains likely in next two days, to bring mercury down||The combined effect of cyclone Yaas and western disturbances may bring light rains in Noida and adjoining areas over the next two days, weather experts at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.According to IMD, while easterly winds already brought the mercury down by two notches in the past 24 hours, there are high chances of rains between May 31 and June 2 that would drop the mercury by three to four degrees Celsius (°C).“As a combined effect of cyclone Yaas and back-to-back western disturbances, the region (NCR) may see rain, light to moderate, between May 31 and June 2. The temperature will be around 36°C. There had been no incidents of heat wave in Delhi-NCR, including Noida, so far and June 15 onwards marks the beginning of pre-monsoon rainfall. So there are no chances of heat waves so far. As an effect of Yaas, strong easterly winds will keep bringing the strong moist winds in the region that will also keep the air quality under check,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.The average wind speed in the region for the past three days has been 25 kmph, IMD said.According to IMD, Noida saw maximum and minimum temperatures of 37.4°C and 27.4°C on Saturday against 39.6 and 26.1°C a day earlier. At Safdarjung, considered average for NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 37.5°C and 26.6°C, respectively.Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday was 92 or ‘satisfactory’ against 118 (‘moderate’) a day earlier, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. While AQI of Greater Noida was 78 against 87 on Friday, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI at 103 against 128 (both under ‘moderate’ category) a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rains-likely-in-next-two-days-to-bring-mercury-down-101622350663358.html
30-05-2021||Noida||Nearly 500 prisoners released to decongest Luksar jail||Nearly 500 inmates have been released from Luksar jail on interim bail following the Supreme Court guidelines to avoid the transmission of Covid-19 in the prisons. From Monday onwards, even juveniles will start getting bail and will be released from the observation homes.During the first wave of the pandemic last year, the Supreme Court had ordered that all prisons and observation homes release the inmates in order to avoid the spread of infection in close quarters. During the second wave, the apex court issued a similar order for prisons.The release of inmates from Luksar jail started on May 5 and till Saturday afternoon, 496 prisoners have been released on interim bail. Of these, 469 are undertrials and 27 convicted.“Any new prisoner is first tested and placed in the temporary jail adjacent to the main block for 14 days. Another test is conducted before they are put in the main prison,” said jail superintendent Bhim Sen Mukund.Currently, there are 2,520 prisoners lodged in Luksar jail, of which 104 inmates are putting up in the temporary jail.“We have medical staff round the clock to monitor the health of the prisoners. A doctor has been stationed at the temporary block also. We have nine oxygen concentrators, several cylinders, medicines, etc. to handle emergencies. An L-1 facility is also operating here to take care of infected inmates. In fact, all the inmates who are 45 and above have been vaccinated while the rest are in the process of getting the jab,” said Mukund.Ever since the pandemic began, the inmates have made 60,374 masks in the prison, of which 3,780 masks have been manufactured this year. While most of these were distributed among prisoners and staff, some were also given to institutions outside.Similar release orders are awaited for the observation homes as well.“We have now received the necessary orders and the juveniles will be released on interim bail from Monday onwards. Orders have also come for the staff vaccination,” said Aneet Bhagel, member, Juvenile Justice Board, Gautam Budh Nagar.The observation home currently has 130 juveniles, in addition to 15 full-time staff members.No Covid cases have been reported from among the inmates of the observation home or the staff members.Since April this year, 103 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19. Currently, seven asymptomatic patients are under isolation in the jail’s L-1 facility while the remaining infected prisoners have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nearly-500-prisoners-released-to-decongest-luksar-jail-101622350897414.html
30-05-2021||Noida||Vaccination picks up pace in Noida in last 15 days||In the past 15 days, the number of vaccinations administered per day at Gautam Budh Nagar’s Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) for all age groups has almost doubled, with around 7,000 doses being administered daily up to May 14, to over 13,000 from around Thursday onwards.The total number of vaccinations carried out at government CVCs on May 10 was 4,621, with 2,603 inoculated in the 18-45 category. This is in contrast with the figures of May 29, when the total vaccinations carried out in the district were 14,600, including 11,296 in the 18-45 category.By May 14, the average per day vaccinations by the Gautam Budh Nagar health department averaged around 6,000-7000 but since then to around Wednesday, the vaccinations went above 10,000 per day.If vaccinations administered at private centres are taken into account as well then on May 28, a total of 19,206 doses were given in the district, out of which 14,180 were at government centres, according to official data.Narendra Bhooshan, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in GB Nagar, said, “The vaccinations being carried out at workplaces vaccination centres (WVCs) and camps being held by private hospitals in residential areas is helping increase the inoculation numbers”.Moreover, ever since May 10 when vaccinations for the 18-44 category were started in the district, the health department has added 62 new government CVCs. On May 10, the district had 21 centres while on May 29, this figure had increased to 83.The district has an estimated population of 21 lakh, of which around 15 lakh to 16 lakh people are to be vaccinated. As of Saturday, 5,95,122 people in the district had been vaccinated, which is around 30% of the total targeted population for vaccinations, said district magistrate Suhas LY.“I believe the government centres as well as private ones can easily vaccinate 25,000 people in a day, combined. If this goes on at the same pace, within two-three months we shall be able to cover all of the 18+ population in the district with at least the first dose,” said Suhas.Workplace vaccinations kick off in NoidaMultinational firm UFlex kicked off a vaccination drive Saturday at its headquarters in Sector 62. The drive is set to cover 6,000 employees of the firm above the age of 18 working in facilities across Noida, including shop-floor workers and contract staff. Doses will be provided free-of-cost to employees, for which UFlex has tied up with Kailash Hospital in the city. The camps will be set up inside the company premises and plants across different locations. The company plans to complete the vaccination drive by June 5.Earlier, digital and business solutions firm Tech Mahindra Ltd had also rolled-out a vaccination drive for its associates and dependent family members above the age of 18 years at its office campuses at NSEZ in Sector 82. The company is covering the cost of vaccination and has partnered with Fortis Healthcare for the same.Meanwhile, Felix Hospital in Sector 137 launched a 24x7 vaccination drive-through facility at its hospital on Saturday. Here, beneficiaries will need to book their slot on Cowin for ₹900.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccination-picks-up-pace-in-noida-in-last-15-days-101622350656029.html
30-05-2021||Mumbai||Over 1 million cases, 19K deaths in 29 days in Maharashtra||Maharashtra on Saturday saw its 10th consecutive day of fewer than 30,000 Covid-19 cases.Despite these welcome figures, a sign that the second wave has most likely receded in India’s worst-hit state, this month has already seen more than a million cases and close to 20,000 casualties, with two days to go. The number of casualties recorded in May is the highest tally for a month since the pandemic hit the state last March. Till May 29, the state has reported 1,107,770 cases and 19,738 deaths, according to statistics from the state health department.The state on Saturday recorded 20,295 Covid-19 infections, pushing the count to 5,713,215. The tally of active cases dipped to 276,573 with 31,964 recoveries in the past 24 hours. The state saw 443 more Covid-19 casualties, taking the toll to 94,030. Satara reported the highest toll with 51 deaths. Solapur and Kolhapur reported 37 casualties each, followed by Mumbai with 25 deaths.The state government has already decided to extend lockdown restrictions, considering the rise in cases in more than a dozen districts. It, however, will provide a few relaxations in the existing restrictions. It may extend the restricted timings of four hours for buying essential commodities and may also allow shops that become essential during monsoon. An order to this effect is likely to be issued on May 30, officials said. The lockdown is ending on June 1 at 7am. A full lockdown was imposed in the state on April 22.The issue of lockdown extension was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Thursday.Currently, people can’t step out unless they need medical attention or are working in an essential sector or want to buy essential commodities, that too within restricted timings — between 7am and 11am.Although the positivity rate of the state is going down, the case fatality rate (CFR) has been one the rise since July 2020. On May 29, the CFR was recorded at 1.65%, up from 1.49% reported on May 1. In the past three months — February, March and April — the CFRs were 2.42%, 1.94% and 1.5%.Previously, April had reported 1,723,249 cases and 12,496 fatalities. Mumbai also clocked 1,038 cases and reported a total of 703,560 cases till date.In the past 24 hours, the state tested 258,799 samples and had a positivity rate of 7.84%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 16.51%, according to the data issued by the state health department on Saturday.“Going by today’s situation, it is very difficult for the state to significantly ease down restrictions. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is also not very much comfortable with the idea. Thus, ‘Mission Begin Again’ is likely to start from June 1, but to a very limited extent. We may extend restricted timings of four hours to six or seven hours for the people to step out for buying essentials and may also allow shops that become essential during the rainy season,” said a senior official privy to the development.Meanwhile, the state government has placed a purchase order for two million vaccine doses, primarily for the inoculation of the people in the 18-45 category. However, a formal decision is yet to be taken when the drive for the people in the age group will recommence. The inoculation for 18-45 category is temporarily suspended since May 13 due to lack of adequate vaccine stock for second doses of people over 45 years.The Maharashtra government is expecting over six million vaccine doses in June. This includes 1,947,550 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin from the Centre under free quota. Another 2,070,530 doses of both vaccines is to be purchased from the manufacturing companies. Besides that, the state is also expecting another two million doses under the Centre’s free quota in the second half of June.A senior bureaucrat said t the state has not decided on restarting the vaccination drive for 18-45 category, but a decision is expected in a day or two. “We are going to get enough vaccines in June but we also have a backlog of second doses. We have placed a purchase order of 2 million doses as well; whether to use it for 18-45 or for above 45 year category is still to be made. A decision to restart inoculation for 18-45 hasn’t been made yet, but we will evaluate the situation and decide on it in a day or two,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, 296,513 doses were administered till 8pm on Saturday across the state in 4,179 centres. So far, the state has administered 22,226,917 doses, of which 4,520,907 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked doctors to ensure that home-quarantined Covid-19 patients should be closely monitored so that they don’t get serious and hospitals are not burdened unnecessarily. He also said that the patients who need hospitalization should be moved without wasting time.He was speaking while inaugurating a two-day workshop organised by the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC). Around 21,000 doctors participated in the workshop. Thackeray said the family doctors have a responsibility to properly identify the patient in time. “We need to see if the patients are getting proper treatment at home, especially in the primary and middle stages when hospitalization is not required. The doctors should also be careful about when the patients need to be shifted to the hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-1-million-cases-19k-deaths-in-29-days-in-maharashtra-101622349922315.html

30-05-2021||Dehradun||Data proves calling Haridwar Kumbh Covid super-spreader unfair: Mela security incharge||A top Kumbh Mela official Saturday said it was unfair to call it a Covid "super-spreader" as just 0.2 per cent of the total RT-PCR tests conducted in Haridwar from January 1 till the conclusion of the event returned a positive result, while just 0.5 per cent police personnel on mela duty contracted the virus.Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal also said the religious event formally began on April 1 by which time the second wave of Covid was already raging in states like Maharashtra and Haryana."If we scientifically analyse the Covid data of Haridwar district right from January 1 to the conclusion of Kumbh on April 30, attempts to create a perception that Kumbh was a super-spreader of the pandemic look unfair," Gunjyal told PTI.He was in charge of the entire security arrangements in Haridwar and adjoining areas during the Kumbh mela.Reeling off data to make his point, the senior official said 8.91 lakh RT-PCR tests were conducted in the district from January 1 to April 30 out of which only 1,954 (0.2 per cent) were positive.Citing another reason why the Kumbh Mela cannot be considered a super-spreader event, he said out of over 16,000 police personnel deployed in the Kumbh Mela Kshetra only 88 (or just a little above 0.5 per cent) had tested positive for Covid by April 30."It is a fact worth taking note of as the security personnel on duty were directly dealing with the crowds converging at Har ki Pairi and other Ganga ghats for a holy dip in the river. In spite of that, a very low percentage of security personnel tested positive," Gunjyal said.During the noitified period of Kumbh from April 1-April 30, swab samples of 55,55,893 people were tested for Covid out of which 17,333 tested positive, he said.The Kumbh Mela, which is attended by people from different parts of the country in large numbers, drew flak from various quarters as the number of Covid-19 cases rose at a rapid pace during the days coinciding with the event.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on April 17 appealed that the event in Haridwar be kept symbolic then on due to the Covid-19 crisis.Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said Saturday that devotees had begun to arrive for the event from March itself, and Mahashivratri also witnessed a big turnout of devotees.However, by April 1 Haridwar district had reported only 144 positive cases of Covid-19, he said.Gunjyal also denied making a downward revision of the number of people attending Kumbh Mela on the three major bathing days or Shahi Snan.The three Shahi Snan days fell during the notified period of the one-month Kumbh this year during which over 34.76 lakh people took a holy dip in the river, he said.As many as 21 lakh people bathed in the river on April 12 on Somwati Amavasya, 13.51 lakh on Mesh Sankranti on April 14 and 25,104 people on Chaitra Purnima on April 27, he said.These figures have never been revised or changed, the IG said.When told that an official release quoting Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat had put the number of people bathing in the river on April 12 at 35 lakh, the officer said he may have given the total number of devotees gathering at the ghats from April 1 to April 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/data-proves-calling-haridwar-kumbh-covid-super-spreader-unfair-mela-security-incharge-101622343248460.html
30-05-2021||Kolkata||Call to rename Mt Everest after Radhanath Sikdar, who measured its height||On Saturday, when the world celebrated Everest Day and people in Darjeeling paid homage to Indian-Nepali Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who on his 39th birthday, scaled the world’s highest peak with New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953, veterans recalled the Bengali mathematician who measured the mountain’s actual height a century before the historic climb.Mount Everest should be named after mathematician Radhanath Sikdar, said mountaineers and the authorities at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) in Darjeeling and the Radhanath Sikdar Himalayan Museum at Chandannagar in Bengal’s Hooghly district, where the almost forgotten genius lived his last years and died in 1870. He was born in Kolkata (then Calcutta) in 1813.Records say that Sikdar, a student and a master in spherical trigonometry from Kolkata’s Hindu College (now Presidency University) was handpicked for the survey department of the British government in the 1830s. He never actually saw the mountain which was recorded in official nomenclature as Peak XV.As part of the team set up for the Great Trigonometric Survey started by George Everest, then surveyor general of India, Sikdar travelled across India to conduct geodetic surveys. Geodetic surveys are done to accurately measure and understand changes in Earth’s geometric shape, orientation and gravity field.In 1852, Sikdar calculated the exact height of Everest. George Everest retired in 1843 but his successor, Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh, named the peak after the man who initiated the survey. The height, 8,848 metres, was officially announced in 1856.If people in Nepal can call the mountain Sagarmatha and the Chinese have named it Qomolangma, why can’t Everest be called Sikdar Parvat (mountain) or Sikdar Sikhar (peak) in India, people asked on Saturday.Hillary, who climbed the peak first, was knighted by the British government immediately after his achievement. He was part of a British team. Recognition came late for Norgay. In 2003, India’s highest award for adventure sports, the National Adventure Awards, was renamed Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award by the Centre.To pay homage to Sikdar, the HMI on Saturday unveiled a library named after him, along with his statue.Group captain Jai Kishan, the HMI principal, said, “Why should not the Indian mountaineering fraternity call the peak Mount Sikdar seven decades after British rule came to an end? We should observe May 29 as Mount Sikdar Day. Let there be a change.”Kalyan Chakraborty, secretary of the Radhanath Sikdar Himalayan Museum, wrote a letter to the HMI principal. It said, “At the order of Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh, then surveyor general of India, Sikdar started measuring the height of mountains. We recall the dichotomy of colonial science. Sikdar had to fit himself into the early colonial scheme of the rulers to self-cultivate his curiosity driven scientific expertise from within that structure. Whenever the latter clashed with the former, Sikdar’s aspirations were thwarted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/call-to-rename-mt-everest-after-radhanath-sikdar-who-measured-its-height-101622341596693.html

30-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Kejriwal urges Centre to order vaccines for states||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked the Centre not to resort to “petty politics” and urged it to buy vaccines for all states.“The central government should procure the vaccines, and after doing so, they should give them to us and we will administer them to everyone. This is not the time for petty politics. This is not the time to play a blame game. This is not the time for finger-pointing. This is not the time for debate and counter. The country is suffering from a pandemic,” said Kejriwal, who was speaking to reporters after launching a drive-through vaccination centre for the 45+ age group at Chhatrasal Stadium.“We have filed a global tender for vaccines. We are making all the efforts from our side, but till now, all the other governments that filed a global tender have not been able to get any positive result. On a general note, what I have understood is that all the big vaccine manufacturing companies of the world want to deal directly with the central government... So only time will tell as to how successful different state governments will be, but we have filed a global tender from our side,” he said.Kejriwal said the Delhi government has started a drive-in vaccination facility at Chhatrasal stadium. “People can come here in their cars, motorcycles, even on foot, and can get vaccinated here. The vaccination is free at this centre. Right now, this has been initiated for those above the age of 45 because there is no vaccine for younger people. As soon as adequate jabs arrive, vaccination for those below the age of 45 (18-45 years) will also be started,” he said.On black fungus, the CM said there are about 450 cases in Delhi government hospitals. “We have demanded the medicines accordingly... there is a countrywide paucity of medicines. The central government is giving whatever it can. As I understand, more injections of this medicine will be procured and be distributed to all the state governments,” he said.Central government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-kejriwal-urges-centre-to-order-vaccines-for-states-101622327838568.html
30-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s new Covid-19 cases drop below 1,000||Delhi on Saturday added fewer than 1,000 cases for the first time in over two months as the city’s fourth and the worst wave of Covid-19 infections continued to taper, with government authorities now focusing on a phased withdrawal of lockdown restrictions while preparing in advance for another potential outbreak.The Capital recorded 956 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest since March 22, when Delhi added 888 cases, and the test-positivity rate fell to 1.19%, according to the government’s daily health bulletin.The city’s positivity rate – the proportion of samples tested returning positive – was under 2% for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday. This figure has been falling since first reducing to under 5% on May 21. The World Health Organization says a positivity rate under 5% indicates that the outbreak within a population is under control.Saturday’s tally is an encouraging sign for the Capital that only weeks before saw its health care infrastructure buckle under the burden of a massive surge of Covid-19 cases.Also read| Delhi will not get 550k alloted vaccine doses before June 10: Sisodia“Yesterday, we announced that two activities -- construction activities and factories -- can be opened up because the poor such as migrant labourers have faced the most difficult time during the lockdown. Today, around 900 cases have emerged for the first time, I hope that as and when the cases keep on decreasing in the coming weeks, we will continue to unlock further. We want the economic activities to come back on track so that the economy can be revived,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters during a visit to the city’s first drive-through vaccination centre at the Chhatrasal Stadium.In keeping with the declining trend of daily cases and deaths, the Delhi government is lifting lockdown curbs in the city, starting with the construction sector and factories that can resume operations from Monday, June 1. Public health officials, however, say there is a need to remain cautious about unlocking of the city to avoid another flare-up of the pandemic in the next few weeks.A weekend curfew in mid-April paved the way for a full lockdown to be enforced in the Capital from April 19. From then on, the restrictions – which forced Delhi to shut down all but essential services – were extended five times until the pandemic loosened its grip over the city May onwards.At its worst, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20 and its test-positivity rate soared to a peak of 36.4% on April 22. Tragedy also unfolded in the third week of April that saw hundreds of patients and their families wait outside hospitals short of oxygen supply, and mass cremations at burial grounds that were running out of space.The situation eased in early May as the central and the Delhi governments procured and replenished supplies of critical life-saving drugs and medical equipment.Officials of the Aam Aadmi Party-led city administration say they have used the one-and-a-half-month lockdown to scale up infrastructure to prepare for a potential surge in cases in the months ahead. It has ramped up surveillance system to foresee a spike in cases, added hospital beds, increased oxygen supply and is keeping a stockpile of medicines needed to treat Covid-19 patients.The city has recorded an average of 1,347 daily cases in the last seven days – a fair distance from the 25,294 cases reported in the week ending April 23.Government data released on Saturday also said 122 people succumbed to the viral illness in the previous 24 hours. Fatalities, too, have seen a steady drop in recent days and the seven-day average of daily deaths is 151, the lowest since April 19.Also read: Delhi restaurateur Kalra gets bail in oxygen concentrator caseActive cases are also at their lowest in 57 days, with 13,035 people currently battling the virus.Despite conclusive signs of an outbreak in decline, the government has warned against complacency in lowering the guard. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said in a tweet that although cases had fallen, people “still need to take all precautions and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to beat the virus”.Public health experts, too, stressed on the same but added that the government needs to plan the unlock process and keep in mind particular activities that can trigger crowding and close contacts. These may include re-opening marketplaces, gymnasiums, and even Delhi Metro services.“You cannot open everything up all at once. You have to open up gradually... we should keep places where a lot of people can gather such as gyms, malls, cinemas, markets closed for now,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.“I think the last time we opened up too soon and too much. I understand that the economy suffers, but this is the only measure we have in the absence of vaccines for everyone. It will take some time for doses to become available and for the people to be immunised. We have to maintain restrictions, especially for weddings and all,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Also read: Soon, breeze through immigration ‘e-gates’ at IGI airportThey also pointed out that lockdowns are effective in lowering transmission but these are still stop-gap measures; eventually, vaccination will be key to clamp down on the infectious disease.“Doses are not available as of now, but it seems like more shots may be available June onwards, after which there should be aggressive vaccination. That is the only hope for preventing another surge,” Singh added.A similar stand has been taken by the Delhi government, which has flagged acute shortage of vaccine doses in recent days.On Saturday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the government has run out of shots to inoculate younger adults and it will be given doses by the central government only by June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-new-covid-19-cases-drop-below-1000-101622325856648.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ola subsidiary told to pay ₹10,000 for failing to deliver cab on lease||For failing to provide a cab on lease despite receiving payments, Ola Fleet Technologies Private Limited has been directed to pay ₹10,000 as compensation and litigation expenses to a Kurali resident. The leasing arm of ridesharing company Ola Cabs was penalised by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Chandigarh, for deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. While disposing of the complaint filed by Deepak Kumar, the consumer forum also directed the firm to refund ₹5,000 paid by him while booking the cab. If the amount is not paid in 30 days from the date of the receipt of the order’s certified copy, the company will have to pay an additional cost of ₹10,000. Deepak in his complaint said that the firm had launched a scheme under which a person could get a cab on lease for four years by depositing ₹21,000. Accordingly, Deepak applied under the scheme and booked a cab on lease by paying ₹4,000 on March 5, 2019, and the balance was to be given after the delivery of the cab. As the firm had assured him the delivery within a week, Deepak also booked a driver for the cab on daily wages of ₹500, starting from March 12, and deposited ₹1,000 for his driving test. He said Ola Fleet Technologies Private Limited on March 20 also got his police verification done, for which he paid ₹50. Despite having made all the payments, the cab was not delivered even though he made repeated visits to the firm’s office in Hallomajra. After making one excuse after the other, the firm ultimately refused to provide the cab, he alleged. Delivery rejected post verification: Firm The firm, seeking dismissal of the complaint, said that Deepak had been told that the cab would be delivered after the clearance of his verification. According to the company’s terms and conditions, which had been shared with him, ₹4,000 was a non-refundable fee for the verification of documents, address and other procedures, the firm said, adding that Deepak’s verification had been rejected due to negative remarks of his references. The firm also admitted that Deepak deposited ₹1,000 for his driver’s test, which is mandatory before handing over the cab. Justification is bald assertion: Forum “The justification put forth by Ola Fleet Technologies Private Limited in its reply for not delivering the cab is a bald assertion and devoid of any document in support. The company only relied upon the verification report briefing negative remarks of the complainant’s references, which has not been made part of the record for the reasons best known to it. Thus, it failed to prove its stand and hence found guilty of resorting to unfair trade practice,” the consumer forum ruled The order further states: “The absence of any verification report itself acclaims that no verification, as alleged, has been carried out by the (firm) and thus no question arises for forfeiting the amount, which remained unutilised by the company for the purpose it was deposited for. Thus, the unfair trade practice adopted by the (firm).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ola-subsidiary-told-to-pay-10-000-for-failing-to-deliver-cab-on-lease-101622322934616.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Jaipal’s 2 aides wanted in ASIs’ killing arrested from Gwalior||Police have arrested two of the main accused in the sensational killing of assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) Bhagwan Singh and Dalwinderjit Singh who were gunned down in Jagraon grain market on May 15. The suspects, Baljinder Singh alias Babbi of Moga’s Mahla Khurd village and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village in Ludhiana district, were carrying a cash reward of ₹2 lakh each on their head. They are associates of gangster Jaipal Bhullar, and were nabbed from Dabra in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, on Friday evening. Another associate of theirs, Harcharan Singh, who had allegedly given shelter to them, was also arrested. Giving details, Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta said preliminary questioning of the suspects has revealed that on the fateful day, Baljinder had come to Jagraon grain market in his mini-truck to pick Jaipal and Jassi and drop them at a hideout outside the state. Darshan turned up there with some clothes for the gangster and his associate. Gupta said the ASIs who were on duty confronted Baljinder on suspicion of drug smuggling and Darshan opened fire from his .32 revolver. Darshan, Jaipal and Jassi then fled in their I-10 Hyundai car, while Baljinder drove off in his mini-truck and joined them after some time. They all fled towards Rajasthan. Gupta said intelligence inputs were received that the suspects could be in and around Gwalior. A team from the Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) led by inspector Pushpinder Singh was despatched to Gwalior. After much effort, the OCCU team managed to track the suspects and arrested them from Dabra railway station, 40 km from Gwalior, on Friday evening when they were planning to board a train to Maharashtra, Gupta said. He said the arrested duo has a criminal past and both had been convicted in two different murder cases. They had come in contact with each other while serving jail term. Darshan was granted remission while undergoing his sentence, Baljinder was released on bail by the high court. Darshan reportedly has two more criminal cases pending against him and was also involved in opium smuggling, he said. Meanwhile, the accused were produced before a Ludhiana court on Saturday that sent them to 10-day police custody for questioning. Six aides of the gangsters, including Darshan’s wife Satpal Kaur alias Noni, were arrested by Jagraon police on May 20 with a cache of weapons and ammunition. The DGP said Jaipal is one of the few gangsters who has managed to elude arrest, so far. While he remains at large, his close associate, Gavi, was arrested by Punjab Police from Jamshedpur last month. Gavi was wanted in the case of recovery of 11-kg heroin in Jalandhar district. Jaipal’s another associate Jaspreet alias Jassi, who is also absconding since the Jagraon shootout, was earlier arrested for heroin smuggling in Mohali and is also wanted in a kidnapping case. Gupta said a manhunt is still on for the absconding suspects and he was confident that they too will be arrested soon. Jaipal and his aide Jaspreet carry a cash reward of ₹10 lakh and ₹5 lakh, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jaipals-2-aides-wanted-in-asis-killing-arrested-from-gwalior-101622322754266.html

30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Road carpeting in Chandigarh: Month before monsoon, only 10% work finished||While city residents continue to suffer because of poor roads, the municipal corporation has completed only 10% of the road carpeting work for the current fiscal. With monsoon expected to hit the city by June end, the road work will be suspended for another couple of months. The civic body manages a road network of around 1,400km, among which V-6 roads (access roads to houses) are in the worst condition, according to residents. Notably, every year 20% roads in the city are to be carpeted on a rotational basis. However, the work was halted for a couple of years due to MC’s inability to pay contractors. After the UT administration dedicated funds for the roads’ maintenance, MC was able finally able to start work in 2020. But, with work from previous years piled up, its pace remains slow. “Pending road carpeting and maintenance work from previous fiscals is nearing completion. For this fiscal, we have so far achieved 10% of the total road work,” said Shailender Singh, chief engineer, MC.A total of ₹80 crore is to be spent this year, including ₹40 crore on last year’s work. Bumpy ride: southern sectors worst affected In a shambles for years, the roads have improved over the last year with MC resuming carpeting. But residents, particularly in the southern sectors, complain that in many areas the ride still remains bumpy. Rajat Malhotra, president, Resident Welfare Association (RWA), Sector 45C, said, “The condition of roads in the sector is very poor. We have repeatedly taken up the matter with MC, but in vain. Though carpeting work has started, improvements have yet to be experienced in our area.” Residents of Sector 56 have a similar complaint. Joginder Singh, general secretary of the sector’s RWA, said, “Some roads have been redone, but internal roads still require attention.” The quality of repair work is also being questioned by residents. SK Khosla, general secretary, RWA, MIG-I houses, Sector 40, said, “We have sought an inquiry into the poor patch work and carpeting of V5 roads (sector circulation roads). But, action is still awaited from MC or the administration. After repeated complaints, patch work is carried out selectively, but the overall condition of the road remains poor.” According to MC commissioner KK Yadav, they had prioritised work, first focusing on stretches which were in very bad shape. “We have set a target to repair all such roads before the onset of monsoon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/road-carpeting-in-chandigarh-month-before-monsoon-only-10-work-finished-101622322335771.html

The project is being developed by the group’s development firm K Raheja Corp. The 45-storeyed skyscraper Astesia is located near Worli coast and offers a breath-taking view of the Arabian Sea. Owing to the reduction in the stamp duty introduced by the state government to boost the sales, the Rahejas saved a staggering ₹12.75 crore. The group paid ₹8.55 crore (2%) as stamp duty. The Rahejas had purchased the apartments last year on December 31 and registered documents on April 22. In the transaction, the promoters of K Raheja Corp – Ravi, Neel and Jyoti Raheja – have purchased the 41st, 43rd and 44th floors as well as some apartments on the 42nd and 45th floors. Despite repeated attempts, K Raheja Corp refused to respond to the development. The other high-profile buyers in Astesia include Smita D Parekh, the wife of banker Deepak Parekh, who has shelled out ₹50 crore to buy a sea-view flat. HDFC Bank’s vice-chairman and chief executive officer Keki Mistry has also purchased an apartment for ₹41.23 crore. The real estate sector has been facing a downturn for several years owing to economic slowdown, with the pandemic making the situation worse. Last August, the government had announced to reduce stamp duty levied on the sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 to December 31 and then further reduced it to 3% from January 1 to March 31 this year. The move had played a huge role in boosting sales of both primary and secondary markets. The state, however, refused to extend the stamp duty cut further despite several requests from the industry. According to Sandeep Reddy, co-founder of real estate data analytics research firm Zapkey.com, “The stamp duty cuts really had a profound effect on the luxury segment as we witnessed several high-value transactions in south and south-central Mumbai during that time [till March 31],” said Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rahejas-buy-3-duplex-flats-for-427-crore-from-its-development-firm-in-mumbai-101622318313263.html

A court later sent him to judicial custody till June 3.Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said whatever recovery was required to be effected by the investigating officer from the accused has already been done.“….the accused Navneet Kalra is hereby admitted to bail on furnishing of personal bond and two surety bonds of ₹1,00,000/- each…with the condition that the accused shall not directly or indirectly try to influence the witnesses, shall not try to contact the customers to whom he had sold the oxygen concentrators during pendency of the investigation, shall not in any manner tamper with the evidence and shall join the investigation as and when directed by the IO,” the court said.Also read: Delhi extends lockdown, allows construction and manufacturing.

Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, who has been meeting several leaders from the state, said that the idea behind meeting Ambedkar was to reduce the “divide” among the two communities. “Our outlook [for the meeting] was to look at reducing the divide between the communities. I belong to the lineage of Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, while he is from the lineage of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar... If Shahu Maharaj and Dr Ambedkar could come together, why can’t Prakash Ambedkar and Sambhaji Chhatrapati,” Sambhajiraje said in a joint press conference with Ambedkar after the meeting. Sambhajiraje is a descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Outlining the connect between the two leaders, he further said, “Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj was the first to give reservation to the Bahujan Samaj. Later, Dr Ambedkar brought it in the Constitution. It was Dr Ambedkar’s wish to provide quota for the Maratha community. Till 1967, Marathas got reservation in the Central list under the OBC (Other Backward Classes) quota. Later, several commissions were set, and Marathas were excluded as forward or dominating class and the quota was removed.” Having deviated from the party line on the issue, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has put forth a three-point demand before the Maharashtra government. He has called for the filing of a review petition in the Supreme Court on it earlier decision to scrap the quota as well as a curative petition, and approaching the President through the Maharashtra Governor. The BJP MP added that the state government will now have to make a “fool-proof” plan again to secure the quota for the community through Article 342 (A) of the Constitution, wherein the President may recommend the reservation for the community. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati expressed confidence that the Raj Bhavan, despite its frosty relations with the state government, will forward the proposal. “He [Governor] will have to do it. According to [Article] 342(A), the Governor will write to the President and, if the latter is inclined, will send the report to the backward class commission, following which it will be kept before the Parliament. For that, a fool-proof planning will be needed again. The shortcoming in the Gaikwad Commission [which recommended the quota earlier] will have to be scrutinised, which will take five-six months. Overall, the situation is quite conducive. Otherwise, there is an alternative of a review petition,” he said. Considering review petitions are usually rejected, there is also an option of a curative petition, said Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati. In an indirect reference to BJP-backed agitations for the quota, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati added that people should not be held hostage by staging protests. and that elected representatives should find a way. “There is no point in holding people hostage on this matter now. Whatever the members of the community wanted to say, they have done it through 58 agitations. Now the matter is legal, and the elected representatives, including myself, will have to find a way out,” Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said when asked about protests planned by BJP legislator Vinayak Mete. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati should meet Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi over the issue as the Centre can decide on the reservation. Raut said that Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati is a well-respected leader in Maharashtra, and the government has heard him on the issue. “He is meeting prominent leaders including [Nationalist Congress Party chief] Sharad Pawar, [Maharashtra chief minister] Uddhav Thackeray, [state minister from Congress] Ashok Chavan and [leader of Opposition from BJP] Devendra Fadnavis. But he should meet PM Modi because this issue is no longer in the hands of the state, but rests with the Centre. All political parties and its leaders are in sync with the sentiments of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje. We should all go to the PM and Modi must take a decision. PM holds the cards for it,” Raut said. When asked why the PM has not chosen to meet him over the issue, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said, “It could be due to Covid-related reasons or maybe his predicament over the issue. We are MPs and I will attempt to express my sentiments over the issue.” Meanwhile, after the meeting with Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, Ambedkar sought to corner Pawar on the issue. He said the Maratha strongman has not taken a clear stance on the quota issue for the community. “I have seen Pawar’s political journey for the past 40 years. His stand is always narova, kunjarova [a phrase from Mahabharat that loosely translates as non-committal]. On the Maratha reservation, too, he has followed the same. He meets CM without having a stand, but demands the implementation of the quota. On some issues, narova kunjarova is fine. But on issues such as the Maratha reservation, there needs to be a clear stand. We expect that he will take a stand soon either for or against the quota.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-sambhajiraje-chhatrapati-meets-dalit-leader-prakash-ambedkar-to-reduce-divide-101622318193300.html

She was not just worried about the futures of her two children, but was also facing difficulties in meeting daily their needs. On March 25, Mahale lost her husband Sanjay – a constable posted with Nardana police station in Dhule – and her father-in-law to Covid-19.

However, to her respite, four policemen arrived at her home one day and gave her a cheque of ₹1.5 lakh for Mahale to meet the household expenses and other daily requirements till the time the family got the solatium from the government. Mahale was overwhelmed by the act of generosity by her husband’s colleagues and batchmatees when she discovered that over a hundred of them had formed a WhatsApp group and collected the amount for the family through crowdfunding. “After losing three members [of the family] within six months, I was completely broken. I was traumatised and worried about the futures of my two children. I lived under tremendous mental stress. But after my husband’s colleagues extended help and arranged some money, I felt that I am not alone. I was moved by their heart-warming gesture, and it certainly boosted the much-needed confidence in me. I got a feeling that there will always be a second family standing beside me,” she said. Like Mahale, many grieving families of personnel who had died of the virus, received help from police groups that came forward during the crisis and are selflessly helping Covid-affected families of cops. The constables from the 2008 batch raised funds for the families of two of their batchmates who had died of the virus. One of them was constable Murad Ali from Mahim police station, who was admitted to SevenHills Hospital on April 26, and succumbed to the virus on May 9. Ali was the sole breadwinner for the family. The other constable for whose family the batch collected money was Satyajeet Pol from Worli local arms division. Soon after news of the Ali and Pol’s deaths spread across the police department, some constables from the batch jumped into action to help the families of the two Covid-19 victims. “On learning about their deaths, a bunch of my batchmates and I decided to help the grieving families. We drafted a message and circulated it in eight WhatsApp groups of our batch, posted across various units in Maharashtra and sought help. There are 1,334 police personnel from our batch, of which hundreds of them transferred around ₹3.4 lakh in a span of 15 days. We will be handing over the cheques of ₹1.7 lakh each to the families on June 1” said constable Bhaghirath Andhale, a member of the batch, who works at the police hospital. “By the time the family gets compensation from the government, this money would help them live with dignity and cut their dependability on others. And most importantly, the grieving families would feel that the friends of their late kin will always be there to look after them,” he added. According to Andhale, the police personnel from their batch were inducted into the force on June 1, 2009, and thus, the group celebrates the day by organising a get-together. “But as there is a health emergency, we all decided to do something to help the needy. We organised a blood donation camp [last year] and 276 constables from our batch donated blood that day,” said Andhale. Another constable from the same group, Sharad Ilag, said, “Our batch members have been very helpful and generous amid the crisis. For a cause like blood donation, our batchmates travelled to Mumbai from towns such as Jalgaon, Sangli, Nashik, Kolhapur and Pune. These days, no one takes the pain to travel for over 500km for donating 300 grams of blood.” Ilag has roped in his wife, a nursing staff from King Edward Memorial Hospital, into the various initiatives of his batch. Cops from this batch also helped fellow batchmates and their families when hit Kolhapur was hit by flood in 2019. At Naigaon’s local arms division, constable Rehana Shaikh, apart from doing her duties as a police personnel, endeavoured to successfully arrange plasma for 54 Covid-19 patients, of which 32 were either cops or their families. “Last year, while helping some colleagues in arranging an injection, I had shared my number with the Covid-19 helpline desk of the police department. Later, the helpdesk staff asked me to arrange injections or plasma for some more Covid-infected cops and I helped them. Later, whenever they would need urgent help, they used to call me. I always responded and used my contacts within and out of the department and ensured timely arrangement of donors and injections. This process worked so well that the helpline desk started calling me regularly, whenever they would exhaust their resources. I, too, felt good to help those in need,” said Shaikh. She said that during this second wave of Covid-19, Twitter was flooded with SOS alerts, with requests for ICU (intensive care unit) beds, oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, and other drugs for patients. “Many celebrities or public figures who have vast reach on social media were using their followers’ network to avail help for the needy. But a lower-ranked cop in the police department hardly has any presence on Twitter. But as I developed a network of healthcare activists and NGOs (non-governmental organisations), they made me a common platform and sent SOS alerts for urgent help. I tried helping as many as people as possible,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/beyond-the-line-of-duty-maharashtra-cops-pitch-in-to-help-kin-of-deceased-colleagues-101622318133256.html
30-05-2021||India||Petrol price surges to ₹100/litre in Mumbai||The price of petrol crossed ₹100 per litre in Mumbai on Saturday as state-run retailers raised fuel rates for the 15th time in 26 days, raising petrol rates by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 28 paise.The latest hike made petrol ₹3.54 a litre costlier and diesel ₹4.16 since May 4, a day after the results of five assembly polls were declared.Prices of auto fuels are at record levels across the country; diesel was sold at ₹92.17 a litre in the financial capital, the highest among all metro cities. Pump prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi on Saturday also made new records of ₹93.94 per litre and ₹84.89 a litre, respectively.While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Consumers in several cities, particularly in states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, are paying over ₹100 for one litre of petrol. Some of the cities selling the fuel over ₹100/ litre are Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar and Banswara.Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel at pumps. Benchmark Brent crude rose marginally by 0.24% to $69.63 a barrel on Friday. Indian fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their international benchmark rates of the previous day. Even as international oil prices saw both upward and downward movements this month, pump rates of fuels in India moved only in the upward direction.Pump prices of fuels are also high because of taxes. In Delhi, central levies account for 35.5% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23%, according to official data of May 16. On diesel, central taxes are over 38.2% while state taxes are about 14.6%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/petrol-prices-breach-the-100-mark-in-mumbai-101622317953170.html
30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana industrialist booked for selling attached property||A city-based industrialist has been booked for allegedly selling a chunk of land which was seized by the Mumbai Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2014. The accused, identified as Kailash Agarwal of Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana, had not told the buyer that it was an attached property. The FIR has been lodged on the statement of Ram Dikshit, assistant director, ED, Zonal Office, Mumbai. In his complaint, Dikshit said the ED had seized 19 properties of the accused’s company in 2014 after economic anomalies were detected. The matter is still sub judice. Dikshit said they came to know that the accused had sold a chunk of land, which was seized by the directorate, to someone in 2020. Following this, they filed a complaint with the Ludhiana police commissioner to lodge an FIR. The police chief marked a probe to the additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, headquarters) who recommended an FIR. Sub-inspector Jaswinder Singh, the investigating officer, said an FIR under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 421(dishonestly or fraudulently removes, conceals or delivers to any person, or transfer or causes to be transferred to any person), 465 (forgery), 467 (Forgery of a valuable security, will or authority to make or transfer any valuable security, or to receive any money), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any 1[document or electronic record] which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged ) of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused. The police found that the accused had not only sold the property but also managed to transfer ownership of the property in the name of the buyer even as the ED had already sent information regarding the attached properties to the revenue offices. Police suspect the involvement of revenue department officials. However, the deal has now been cancelled by the authorities. The SI added that police will arrest the accused soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-industrialist-booked-for-selling-attached-property-101622317714756.html

The hiked tariff will come into effect from June 1. Terming the announcement anti-industry and the relief to domestic consumers an eyewash ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, industrialists said they are in dire need of relief amid the pandemic. They added that fixed charges for large-scale consumers have been increased by upto ₹20 per KVA and energy consumption charges have been hiked by seven paise. Gurmeet Kular, president, Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation, said, “The recently approved power tariff is an election stunt by the state government, for which the industry will have to bear the brunt. As per the new tariff, for a unit with a power connection of 500 KW, an additional ₹15,000 will be charged per month.” Furnace Alliance president Mahesh Gupta, Federation of Punjab Small Industrial Association president Badish Jindal, and Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings general secretary Pankaj Sharma slammed the move. Punjab BJP chief spokesperson Anil Sareen, said, “The government has tried to get votes by announcing ₹ 0.50 to ₹1 relief for residential consumers.

30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Rumours deterring villagers in Ludhiana from getting tested: Survey||Two days after a man who did not want to be tested for the coronavirus disease attacked a health department staffer, a Mission Fateh-2 survey has revealed that rampant misinformation being spread through social media was hampering the testing and vaccination process in villages. The first six-day long survey, which was conducted by Asha workers, covered 1,65,314 households and 7,66,452 people in the district. Of the 16,564 people tested, 193 were found positive. Mission Fateh kits were provided to all patients in home isolation.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said, “There is a misconception prevalent among villagers that if they were to test positive, they will be sent to the hospital. We are assuring people that a positive diagnosis does not necessarily lead to hospitalisation.” “Efforts are also on to dispel misinformation regarding deaths of Covid patients in hospital. Sadly, social media is doing more harm than good as people are increasingly falling prey to fake news,” Ahluwalia said. With fake news, misinformation and disinformation abound, the matter was raised during the interaction between city-based NGOs with the administration.During the meeting, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu, the wife of Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, urged women volunteers to be harbingers of social change in villages.“Women social activists living in urban areas could mobilise their womenfolk living in rural areas. Once women in rural areas shun hesitancy and come forward to get themselves tested and vaccinated, the men and elderly will also follow suit. If NGOs start adopting two to four villagers, we will get encouraging results in testing as well as in vaccinations,” she said.Dayanand Medical College and Hospital senior cardiologist at Dr Bishav Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid task force, said people living in villages were indulging in self- medication and reaching at a very late stage when the saturation had dropped significantly.Dr Sandeep Kaur, senior medical officer (SMO) of community health centre (CHC), Pakhowal, where the healthcare worker was attacked said that the health staff was facing numerous challenges. “Each day health department teams carrying out the drive have to dispel fake claims linked to tests and vaccination,” said Dr Kaur.Tejpal Singh, state committee member of the multipurpose health employee union, said sampling could not be carried out in the Rachhin village of Pakhowa where the health department team that was carrying out sampling was attacked. “The situation is more or less the same in most of the villages,” said Tejpal Singh.On May 27, a villager had attacked Suraaj Mohammed, 47, a multipurpose health worker, who along with two women employees, was encouraging residents to take Covid tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumours-deterring-villagers-in-ludhiana-from-getting-tested-survey-101622317656433.html

30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Rumblings in Cong: Three-member panel to meet Punjab leaders from Monday||The three-member Congress committee headed by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge will start meeting party leaders from Punjab from Monday to try and resolve factionalism in the state unit. The committee, which includes All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi Congress president Jai Prakash Agarwal as members, held its first meeting in Delhi on Saturday and has decided to call all ministers, present and former state unit chiefs, MPs, MLAs and other senior party leaders one by one in the first week of June. The three senior leaders, who have been tasked with finding a solution to squabbling in the state Congress, will start by talking to Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday and then meet others over the next one week to comprehend the situation and hear their suggestions and grievances. “The committee will have one-to-one meeting with each one of them to find a solution to their doubts and differences. We have to bring all the state leaders together to present a united face to strengthen the party for the 2022 assembly elections,” Rawat told HT after the meeting. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s detractors, particularly Amritsar East MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh, have been suggesting that the party leadership should have one-to-one meetings with party legislators and others so that they can speak freely. On some dissenting leaders’ demand for a change of leadership in the state unit and the government, Rawat said this was not in the purview of the committee. “There is no rebellion. There are differences among some leaders over the sacrilege-related cases and other poll promises. We will see how this can be sorted out, but everything will depend on their feedback and suggestions,” he said, trying to play down the open sparring between Amarinder and Sidhu in recent weeks. While party MLAs have already started getting messages for their audience with the committee at a party office on Gurdwara Rakabganj Road in New Delhi, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi reportedly phoned three party leaders, including one minister, on Saturday for first-hand feedback from them. “Rahul ji spoke to me today and asked about the government and the goings-on in the state party. I told him my views,” Urmar MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian said, refusing to divulge the details. Asked about the continued rumblings and meetings of dissenting leaders, Rawat said they were all senior leaders and would express their views before the committee. “I am hopeful that since the Congress president has respected their sentiments and set up a high-level committee, they (party leaders) will display due regard for the committee and the conclusion it arrives at even though not everyone can be satisfied,” he said. The committee was constituted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi after Sidhu and a few other party leaders in the state targeted the chief minister for the legal setback in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case. Amarinder and his loyalists also hit back equally hard. The rift got worse when the state agencies started to dig up dirt on some of the detractors and one of them even alleged a threat call from an aide of the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumblings-in-cong-three-member-panel-to-meet-punjab-leaders-from-monday-101622316274270.html

However, the 22-year-old will soon graduate with a degree in Botany from a suburban college in Mumbai without having seen the instrument in person.“I saw a video of my teacher performing the experiment, but never really saw it,” she said.The Covid-19 pandemic shut down almost all campuses across the country. While educational institutes were quick to move to online mode of education, the pandemic deprived students of practical knowledge that students learn on campus. Many will graduate this year without having set foot in a laboratory for more than a year.Faculty members and principals of various colleges in the city highlighted a skill gap that will affect prospects of the graduates in getting admission to higher education institutes as well as job opportunities.“Graduating students, who haven’t been on campus for more than a year, will miss out on the experience of doing a practical experiment. The problem is students will not know how to operate an instrument properly because they have only seen it in pictures or videos,” said principal of a prominent college in the city.Admissions: How to compare apples to orangesAdmission to degree colleges is going to be a tough affair this year, especially with different boards adopting different methodologies to mark students. “For example, state board has cancelled exams. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to decide. That’s apples and oranges. How do you define merit without bringing students from different boards to the same level,” asked principal of a suburban college.Drawing up merit lists is going to be difficult this year, said most principals interviewed by HT. All of them requested anonymity.Unlike professional courses such as medicine, engineering and law where candidates have to take a centralised exam, admission to degree colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) are based on students’ performance in board exams.“Online exams are not a proper reflection of a students’ understanding of a subject. So to judge the students on online exams is not appropriate,” said a principal.While some colleges conduct entrance exams for some niche courses, holding entrance exams for all subjects would require enormous resources that colleges lack at short notice. “However, it is not impossible. In a meeting with state government officials, we, principals, have suggested ways of conducting online entrance exams,” said Kishore Peshori, principal, MMK College of Commerce, Bandra.“Until last year, even for niche courses, 70% weightage was on entrance exam and 30% on board results. This year, we are planning to make it 100% on entrance exam,” said a principal.Hiring: Bridging an irreparable skill gapEvery year when the Union budget is announced, final year BCom students of HR College in Churchgate watch the speech with their faculty and engage in analysis. This year, the event happened online as students and faculty joined in virtually.“It is a universal fact that there is an irreparable skill gap. The onus is now on colleges and students themselves to bridge this gap in the best possible way, given the circumstances,” said Navin Punjabi, assistant professor and director (placements) at HR College.He said that this year recruiters have been preferring students who are skilled to start working virtually. “Recruiters are realising that if the student can start working from home, they can save time and resources on on-boarding the new recruit in the virtual process. So, we are trying to train our students in the same,” Punjabi added.Paavan Choudary, founder of Merilytics, an analytics solution firm that rolled out over 100 offers across premiere institutes such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), agreed with Punjabi.“The pandemic has been both a boon and a bane for talent acquisition. On one hand, due to virtual processes, we are able to expand our reach of campuses, but on the other hand, it has become highly competitive to find talent. We don’t think any additional training is necessary, at least from our perspective, but the on-boarding processes are largely virtual, which implies we have to budget more time for people to integrate,” said Choudary.Over the last weekend, Scaler, an upskilling platform for students and working professionals in the technology space, held a virtual job fair for students. “Virtual hiring events are becoming the new normal. Our online assessment test platform is being used by many technology companies for screening their new recruits,” said Abhimanyu Saxena, co-founder of Scaler.He said that many technology firms are adding an additional screening level and asking students to take live coding tests. Video CVs are also becoming increasingly popular among recruiters.“We have already introduced an additional level of screening by introducing video proctoring during an online test and virtual interviews. We have been using video CVs as the first step along with resume as it helps in the selection process. Coding tests with real-time compilers are used to assess coding ability. Students can take the online test/interviews from their location using laptop or desktop or mobile phone. In case of any suspicious activity by the student, the system warns the candidate and shares the final report with the recruiter whether the student was found suspicious or non-suspicious during the process,” said SJ Raj, senior vice-president, human resources operations, Newgen Software, a digital transformation firm.Raj said that even as the pandemic subsides, companies may continue to use technology. “In the future, considering most of the colleges are off city limits, technology will be the big enabler. It will be a hybrid model wherein local colleges can be covered offline while outstation colleges can be covered with the online process to optimise our effort and cost,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-students-grapple-with-pandemic-truths-101622315913625.html
30-05-2021||Mumbai||New UGC rules facilitates autonomy to seven MU colleges in past one year||The move to reduce the academic burden of University of Mumbai (MU) is an ongoing process and while the state government has already approved two cluster universities as well as the state’s first private university, more and more colleges have managed to acquire autonomous status in the past one year.As per information shared by MU officials, there were 35 autonomous colleges, including five university departments, under the varsity by February 2020. However, making use of the new University Grants Commission (UGC) rules, seven other colleges have managed to get the prestigious status, taking the total number to 42 at present.“Earlier the process of autonomy was a two-step process and colleges first had to seek approval from the affiliated university before approaching UGC. But now UGC has streamlined the process, and this has encouraged more colleges to apply and achieve the autonomous status in the past one year,” said Deepak Wasave, deputy registrar, affiliation section, MU. He added that with the change in rules approved by UGC in 2018, colleges now only need affiliation confirmation from the respective university and can then approach UGC directly. “This cuts down the process time by more than half, helping more and more colleges in seeking autonomy,” he said.Well performing colleges were first encouraged to seek autonomy to help reduce the burden on MU, which has more than 800 affiliated colleges. The state education department encouraged more and more ‘A’ grade accredited colleges to apply for autonomy and handed over the reins of academic growth to the institutes themselves.UGC had earlier mentioned that colleges that get ‘A’ grade in three consecutive National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) cycles should be awarded autonomous status.The new guidelines, referred to as University Grants Commission (Conferment of Autonomous Status upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations, 2018, now states that henceforth, colleges with a NAAC score of 3.51 and above shall be considered for autonomous status “without onsite visit by the expert committee” of UGC.One of the last institutes to be awarded autonomy was KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering & Information Technology, in March this year. “At the UGC level, things have become much more facilitative, but the process still has hurdles and delays. Even though UGC permits new courses for autonomous colleges, if such a course is not there in the affiliating university, additional steps and more processes for approval cause further delays,” said professor VN Rajasekharan Pillai, provost, Somaiya Vidyavihar.Time and again experts have commented on the need for “full-fledged autonomy” as opposed to only academic autonomy. “There are four facets of autonomy — academic, financial, administrative and managerial. Technically, autonomy survives on these four pillars, but what colleges are getting right now is only academic autonomy, which dilutes the power of the status,” said SS Mantha, former director of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).Colleges, too, have highlighted the need for more diversity in the status. “What we get is more or less autonomy in conduct of examination only. Though autonomous colleges are getting some liberty, what we need is complete autonomy,” said Naresh Chandra, principal of BK Birla College, Kalyan.At present, autonomous colleges are allowed to design and upgrade their curriculum and to conduct examination as per their own schedule. However, the result is still certified by the university they were formerly affiliated to. “In order to initiate any new project, one needs financial backing and with that important part missing, it limits the growth of the institute,” said Mantha, adding, “The true strength of an institution in terms of what it does academically or otherwise is revealed only when they start giving out their own degree certificates, without the backing of an established university.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-ugc-rules-facilitates-autonomy-to-seven-mu-colleges-in-past-one-year-101622315913041.html

She induced the complainant into investing money in supplying raw material for an alleged drug for cancer treatment and cheated him.According to police sources, the complainant received a friend request from one Samantha Mathew, who introduced herself as purchase manager in pharmaceutical company at London, in February this year. After chatting on the platform for a while, the two shared their mobile numbers. “Mathew told the complainant that her company procured some herbal raw material for producing a cancer medicine from a firm in Nagaland, India. This raw material, she claimed, was extracted from a tree in Nagaland and added that she has been procuring the raw material for the company and was getting good commission for it. She then allegedly told him that her employer was transferring her to some other department, and offered the complainant her company’s agency for procuring the raw material and earn 60% commission,” said a police officer. The complainant decided to invest money in the business of supplying the raw material and entered a deed of agreement with Mathew’s company on May 3. As per the agreement, which was sent to the complainant through email, he was supposed to buy 5,000 packets of the raw material from Nagaland-based Varma Enterprises and send it to the company in the UK for a period of five years. The firm also stated that they would check samples first and then make 50% advance payment for a shipment. For the one packet of raw material, the company agreed to pay around ₹2 lakh.The complainant bought five packets from the Nagaland firm for ₹75,000 each to send as samples. But the UK-based company told him that they would need at least 500 packets as sample.However, after the complainant sent around ₹1.7 crore to buy 500 packets to the said Nagaland-based firm, he did not get the delivery. Upon checking with the firm repeatedly, the firm told him that they would send an executive via air to deliver the samples. Upon reaching the airport on the given date, the complainant found out that no such person was in the flight. Following this, he approached Colaba police.“We have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66 (Computer related offences) of the Information Technology Act. We are in process of obtaining details of the transactions, online Facebook accounts and beneficiary bank accounts. We suspect that the accused used fake names, fake company details and website and emails IDs,” said a police officer.Another police officer said the typical modus operandi indicates involvement of a Nigerian gang in the fraud. “Nigerian cyber fraudsters have been using the false stories of cancer-curing herbal medicine since many years and targetting vulnerable senior citizens on Facebook,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/82yearold-hotelier-duped-of-1-7-crore-by-facebook-friend-101622315853588.html

Fishermen from the area said a layer of fuel has formed over the water, making it difficult for them to fish. Contractors of the barge, which had 137 crew members onboard when it was stuck in the Arabia Sea amid the cyclone, have arrived at the spot and are making attempts to contain the spillage.The Coast Guard, in a statement, said that two fuel barges are being used to remove the oil and repairs to the hull is on.The barge, which was on ONGC duty, drifted to Vadrai coast on May 17 after it lost power. The Coast Guard with the help of three Chetak choppers and ship rescued all 137 crew members but the barge is still stuck at the coast, jeopardising the environment and leading to marine pollution.Manendra Arekar, chairman of Vadrai Machimar Sarvodaya Society, complained to Palghar port officer about the dangers of marine pollution due to the spillage. “Due to the oil spillage, the entire Vadrai, Satpati coast area is reeking of fuel, oil and chemicals, and as a result fishing is impossible. A thin layer of fuel is formed, leading to harm to marine lives,” said Arekar, adding, “We have appealed to the port officer to take remedial action to prevent more damage to the coast and the environment.”Poornima Meher, a fishermen leader, said the barge should be removed from the spot immediately before the onset of monsoon and that the spillage be controlled. “The fuel and oil load should be emptied on an emergency level, or else we will protest at the spot as 12 days have passed since the spillage,” Meher said.Assistant inspector Sudhir Dhayarkar of Satpati coastal police station said contractors and owners of the barge approached the police seeking security at the spot as the team are at the location to contain the spillage. “They are using boom, a big ring surrounding the barge, which will soak up the oil and fuel spillage,” said the official. “It is a time consuming process and we have not been informed as to when the fuel and oil will be emptied as the hull of the barge has formed cracks in some areas, resulting in the spillage. The process could take months,” said Dhayarkar. He further added that locals visiting the barge during low tide made the job difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclonehit-barge-gal-constructor-spills-diesel-into-arabian-sea-101622315853001.html

The bridge, from Malak Harhar to Stanley road (near Beli Hospital), is expected to be ready by February 2024, said officials.“The state’s first six-lane extradosed bridge will have an overall length of 9.9 kilometers, of which 3.84 km would be the main bridge and the rest of the distance would be approach section of the bridge,” said project director Raj Kishor Singh, an Indian Engineering Services (IES) officer. “The stretch of 3.84 km would have 67 pillars and foundation work of 17 pillars is now in process. Also, of this 3.84 km, the span of 860 meters would be extradosed bridge and the rest would be precast segmental bridge, having span of 50 meters,” he said.“Of this, 860 meters, there would be three spans of 200 meters while two of 130 meters would be balancing spans on either side of the bridge. Besides, two spans of 50 meters would also be there on either side of the stretch,” said Singh.“The bridge would start from the Pratapgrah road (around 500 meters from Malak Harhar trisection), gain height to over cross the existing Y-junction (going towards Lucknow) and would then cross the Ganga from Kacchar area spanning over Beli village before ending at Stanley road,” he said. “For the commuters, wishing to move towards Lucknow, there would be a slip road using which one can turn towards Lucknow, while those going towards Pratapgrah or Faizabad would stay on the bridge and land on the existing Prayagraj-Pratapgrah highway,” said Singh who has earlier executed work on Varanasi airport link road. To speed up the construction work, a temporary road has been constructed which would expedite the transport of men and material. “We have the challenge of expediting the construction work amid Covid-19 pandemic. The total cost of the bridge is 1948.25 crore and would be completed by February 2024,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ups-first-6-lane-extradosed-bridge-at-prayagraj-to-be-ready-by-2024-101622315733521.html

Now all the adjudicatory posts— chairman, judicial member, expert member, and special inspector general — are all vacant, advocate Vaishnavi Gholave has highlighted in a notice issued to the state government, calling upon the state authorities to fill up the vacant posts at the earliest.In her letter to the chief minister and other state dignitaries, Gholave also highlighted the fact that no appointments have been made to MSHRC since July 2018, although there were around 20,737 cases of human rights violations are waiting to be adjudicated.According to the notice, “acting chairperson MA Sayeed retired on April 27, 2021 and this has left the commission entirely non-functional”. There’s a notice on MSHRC website declaring that “all new matters have been adjourned sine die”.According to the information obtained by Gholave under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the last MSHRC chairman retired on January 23, 2018 and the expert member demitted office on September 16 of the same year, and the posts have been lying vacant since then.The post of special inspector general of police attached to the commission, who undertakes investigations as may be ordered by the commission, has been vacant since December 12, 2019. Overall, around 50% of the sanctioned posts on the establishment of MSHRC are vacant as of date.As per information obtained by the lawyer, only 1,083 cases have been disposed of in the past year due to non-availability of regular chairperson and expert member, which led to the entire load being handled by a single judicial member, Sayeed, who also had to discharge administrative and other functions till the date of his retirement.In this backdrop, Gholave has called upon the state authorities to fill up the vacant posts at the earliest. “The Constitution of India guarantees the right to seek justice,” states her notice, adding, “So if there are no members appointed to give justice, people will be deprived of the constitutional right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-human-rights-body-defunct-for-over-a-month-for-want-of-members-101622315732956.html

This is the time taken at the counter, and does not include time spent waiting in the queue. With the e-gates in place, as manual intervention will be zero, a passenger will be able to gain immigration clearance within 30-40 seconds,” said an officer, who wished not to be named.Another officer aware of the development said on condition of anonymity that to get immigration clearance at the e-gates, passengers will need to scan their passports and boarding passes themselves. “After ascertaining that the passport and boarding pass are genuine, a camera attached to the scanner will click a picture of the passenger’s face. The e-gate will also scan their fingerprints, which will be matched with a database of the prohibited or blacklisted passengers within seconds. Once cleared, the e-gates will open, allowing the passenger to proceed,” the officer said.Also read: Pulwama hero’s widow completes mission to become an army officerOfficers also said that initially, there will be staff present to assist the passengers in the process. The passengers’ data will also be recorded with the bureau of immigration for future use, they added.The e-gate was put on trial at Delhi airport in December last year for three months. The officer said that after completion of the trials, they received approval from the MHA to proceed. “Orders have been placed to buy the technology and operations are expected to begin by July first week,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/soon-breeze-through-immigration-e-gates-at-igi-airport-101622313813461.html

Moreover, the involvement of a large number of persons in the commission of crime as well as in hiding out of the accused persons, some of which belong to some notorious gangs stationed in Delhi and outside Delhi are yet to be arrested (sic),” said the judge, noting that the initial days of the investigation are crucial. He agreed with the police submission that recoveries of mobile phones and clothes have to be made. “As such, in the interest of justice, deem it appropriate to allow the application of IO to the extent of four days only,” the court said in a seven-page order.Police had sought seven days custody for Kumar and co-accused Sehrawat, who were arrested from Mundka area on May 23. Kumar has been booked for murder, abduction and criminal conspiracy in the murder of wrestler Sagar Rana, a former national junior wrestling champion. Advocate Pradeep Rana, the counsel for Sushil Kumar, accused the police of a media trial and trying to curtail the freedom of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sushil-kumar-sent-to-4-day-police-custody-101622313814041.html

30-05-2021||Delhi||City won’t get 550,000 allotted jabs before June 10: Sisodia||Delhi will not get its next allocation of 550,000 Covid-19 doses for the 18-45 age bracket before June 10, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday, adding that the state will need several more doses if it wants to inoculate its entire population.“Yesterday [Friday], the Centre communicated to us that the Delhi government will get 5.5 lakh allocated doses only by June 10. Firstly, 5.5 lakh doses are too little, and on top of that they are not giving us the doses on time. Delhi has 92 lakh people aged between 18 and 45. We need 1.84 crore doses [to inoculate all of them completely]. We are prepared to vaccinate all of them in three months, but there are no vaccines only due to gross mismanagement by the Centre. The Delhi government only received 4.5 lakh doses in April, and then 3.66 lakh doses in May,” said the deputy chief minister, while addressing a video press briefing.Also read | Vietnam detects hybrid Covid-19 variant: ReportSisodia also asked how private hospitals that charge people for the vaccines — as compared to state-run centres, which administer jabs for free — are able to get stocks, while the state government is short of vaccines.All of the Delhi government’s vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group have been shut for nearly a week now due to a shortage of vaccines.A senior government official said that when Covaxin doses arrive, those due for their second dose will be given priority to ensure they are fully vaccinated within the stipulated 28-day period.In addition, the deputy chief minister also asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-run Centre why finance ministers of some BJP-ruled states are opposing Goods and Service Tax (GST) waivers on essential health items such as vaccines, oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeters and so on.Several states across the country have requested for all Covid-essential materials, equipment, medicines and vaccines to be exempted from GST. To this effect, the Union government on Saturday constituted an eight-member ministerial panel under Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma to consider GST exemptions on a range of Covid-19 medical essentials.Also read: Except two exemptions, curbs to stay for a weekReferring to the GST council meeting chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday that was attended by all state finance ministers, Sisodia said, “As the finance minister of Delhi, I proposed making vaccines and other essential health equipment such as pulse-oximeters, PPE kits, etc. tax-free. Finance ministers of West Bengal, Punjab, Chhattisgarh too demanded the same. However, when I proposed the need to make vaccines and Covid-19 related equipment tax free, many finance ministers of BJP-ruled states resisted and therefore, a consensus could not be concurred.”Central government spokespersons did not respond despite repeated requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-will-not-get-550k-alloted-vaccine-doses-before-june-10-sisodia-101622313633561.html

Yogesh Gupta from Chhattisgarh, who has been working in a private firm in Hyderabad for the last 10 years, and his wife Rupal Gupta, were clueless when the doctors at Rainbow Children’s Hospital in the city told them that the only way to save their son Ayaansh was to procure – Zolgensma, which is the only medicine that can cure SMA. “When we made enquiries, we came to know that Zolgensma, made by Novartis, costs around ₹16 crore and it has to be imported from the USA or the European countries. Added to this, one has to pay import duty and GST on the medicine,” Gupta told HT. The couple tried a few options to mobilise money for the medicine, but they realised that they won’t be able to do it because it was too huge. “But my wife was confident that we could definitely raise the money. She was reading about fund-raising or crowd-funding campaigns that regularly take place in the countries like the USA and the UK. So, she suggested we, too, could start such a campaign,” Gupta said. On February 4, the couple posted a request on the social media platforms and began the campaign. “Our friends, about 150 of them, also pitched in and made the campaign viral. The response was overwhelming. Though the flow of funds slowed down a bit later, we did not give up hope. Our friends intensified the campaign and finally, by May 23, we could mobilise all the money we required for Ayaansh’s treatment. We closed the campaign on the same day,” Gupta said. He said nearly 65,000 donors have responded to the fund-raising campaign and donated money in small or big amounts. The donors included celebrities like Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli and his actress-wife Anushka Sharma, Emraan Hashmi, Dia Miza, Javeed Jaafri, Rajkumar Rao, Arjun Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan and others. “We have completed all the required documentation and placed the order with the US firm for the purchase medicine and we are expecting it to be delivered by June 10. We are thankful to every one of the donors and also to my friends, who made relentless efforts to mobilise money to save my son,” Gupta said. Ayaansh, who turned three years on Thursday, showed the signs of the rare disease, when he was just six months old. “He had very limited movement of his muscles. He couldn’t even cough and when there was a congestion in chest, we had to use a suction pump to remove phlegm from the lungs,” Gupta said. The couple took the child to various doctors, including paediatricians and neuro-physicians. “Though they diagnosed it as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), they had no idea about the treatment. They told me it is a progressive disease and my son might not survive beyond four years,” he said. Luckily for the couple, Ayaansh can speak and that was the only solace for them. “Finally, the doctors at the Rainbow Hospital in Hyderabad recommended this drug available abroad and said it would make him normal. That raised our hopes,” Gupta said. The couple is now trying for exemption of the import duty and GST on Zolgensma. Interestingly, on March 17, Ayaansh’s issue was raised in Rajya Sabha by a Congress member from Madhya Pradesh Vivek K Tankha. Replying to his query, finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman said imported life-saving drugs including those for spinal muscular atrophy disease for personal use are exempted from basic customs duty but they attract five per cent GST. She, however, assured that ad hoc exemption from GST on imported life-saving drugs could be given on a case-to-case basis during exceptional nature. “We have made the request for exemption of the GST as well and are hopeful of getting the approval by next week,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hyderabad-couple-mobilises-16cr-through-crowd-funding-for-son-s-treatment-101622313632869.html

He added that if people follow the regulations, there will be no need to extend the lockdown. All districts of Karnataka are currently under a lockdown till 6 am on June 7. While lockdown announced initially was supposed to end on May 10, experts insisted to impose lockdown from May 10 to 24, which was later extended till June 7. Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, Yediyurappa said: “The lockdown will be in effect till June 7 and we will assess the situation and decide what happens next. The strict restrictions will be in place till then and depending on Covid-19 cases reducing, we will take the next decision. If people cooperate, the question of extending the lockdown may not arise but people have to cooperate, that is all.” Yediyurappa on Saturday also announced the CM Baalaseva scheme for children who lost their parents due to Covid-19. Under this scheme, the government will provide ₹3,500 to guardians of the children who lost both their parents in the pandemic. Similarly, for children who have passed standard 10, they will be given laptops and girl students above the age of 21, will be provided ₹1 lakh for marriage, higher education, or entrepreneurship, the government said. “Children who don’t have any guardians will be taken care of in the childcare institutions and to provide then quality education children will be admitted to (government-run) residential schools,” Yediyurappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-decision-on-extending-lockdownyediyurappa-101622313512782.html
30-05-2021||Other||Don’t lower guard: Experts warn against Covid 3rd wave in K’taka||Bengaluru: The daily Covid-19 numbers reported in the past few days in Karnataka point at the downward trend of the second wave of the pandemic, with experts saying the spike in cases would stabilise by mid-June. They, however, warned against lowering the guard, and added that the third wave was inevitable by the end of October. Looking at the experiences of the European countries, experts said, the third wave could be deadlier than the first two. “It is a clear indication that by the third wave, we have to strengthen the medical infrastructure in order to treat higher number of patients than the second wave. The next few months should be used for that,” said Giridhar Babu, a professor of epidemiology and member of the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19. However, the preparation for the third wave has to go beyond just medical infrastructure and oxygen supply, experts said, adding that the younger population might be the most vulnerable group in the third wave. Babu said with most senior citizens getting vaccinated by then, those below 18 years, if not vaccinated by then, would be the most vulnerable. He also said that infections among children would be a bigger concern. In Karnataka, during the first wave between March and September 2020, as many as 19,378 children under the age of 10 were infected. From then until May this year, 49,257 in the age group have tested positive for Covid-19. As many as 68,635 children under the age of 10 have been infected till May 20 this year, according to state health department data. The case was similar in the 10-19 age group as 41,895 tested positive for the virus between March and September 2020, while another 131,391 got infected since then, taking the total to 173,286 so far, the state data suggests. State health director Om Prakash Patil, who held consultations with 17 experts and members of the state unit of the Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP) on Friday, said Karnataka will come out with guidelines on handling paediatric Covid-19 infections. “We discussed what can be done to prevent spread among children and how we can ramp up our infrastructure and train manpower to handle paediatric cases if at all the projections come true,” Patil said. Shivananda, former director of the state-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, who attended the meeting, said the state needs more manpower trained in handling child cases as the existing number of paediatricians may not be adequate. “Only a fraction of the infected child cases may require ventilators. Most of the new ventilators come with settings that can be adjusted for paediatric use. What the state may require is more paediatric BIPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines and paediatric ICU beds,” he said. “Also, as home isolation of infected children is very difficult without parents’ supervision, we have asserted that vaccination of parents should be given priority. If they are immunised, the risk of them getting infected while handling Covid positive children will be minimal,” Shivananda added. Another point of concern has been the deaths among the 30-45 age group, experts said. Compared to the first wave, more deaths were reported in this age category in the second wave. Babu said in many cases undetected comorbidities could have been the reason for deaths. “As we are expected to witness the third wave, it was important that people get themselves tested to understand the various comorbidities they have. In India, people get these comorbidities at least 10 years before other countries,” he said. Babu added that the pace of vaccination will be a key factor in preparing for the third wave. “We are vaccinating elderly, and it is showing results, but it important that we vaccinate the younger population as well. We can’t emphasise this enough,” Babu said. The Karnataka government has formally announced a 13-member committee of medical experts, headed by noted cardiac surgeon Devi Prasad Shetty, to prepare a roadmap to tackle the possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced Shetty’s name on May 14, after the Karnataka high court asked the government to submit its plans to tackle the pandemic. Experts also said it was important to increase the number of beds in hospitals and other infrastructure, referring to the countless reports of patients dying without getting a hospital bed. In the second wave of Covid-19, the proportion of people who died without getting a hospital bed increased exponentially. While 3.8% of all deaths in the first wave were reported outside of hospitals, in the second wave, it jumped up to 9.3%, or one in every 10 Covid fatalities in Karnataka, shows the analysis of health bulletins released by the Karnataka state health department on so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-lower-guard-experts-warn-against-covid-3rd-wave-in-ktaka-101622313452824.html
30-05-2021||World||Find Covid-19 origin or face another pandemic, US experts warn||The world needs the cooperation of the Chinese government to trace the origins of Covid-19 and prevent future pandemic threats, two leading U.S. disease experts said Sunday.Information to support the theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, has increased, said Scott Gottlieb, a commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration who now sits on the board of Pfizer Inc.China hasn’t provided evidence to disprove that theory, while the search for signs that the virus emerged from wildlife hasn’t yielded results, Gottlieb said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”Not knowing how the pandemic started puts the world at risk of future outbreaks, Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said in a separate TV appearance.“There’s going to be Covid-26 and Covid-32 unless we fully understand the origins of Covid-19,” Hotez said on NBC’s “Meet the press.”Almost a year and half after the new pathogen was first detected spreading in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, the precise origins of the virus remain obscure. Scientists have hypothesized that it most likely spread from wild animals to humans. The idea that the virus may have accidentally escaped from a research lab, long promoted by some Republicans, has gotten renewed attention from the Biden administration.In a surprise statement on Wednesday, President Joe Biden called for a renewed investigation into the virus’s emergence. U.S. intelligence agencies had conflicting assessments of whether it was more likely the virus crossed the species barrier from a natural reservoir or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Biden said. He ordered the agencies to “redouble their efforts” and report to him again in 90 days.Debate over the virus’s origin was fueled anew by a Wall Street Journal report on May 23 that three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care for “symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.”Scientists should be allowed to conduct a long-term investigation in China and take blood samples from humans and animals, Hotez said. The U.S. should pressure China, including with the threat of sanctions, to allow for an inquiry.“We need a team of scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, bat ecologists in Hubei province for a six-month, year-long period,” Hotez said.Chinese officials have disputed the Wuhan lab theory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday dismissed Biden’s inquiry as an attempt to engage in “stigmatization, political manipulation and blame-shifting.”A World Health Organization report released in March didn’t fully uncover the virus’s origin but called a lab leak unlikely. The global health body called for more investigation at that time.“As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement when the March report was released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/find-covid-19-origin-or-face-another-pandemic-us-experts-warn-101622396047440.html
30-05-2021||World||Israeli opposition parties reach coalition deal to oust Netanyahu||Far-right party leader Naftali Bennett threw his crucial support on Sunday behind a "government of change" in Israel to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in what would be the end of a political era.Bennett's decision, which he announced in a televised address, could enable opposition chief Yair Lapid to put together a coalition of right-wing, centrist and leftist parties and hand Netanyahu his first election defeat since 1999.Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party that finished second to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in an inconclusive March 23 national ballot, faces a Wednesday deadline from Israel's president to announce a new government.Lapid's chances of success have rested largely with Bennett, a former defence chief whose Yamina party's six seats in the 120-member parliament are enough to give him the status of kingmaker.Under a prospective power-sharing deal, Bennett would replace Netanyahu, the 71-year-old head of the Likud party, as prime minister and later give way to centrist Lapid in a rotation agreement."It's either a fifth election, or a unity government," Bennett, 49, said in his speech, explaining his decision to partner with Lapid.Israel has held four inconclusive elections since April 2019.The new coalition's diverse members would have little in common apart from a plan to end the 12-year-run of Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, now on trial over corruption charges he denies.An anti-Netanyahu coalition would be fragile and require outside backing by Arab members of parliament who oppose much of Bennett's agenda, which includes more settlement building in the occupied West Bank and its partial annexation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-opposition-parties-reach-coalition-deal-to-oust-netanyahu-101622395183289.html
30-05-2021||World||Israel, Egypt hold talks over a 'permanent ceasefire' in Gaza||Israeli and Egyptian officials held talks in both countries Sunday aimed at bolstering the Cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the Jewish state and Gaza's Hamas rulers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in Jerusalem to discuss "strengthening cooperation" between their countries, Netanyahu's office said.Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi tasked Kamel and his delegation, who also visited the occupied Palestinian Territories, with hammering out a permanent ceasefire deal, senior Egyptian security officials told AFP.On the same day, Israel's Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi made the first official visit by an Israeli top diplomat to neighbouring Egypt in 13 years, for talks with his counterpart Sameh Shoukry.Ashkenazi tweeted that they would "discuss establishing a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, a mechanism for providing humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Gaza with a pivotal role played by the international community".He later called for efforts "to prevent strengthening extremist elements that threaten regional stability, and to ensure the return home of the missing persons and prisoners held by Hamas."The Egyptian foreign ministry tweeted that the ministers' talks were "part of Egypt's relentless and continued efforts to revive the peace track and to build on the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip".Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was also expected in Cairo for talks, senior Egyptian security officials said, without providing further details.Egypt played a pivotal role in negotiating the May 21 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought an end to 11 days of deadly fighting.Israeli strikes on Gaza killed 254 Palestinians, including 66 children, health officials said.Rockets and other fire from Gaza claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, medics said.- Prisoners -Sisi also tasked Kamel with working to help iron out political divisions between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Egyptian officials said.Kamel met Sunday with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah, according to official Palestinian media.They discussed the latest developments linked to the truce, as well as the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian national dialogue, the Wafa news agency said.A bitter divide between Hamas and Fatah has long plagued Palestinian politics, but analysts say the latest escalation has served to unite the geographically fragmented Palestinian community in a way not seen in years.Netanyahu reiterated Israel's demand "for the prompt return" of Israelis being held in the Gaza Strip, according to the statement.Ashkenazi also said Israel was "fully committed" to repatriating Israeli prisoners held by Hamas.Since Israel's 2014 invasion of the Gaza Strip, the Islamist group has held the bodies of Israeli soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, although Hamas has never confirmed their deaths.Hamas is also believed to be holding two Israeli citizens who entered Gaza alone and whose families say they have mental health issues.Israel is meanwhile holding more than 5,000 Palestinians in its jails.- Gaza reconstruction -Sisi has pledged $500 million to help reconstruction efforts in the densely populated Gaza enclave, which was pummelled by Israeli air strikes.Hamas has pledged not to touch "a single cent" of international aid to rebuild Gaza.Israel, which has enforced a land and maritime blockade on the enclave since 2007, accuses the group of diverting international aid to military ends.The statement from Netanyahu's office said he and Kamel also discussed "mechanisms and processes to prevent the strengthening of Hamas and its use of the resources that will be directed to the civilian population in the future".The latest violent flare-up was sparked by increased tensions in Jerusalem, including over Israeli security forces cracking down on Palestinians inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, which is also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.Shoukry emphasised the "need to consider the particular sensitivity (of) east Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa mosque and all Christian and Muslim holy sites," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement.The UN Human Rights Council decided Thursday to create an open-ended international investigation into violations surrounding the latest Gaza violence.It said it would also look at the "underlying root causes of recurrent tensions and instability, including systematic discrimination" in the occupied Palestinian Territories and inside Israel.UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet voiced particular concern about the "high level of civilian fatalities and injuries" from the bombing of Gaza and warned the Israeli strikes on the enclave "may constitute war crimes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-egypt-hold-talks-over-a-permanent-ceasefire-in-gaza-101622393428134.html
30-05-2021||World||UK may ask NHS workers to take vaccine against Covid-19, opposition up in arms||The British government may require National Health Service workers to be inoculated against COVID-19 — a contentious proposal that was immediately criticised by opposition leaders as counterproductive.The UK government's vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, told Sky News on Sunday that officials were considering the move in hopes of preventing medical workers from spreading COVID-19 to their patients. The government has already asked the public to comment on a similar requirement for care home employees.“It's absolutely the right thing and would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated," Zahawi said.“There is precedent for this. Obviously, surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it is something that we are absolutely thinking about."British authorities are scrambling to protect their plans to lift all COVID-19 restrictions on June 21, allowing people to enjoy their summer holidays, amid concern about a fast-spreading variant that was first discovered in India. New infections and coronavirus-related deaths have risen over the past week, though the current figures are still a fraction of the levels reported during the January peak.While Britain has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll, at over 128,000 people, public health officials say the situation has improved since last winter because of the rapid rollout of vaccines. More than 74% of British adults have received at least one dose of vaccine.The opposition Labour Party was quick to condemn the proposal for compulsory vaccinations, saying it would be better to work with staff to address their concerns than to force them to get the shot.“Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS, I think it's far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them," said lawmaker Thangam Debbonaire, a party spokesperson on such issues. “Threatening staff, I don't think, is a good idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-may-ask-nhs-workers-to-take-vaccine-against-covid-19-opposition-up-in-arms-101622393289218.html

How can we feed the horses?"Tourists had briefly returned to the district from December to February when infections slowed, but visits dried up under the fresh lockdown imposed from April 14.At least 21 horses out of up to 90 used for tourists at the beach died over the past month while others were emaciated, Begum said.During last year's lockdown, 41 horses -- including eight of Begum's own -- died, she added.Some owners have set their horses free, hoping they can survive by eating grass or foraging for food.The horse owners say they have been struggling to feed their own families, with many taking out loans from microlenders just to make ends meet."Officials from the microlender come to my home every week and badger me to pay back the loan in instalments. But unless the tourists start arriving in Cox's Bazar, I can't pay back the money," Begum said, adding that she had borrowed 100,000 taka ($1,200).Dozens of horse handlers usually hired by the owners to help tourists with the rides have switched to driving rickshaws or construction work.- 'No tourists means no income' -The resort town usually attracts more than two million mostly domestic tourists every year.But under the nationwide lockdown, offices and markets are shut and public transport has been halted.Horse owner Sarwar Azam told AFP that one of his animals died last week and the second was also going hungry.The head of a local horse owners' organisation, Nishan Ahsan -- whose four animals died during last year's lockdown -- said his members had received limited aid from the government."During the peak tourism time, a horse can earn up to 2,000 taka ($23) a day. We would set aside a slice of that income for the horses' food, which is expensive," Ahsan told AFP."But no tourists means no income for us."The government administrator for Cox's Bazar, Sumaiya Akter, said she had only heard of four to five horses dying in the past eight months.She added that the government had given the owners 146 sacks of husks and 20 cans of molasses since May 9.Bangladesh has recorded nearly 800,000 coronavirus infections and more than 12,300 deaths since the start of the pandemic, but experts say the actual numbers are likely to be much higher.Just over six percent of the population has received the first vaccine dose, while the government has said it is running out of jabs as it tries to combat the latest devastating virus wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horses-starve-to-death-as-covid-pandemic-hits-bangladesh-tourism-101622386004358.html

India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories.However, lately there has been some improvement when the two countries agreed in February to restore peace on the Line of Control. It is said that the rival officials have been interacting through the back channel diplomacy to ease tension.Khan also responded to several questions about domestic issues including inflation and promised that his government was working hard to bring down prices of commodities. He also said that Pakistan will continue to achieve economic growth in the days to come as he termed the process gradual and one that would take time.

The new panorama, touted as a “cosmic masterpiece”, was compiled using a giant mosaic of data from Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The image depicts billions of stars and countless black holes in the centre of the Milky Way.“What we see in the picture is a violent or energetic ecosystem in our galaxy’s downtown,” Astronomer Daniel Wang of the University of Massachusetts Amherst told Associated Press in an email.“There are a lot of supernova remnants, black holes, and neutron stars there. Each X-ray dot or feature represents an energetic source, most of which are in the center,” Wang added.Sharing the image, Nasa noted that the threads of superheated gas and magnetic fields are “weaving a tapestry of energy at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.” According to the US space agency, the latest image expands Chandra’s image, which was based on previous surveys, farther above and below the plane of the Galaxy where most of the Galaxy's stars reside.Also Read | Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter survives wild flight after a navigation error. Here’s what happenedThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration explained that orange, green, blue and purple colours are X-rays from Chandra showing different X-ray energies. The radio data received from MeerKAT are shown in lilac and grey. “One thread is particularly intriguing because it has X-ray and radio emission intertwined. It points perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and is about 20 light years long but only one-hundredth that size in width,” said Nasa.A new study of the X-ray and radio properties of this “thread” by Wang, who spent over a year working on it, suggests these features are bound together by thin strips of magnetic fields. Wang’s study describing these results will appear in the June issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a preprint is available online.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cosmic-masterpiece-nasa-image-shows-violent-energy-of-milky-way-downtown-101622382422334.html

The census showed China's 2020 fertility rate was 1.3 children per woman, which is below the replacement level of 2.1 needed for a stable population.Military expert Antony Wong Tong said that many mainland military officials and observers had voiced concerns about the impact of the one-child policy on the military since 1993. Professor Liu Mingfu from the PLA National Defence University in 2012 warned that at least 70 per cent of PLA soldiers were from one-child families, and the figure rose to 80 per cent among combat troops."We could find the PLA has recruited more female soldiers in the past decade - a popular approach adopted by developed countries facing a shortage of new blood," Wong said.The gathering pace of the PLA's modernisation has given its instructors and recruiters the challenge of how to train a newer breed of soldier, SCMP reported citing experts."Military instructors found the strict and dogmatic training modes applied in the last century didn't work for the more individual young soldiers born in the 21st century," said Zhou Chenming, a researcher from a Beijing-based think tank.Chinese media reported that rather than only orders and scolding, China's military has also brought in therapy sessions by professional psychotherapists since 2011 to ease stress.Physical fitness has been another tough challenge for the PLA since the military shifted its recruitment targets from peasants' children to rural youth with a higher education level in 2000.The military recruited more than 120,000 college graduates in 2009 - the highest since 1949 - to command and operate increasingly advanced and sophisticated weapon systems, SCMP reported.Even after postponing the results of the once-in-a-decade census for a month, the Chinese government was unable to fully cover up the alarming demographic situation that the country is facing.According to the seventh nationwide census of 2020, China's population has grown by merely 5.38 per cent over the last 10 years. China's birthrate has been on the decline since 2017, despite easing of the 'one-child policy' in order to avert an incoming demographic crisis.China's one-child policy, implemented in 1979 and withdrawn in 2016, had exacerbated the practice of sex-selective abortion in favour of boys, said Jiang Quanbao, a demography professor.

Most Israeli media predicted Bennett would agree to a deal under which he would replace Netanyahu as prime minister and later give way to Lapid in a rotation agreement.Such a deal had already been reported as close when violence broke out between Israel and Gaza militants on May 10, which prompted Bennett to suspend discussions. The fighting ended with a ceasefire after 11 days. Bennett has maintained public silence in recent days.To form a government with Lapid, Bennett would first have to rally his own party's legislators, despite a closer political affinity to Netanyahu's Likud.An anti-Netanyahu coalition would be fragile, and require outside backing by Arab members of parliament who oppose much of Bennett's agenda. It would be expected to focus on the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, while setting aside issues on which members disagree, such as the role of religion in society and Palestinian aspirations for statehood.COUNTER-OFFERNetanyahu, 71, made a sudden three-way counter-offer on Sunday to stand aside in favour of another right-wing politician, Gideon Saar. Under Netanyahu's blueprint, Saar would serve as prime minister for 15 months, Netanyahu would return for two years, and Bennett would then take over for the rest of the government's term."We are at a fateful moment for Israel's security, character and future, when you put aside any personal considerations and take far-reaching and even unprecedented steps," Netanyahu said in a video statement on Twitter about the proposal.However, Saar, a former Likud cabinet minister, swiftly rejected the offer, writing on Twitter: "Our position and commitment are unchanged - to end Netanyahu's rule."There was no immediate comment from Bennett, who has reversed course before over whether to push out Netanyahu.Netanyahu's rivals have cited his corruption case as a main reason why Israel needs a new leader, arguing that he might use a new term to legislate immunity to shield himself.If Lapid, 57, fails to announce a government by Wednesday, a new election, the fifth since April 2019, is likely. Bennett has said he aims to avoid it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-in-last-minute-bid-to-scupper-possible-deal-to-unseat-him-101622376594182.html
30-05-2021||World||Pakistan: Sindh province facing 'worst' water shortage in 60 years, says official||The chief engineer of Guddu Barrage in Pakistan's Sindh province has advised growers not to go for paddy sowing in May and June as the barrage as well as the province are experiencing 'worst water shortage in 60 years'.This comes after the decision taken by the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) on Saturday to apply 32 per cent shortages for Punjab and Sindh provinces, reported Dawn.The engineer said that growers could go for nurseries' preparation in July while anticipating an improvement in water flows, as three barrages in the province are facing a water shortage. The Kotri Barrage is bearing the most serious shortage i.e. 50.44 per cent.As of Saturday, Sindh's three barrages are bearing with 36.94 per cent water shortage which undermines cotton crop that has been sown in areas wherever water is made available for the early Kharif.IRSA's Sindh member Zahid Junejo says everyone hopes that the water situation improves in view of rising temperature in upper reaches that may lead to improved water flows."But currently, wherever cotton is grown or paddy nurseries are prepared, crops are affected due to water shortage that has been going on for a long period," he said.He also disagreed with the viewpoint of Punjab, which accuses Sindh of providing fudged figures."We check water flows at every point. Formation of a committee is now likely with consent of Sindh and Punjab. It would be entrusted with monitoring of water discharges through independent inspectors," he added.He also said that allowable losses have been revised at 30 per cent, which was again a loss for the Sindh province, reported Dawn."That's why Sindh says transit losses between Taunsa and Guddu are exceptionally higher and explains that gradients are not steeper and the temperature remains exceptionally high there," he added.He also regretted that when IRSA decided on May 24 to not open the Taunsa-Panjnad link canal, it was still opened by Punjab to the great disadvantage of Sindh, where farmers have lost their early sowing of Kharif crops considerably".Amid the rising population and climate change, the availability of fresh water is becoming worrisome in South Asia, particularly in Pakistan, which may face absolute water scarcity by 2040.According to a Washington-based magazine, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed Pakistan at the third position in the list of countries facing acute water scarcity.Moreover, the per capita availability of fresh water in Pakistan has fallen below the water scarcity threshold (1,000 cubic meters), which was 3,950 cubic meters in 1961 and 1600 in 1991.

They chanted slogans against the government, the federal minister for education and other officers of the education department.As the Covid-19 pandemic forced the educational institutes to remain closed, online classes were conducted only for a short period. Under such a situation, the students insisted that final exams should be taken online.As the protest turned violent, protesters started damaging private vehicles and also beat and injured the drivers of these vehicles, claimed officials. In response, the police resorted to baton-charge to disperse the protesters, Dawn reported.The students pelted stones at the police after which the police used tear gas to disperse them, taking over a dozen of protesters into custody.Later, the arrested students along with the bikes were shifted to different police stations.The officials said that during questioning those who were arrested failed to prove that they were students and enrolled in any educational institutes. They seemed to be miscreants and had joined the students' protest to disrupt law and order, they added.Meanwhile, a gridlock was witnessed on the expressway and other roads due to the protest by the students at Faizabad creating hardship for motorists, Dawn reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-dozen-students-arrested-in-islamabad-after-protest-against-in-person-exams-101622378561852.html

30-05-2021||World||British spies believe Wuhan Covid lab leak theory is ‘feasible’: Report||The controversy around the possible leak of the Sars-CoV-2 virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan has received another boost. According to a Sunday Times report, British intelligence officials believe it is “feasible” that the pandemic began after a virus leak from a Wuhan laboratory. The British spies are now investigating the theory of a possible leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to the report.Quoting people familiar with the development, the British daily said that a recent reassessment of the possible source of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has prompted UK intelligence to investigate the lab leak theory. Sharing renewed concerns over virus origin, American diplomatic sources said that the world is “one wet market or bio lab away from the next spillover”, reported The Sunday Times.The hypothesis of the introduction of Sars-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident had gained a lot of traction in the early days of the pandemic but was largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. A global study, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), also deemed it “extremely unlikely” after international experts visited Wuhan in January this year.Also Read | Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsBut a recent remark by top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on virus origin possibilities took the world by surprise, which was followed by a demand for a new “transparent” investigation. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a virtual event that he was not convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.”"Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus," he said.According to a Daily Mail report, a study has found that the Sars-CoV-2 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’ and was created by Chinese scientists while working on ‘gain-of-function’ research. The study, which is set to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, claimed that the Chinese scientist also tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering the viruses to make it look like they naturally arose from bats, reported Daily Mail.“I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why,” UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-spies-believe-wuhan-covid-lab-leak-theory-is-feasible-report-101622374947571.html

30-05-2021||World||‘Egregious’: Sikh immigrant forced to shave beard in US prison, advocacy groups demand probe||Several legal advocacy groups have filed a complaint with the civil rights division of the US department of justice after a Sikh immigrant was forced to shave his beard in an Arizona detention facility. Surjit Singh, a 64-year-old Indian immigrant, was sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter after a fatal vehicle accident in Yuma, Arizona.Last year, Singh was stripped of his turban when he entered Yuma county jail and had his beard forcibly shaved by corrections officers after he was transferred to Alhambra Reception Center, operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry (ADCRR), the advocacy groups have alleged. Singh believes, in accordance with his Sikh faith, that he must wear a turban and refrain from cutting any of his hair, including facial hair, according to the complaint.Calling it an “egregious incident”, the advocacy groups said that the incident caused Singh “deep shame and mental trauma, including severe depression” as he had never cut, shaved, trimmed, or otherwise removed his hair. The complaint also alleged continued harassment of the Sikh immigrant over his religious practices, claiming that prison staff at the Douglas facility tried to shave his facial hair a second time because it had grown out beyond the one inch allowed by the ADCRR policy.There are around 26 million Sikhs worldwide, of which more than 500,000 reside in the US. As per the Sikh code of conduct, called the Rehat Maryada, Sikh men are required to wear external articles of faith, and the most commonly maintained article is unshorn hair (kesh) covered by a turban. However, the ADCRR requires prisoners to shave any facial hair before having their photo taken during the intake process to facilitate a clean picture for the ‘Mug Photo Interface Subsystem’.“Mr. Singh’s faith requires him to maintain unshorn facial hair, and the ADCRR’s arbitrary policies should not violate his or anyone else’s religious rights in Arizona,” Cindy Nesbit, Sikh Coalition senior staff attorney, said in a statement.The complaint has been jointly filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arizona, the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief (PFRB), the ACLU National Prison Project (NPP), the Sikh Coalition, and WilmerHale LLP, an international law firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-immigrant-forced-to-shave-beard-in-us-prison-advocacy-groups-demand-probe-101622370929497.html

Famous stir-fried Chinese dishes like fish-flavoured shredded pork and Gong Bao (Kung Bao) chicken are both on the menu,” the Xinhua report said.Separately, the CMSEO announced that the three astronauts who will take the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft to the space station’s core cabin in June were undergoing quarantine ahead of their departure.“The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-12 mission, who were selected from China’s first and second batch of astronauts, will stay in space for three months, during which they will conduct tasks including repair and maintenance, appliance switch and scientific operation of payloads,” Yang Liwei, CMSEO director and China’s first astronaut told state broadcaster, CCTV.Following five launch missions this year, China plans to have six more missions, including the launch of the Wentian and Mengtian lab modules, two cargo spacecraft and two crewed spaceships, by 2022, to complete the construction of the space station.“Since 2003, China has sent six astronauts into space including astronaut Zhai Zhigang who carried out China’s first outer space walk in September 2008,” the report said.Once completed, the Tiangong is set to be a rival to the International Space Station from which China is excluded.The ISS comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tianzhou-2-reaches-space-station-module-carrying-supplies-101622367219998.html

Some like the United Arab Emirates have sought to normalise ties after Assad regained control of most of the country."So far we see nothing on the horizon for a political solution acceptable to the Syrian people... the (regime's)approach and conduct has not changed," Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told UK-based Al Araby television in an interview aired on Friday."There is no motivation for us to re-establish ties with the Syrian regime at this time," Sheikh Mohammed said. "The Syrian regime is committing crimes against its people."Syria's government said that Wednesday's election shows the country is functioning normally despite the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced 11 million.Gulf Arab states downgraded or shut missions in Damascus in 2012 over attacks by the government on protests at the start of the conflict.The UAE re-opened its mission to Damascus in late 2018 in a bid to counter the influence of non-Arab actors like Iran, which along with Russia backs Assad, and Turkey, which backs rebels.The UAE has a charge d'affaires in Syria.

The record of 10 hours and 56 minutes is held by a Sherpa guide, Lakpa Gelu.A climbing accident on Everest in 2019, when Muir hurt his ankle falling off a ladder, did not deter him from attempting to scale the peak again. He began mountaineering late in life, and said he was scared and anxious during his latest adventure.“You realize how big a mountain it is, how dangerous it is, how many things that could go wrong. Yeah, it makes you nervous, it makes you know some anxiety there and maybe little bit of scared," Muir told reporters in Kathmandu.“I was just surprised when I actually got to there (the summit) but I was too tired to stand up, and in my summit pictures I am sitting down," he said.Also Read | First blind Chinese mountaineer climbs Mount EverestMuir began mountaineering at age 68 with trips to South America and Alaska before attempting Everest in 2019, when he fell off the ladder.Climbing was closed last year due to the pandemic.Married and a father of three, Muir has six grandchildren. The last one — a boy — was born while he was still in the mountains during his current expedition.Tsang made only two stops between the base camp, located at 5,300 meters (17,390 feet), to the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit to change, and covered the near vertical distance in 25 hours and 50 minutes.She was lucky because there were barely any climbers on the way to the highest camp at South Col. After that, on her way to the summit, she met only climbers making their descent, which did not slow her speed climb.There are only a few days of good weather left on the mountain this year, when hundreds of climbers line up to the summit, many having to wait for a long time in the traffic jam on the highest trail.“I just feel kind of relief and happy because I am not looking for breaking a record," she said. “I feel relieved because I can prove my work to my friends, to my students."She made a previous attempt on May 11, but bad weather forced her to turn back from a point very close to the summit. She then returned last Sunday.“For the summit, it is not just not your ability, team work, I think luck is very important,” she said.An outbreak of the coronavirus among climbers and their guides at the Everest base camp has forced at least three teams to cancel their expeditions. But hundreds of others have pushed through attempting to scale the summit, at a time Nepal is in lockdown battling its worst surge in Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oldest-american-fastest-woman-on-everest-return-safely-101622364166151.html

Report reveals new timeline of infection||Three weeks before China admitted SARS-CoV-2 virus cases, the country might have its first case, Daily Mail reported quoting new findings. These findings are based on an interview of Wuhan University biostatistics professor Yu Chuanhua, given to Chinese medical journal, Health Times. In the interview, the professor talked about one suspected fatality of a patient who fell ill in September 2019 and eventually died.Who is Patient Su?According to Daily Mail, there is a record of a case under the name of Patient Su who was treated at Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan. The patient did not undergo nucleic testing. The data has not been confirmed, the professor said. Going by the building and the street number as found in hospital records, it is believed that the woman lived somewhere n the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, very close to where several bat-related research was taking place. "These include a laboratory run by China’s Centre for Disease Control with the second-highest global levels of biosecurity little more than one mile away, while downtown sites run by Wuhan Institute of Virology are less than three miles away," Daily Mail said.Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsPatient Su's location was also close to a high-speed rail line, which might have played a crucial role in spreading the infection.The screenshots of the details were by mistake published by the medical journal.Yu, according to the report, called up the journalist within two days to retract this information and claimed that the dates had been entered incorrectly and all the other suspected cases before December 8 needed verification.Covid timelineOn December 31, China informed the World Health Organization about a Vitus outbreak in Wuhan. Between December 8 and January 2, 41 people had fallen ill, according to China's official account.A Us intelligence report has recently found that several researchers at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill in November 2019.

A survey by management-side law firm Fisher Phillips earlier this year found that only 9% of the more than 700 employers surveyed said they were considering mandating vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-workers-sue-texas-hospital-over-compulsory-vaccinations-report-101622345462110.html

Sixteen of them had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, while 12 had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.People who had received two doses of Pfizer saw a three-fold reduction in their antibodies against the Indian variant, B.1.617, according to the study, but were still protected."The situation was different with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which induced particularly low levels of antibodies neutralising" the Indian variant, the study said.Patients who had had Covid-19 within the past year and people vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer retained enough antibodies to be protected against the Indian variant, but three to six times less antibodies than against the UK variant, Schwartz said.The study shows that "this variant.. has acquired partial resistance to antibodies," Schwartz said.Since first emerging in late 2019 in China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 has developed several variants, usually named for the places where it first appeared including the so-called South Africa and UK strains.The variant first detected in India appears to be much more transmissible than earlier variations.It has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, according to a World Health Organization report.To try to curb its spread, France and Germany have re-introduced tighter rules on arrivals from affected countries, including the United Kingdom.bc/yad/bpPFIZERASTRAZENECA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-less-effective-but-protects-against-variant-found-in-india-study-101622341779802.html
30-05-2021||World||In Covid aftermath, scientists are concerned about biolab leaks. Here's why||The theory that Covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs.While the evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China is strictly circumstantial, a number of experts want tougher controls on such facilities over fears that accidental leaks could touch off the next pandemic.Here's what you should know.59 TOP FACILITIESThe Wuhan lab belongs to the most secure class, commonly referred to as biosafety level 4, or BSL4.These are built to work safely and securely with the most dangerous bacteria and viruses that can cause serious diseases for which there are no known treatment or vaccines."There are HVAC filtration systems, so that the virus can't escape through exhaust; any waste water that leaves the facility is treated with either chemicals or high temperatures to make sure that there's nothing alive," Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, told AFP.The researchers themselves are highly trained and wear hazmat suits.There are 59 such facilities across the world, according to a report Koblentz co-authored that was released this week."There are no binding international standards for safe, secure, and responsible work on pathogens," the report, called Mapping Maximum Biological Containment Labs Globally, said.ACCIDENTS DO HAPPENAccidents can happen, sometimes at the top tier facilities, and much more frequently at lower rung labs of which there are thousands.Human H1N1 virus -- the same flu that caused the 1918 pandemic -- leaked in 1977 in the Soviet Union and China and spread worldwide.In 2001, a mentally disturbed employee at a US biolab mailed out anthrax spores across the country, killing five people.Two Chinese researchers exposed to SARS in 2004 spread the disease to others, killing one.In 2014, a handful of smallpox vials were uncovered during an Food and Drug Administration office move.Lynn Klotz, a senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the public safety threats posed by such facilities."Human errors constitute over 70 percent of the errors in laboratories," he told AFP, adding that US researchers have to rely on data from Freedom of Information requests to learn of these incidents.GAIN OF FUNCTION CONTROVERSYThere is disagreement between the US government, which funded bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, and some independent scientists, about whether this work was controversial "gain of function" (GOF) research.GOF research entails modifying pathogens to make them more transmissible, deadlier, or better able to evade treatment and vaccines -- all to learn how to fight them better.This field has long been contentious. Debate reached a fever pitch when two research teams in 2011 showed they could make bird flu transmissible between mammals.Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told AFP he was concerned "that it would create a strain of virus that if it infected a laboratory worker could not just kill that laboratory worker... but also cause a pandemic.""The research is not required and does not contribute to the development of drugs or vaccines," added molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, one of the staunchest opponents of this kind of research.In 2014 the US government announced a pause in federal funding for such work, which gave way in 2017 to a framework that would consider each application on a case-by-case basis.But the process has been criticized as lacking transparency and credibility.As late as last year, a nonprofit received funding from the US on research to "predict spillover potential" of bat coronavirus to humans in Wuhan.Questioned by Congress this week, Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health denied this amounted to gain of function research, but Ebright said it clearly does.THE PATH AHEADNone of this means that Covid-19 definitely leaked from a lab -- in fact there is no hard scientific evidence in favor of natural origin or lab accident scenario, said Ebright.But there are certain lines of circumstantial evidence in favor of the latter. For instance, Wuhan is around 1,000 miles north of bat caves that harbor the ancestor virus, well out of the animals' flight range.Scientists from Wuhan were however known to be carrying out routine trips to those caves to take samples.Alina Chan, a molecular biologist from the Broad Institute, said there were no signs of risky pathogen research dying down in the wake of the pandemic -- in fact "it's possibly expanded."Last year, Chan published research showing that, unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 was not evolving fast when it was first detected in humans -- another piece of circumstantial evidence that could point to lab origin.Chan considers herself a "fence-sitter" on the competing hypotheses, but does not favor banning risky research, fearing it would then go underground.One solution "might just be as simple as moving these research institutes out into extremely remote areas...where you have to quarantine for two weeks before we re-enter in human society," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-covid-aftermath-scientists-are-concerned-about-biolab-leaks-here-s-why-101622338361938.html

Belarusian authorities scrambled a fighter jet and flagged what turned out to be a false bomb alert to force the plane to land, then detained Roman Protasevich, a journalist who was on board.Psaki said the US, with the EU and other allies, was preparing a list of targeted sanctions against key members of Lukashenko’s government “associated with abuses of human rights and corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election, and the events of May 23”.The White House also issued a “Do Not Travel” warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American passenger planes to “exercise caution” if considering flying over Belarusian airspace.The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aims-targeted-sanctions-at-belarus-after-journalist-held-101622335377391.html

No end in sight. We removed all the plastic yesterday, only to see more of it dumped by the waves overnight," he said.The pellets and waste were packed into green and white polythene sacks and taken away by trucks.An officer leading another team said that in certain parts of the beach the microplastics and charred debris was 60 centimetres (two feet) deep.Local fisherman Peter Fernando, 68, said he had never seen such destruction.The December 2004 Asian tsunami devastated much of the island's coastline and killed an estimated 31,000 people, but only damaged coastal infrastructure.Roman Catholic priest Sujeewa Athukorale said most of his parishioners were fishermen who risked becoming destitute."Their immediate need is to be allowed to go back to the sea," he said."There are 4,500 fishing families in my parish alone."- Mangroves threatened -Fisherman Lakshan Fernando, 30, said people feared the plastic waste could destroy mangroves as well as the corals where fish breed in the shallow water."No one is able to say how long we will have the adverse effects of this pollution," Fernando told AFP."It could take a few years or a few decades, but in the meantime what about our livelihoods?"An oil leak from the vessel, said to be carrying 278 tonnes of bunker oil and 50 tonnes of gasoil, would increase the risk of devastation.Much of the ship's cargo, including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, lubricants and other chemicals, appeared to have been destroyed in the fire, officials said.The X-Press Pearl caught fire as it waited to enter Colombo harbour and remains anchored just outside the port.An international salvage operation is led by the Dutch company SMIT, which has sent specialist fire-fighting tugs. India has sent coastguard vessels to help Sri Lanka's navy.SMIT was also involved in dousing a burning oil tanker off Sri Lanka's east coast last September after an engine room explosion killed a crew member.The fire on the New Diamond took more than a week to put out and left a 40-kilometre (25-mile) long oil spill. Sri Lanka has demanded the owners pay $17 million for the clean-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-burns-as-lanka-facing-worst-beach-pollution-in-its-history-101622333859829.html

Police said eight of the 10 were shot dead. Earlier in the day, Colombian President Iván Duque announced the deployment of military forces to the city of Cali to quell the protests.“This deployment will almost triple our capacity throughout the province in less than 24 hours, ensuring assistance in nerve centres where we have seen acts of vandalism, violence and low-intensity urban terrorism,” said the president, speaking from Cali.Juliette de Rivero, representative in Colombia of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called for an end to violence, also citing cases of “civilians shooting” in Cali.Protests were held in other parts as well as the country marked a month since the start of the largest protests in the country decades. The protests erupted when Duque proposed a wide-ranging tax increase, but continued even after he backed off, transformed into a general outcry against growing poverty and inequality in a country where the unemployment rate doubled over the past year of pandemic.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Colombia’s vice-president Marta Lucia Ramirez in Washington on Friday.Blinken “expressed his concern and condolences for the loss of life during recent protests in Colombia and reiterated the unquestionable right of citizens to protest peacefully”, according to spokesman Ned Price.Colombia’s finance ministry estimates protests and roadblocks have cost the country $2.68 billion, with the roadblocks leading to shortages of food and other supplies, boosting prices, and disrupting operations in the country’s main seaport as well as for hundreds of companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-killed-in-colombia-anti-govt-protests-101622323868264.html

In one more photos, he is seen showing bruises on his arm. It is not clear if Antigua Newsroom took the photos or these were accessed via Mehul Choksi’s legal team. To be sure, Choksi’s lawyers have alleged the businessman was abducted from Antigua, whose citizenship he holds, taken to Dominica where he was arrested to facilitate his repatriation to India.First pictures emerge of Mehul Choksi behind bars pic.twitter.com/UvelfTXKx8Choksi faces multiple charges of embezzling funds from the state-owned Punjab National Bank in India; the fraud is worth some ₹13,500-crore. He had acquired citizenship of Antigua under its Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017, weeks before investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation started.Also Read: Choksi’s 1st photo in 3 yrs emerges as next stop bursts a controversy in AntiguaChoksi’s legal team promptly filed a habeas corpus plea in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court that has barred authorities from removing him from the country until further orders. The court will take up the case on June 2. Choksi was released from police custody on Friday following the court order and has been moved to a quarantine facilityIn the only official statement that had emerged from Dominica’s capital Roseau before the court’s interim ruling, the authorities had made it clear that they were checking Choksi’s citizenship papers and were likely to send him back to Antigua 100 nautical miles away. The statement was interpreted to end speculation that Dominica could deport Choksi to India, prompted in part due to Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne’s statement that he didn’t want Choksi back.Also read: Antiguan oppn party hits out at PM Browne, seeks to treat Choksi as citizen“We asked them (Dominica) not to repatriate him to Antigua. He needs to return to India where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him”, Browne told journalists soon after Mehul Choksi turned up on the Dominican coast.That remark also exposed PM Browne to sharp attacks from the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP), which, according to reports in Antigua Newsroom, insisted that since Choksi was an Antiguan citizen, he was entitled to due process and should be treated according to the rule of law.Browne hit back at the UPP. “After mischievously accusing my administration of harbouring Mehul Choksi, who has an Interpol Red Notice, they are now seeking to sanitise this fugitive to get campaign funding...There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship.”Referring to Browne’s statement, the UPP said: “The statement is both irresponsible and frightening. It is not for the prime minister to decide who is entitled to the protection of the constitution.” Choksi’s lawyers have said that their client enjoys legal protection as a citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-image-of-fugitive-mehul-choksi-in-custody-of-dominica-police-released-101622312519295.html

Officers from the detective department of the Kolkata Police, while investigating the case, found that none of the machines located in the New Market, Jadavpur and Cossipore police station areas were forcibly broken. The hackers made the machines dispense cash by connecting to the bank’s server using a small device that was apparently attached to cables in the ATM, said Murlidhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime). Experts told the police that end-to-end encryption in the communication between the ATM terminal and bank’s server was broken. Similar crimes took place in Delhi in the past. A specific type of ATM, that was not upgraded to stop such crimes, was hacked, Sharma added. Three cases were registered by the bank on May 25 and 28. The police are looking for the criminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hackers-steal-rs-39-6-lakh-from-3-atms-of-bank-in-kolkata-101622396502287.html
30-05-2021||India||Bengal BJP leader Mukul Roy’s son calls for self-criticism after poll defeat||Self-criticism is more necessary than criticizing a government elected by people, Subhranshu Roy, son of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president and Bengal leader Mukul Roy, has said on his social media page causing embarrassment for the party. Though he did not name any party or state, social media users took it as an obvious reference to Bengal. While Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district in the recent assembly polls, his son was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in North 24 Parganas district. Both were earlier with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Mukul Roy, who was the TMC’s founder member and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP in 2017. His son switched sides two years later. Mukul Roy was the BJP’s election strategist in the 2019 Bengal Lok Sabha polls in which the saffron camp bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats. The scenario changed in the assembly polls with the TMC winning 213 of the state’s 294 seats against the BJP’s 77. The main opposition party had sworn to win more than 200 seats and oust the Mamata Banerjee government. With many TMC turncoats now trying to return to the old party, Subhranshu Roy’s post raised speculations. He avoided the media saying his mother was admitted in hospital. Mukul Roy, too, was in the hospital. The post, which Roy wrote on Saturday night, went unnoticed till Sunday afternoon. “Someone can express a personal opinion. BJP’s policies are not decided by Facebook posts,” said the party’s state president Dilip Ghosh. TMC leaders said the young leader had said the right thing. “He often shows signs of inexperience but he has said something right. Since he is Mukul Roy’s son we have affection for him but it is Mamata Banerjee who decides whether deserters can return to the party or not,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. An accused in the Narada sting operation case being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Mukul Roy resigned from the TMC in September 2017. He was suspended for six years for anti-party activities. He also resigned from the Rajya Sabha in October, 2017. He joined the BJP in November that year. In September 2020, Roy was made national vice-president of the BJP. Subhranshu Roy joined the BJP in May 2019. The state assembly has 294 seats but polls were held in 292 as two candidates died of Covid-19 before elections were held. The BJP won 77 seats but its tally came down to 75 as two of its winning candidates resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-leader-mukul-roy-s-son-calls-for-self-criticism-after-poll-defeat-101622395842393.html
30-05-2021||India||Indian jet in Dominica for Choksi, he went out of Antigua with girlfriend: Gaston Browne||India seems to be going all out as it has sent a private jet to get Mehul Choksi repatriated directly from Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has told the local media there. Browne also claimed that Choksi may have taken his girlfriend to Dominica on a romantic trip and got caught. A Bombardier Global 5,000 jet of Qatar Executive had mysteriously landed at Dominica’s Douglas Charles airport on Saturday. It’s publicly accessible flight path shows that it took off from New Delhi on May 28 and reached Dominica via Madrid. PM Browne, who has been vocal about not accepting Choksi back in his country, where he is a citizen, said, “My understanding is that [the] Indian government has sent certain documentation from courts in India to confirm that Choksi is indeed a fugitive”. These documents, Browne added, will be utilised in the court case in Dominica, where a judge is hearing the matter and has put a stay on repatriation till Wednesday. “Indian government seems to be going all out to make sure he is repatriated to India to stand trial,” Browne told a FM channel in Antigua. The interview was posted by Antigua Newsroom on its website. On the circumstances under which Choksi reached Dominica, Browne said – “The information that we are getting is that Mehul Choksi may have taken his girlfriend to Dominica probably to have dinner or have a good time and so on and got caught. That would have been a monumental error because in Antigua he is a citizen, we could not deport him...,” he said. Indian officials were tight-lipped about the team which has flown to Dominica along with the documents, but they said this was their “window of opportunity” to bring Choksi to India because once he reaches Antigua, he will have citizenship rights and the extradition case can linger on for years. Officials in New Delhi also confirmed to HT that Choksi’s Indian citizenship was never cancelled, which gives an edge to India before Dominica to seek his deportation. Choksi’s mysterious disappearance from Antigua last Sunday and detention in Dominica, island nation about 101 nautical miles away, has caused a political storm in Antigua, where he is a citizen. Antiguan PM Browne on Saturday accused the country’s key opposition party -- United Progressive Party (UPP) of taking funds from Mehul Choksi for its political campaigns. The UPP had issued a statement on Saturday in favour of Choksi saying that he should get his constitutional and legal rights as a citizen of Antigua. Browne had hit back at UPP saying-- “After mischievously accusing my administration of harbouring Mehul Choksi, who has an Interpol Red Notice, they are now seeking to sanitise this fugitive to get campaign funding...There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship.” Earlier, on Saturday, Antigua Newsroom had released Mehul Choksi’s pictures while in custody of Dominica police. In one of the photos, he is seen standing behind bars with his left eye swollen while another photo showed bruises on his arm. Choksi’s lawyers Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal had alleged the businessman was abducted from Antigua and tortured on the way to Dominica and in custody. He had gone missing from Antigua last Sunday following which a manhunt had begun in the region. To be sure, Choksi is currently out of police custody and has been placed at a quarantine facility in Roseau, where he is allowed to meet his lawyers. Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said – “All these theories of Mehul Choksi fleeing from Antigua voluntarily are opposed to common sense. Firstly, he has a stay in his favour in Antigua. Secondly, I have been informed that his passport is in Antigua only, so nobody will try to escape without having his passport in his pocket. Brutal marks on body and this passport factor now establish abduction claims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-jet-in-dominica-for-choksi-he-went-out-of-antigua-with-girlfriend-gaston-browne-101622394282382.html

We need to wait for evidence to emerge to say conclusively about the origin of the virus."Speaking about the country's vaccination strategy, he said that all efforts have to be made to obtain the vaccines."Now that vaccine doses are not available, we have opened up the purchases from other foreign manufacturers for approved vaccines. We are open to buying these vaccines from other countries as well and we have also invested in increasing the capacity of the vaccines of indigenous vaccines manufacturers," Gangakhedkar said.He also said that it would be 'prudent' to focus on vaccinating people in the 45 age group, given that it will take a while to get adequate doses."Given that it will take some time to get adequate doses, it would be prudent to first focus on the people who fall in the bracket of 45 years of age. We know that the second wave is on a decline. We should utilise this opportunity to reduce the challenge that a potential third wave can pose to healthcare infrastructure. If we can do that in a massive way I am sure we will be able to make a huge difference with respect to the challenges that will be thrown to the health infrastructure," he added.On being asked how the new dominant B.1.6171.2 variant can be dangerous, this particular mutant might have higher transmission efficiency which means if it has infected one individual then it may infect more individuals then if it was from some other virus that we had this infection.He said in order to prevent this spread, people should follow Covid appropriate behaviour and also get themselves vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-to-indicate-artificial-origin-of-covid-19-ex-icmr-head-scientist-101622393390235.html
30-05-2021||India||Soli Sorabjee inspired me to continue in profession: CJI Ramana||Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Sunday said that eminent jurist Soli Sorabjee was among the many people who inspired him to continue in the legal profession and in his demise the country had lost one of the greatest legal minds and a champion of human rights. Sorabjee, a recipient of Padma Vibhushan who twice served as Attorney General, passed away due to Covid-19 on April 30.Speaking at a virtual event organized in memory of Sorabjee, Justice Ramana recalled meeting him in 1988 to discuss a case involving the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Sorabjee was thorough with facts and after a five-minute briefing, the two questions he asked were the ones posed by the bench the next day.“I thought I had seen a prophet in action….I must admit that he was one of those who inspired me to continue in this profession,” Justice Ramana said, describing Sorabjee as one of the greatest legal minds and champion of human rights who possessed great qualities.Justice UU Lalit of the Supreme Court described Sorabjee as a “great package” who had love for life, particularly his passion for jazz, poetry and literature. “He was the best guardian of the fortress of free speech and expression who excelled in all branches of law,” Justice Lalit said. The fact that a viral infection led to Sorabjee’s end was ironical, said Justice DY Chandrachud, who also spoke at the memorial event hosted by Sorabjee family – wife Zena, daughter Zia and sons Jehangir and Hormazd.Justice Chandrachud said, “If you are in his chamber and you had a (common) cold, you ran the risk of being thrown out and it is so ironical that it was a virus that got him in the end.” In 1998, Sorabjee asked the young Chandrachud whether he was willing to become Additional Solicitor General, which he readily accepted. The same year when the opportunity came to be elevated as a High Court judge, upon Sorabjee’ advice, Justice Chandrachud decided to accept the offer.Other eminent lawyers like Harish Salve, Gopal Subramaniam and S Ganesh who once served as juniors to Sorabjee also spoke on the occasion. Nobody missed out sharing anecdotes about Sorabjee’s court craft, wit, humour and ability to mimic judges. Salve later served as Solicitor General of India when Sorabjee was Attorney General.

The current state-wide lockdown, which was imposed on April 22, was scheduled to end on June 1 at 7am.Also Read: Over 1 million cases, 19K deaths in 29 days in Maharashtra"We are unwillingly extending the lockdown. We are ramping up the health infrastructure. The unlocking will be done in graded manner," the chief minister said addressing the people of the state virtually.Thackeray said that some districts, where Covid-19 cases are rising at a faster pace, will see additional restrictions, and those where positivity rate is less than 10 per cent - like state capital Mumbai - will get some relaxations.Currently, people can’t step out unless they need medical attention, or are working in an essential sector, or want to buy essential commodities, and that too only between 7am and 11am. But now, in areas where Covid-19 cases are declining, shops selling essential commodities will be allowed to remain open from 7am to 2pm.Thackeray acknowledged the fact that daily cases of Covid-19 have gone down significantly in Maharashtra over the last few days but added that the number is still near the peak of the first wave. "The drop in Covid-19 cases is still not as expected," he said.He also appealed to the political parties to not pressurise the state government for unlocking certain activities, and urged people to come together and work with the government in fight against the pandemic."Each one of us need to decide to keep our village, tehsil and district free from Covid-19," the chief minister said."The recovery rate and case fatality rate (CFR) is better than that of the peak of the first wave. But the transmission rate of the strain in the second wave is rapid. The time taken for the recovery is more than that in the first wave," Thackeray added.The chief minister also said that the state government has constituted a task force of paediatric doctors as part of preparedness of the potential third wave of Covid-19.During the address, he also talked about Cyclone Tauktae, which wreaked havoc on India's western coast, leaving trail of destruction in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Thackeray said the cyclonic storm intensified the state government's challenge of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. He also listed the steps taken by the state government in view of the cyclonic storm."While fighting Covid-19 pandemic, we distributed 2.74 lakh metric tonnes of food grain, disbursed ₹155 crore to construction worker and ₹34.42 lakh to domestic workers," the chief minister said.It was widely expected that the state government will extend the lockdown due to the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in about a dozen districts. State health minister Rajesh Tope too had said there was no chance of lifting the lockdown.The districts with high weekly average positivity rate include Sindhudurga, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Buldhana, Satara, Sangli, Osmanabad, Amravati and Beed.Maharashtra is among the six states which have more than one lakh active cases of Covid-19, according to Union health ministry. While Karnataka has the highest number of active cases, Maharashtra is at number 2.On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 18,600 fresh cases of Covid-19. This is the lowest daily tally of infection since March 16, when the state recorded 17,864 cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-extends-maharashtra-curbs-by-15-days-pitches-for-covid-free-villages-101622386958114.html

30-05-2021||India||Monsoon onset delayed, expected to hit Kerala on June 3: IMD||Monsoon is likely to hit India’s southwestern coast around June 3 instead of the regular onset date of June 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday. The southwest monsoon was earlier expected to hit Kerala on May 31, but the IMD said that a cyclonic circulation along the Karnataka coast is halting its progress.“The southwesterly winds could strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in likely enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala. Hence the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3,” the IMD director general M Mohapatra was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The onset of monsoon depends on three parameters. If 60% of these weather stations situated in Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudlu and Mangalore report rainfall of 2.5 millimetres or more for two days in a row the onset of monsoon of Kerala will be declared on the second day, according to Mohapatra.The above conditions have to be supplemented by the wind speed, depth of westerlies and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR). The IMD chief said that the depth of the westerlies is not as much as the weather department had earlier expected and the rainfall parameters are also unfulfilled to declare onset of monsoon over Kerala.The IMD last month said that India will receive normal rainfall this monsoon. Monsoon in India is vital for irrigation and its agriculture-based economy as farmers depend upon annual June-September rains to grow rice, corn, cane, cotton and soybeans. A normal monsoon could lead to higher agricultural outputs.Private weather forecasting agency Skymet Weather has said that the onset of monsoon is likely to be mild and the conditions are favourable for its further advancement towards the other parts of the southern peninsula and also expected timely progress over northeast India.The onset of monsoon over Kerala normally is June 1 which marks the beginning of the four-month rainfall season for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-onset-delayed-expected-to-hit-kerala-on-june-3-imd-101622387832017.html

He has a positive approach towards Maharashtra but his powers are being continuously curtailed," Chavan said, though he did not elaborate on his assertion."The price of petrol had reached ₹100 per lite. Some 12.21 core people have lost their jobs. The per capita income of Bangladesh is now higher than that of India. The policies of the Centre have devastated the country," the former Maharashtra chief minister claimed.Chavan alleged the Centre had a discriminatory attitude towards Maharashtra on all fronts, including aid and GST compensation.He also attacked the BJP over the Maratha quota issue, and asked the ruling party at the Centre to come up with a solution after the Supreme Court, on May 5, struck down a state law granting reservations in jobs and education to the community.He congratulated BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sambhaji Chhatrapati for trying to meet leaders of all parties to evolve a consensus on the Maratha quota issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-maharashtra-cm-lashes-out-at-centre-but-praises-minister-nitin-gadkari-101622387102265.html

Addressing party workers on the government’s seventh anniversary in power at the Centre, Nadda said the opposition parties went into quarantine; while his party colleagues carried out relief work amid the Coronavirus pandemic. The opposition leaders mocked the vaccines developed indigenously and dubbed them as BJP vaccines, Nadda said, accusing them of creating doubts about the efficacy of the vaccines.

They said the vaccines are being given without trials and peoples’ lives are being put to risk. …It is a BJP vaccine. All kinds of questions and doubts were being raised and the same people are now shouting for vaccines today,” Nadda said. Even though the BJP has decided not to hold any public events to mark the anniversary, the BJP chief said all party MPs, ministers and MLAs will serve people in at least two villages following Covid-19 protocols and lockdown guidelines to mark the occasion. Nadda said party workers in one lakh villages and hamlets are serving the needy to mark the occasion. “BJP workers are mature and work with sensitivity. They should continue working with sadhana (dedication). India is the only country where apart from the government; society too played a role in combating the pandemic. The BJP is the only party that took up work for so long and on such a large-scale and created a record for being the only party that work and offered relief…This will never go unregistered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-work-will-not-go-unnoticed-says-jp-nadda-101622379940751.html

He also alleged the presence of a campaign against ancient Indian science of Ayurveda. The Yoga guru who has been in a running feud with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) also claimed that he didn’t opt for vaccination since he has been enjoying the dual protection of yoga and Ayurveda for several years now.“For decades, I have been practicing yoga-Ayurveda doses so I didn’t feel the need to get vaccinated. Over 100 crore people of India as well as in foreign countries are in reach of these ancient therapies. In the coming time, Ayurveda will be globally accepted. A section of society is deliberately ignoring or deeming it inferior in comparison to allopathy,” said Swami Ramdev.Ram Dev had earlier raised 25 questions on the efficacy of modern medicine and the IMA Uttarakhand chapter threatened him with a ₹1000 crore defamation case and Delhi Medical Association filed a police complaint against the yoga guru. It all started a couple of weeks ago with a video, where Ramdev was seen calling allopathy a ‘stupid science’ and alleging that thousands of doctors had died despite taking the vaccine to prevent Covid-19 infection. He later retracted those comments following the IMA and Union health minister’s objections.However, Swami Ramdev has continued to question modern medicine. On Sunday he said Ayurvdic surgeons should also get permission to perform surgeries as it was a “skill” and “not a science”.“Yoga, Ayurveda ingredients, Coronil and age-old Indian usage of herbs and dietary habits have been saving many lives. Allopathy treatment on the other side has been relying on antibiotics and steroids, harmful effects of which are now visible. Yoga and Ayurveda can cure all ailments and Patanjali Yogpeeth is ready to give proof in this regard. Ayurveda needs to be given due respect and recognition by modern science,” Swami Ramdev said.He however, qualified his stance by claiming he respected allopathy for its contributions, particularly in case of emergency medical treatments but it was not reciprocated by the allopathic branch of medicine.IMA Uttarakhand general secretary Dr Ajay Khanna said the association was willing to reply to Ramdev’s questions and claims but it should be done face to face in an open panel discussion in presence of media. He added that Ramdev’s statements were only promoting vaccine hesitancy.“The way Ramdev is slamming vaccination is quite dangerous as it will add to vaccination hesitancy in the country. World over vaccination drives are being held and here we are debating and slamming it. Ramdev has to realise the consequences his statements will have on the battle against Covid and vaccination drive. We have to end vaccination hesitancy, not add to it,” he said.Dr Sanjay Shah, vice president Uttarakhand chapter of Association of Physicians of India agreed that Ramdev's statements will only promote vaccine hesitancy. "Globallyy, billions of people have been vaccinated, modern science is based on rational scientific medicine and it's unfair to create undue comparisons between Ayurveda and modern science. Such statements will create vaccine hesitancy and can have dangerous consequences in the coming time " Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-again-questions-covid-19-vaccines-says-he-s-protected-by-yoga-ayurveda-101622376819966.html

Recently 15 contracts worth more than ₹16,000 crore have been concluded under normal schemes of procurement and 44 contracts worth ₹5,000 crore have been concluded in 2020-21 under emergency procurements," Gen Naravane said."A number of capital acquisition proposals too are underway concurrently," the Chief of Army Staff said.He was replying to a question on whether the much-needed modernisation of the Army has been impacted due to the need for allocation of greater resources to keep a large number of troops for guarding the LAC in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere in the wake of the standoff since last one year."We are not facing any difficulty," he said, referring to the modernisation drive.In February, the government allocated ₹ ₹4.78 lakh crore for the defence budget for 2021-22. Out of the total allocation, ₹1,35,060 crore was set aside for capital expenditure that includes purchasing new weapons, aircraft, warships and other military hardware.The capital outlay for 2021-22 is an increase of 18.75 percent compared to last year's allocation of ₹1,13,734 crore.In the last few years, military experts have been pitching for rapid modernisation of the Indian armed forces to effectively deal with China's increasing assertiveness.It has been more than a year since the military standoff between the two sides erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5 during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years.They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong lake area while negotiations for similar steps at other points remained deadlocked.Gen Naravane said that the Indian Army is currently holding onto all important areas in the high-altitude region and it has adequate personnel in the form of "reserves" to react to any contingencies.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.The ties between the two countries came under severe strain after the deadly clashes at the Galwan valley following which both sides rushed in thousands of additional troops as well as battle tanks and other large weapons to the region.Nine months after the military standoff at multiple friction points, both sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong lake in February as part of an agreement reached following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides have held 11 rounds of military talks to ensure disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points. Both the militaries are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modernisation-of-indian-army-well-on-course-army-chief-gen-mm-naravane-101622372942153.html

It also recommends restriction on entry of visitor’s vehicle, without authorized pass, on Dr Rajendra Prasad and Maulana Azad roads during office hours owing to the “significant overall impact on road network due to Central Vista development/redevelopment in the horizon year 2026.”“Ashoka road & Shershah road will require immediate upgrade to 8 lanes... to cater [to the] future traffic demand and provide desired LOS C in 2026. Akbar road, Rafi Marg & Janpath will [be] required to be upgraded to 6 lanes... in [the] year 2026. Akbar road will be required to upgrade to 8 lanes... in [the] year 2039. Dr Rajendra Prasad road will require 4 lanes... in [the] year 2031,” the report says.The Central Vista project includes construction of a new Parliament, Prime Minister and vice-president’s residences, a central secretariat and several other buildings. Once complete, the government employee population in the area is expected to increase by 10-15% from 57,000 currently. The Central Public Works Department recently said the new buildings will have parking for at least 16,000 cars and the new service roads will ensure smooth flow of traffic on main roads.The traffic impact assessment report also notes that India Gate road, Motilal Nehru road, Red Cross road, Raisina road and Mansingh road will have no impact due to the project.The forecasted traffic on the road network consists of two main components, the first is routine traffic growth projected to grow annually at 3% between 2020 and 2025, 2.5% between 2025 and 2030 and 2% thereafter, the report says. The second component is of additional traffic generated due to the development of common secretariat & parliament house and employee traffic.“The pedestrian count survey has shown that approximately 22,500 people visit C- Hexagon road & Rajpath show around 35,000 on weekend[s]. The weekday traffic is supposed to be lower than the weekend demand. The tourist traffic is estimated at 25,000 on weekday[s] and 50,000 people on the weekend. To assess the impact on the overall traffic it is assumed that around 10% tourists will visit the CV during the peak hour observed on the roads during office hours,” the report notes.“Based on the above assumptions it is expected that approximately 2,500 tourists will visit the Central Vista Avenue. The total people approaching the site by road will be 30% of the total tourists. It is also important to note that the tourists will travel in groups and hence the number of vehicles on the road will not increase proportionately. We have assumed that the tourists travel in a group of 2.5. Hence the total number of resulting cars on the road will be approximately 300,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-delhi-roads-will-need-to-expand-due-to-central-vista-project-report-101622369919938.html

The SIT has also demanded that Nath produces to pen drive that he mentioned during an online press meet on May 21, ANI further reported.Nath's remarks about the 2019 scandal set off a political storm in Madhya Pradesh with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing him of impropriety.The honey trap scandal involves blackmailing of some politicians and bureaucrats and politicians in Madhya Pradesh by a gang of five women and a man. The gang members used sex tapes shot without the politicians' and bureaucrats' knowledge.The names of the politicians ensnared in the case have not been made public to date.Nath made the remark when some Congress MLAs raised the issue of FIR against former forest minister and Congress MLA Umang Singhar in a case of suicide of a 40-year-old woman. The Congress leaders accused the BJP-led government in the state of doing dirty politics. Nath said he still had a pen drive of the honey trap scandal but that he believed in doing decent politics.The BJP lashed out at the former chief minister with its state president VD Sharma saying if Nath had proof (when he was the chief minister) against any politician or officer, why did he not take any action."Many people have the pen-drive of honeytrap case, many media people also have it. It was first on pen-drive, the matter went to court much later," said Kamal Nath, responding to the BJP's charges.The 74-year-old politician has been attacking the Madhya Pradesh government over handling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). On Friday, Nath accused the government of hiding the real Covid-19 death figures in the state."I believe that 80 per cent of these bodies were of coronavirus victims, while the state government has put the death toll in thousands even now," the former CM said.As per the state government's bulletin issued on Friday, the Covid-19 fatality count was 7,891.In March 2020, Nath resigned as the state chief minister after several Congress MLAs quit the party and joined the BJP, which then came to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-sends-notice-to-kamal-nath-over-comments-on-2019-honey-trap-case-101622368443747.html

30-05-2021||India||Shiv Sena claims BJP’s social media ‘toolkit’ backfired after LS poll wins||Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut on Sunday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seeking to censure the social media it had once used as its ‘toolkit’ to win two general elections and to spread misinformation. Writing in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ in Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, Raut also said Centre’s stance against social media companies came after Congress effectively launched its own toolkit to expose the NDA government’s alleged mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The social media is an effective medium to run a campaign or tarnish someone’s name. The BJP has been foremost in misusing this medium. They used it for [running] a smear campaign against Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The same toolkit used by the BJP against their opponents has backfired and all attempts are made to ban the social media networks,” Raut wrote.The Central government has asked the social media giants such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to put in place a new mechanism to regulate content and appoint officers liable for compliance under Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. It also asks them to adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification for the purpose of preventing social media abuse. Google, Facebook and WhatsApp have shared the details as mandated under the new guidelines for intermediaries.Raut alleged that any censure on social media would be akin to the 1975-emergency declared by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which curbed all personal liberty.Raut further alleged that the government’s irritation with social media followed Congress party using a Toolkit to attack the government over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in social media. “Here the twitter was effectively used to show the dead bodies floating in the rivers, the vaccination fiasco and others. The BJP has realised that citizens are no longer responding to their misleading and false campaigns and hence wants to rein in the social media networks,” said Raut.He added that this was aptly demonstrated as despite misleading campaigns against the farmers like linking them to Khalistani terrorists or foreign funding, the struggle was still going strong.Raut finally said that twitter had once virtually become the voice of Modi and his government. However, after it took strong actions like permanently suspending actor Kangana Ranaut’s account, there has been resentment in the Modi government about social media networks and plans were afoot to ban them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-claims-bjp-s-social-media-toolkit-backfired-after-ls-poll-wins-101622367221084.html

The conditions will become favourable for onset of the monsoon over southern tip of Kerala on May 31, the IMD's said in its forecast.The date has advanced by a day due to Cyclone Yaas, which started brewing in the Bay of Bengal and lashed India's east coast, the IMD said earlier. The cyclonic storm helped pull the monsoon flow over Arabian sea, it added."Southwest monsoon has further advanced into some more parts of Maldives-Comorin area, southwest and eastcentral Bay of Bengal, most parts of Southeast Bay of Bengal and some parts of westcentral Bay of Bengal," the IMD said in its May 27 forecast.The usual date of the monsoon's arrival in Kerala is June 1. It marks the commencement of four-month rainfall season from June to September.The details of zone wise distribution of rain will be released by the weather department on May 31.

30-05-2021||India||5.22% transgender persons vaccinated till now; misinformation, lack of digital knowledge impeding inoculation: Activists||With just 25,468 (5.22 per cent) transgender persons vaccinated against Covid-19 in India till now, activists said misinformation, lack of documents and digital divide have added to their woes in getting inoculated.According to the 2011 census, there are 4.87 lakh people belonging to the transgender community in India.A total of 8,80,47,053 men and 7,67,64,479 women have been vaccinated, while just 25,468 people in the 'other' category have been inoculated, the CoWIN portal showed.The activists said misinformation, lack of digital knowledge and no government documents are the main reasons behind hesitancy of the community members in getting vaccinated.Transgender activist Pushpa Mai, who is based in Jaipur, said a lot of community members approached her with queries related to vaccination."They were misguided. They were told that taking vaccination will make their health worse. We have explained to them that getting vaccinated can protect them from this deadly disease and they should get vaccinated as soon as possible," Mai said.Shahana, 21, said she had many reservations about the vaccine earlier but the activists dispelled her fears."My friends told me you will die, why do you want to risk your life... but then I asked activists and they told me there is nothing like that and I should get vaccinated as they will give me protection," Shahana, who works as an office assistant, said.Another person from the community who is HIV positive said he is not sure if vaccination is safe for him.Dr Vandana Prasad, a public health professional, said there are no contraindications that people who are HIV positive or have recently undergone surgery can't get vaccinated."There is some misinformation going around that you will die if you take the vaccines. There are some side-effects of the vaccines, including death, but that is a very, very rare event as compared to deaths due to Covid-19. They can speak to their doctors but generally if they are not severely immunocompromised, then they can get the vaccination," she said.Some people from the community are eager to get vaccinated but they do not have the necessary documents.Fifty-year-old Chandni, who earns her living by dancing at weddings and family functions, has been desperate to get vaccinated. Chandni, a diabetic, said she does not have any government documents that are necessary for her to get vaccinated."If I go anywhere to perform I am asked if me or my family members have any symptoms or if I have got vaccinated so it is necessary for me to get vaccinated to remain safe and also to earn my livelihood," she said.Samina (name changed), 44, who earns her livelihood by begging at traffic signals, does have an Aadhaar card but does not own a smartphone and is hesitant to go for walk-in vaccination fearing discrimination."My friend went and she was driven away by the people queuing outside who told her she can't get vaccinated with them. I want to go with an appointment so no one can say that but with no smartphone that is very difficult," she said.Chandni and Samina are now waiting for a special vaccination drive as planned by the government.The Centre had recently asked states to ensure that there was no discrimination against transgender persons at Covid-19 vaccination centres.The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry has also urged the states to conduct awareness drives, especially to reach out to members of the transgender community in different vernaculars to ensure that they are informed and aware of the vaccination process.The ministry has also requested states to organise separate mobile vaccination centres or booths for vaccination of transgender persons such as those taken up in the states of Haryana and Assam.Meera Parida, representing the east region in the National Council for Transgender Persons, said she along with her NGO Sakha is planning to organise a special drive for the community members in Odisha."There were apprehensions and fears among the community members over vaccination but now the situation is improving and we are planning a special drive for the community members," Parida said.NGO Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) executive director Akhila Sivadas said any disease prevention approach requires community involvement."This is particularly true for marginal groups such as transgender, who even in the best of times feel unsupported and unaccepted by mainstream society. It is not possible to ensure vaccine preparedness without engaging the community and encouraging them to be part of the solution and find ways to educate and persuade their peers," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/522-transgender-persons-vaccinated-till-now-misinformation-lack-of-digital-knowledge-impeding-inoculation-say-activists-101622361657009.html
30-05-2021||India||Congress lists 7 ‘criminal wrongdoings’ of Modi govt on its 7th anniversary||The Congress claimed on Sunday that the Narendra Modi government’s seven years in power could be summed up in seven “criminal wrongdoings” by the Centre, including fuelling unemployment and inflation.“In the last seven years, the Modi government has given the country unmeasurable pain. It has been seven years since the country got a failed, useless and mindless government. The country is suffering as unemployment fell to 11.3% in 7 years. Petrol [prices have crossed] ₹100 and mustard oil ₹200 in many provinces. It has proved to be the weakest government in the country in the 73 years,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a press conference on Sunday.The attack by the Congress coincides with the Prime Minister Modi listing resolution of long pending disputes, prioritisation of national security, self-reliance and development works as major achievements of his government’s seven year rule at the Centre during his Mann ki Baat address on Sunday.An unimpressed Congress party also launched a 4 minutes and 36 seconds long video in support of party’s #7YearsofModiMadeDisaster social media campaign to claim that the Modi government was the weakest to step into office in the last 73 years.“The seven years of the Modi government are marked by seven criminal wrong doings,” Surjewala said, while accusing the government of being guilty of bringing upon a financial crisis, triggering unemployment and inflation, attack on farmers, lack of sympathy for the poor and the middle-class, mismanagement of Covid crisis and tampering with national security.Surjewala said the current unemployment rate was the highest in 45 years; per capita income was expected to dip to 5.4%; people were dying due to lack of life-saving drugs, oxygen and hospital beds while the government watched.On the issue of farmers’ protest, the Congress spokesperson alleged that the Modi government was playing with livelihoods to help their “capitalist friends” in the form of the three farm laws.On the national security front, Surjewaala claimed the government had failed in protecting the sovereignty and the borders of the country. “Far from showing the red eye to China, the BJP government could not hold China back from the encroachment within our border in Ladakh,” he said.He also hit out at the government for demonetisation, implementation of GST and its handling of Maoists insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-lists-7-criminal-wrongdoings-of-modi-govt-on-its-7th-anniversary-101622362479312.html

Be grateful to #PMCares for PROMISE of free education; a RIGHT guaranteed by the Constitution/RTE,” he also tweeted.Continuing with his scathing attack, Kishor also pointed to the shortage of hospital beds and oxygen last month at the peak of Covid-19 second wave in the country. "Thank @PMOIndia for ASSURANCE to be enrolled in Ayushman Bharat that supposedly covers healthcare needs of 50Cr Indians but only FAILED to provide bed/oxygen when needed,” he said.The poll strategist was reacting to a tweet posted by PM Modi stating that several children who lost their parents to Covid-19 will be cared for by the government. "PM-CARES for Children will ensure education & other assistance to children," PM said in the tweet, sharing the government's statement.According to the statement, these measures are meant “to help families maintain a good standard of living". The Centre has also liberalised and enhanced existing schemes to cover families of contractual and casual workers. Under the relief initiative, the government is extending the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) scheme, meant for employment-related deaths, to those who died due to Covid-19.Additionally, the dependent family members of the deceased will be entitled to pension benefits, which would be 90% of the average daily wage drawn by the employee as per the existing norms.Also read: Prashant Kishor wants to quit poll strategising after Mamata, Stalin's big win, says 'have had enough'Earlier this month, the election strategist jabbed the government, saying its attempt to push "falsehood" and "propaganda" in the name of spreading positivity is "disgusting". "In the face of a grieving nation and tragedies unfolding all around us, the continued attempt to push FALSEHOOD and PROPAGANDA in the name of spreading POSITIVITY is disgusting! For being positive we don’t have to become blind propagandist of the Govt," he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-shreds-pm-modi-s-tweet-blames-govt-s-catastrophic-mishandling-101622358102205.html

All of us have worked every moment with dedication in the service of the country…Friends, whatever we have accomplished in these seven years, it has been of the country, of the countrymen.

When India does not compromise on the issues of national security, when the strength of our armed forces increases, we feel that yes, we are on the right path,” he said.The Prime Minister said India has not only fought against the biggest pandemic in a century but also faced natural disasters, including Cyclone Tauktae on the western coast and Cyclone Yaas on the eastern coast, while battling the Covid-19 pandemic.Also watch | ‘Bigger the challenge, India’s resolve to fight it even greater’: PM ModiPM Modi said providing medical grade oxygen to different states during the second wave of Covid-19 was a challenge but the Indian Air Force (IAF), the Indian Railways and scores of tanker drivers ensured that the crucial gas was delivered to those in need on time.

We worked as Team India. Every citizen has tried to take a few steps forward in advancing the country,” he said.There are successes as well as trials, he said but “we have overcome many difficult tests as well, and each time we have all emerged stronger”, he added.

Even big countries were not spared from its devastation. In the midst of this pandemic, India is moving forward with the resolve of service and cooperation.

30-05-2021||India||Worked as Team India to resolve long pending issues: PM Modi in Mann ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said India followed its “own resolve” and not “thoughts and pressures” of other nations and the country’s armed forces gave a “befitting” reply to those who “conspire” against it, inculcating a feeling of pride in the nation.In his monthly radio broadcast, Mann Ki Baat, which coincided with the seventh anniversary of the Modi government in power, the PM said the achievements in these years were an outcome of all having “worked every moment with dedication for the service of the nation.”“Whatever accomplishments have been made during these last seven years belong to the country and the countrymen. We have together experienced many moments of national pride. When we see that now India does not work as per the thoughts and pressures of other nations, but according to its resolve, we feel proud. When we see that India gives a befitting reply to all those who conspire against it, then our self-confidence gets a further boost. When India does not compromise on the issues of national security… when the strength of security forces increases then we think that yes, we are on the right track,” the PM said.The BJP-led NDA government was re-elected in May 2019 with an unprecedented majority of 303 seats.“In the last seven years the nation has resolved many old disputes peacefully and cordially. From the north-east to Kashmir there is a new belief of peace and development,” he said.Sharing the credit for these accomplishments with people, the PM went on to say, “…And have you ever thought how these works that could not be accomplished in decades have been completed in the last seven years… this has been possible because we work like a national team. We work like team India and every citizen has taken steps to help the country advance ahead.”Recounting the achievements of his government, which he said has worked on the principle of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas …”, the PM said he receives letters from villages where electricity has reached after 70 years. “Many say they are now connected to cities via roads… I receive letters and messages from across the nation, recently a family shared a picture of a tap installed under the Jal Jeevan Mission. They captioned the photo, ‘Lifeline of my village’,” the PM said.He referred to the corona pandemic as a challenge and said during the first wave, India fought it with total courage. “This time too, India will be victorious in the fight against Covid-19….Where there are successes, there are also trials. In these 7 years, together we have seen many tough times together but each time we all came out stronger,” the PM said.The corona pandemic is the biggest challenge that has gripped the whole world, including powerful nations and many people have lost their near and dear ones, and not lowering the guard is the only way to succeed, he said.He also interacted with professionals who are on the frontlines of the war against the pandemic and said these warriors have been fighting without worrying about themselves.“In the beginning of the pandemic, there was only one testing lab in the country but today more than 2,500 labs are working. Initially only a few hundred tests could be conducted in a day, now more than 20 lakh tests are being conducted in a day,” the PM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worked-as-team-india-to-resolve-long-pending-issues-pm-modi-in-mann-ki-baat-101622359599311.html

Every woman of the country would be proud of this. Every Indian must be proud,” the Prime Minister said as he introduced her.“Sireesha ji, you are doing an outstanding job.

At the time of the delivery of oxygen express, everything is checked from every point of view—safety, formation, leakage. The Indian Railways has been supportive to me.

30-05-2021||India||Hit by pandemic and electoral setback, BJP to recalibrate strategy||The muted celebrations on May 30 to mark the Bharatiya Janata Party’s seventh year in power at the centre are primarily on account of the death and devastation brought on by the second wave of the corona pandemic, however a slew of electoral upsets, especially in West Bengal, and allegations of governance deficit, have also forced the party to revisit its political strategy, party leaders aware of the development said.The euphoria that followed the delivery of its key promises, the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya; the abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir; and a partial deliverance of the uniform civil code by way of banning Triple Talaq, has been dampened by the accusations of inadequate pandemic response, the leaders acknowledge.The opposition has mocked the government alleging it made a premature declaration of victory in the war against the pandemic. It was also attacked for alleged reliance on non-scientific approaches to deal with Covid-19, allowing Kumbh Mela and focusing on state elections even as the cases had begun to show an upward trend.“I, along with several other people, warned the Centre over the Covid-19 pandemic multiple times. The Centre made fun of us. The Prime Minister declared victory against Covid-19. The problem here is neither the Prime Minister nor the Centre has understood the viral disease till now,” Congress MP, Rahul Gandhi said on Friday.In February, the national office bearers of the BJP passed a resolution commending the government’s Covid-19 response, while the world was “speculating over how India with its vast population and limited healthcare infrastructure” would face the challenge. It claimed it can be “said with pride that India not only defeated Covid under the able, sensitive, committed and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, but also infused in all its citizens the confidence to build an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.”However, during the second wave as the country struggled with rising cases of deaths and infections and staggering inadequacies in essential healthcare, party leaders were left to defend the government’s policies from vaccination to not announcing a nationwide lockdown amid rising public anger.“This has been the most depressing time for the party. The blame for the many deaths was placed at the centre’s doorstep. And the public perception about the government’s abilities changed overnight. So, the party realised that it was time to withdraw from making statements. Even the Prime Minister’s messages have been fewer compared to the last time (first wave),” said a senior party leader, who didn’t wish to be named.Many party leaders also admit that the lapses can have a severe impact on the party’s electoral fortunes. Therefore, for the upcoming elections in five states—Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Goa--the party is recalibrating its strategy to counter an aggressive opposition. Instead of extravagant outreach programmes that have been a key aspect of its politics, the party has opted for restrained messaging.“The party brass has already instructed the cadre not to organise any celebratory events, even though they have been asked to highlight the achievements of the Modi government vis-à-vis getting vaccines, ramping up medical infrastructure and the welfare schemes such as providing 5 kg of food grains free-of-cost to around 80 crore (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) beneficiaries during May and June,” said the functionary quoted above.Party leaders have also been urged not to make desultory comments and refrain from promoting unscientific practices. “The focus has to be on the achievements made in the past seven years, from housing for the poor to social schemes. The idea is not to let the pandemic overshadow the past gains,” said the functionary.Another party leader pointed out that assuaging public anger after the second wave is proving to be a challenge. “When demonetization happened, there was an explanation offered; similarly, there were reasons attributed to protests against legislation such as the farm laws and the citizenship amendment act. However, this time no explanation will cut ice,” he said.To remain visible in the public arena, the party is organising blood donation camps, creating awareness about safe distancing and Covid appropriate behaviour and helping people access medical care.A state unit president who did not wish to be quoted said the party leadership has had to face questions even from its own cadre. “The problem did not spare anyone. In many districts the party has lost dozens of local leaders or their family members. It is natural that there will be some anger and remonstration. We have also instructed our cadre not to politicise the pandemic,” the person said.A few leaders assert that the current turmoil is unlikely to impact the party’s growth in the long term as the insufficiency and weakness in critical areas of health care that were exposed during the second wave cannot be pinned on the central government alone.“The opposition led states, Maharashtra being a prime example, fared no better than the BJP ruled states. It is unfair to say that the failure belongs to the BJP. We admit there were problems, but we ensured that quick amends were made,” said a state level functionary from poll-bound UP.The functionary said the BJP’s failure to win West Bengal has amplified the criticism; “The loss has given the opposition a chance to attack the BJP and to show that the idea of BJP’s invincibility in elections is a myth.”Will the BJP face long-term losses on account of the pandemic fallout? Political commentator Sumanth C Raman says it is unlikely. “In recent times, the quality of governance is not a determining factor in winning elections. In my view, the 2019 victory was not on account of governance and the party has perfected the art of winning elections. It has delinked the process of winning elections from governance. West Bengal was a blow to the invincibility of the party, but it is too soon to write them off,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-by-pandemic-and-electoral-setback-bjp-to-recalibrate-strategy-101622356178879.html

It’s publicly accessible flight path shows that it took off from New Delhi on May 28 and reached Dominica via Madrid.PM Browne, who has been vocal about not accepting Choksi back in his country, where he is a citizen, said, “My understanding is that [the] Indian government has sent certain documentation from courts in India to confirm that Choksi is indeed a fugitive”. These documents, Browne added, will be utilised in the court case in Dominica, where a judge is hearing the matter and has put a stay on repatriation till Wednesday.“Indian government seems to be going all out to make sure he is repatriated to India to stand trial,” Browne told a FM channel in Antigua. The interview was posted by Antigua Newsroom on its website.Indian officials were tight lipped about the team which has flown to Dominica along with the documents, but they said this was their “window of opportunity” to bring Choksi to India because once he reaches Antigua, he will have citizenship rights and the extradition case can linger on for years.Antiguan PM Browne on Saturday accused the country’s key opposition party - United Progressive Party (UPP) of taking funds from Mehul Choksi for its political campaigns.The UPP had issued a statement on Saturday in favour of Choksi saying that he should get his constitutional and legal rights as a citizen of Antigua.Browne had hit back at UPP saying - “After mischievously accusing my administration of harbouring Mehul Choksi, who has an Interpol Red Notice, they are now seeking to sanitise this fugitive to get campaign funding...There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship.”Earlier, on Saturday, Antigua Newsroom had released Mehul Choksi’s pictures while in custody of Dominica police.In one of the photos, he is seen standing behind bars with his left eye swollen while another photo showed bruises on his arm.Choksi’s lawyers Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal had alleged the businessman was abducted from Antigua and tortured on the way to Dominica and in custody.He had gone missing from Antigua last Sunday following which a manhunt had begun in the region.To be sure, Choksi is currently out of police custody and has been placed at a quarantine facility in Roseau, where he is allowed to meet his lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antigua-and-barbuda-pm-says-india-has-sent-jet-to-bring-back-mehul-choksi-101622352578232.html

The picture of the jet was posted on Antigua Newsroom. "My understanding is that Indian government has sent certain documents from courts in India to confirm that he is indeed a fugitive and my understanding is that the documents will be utilised in the court case as you know the judge in Dominica has put a stay on deportation till Wednesday. So Indian government seems to be going all out to make sure he is repatriated to India to stand trial," Browne said to an FM channel.A Bombardier Global 5000 jet of Qatar Executive landed at Dominica’s Douglas Charles airport on Saturday. It’s publicly accessible flight path shows that it took off from New Delhi on May 28 and reached Dominica via Madrid.On Saturday, the first photos of the multi-crore PNB scam-accused were released where he could be seen behind the bars, with an eye swollen, bruises on his arm. These were the first public photos of Choksi in the last three years that he spent in Antigua as a legal citizen after he fled India before the scam surfaced.Also Watch | Mehul Choksi’s 1st photo in 3 yrs; Antigua PM confirms Indian jet in DominicaMehul Choksi was apprehended by Dominica Police on Wednesday after he reportedly on missing on Sunday evening. Since then, he has been in the custody of the Dominica Police. Antigua PM earlier said that he won't accept Choksi back in his country and he wants him to be repatriated straight to India where he is wanted. Dominica court, however, has put a stay on his deportation. The case will be heard again on June 2.Going by Antiguan PM's indication, the Indian government may present some document during the hearing.India does not have a repatriation agreement with Dominica and hence whether he will be deported to India will depend on the government's decision. Dominia's acting police chief Lincoln Corbette earlier said that he will be deported to Antigua and not to India.Choksi's legal team in Dominica, comprising Julian Prevost, Wayne Norde, Cara Shillingford-Marsh, and Wayne Marsh, filed a habeas corpus petition in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court on Friday highlighting that he should be given access to his lawyers, which the court granted.It is not yet clear how Choksi landed at Dominica, 188 km from Antigua, while his car in which he was last seen was found in Antigua. His lawyers have claimed that he was abducted and was severely beaten up.The episode has kicked up a storm in Antigua's internal politics as the prime minister accused the opposition party of receiving funds from Choksi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-repatriation-private-jet-in-dominica-is-from-india-confirms-antigua-pm-101622346573780.html
30-05-2021||India||Pension and enhanced insurance for families who lost earning member to Covid-19||The Union government on Saturday promised pension to families that lost their earning members to Covid-19 and said it had ‘enhanced and liberalized’ the insurance compensation for such families. The government order will be applied retrospectively to cover Covid casualties since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year.“To help families… maintain a good standard of living, benefit of ESIC (Employees State Insurance Corporation) pension scheme for employment related death cases is being extended to even those who have died due to Covid. Dependent family members of such persons will be entitled to the benefit of pension equivalent to 90% of average daily wage drawn by the worker as per the existing norms,” a government statement said.It added that the benefit will be available retrospectively with effect from 24.03.2020 and for all such cases till 24.03.2022.The move comes in addition to the slew of measures that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday for supporting children orphaned by Covid-19.The government also said that insurance benefits under Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme have been enhanced and liberalised to help the families of employees who have lost their lives due to Covid.“The maximum insurance benefit has been increased from ₹ 6 lakh to ₹ 7 lakh. The provision of minimum insurance benefit of ₹ 2.5 lakh has been restored and will apply retrospectively from 15th February 2020 for the next three years,” the government statement said.Making the specific mention of the contractual/ casual workers, the statement said that the earlier clause of continuous employment in only one establishment has been done away with.“Benefit (is) being made available to families of even those employees who may have changed jobs in the last 12 months preceding his death,” the government said, adding that detailed guidelines of these schemes are being issued by the ministry of labour and employment.Speaking to HT, India’s Central labour commissioner DPS Negi said that they are already in touch with states and are seeking the details of all the workers who have lost their lives to Covid.He added that these measures will include many new beneficiaries now due to the retrospective effect.‘Since it is not just the recent deaths, families of workers who have died in the first wave after 24 March last year should also reach out to state governments or central labour commissioner’s office, so they too can avail the benefit of the schemes,” Negi said.A spokesperson from the labour ministry informed HT that the ministry is already working on a detailed notification containing the guidelines, likely to be out by Monday.Earlier on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a slew of measures, from schooling to early career support, to help children orphaned by the pandemic through PM CARES For Children- a special fund created for the purpose. A corpus of ₹10 lakh will be allocated to each of these children from the fund. The PM also assured complete financial support of the education of such children till they turn 18 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pension-and-enhanced-insurance-for-families-who-lost-earning-member-to-covid-101622346697467.html

Members of Mission Shakti groups, Vana Surakshya Samitis, and other community-based organizations will also be trained and equipped with the knowledge to make Odisha a leading state in disaster preparedness with the presence of a “Yodha in every home”.Three persons lost their lives due to cyclone Yaas, which did not inflict any major damages except causing huge amounts of rain in a few coastal districts. Officials and experts credit mass evacuations carried out by Central and state agencies for the low casualty. However, CM Patnaik has demanded that the Centre help the state in creating disaster resilient power infrastructure and a resilient coastal protection framework with storm surge resilient embankments.Meanwhile, the state water resources department has decided to construct a 380 km long saline embankment to ensure minimal erosion in the six coastal districts of the state.Engineer-in-chief of the water resources department, Jyotirmaya Rath said the 380-km-long special embankments will be constructed by packing stones in wire mesh. Initially ₹1,944 crore will be spent for the sea embankment project. The government has estimated to spend a total of ₹6,000 crore on the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-schools-and-colleges-to-teach-disaster-and-pandemic-management-101622344897363.html

30-05-2021||India||Ramdev shares old video of Aamir Khan, throws new challenge to 'medical mafia'||Yoga guru Ramdev on Saturday tweeted an old video of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan's television show 'Satyamev Jayate' and asked if the "medical mafias" have the courage to take on the Bollywood actor. In the video, Aamir Khan can be seen talking with Dr Samit Sharma who explains the price difference between a generic medicine and branded medicine.This comes as Ramdev's latest dig at allopathic doctors amid the ongoing tussle between the yoga guru and the Indian Medical Association that started last Saturday after a video of Ramdev trashing allopathy went viral. The medical association had written to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and consequently, Ramdev withdrew the video, expressing regret. But the two sides are far from burying the hatchet as the IMA sent a legal notice to Patanjali Yogpeeth. Patanjali too is taking the legal route, general secretary Acharya Balkrishna said earlier.इन मेडिकल माफियाओं में हिम्म्त है तो आमिर खान के खिलाफ मोर्चा खोलें-वीडियो साभार-स्टार प्लस pic.twitter.com/ZpNT8CSohDIn the video that Ramdev tweeted on Saturday, Dr Samit Sharma says the original price of medicines is way lower than the market price. "More than 40 crore people can't afford two square meals a day. Can they buy medicines at 50 per cent higher price?" he says."That's why many people remain deprived of medicines," Aamir Khan can be heard saying.The video is from 2012 when the television show, which ran till 2014, debuted. The episode from where the video was taken deals with generic medicine and the branding of medicine. "A specific blood cancer medicine which lasts for a month costs ₹1.25 lakh. But the generic medicine costs around ₹10,000, including all costs," Dr Sharma says.Indian Medical association national chief Dr JA Jayalal has recently said that doctors and their associations do not have anything against Ramdev, but as he has many followers, his comments on Covid-19 can discourage people from getting vaccinated. Dr Jayalal said IMA will withdraw its complaint and the legal notice once Ramdev withdraws his disparaging comments against modern medicine in its entirety. While the Uttarkhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association challenged experts from Patanjali Yogpeeth to a televised debate on allopathy, a fresh complaint against Ramdev was filed by the West Bengal chapter of the Indian Medical Association. The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association has announced a nationwide protest against Ramdev's remarks on June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-shares-old-video-of-aamir-khan-throws-new-challenge-to-medical-mafia-101622340212913.html

Some reached out to the district’s police chief.Police said a case of cruelty was registered under various provisions including section 429 of the Indian Penal Code and section 11 (1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.The 1960-vintage special law to deter cruelty to animals prescribes a fine of ₹10-50 for the first offence of cruelty to animals, and for a repeat offence within three years of the first, a fine of ₹25-100 and up to 3 months jail.Section 429 of the penal code, which prescribes the punishment for mischief by killing or maiming any animal, provides for a jail sentence of up to a maximum of five years.It was on account of this section in the FIR that Babula Singh was remanded in judicial custody by a judge.Inspector Rakesh Tripathy at the Pattamundai police station said Babula Singh told the police that he was angry that the dog had killed two of his roosters.Earlier this month, a retired bank official in Bhubaneswar was arrested by police on charges of animal cruelty after a video clip emerged in which he was seen throwing three kittens, which had entered his house, in front of street dogs. The dogs killed the kittens.The accused, identified by the police as a retired bank official Prahallad Behera, was arrested on charges of animal crueltyIn May 2020, a pregnant dog was mercilessly beaten to death by a woman in Bhubaneswar. Despite all attempts, she could not be saved and her two premature puppies who were delivered after surgery also succumbed later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-man-hacks-dog-to-death-arrested-after-gruesome-video-goes-viral-101622312897923.html
30-05-2021||India||Positivity rate declines, but Covid surge continues in rural Odisha||Even as Odisha was witnessing a decline in the test positivity rate, the rural Covid surge that health experts and state government had feared all along might be happening across the state.On Saturday, the test positivity rate (TPR) in Odisha dropped to 14.7% and the state reported 7,188 new infections from over 10,000 a couple of days ago, according to the state health department data. “We are on a better position as TPR is declining. There is little cause for worry now,” said director of public health Niranjan Mishra.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19However, experts attributed fewer new cases to declining number of tests. From over 67,000 tests on May 22, the total number of tests dropped to a little over 48,000 on May 28, data suggests. “Isn’t the state government’s celebration a little too premature?” asked Gouranga Mohapatra, state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, a public health campaign. “If the government tests nearly 100,000 a day, we would have at least 20,000 cases a day. The government is simply not testing enough in rural Odisha, where the surge is happening,” Mohapatra added.As per state health department’s statistics, around 55% of the 400,000 odd positive cases since April 1 this year are from rural areas. While around 51% of the total cases were from rural areas in April, it climbed up to 57% in May.In Dhenkanal district, which is clocking TPR of around 37%, the highest in Odisha over the past one week, 96 people in Barsinga village of Hindol block tested positive after attending a community feast. Similarly, in Jaypur Kateni village of Parjang block in the district, 82 tested positive. In Mundideuli village of Kamakhyanagar block, 52 tested positive.“We have declared all these villages as containment zones keeping with our policy of labelling any village with more than 10 positive cases. In rural areas, surveillance by police is not possible during lockdown due to lack of manpower. When people come in contact with positive cases in marriage feasts, dozens are getting infected. Marriage feasts have become superspreader events in our district,” said Dhenkanal district collector Bhumesh Behera.While the Covid surge in rural areas continues, cyclone Yaas might have made things worse for the cyclone-affected districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur district, experts said.In coastal Jagatsinghpur, which was affected by the cyclone early this week, three villages of Gadaharispur panchayat under Erasama block were declared as containment zone till June 4.Erasama block development officer Kailash Behera said though the administration had identified 32 designated shelters with a capacity of 1,000 persons in the block, at least 8,000 people took shelter in 150 more buildings the night before the cyclone struck the Odisha coast.“Scared of the cyclone hitting the district, those people ran into any pucca building including anganwadi centre in the area on Tuesday evening. No one knows if any of them followed Covid protocols,” said Behera. Soon after the cyclone, 14 persons, including the panchayat executive officer and the gram rozgar sevak who took part in the evacuation process, tested positive for Covid-19.In cyclone-affected Kendrapara district, at least 13 villages were declared containment zones after 550 persons tested positive in two days. In Balasore district, panchayati raj functionaries said the number of positive persons is likely to go up in next few days.Also read: Odisha man hacks dog to death; arrested after gruesome video goes viralNibedita Nayak, sarpanch of Baripada grampanchayat in Bahanaga block, where cyclone Yaas made the landfall, said many people in the villages were showing Covid symptoms. “As many villages are waterloddged and people are taking shelter in pucca buildings or in someone else’s house, Covid protocols are difficult to follow. I expect cases to explode in next few days once tests rise,” said Nayak.Health experts said cyclone-affected districts are likely to report more positive cases in next few weeks due to crowding of shelters. “Balasore, which has been consistently reporting over 30% positivity over the last month, has seen fewer tests after Yaas struck Odishs coast. Same is the case with Bhadrak district, which is now reporting over 36% positivity over last week. From 4,400-odd tests before the cyclone, Balasore is now testing less than one third of it. Bhadrak’s numbers are down by over 75% from its pre-cyclone numbers of over 2,500. Once the testing in these two districts reaches pre-cyclone level, they would report much higher cases,” said Sarit Rout of Public Health Foundation of India.Gouranga Mohapatra of Janaswasthya Abhiyan said the rural surge of Covid would continue to be headache for Odisha considering the lack of doctors in many primary health centres. “The government erred in not starting quarantine centres in villages where home isolation is practically impossible due to lack of space. The testing strategy is also flawed as only symptomatic people are being tested while other people in the family who are exposed to the symptomatic person are not tested. This would result in the spread of virus go undetected,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/positivity-rate-declines-but-covid-surge-continues-in-rural-odisha-101622312792701.html
30-05-2021||India||PM CARES to help kids orphaned due to Covid||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced a slew of measures to help children orphaned by the pandemic as he chaired a meeting on Covid relief.Launching a specially designed scheme named PM CARES For Children, Modi said a corpus of ₹10 lakh will be allocated to each of these children from the PM CARES fund. The PM also assured assistance in the education of such children.“PM CARES will contribute… to create a corpus of ₹10 lakh for each child… This corpus will be used to give a monthly financial support/ stipend from 18 years of their age, for the next five years … and on reaching the age of 23 years, he or she will get the corpus amount as one lump-sum for personal and professional use,” a statement from the Prime Minister’s office said.According to the government, at least 577 children were orphaned due to the second wave of Covid in India from April 1 to May 25.The statement said children less than 11 years of age will be given admission in the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as day scholars and the fees, expenditure on uniform, text books and notebooks will be borne by the PM CARES fund. For children 11 to 18 years of age, the statement added they can take admission in any central government residential school like Sainik School, Navodaya Vidyalaya, etc.“In case the child’s education is to be continued under the care of Guardian/ grandparents/ extended family, then he or she will be given admission in the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school... and PM Cares will pay for the expenditure…,” the statement added.Earlier on May 19, Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Modi urging him to provide free education in Navodaya Vidyalayas to children whose parents died of Covid-19.“I feel that as a nation, we owe it to them, to give them hope for a robust future after the unimaginable tragedy that has befallen them,” she wrote.Regarding the higher education of these children, the PM’s office said that the government will assist them in easily obtaining study loans, the interest on which will be paid from the PM CARES fund.It also added that as an alternative, scholarship equivalent to the course fees for undergraduate/vocational courses will be provided to such children under central or state government schemes. “For children who are not eligible under the existing scholarship schemes, PM CARES will provide an equivalent scholarship,” the statement said.At the meeting, it was also decided that all such children will be enrolled as beneficiaries under the Ayushman Bharat Scheme (PM-JAY) with a health insurance cover of ₹5 lakh, the premium of which will be paid from the PM CARES fund till they reach 18 years of age.Union child and women development minister Smriti Irani said the announcement will ensure such children are not deprived of any opportunity and secure their future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cares-to-help-children-orphaned-due-to-covid-101622312732729.html

After a protracted discussion on the issue of tax exemptions at the GST Council meeting on Friday, the apex federal body decided to form a committee to examine the merits of waivers on individual items.According to its terms of reference, the GoM “will examine the need for GST concession/exemption” on Covid vaccines, drugs and medicines for Covid treatment, testing kits for Covid detection, medical grade oxygen, pulse oximeters, hand sanitisers, oxygen therapy instruments (concentrators, generators and ventilators), PPE kits, N95 masks, surgical masks, thermometers and any other items required for Covid relief.While vaccines and cotton masks attract 5% GST, most of these items fall in the 12% tax slab. Testing kits, drugs, medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators and ventilators fall under the 12% tax bracket. Alcohol-based sanitisers, hand wash gels, disinfectants and thermometers attract 18% GST.The group of ministers was constituted after several member states of the council, such as West Bengal and Punjab asked for exempting GST on all Covid-essential materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-forms-8-member-panel-to-examine-gst-exemption-on-covid-material-101622312553228.html
30-05-2021||India||Covid empowered groups reconstituted, oxygen included||The Centre on Saturday reconstituted the empowered groups set up to monitor and coordinate activities and response to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the country by including exclusive groups on oxygen availability, testing, vaccination and emergency response capabilities.Six of the groups are headed by secretaries of the government while three are headed by Niti Aayog members and one by the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).VK Paul, member of the Niti Aayog, is in charge of two key empowered groups – EG1 on India’s emergency management plan and strategy, and EG5 on vaccination.The order issued by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, said: “...the situation has been reviewed and a need has been felt to reconstitute the six Empowered Groups into 10 groups in order to cater the current need of Covid-19 management.”Bhalla himself heads EG10 on pandemic response and coordination, which deals with containment measures and guidelines, coordination with the states, legal and administrative aspects and logistics and supply chain management.Originally, immediately after the first nationwide lockdown in March last year, the Centre formed 11 EGs for Covid-19 management, which were reconstituted into six larger groups in September.A new group formed on Saturday – EG2, headed by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan -- will exclusively look into emergency response capabilities of the country during a Covid-19 wave. It will primarily address the issues related to availability of general and ICU beds in hospitals; equipments including ventilators; personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, gloves, medicines, etc.The Centre has also formed a separate group on oxygen – EG4, headed by secretary road transport Giridhar Aramane -- which will look into production, import, logistics, plants and conversion of nitrogen into medical oxygen, availability of cryogenic tankers, etc.Significantly, EG5 for vaccination under VK Paul will monitor the procurement, management, import, logistics, daily supply, utilisation and wastage of Covid-19 vaccines across the country. India is currently administering three vaccines – Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V (from second week of June).Paul also heads EG1, which monitors disease surveillance, emerging scenarios, global trends and medical protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-empowered-groups-reconstituted-o2-included-101622312433958.html

The number of plants manufacturing the drug, the patent for which is held by Gilead Sciences, has increased from 20 to 60 in a month.“Now the country has enough Remdesivir as the supply is much more than the demand,” the minister said in a release. The government has also decided to purchase five million vials and create a stock so that there is no shortage if cases surge again.Also read| Don’t lower guard: Experts warn against Covid 3rd wave in K’takaWhen Covid-19 infections shot up in India in April, there was an acute shortage of the antiviral drug that is used by doctors for treating patients with moderate disease. At the time, Gilead Sciences donated 450,000 doses of the medicine while India was scaling up domestic production.To be sure, the World Health Organisation recommended against the use of the medicine seeing no mortality or any other benefit in November last year. India continues to use the drug, which is part of its clinical management protocol as well.“Initially, it was said to reduce the period of hospitalisation. However, since then several global studies have shown no benefit and many countries have stopped using the drug. In India, we do not have a large randomised control trial but clinicians have seen benefit of the medicine in their patients. So, there is no big centre in the country that is not using the drug in moderate to severe cases,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.The government still controls allocation of other Covid-19 drugs such as Tocilizumab, which is not manufactured in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-stops-allocation-of-remdesivir-to-states-as-supply-crunch-resolves-101622312433244.html
30-05-2021||India||LoC truce led to sense of peace: Army chief||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has said that the restoration of ceasefire in February between Indian and Pakistani militaries along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir is holding, has led to a significant drop in infiltration by terrorists from Pakistan and contributed to the overall sense of peace and well-being in border areas.“This is the first step on the long road to normalisation of ties between the two countries. We would like the ceasefire to continue. It has definitely led to an improvement in the security situation and benefited civilians living in forward areas,” Naravane said.In a surprise development, Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on February 25 that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC from the midnight of February 24. India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003, but it was frequently violated.The army chief said the ceasefire violations by the neighbouring army were aimed at providing cover to infiltrators. No ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army indicated that infiltration attempts were not being supported, Naravane said.“Counterterrorism operations will continue. We have no reason to believe that terror infrastructure along the LoC has been dismantled by the Pakistan army,” Naravane said.Also read: Pakistan fails to prove alleged India role in 2018 China consulate attackPakistan resorted to the highest ever ceasefire violations during the 12 months preceding the joint announcement of the ceasefire in February. According to government data accessed by HT, the Pakistani army violated ceasefire at least a dozen times on average daily between February 2020 and February 2021.Peace along the LoC is mutually beneficial, Naravane said. “The population living on either side suffers due to violence along the LoC. I am sure the Pakistan army is also concerned about the population and hopefully the ceasefire will hold,” the army chief said.After February 24, there has been a solitary instance of cross-border firing along the international border in Jammu sector between the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers.Of the 30 terrorists killed by security forces in Kashmir during the last three months, only one was a foreigner, said officials familiar with the developments. “It’s an indicator that infiltration by Pakistani terrorists has dropped notably. We will have to wait and watch how things unfold as three months is a short window to confirm a pattern,” said one of the officials.The escalation in ceasefire violations coincided with the first anniversary of the Centre’s move in August 2019 to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status that Islamabad reacted sharply to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loc-truce-led-to-sense-of-peace-army-chief-101622312372695.html

My administration’s revocation of Choksi’s citizenship has been frustrated by a litigation brought against the state. We are determined to revoke Choksi’s citizenship and to concurrently pursue his extradition to India to face criminal charges there. There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitution protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship.”Choksi’s lawyers have said that their client enjoys legal and constitutional protection as a citizen.Referring to Browne’s statement, the UPP said: “The statement is both irresponsible and frightening. It is not for the prime minister to decide who is entitled to the protection of the constitution. We are a nation of laws: Every citizen of Antigua and Barbuda is entitled to due process and the rule of law must be respected by all.”“The alleged abduction and beating of Mr Choksi already paints an unflattering picture of the country. Browne’s deliberate attempt to subvert and corrupt the rule of law makes us look even worse,” the UPP was quoted as saying by Antigua Newsroom.Reacting on the development, Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “My client is a human being not some pawn that he can be just put in any square in the game of chess as per anybody’s desire or on anybody’s statement. My stand is vindicated and I am filled with gratitude and appreciation seeing the statement of United Progressive Party Antigua, recognising that Antigua ought to protect the rights of every citizen. My client is citizen of Antigua and is entitled to all constitutional protections under Antiguan constitution and is entitled to all remedies available to him under law which he has even successfully availed.”The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court has ordered that he should not be removed from Dominica, where he was detained by the local police after he went missing from Antigua on Sunday. The court will further hear the matter on Wednesday.Choksi was released from police custody on Friday following the court order and has been moved to a quarantine facility in Roseau.His lawyers have alleged that Indian and Antiguan officials abducted the businessman but Antigua and Barbuda’s commissioner of police Atlee Patrick Rodney denied the charge.Indian officials are in touch with their counterparts in Dominica to make an attempt to bring him back through the deportation route because India has no extradition arrangements with the Caribbean country, people tracking developments said in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiguan-oppn-party-hits-out-at-pm-browne-seeks-to-treat-choksi-as-citizen-101622312312649.html
30-05-2021||India||Mamata targets Modi over ‘vendetta politics’||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, a day after she was accused by senior BJP leaders of skipping a review meeting chaired by Modi to take stock of the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas.Banerjee accused the BJP of playing a “dirty game” and carrying out “political vendetta” following its poll debacle in the recently ended assembly elections after the Centre on Friday recalled the state’s chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay to Delhi.“If the PM tells me to touch his feet and in return promises to help Bengal, I am ready to do that. But please don’t humiliate and insult me. Please stop playing this dirty game. The PMO was giving out one-sided manipulated news,” Banerjee said.On Friday, the BJP’s top leaders, including the party’s national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah, uploaded pictures of the PM’s meeting with empty chairs while accusing the CM of skipping the review meeting.“Mamata Didi’s conduct today is an unfortunate low. Cyclone Yaas has affected several common citizens and the need of the hour is to assist those affected. Sadly, Didi has put arrogance above public welfare and today’s petty behaviour reflects that,” Shah tweeted.“I felt bad the way I was insulted and humiliated yesterday with fake news being planted by the PMO while central ministers echoed the same lie as parrots. While we were working in cyclone-hit areas trying to save people, they were busy in maligning us,” she said.“They are giving out pictures of empty chairs. Where is the photo of the Prime Minister sitting and I was standing next to him and bowing down to speak to him,” adding that she left after taking the PM’s permission.Mamata refuted the allegations of skipping the PM’s meeting saying that her flight could take off 20 minutes after its scheduled departure, only after the PM’s flight landed at Kalaikunda. At Kalaikunda too her flight had to hover for 10-15 minutes, she said.“There were political leaders who were not entitled to attend a meeting between the PM and the CM. Initially the meeting was scheduled between the PM and CM. Later it was revised and central ministers, the governor and an MLA (BJP) who is leader of the opposition were included. It was a big BJP party,” she added. “You always create some confusion and confrontation in Bengal. Why are you behaving like this? Is it just because we returned to power with a sweeping victory? Why don’t you accept the people’s mandate? Do you want to bulldoze the federal structure? Is there a martial rule for West Bengal and another law for the remaining states?” she said.The TMC swept to power for the third consecutive term after a high-pitched poll battle, winning 213 of the 292 assembly seats where elections were held. The BJP which had set a target to win more than 200 seats could only manage 77.The chief minister urged the Centre to withdraw the letter in which it had recalled the state’s chief secretary to Delhi but hinted that the matter may end up in a court battle.BJP leaders hit back saying earlier too bureaucrats were transferred. “I do not understand this hullabaloo over Alapon Bandyopadhyay’s transfer to centre! He belongs to IAS, an All-India service. Such officers are transferred from time to time as a routine measure. Sanjay Mitra, a previous CS was similarly transferred and posted as Defence Secretary!” tweeted Tathagata Roy, veteran BJP leader and former governor or Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-targets-modi-over-vendetta-politics-101622312313221.html
30-05-2021||India||Last detainee in Silchar centre released on bail||The last D-voter detainee at the Foreigners’ Detention Centre in Assam’s Silchar Central Jail was released on Saturday after being granted bail by the high court, officials said.Manindra Das, 67, from the Katigorah area of Cachar district, is the 67th detained “doubtful citizen”, also referred to as D-voter (for doubtful or dubious voter on account of not being able to establish Indian citizenship), to be released on bail from the centre since June 2018.Chandradhar Das, 102, was the first D-voter in Assam’s Barak Valley to get bail on medical grounds. Only a few self-declared foreigners, including nationals of Myanmar, Bangladesh, and some African countries are now lodged at the detention centre.Manindra Das, who received a notice from a Foreigners Tribunal in 2015, appeared before it several times but his lawyer died during the process, and he missed some hearings. The court issued an ex parte detention order on May 8, 2019.“We are Indians. We love this land like any other citizen of this country. But now people will look at me in a different way… This entire process is humiliating but I am not going to blame anybody,” a teary-eyed Manindra Das said after his release.Apart from Silchar, there are five other detention centres in Assam where at least 19 people declared as D-voters are under detention, officials said.The Supreme Court cited the Covid-19 pandemic last year and ordered release of all inmates at detention centres, who have stayed there for over two years. The basic criteria for applying for bail earlier was a minimum of three-year detention.Satyendra Baisya, in charge of Silchar Central Jail, said they have had two kinds of detainees, including self-declared foreigners. “…we have deported many of them. The other kind of detainees is doubtful citizens who have cases pending in tribunals.”Baisya said D-voters have often been arrested for missing hearings. “Last year, many of them tested positive for coronavirus, but this year, we have managed to protect them.”After 2019, there have been no new detentions at Silchar centre.The last wish of Chandradhar Das, who died in December, to die as an Indian remained unfulfilled, his family said. Despite having valid documents, he failed to prove his identity. He was arrested in 2018. The trial was delayed in the absence of a government lawyer.His daughter, Niyoti Roy said, “My father was a strong man. He wanted to die as an Indian, but we could not fulfil his last wish. My mother considers Narendra Modi as her God. She says Modi heard her prayers and sent food and medicine during the lockdown. We have voted for Modi’s candidate this year again. My father had the same faith and admiration but in his last days, he faced humiliation without any reason. We are afraid that this can happen to us as well.”Over 20,00,00 people in Bengali-dominated Barak Valley have been left out of the NRC as part of a process to identify and deport undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh. Assam’s NRC Authority has gone to the SC seeking re-verification of the list. The state, too, has said it will approach the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-detainee-released-on-bail-from-foreigners-detention-centre-in-silchar-101622292271444.html

30-05-2021||Today's||The priority sector lending India needs||The origins of priority sector (PS) lending can be traced back to 1966 when Morarji Desai saw a need for increasing credit to agriculture and small industries. However, the definition for PS was only formalised based on a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report in the National Credit Council in 1972. After bank nationalisation, the PS formulation also allowed Indira Gandhi to assuage important political lobbies, in a poor country with full adult franchise, through such directed lending. The PS definition grew over time, and was not just limited to important lobby groups, but extended to cover important neglected sectors of the economy. But despite the tweaks, the classification retains a heavy focus on agriculture and small industries (defined as micro, small and medium enterprises or MSME) till today. Banks lend nearly 40% of their adjusted net bank credit (ANBC), a not inconsiderable ₹39,50,205 crore, to the priority sector. The important question that arises, as we battle Covid-19 today, is whether the PS definition needs any change? Are valid categories such as health infrastructure well served? Are we using the full possibilities of JAM — full access to Jan Dhan accounts, universal Aadhaar numbers and near-universal mobile penetration — to address the issues that PS lending cannot achieve, but direct benefit transfers (DBT) may be able to solve? PS includes eight identified sectors. The biggest is agriculture with an 18% target of total ANBC. The other important category is MSMEs. In addition, five sectors are classified as PS — housing, export credit, education, social infrastructure and renewable energy. Social infrastructure has lending caps and covers loans up to a limit of ₹5 crore per borrower for setting up schools, drinking water facilities and sanitation facilities, including construction/ refurbishment of household toilets, and water improvements at the household level. It also covers loans up to a limit of ₹10 crore per borrower for building health care facilities in Tier II to Tier VI centres. The education category covers loans for study or vocational courses. Further, these targets must include 12% loans to defined weaker sections, 7.5% to micro enterprises, and 10% of the agriculture target is for small and marginal farmers.We believe this formulation needs a rethink. First, it is shocking that health is only a sub-category of social infrastructure with a ₹10 crore limit for building hospitals. This needs to be a large independent category where we encourage “right size” not “small size” hospitals — big in urban centres but smaller outside. Second, the need to create institutions for training nurses, health technicians, and health machine operators, and more broadly for training in basic technology and digital applications is dire. Tata chairman N Chandrashekharan has captured this wonderfully in his book Bridgital Nations. Third, educational infrastructure has a low credit limit of ₹5 crore. Finally, loans for purchase of computers and smart phones for low income categories should also be considered as part of PS lending. The related question in respect of PS lending is to assess whether it is the right form of intervention for some of its targeted categories. While allowing banks to lend to micro finance institutions, are there not some PS categories that are better served by grants? How productive has lending to weaker sections and small and marginal farmers in agriculture been? They still struggle after 50 years. The banks lending to these categories in agriculture have double digit non-performing assets (NPA) in their loan portfolios, making the sector economically unviable for them.Granting loans to this borrower segment with the high probability of NPAs creates corruption opportunities for bank managers and create moral hazards for the identified beneficiaries. When there are large defaults in a segment, the farmers repaying the loans are disincentivised, and the overall credit environment gets contaminated by large defaults. Converting some part of PS lending to a grant paid directly by government can unlock large amounts of efficiency in the system, and dramatically increase the valuation of public sector banks also. These weaker sections will benefit a lot more with grants. The JAM trinity allows us to do this, the beneficiaries will prefer this, and it will be politically popular. In fact, we believe that banks should be happy to pay for part of the overall grant amounts through a specific cess imposed on them for the purpose. It could be calculated as the cost of their NPAs in the segment, so they are no worse off than before. Covid-19 has forced us to re-examine many things from the past. The importance of health and education infrastructure has been sharply highlighted. It has underlined the importance of digital access as we all settle into new ways of working and learning. PS classification should reflect this, and we should use the potential of our technology stack (and JAM) to target and deliver grants to the weaker sections. This, however, cannot supplant the dramatic increase needed in health and education budgets of state governments to fix our social infrastructure. All talk of being a superpower should wait till we can offer our people even minimum access to the basic social infrastructure needed for living. That is what we owe all those lost to Covid-19.

30-05-2021||Today's||Seven years on, Modi faces three challenges||The beginning of the third year of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s second term would be an apt occasion to look at the early days of this innings. He began as a run-hungry batsman, eager to notch up a big score, belting out sixes and fours to every corner of the ground. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government divided Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and abrogated Article 370 in one fell swoop. A new Union Territory, Ladakh, emerged and J&K’s full state status was done away with. The practice of triple talaq was declared illegal. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) always had these issues in its sights, but Modi is the one who grasped the nettle. His vow of making India a $5-trillion economy by 2024 meant removing certain hurdles to growth. He zeroed in on non-performing assets of public sector banks as one and a merger of 19 banks into four was executed. Despite unprecedented opposition from farmers and the Opposition, agri-sector laws were changed and the path to the privatisation of government undertakings was cleared. Modi meant to show that he would not hold back on economic reform. Then disaster struck in the form of the lethal coronavirus. Of the three major challenges facing the government, this has been the biggest the NDA has faced by far. As of Saturday, the death toll from the virus is around 3.22 lakh. The Opposition and some experts claim that the death toll could be higher and a third wave may be in the offing. They also say that if 70-80% of the population is not vaccinated without delay, the waves will keep coming. The government claims that everyone will be vaccinated by December but so far there is little to inspire confidence in this assertion. A vaccination drive for those above 18 years has been announced, but hundreds of vaccination centres are running short of vaccines for this cohort. In fact, the whole vaccination strategy, which was to be a model for the world, is now in trouble. Vaccines are in short supply and prior commitments made to foreign nations for vaccine supplies cannot be fulfilled. The state governments ruled by opposition parties are up in arms about the paucity of vaccines and have accused the government of ignoring the threat from the virus for political gain. The pandemic may eventually peter out but it has seriously damaged the economy. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), the rural unemployment rate reached 13.5% in the week ending May 23. On May 9, it was 7.29%. The unemployment rate in cities was found to be 17.4% and the national unemployment rate has climbed to a new high of 14.7%. If the lockdowns do not end quickly, the situation could worsen. Certainly, the government will have to address the deteriorating financial condition. The second challenge Modi faces is political. Next year, assembly elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa and Manipur. The groundwork for these has begun. Despite the victories in Assam and Puducherry, the defeat in West Bengal has dented the BJP’s reputation as an invincible election machine. During Modi 2.0, the party has won only four out of 10 state elections. In these, the role of the allies was crucial. That is why many political critics feel that even though there is no alternative to Modi at the Centre, the voters prefer strong state-level parties in the assembly elections. As on March 2018, the NDA was ruling 21 states, with 71% of the country’s population. In April 2019, it was reduced to 18 states. However, in terms of demography, now 49% of the population is ruled by the NDA. The seven states where elections are to be held next year are crucial to the BJP. All of them are governed by the BJP, barring Punjab, which is ruled by the Congress. Retaining power in these states is going to be the political litmus test for Modi. In Punjab, so far, the BJP has been fighting elections in alliance with the Akalis. This time, it is on its own. Over the last five years, the NDA has lost almost all its old allies.The third challenge the Modi government is from across the borders. China is still up to its old tricks. Will Modi be able to get China to retreat from the border areas it has encroached on? These are all daunting challenges for PM Modi. His track record on meeting difficult situations head-on is well known. He is a past master at political manoeuvrings. Will he rise to the occasion now as well? It remains to be seen but this is why the eighth year of his prime ministership or his second term as pradhan sevak as he likes to term himself, will prove interesting to both his admirers and critics.

30-05-2021||Today's||To ease Covid-19 curbs, rely on decentralised/district-level guidelines||Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit India, our response strategy has been around the mantra “test, test, test”. India has increased its testing capacity by using RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test kits, along with an innovative combination of different platforms. These strategies helped us reach 1.2 million tests per day in September 2020 and a further peak of 2.2 million tests per day in May. This was also accompanied with the introduction of two India-made vaccines in January. Now, with India in the midst of a second surge, the state governments have implemented restrictive measures. While these have mostly been successful in curbing the spread of infection, restrictions cannot be a sustainable solution. So, what then should constitute an evidence-based response to the situation? What can be considered as a neither too-late nor too-early easing of restrictions, as each option has its associated consequences?The answer lies in a decentralised pandemic response that focuses on three pillars — district-level test positivity rate, vaccination coverage, and a bottom-up decision-making process. During the first wave, centralisation, to some extent, was critical — since we were dealing with a novel virus and regulatory processes had to be set up. But now, with wide heterogeneity in disease transmission between states, these decisions need to be more decentralised and contingent on local-level data. Restrictive measures on movement, mass gatherings, and social events are being governed at the district level. We need to further engage districts to make these recommendations based on district-level data and trends. But while monitoring is key, evaluation tools should be easy to use, shunning a long list of asks that keeps delaying the decision to ease things. Instead, what we should focus on are three key parameters. Pillar one should focus on districts with a test positivity rate (TPR) of less than 5%. TPR reflects the percentage of all Sars-CoV-2 tests performed that are positive. This will continue to be the key indicator for making informed decisions. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic should be considered under control, when the positivity average over two weeks is less than 5%. Districts should liaise closely with state government on TPR, ensuring quality of restrictions and make recommendations accordingly. Pillar two rests on adequate vaccine coverage for priority and vulnerable groups, and should be a parameter while considering opening up. Vaccinations among the most vulnerable population groups need to be ramped up to ensure that there are fewer deaths, even if the cases surge. The reality is that the supply of vaccines will take a few months to reach the level of adequacy in terms of doses. However, the judicious use of what is available now, and ensuring their administration where they are needed most (frontline workers, including health care professionals, those above 60 years, and those who are above 45 years and with co-morbidities) need to be prioritised. At least 70% of these priority groups need to be covered while a district is working its way out through restrictive measures to reach the TPR threshold of less than 5%. Pillar three is community ownership. Without community ownership — where people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as masking up and maintaining physical distance — all administrative measures are bound to fail. The pandemic has forced us to think differently about the norms that govern responses to it. While we live in silos and ask for continued restrictive measures or new treatment and prevention to be adopted every day, we must consider the impact of these on lives and livelihoods. Therefore, our response to the pandemic must be driven by local data, and executed and monitored by a flexible administration and an empowered community.Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and director, ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune.Professor (Dr.) Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMRThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-ease-covid-19-curbs-rely-on-decentralised-district-level-guidelines-101622375921860.html
30-05-2021||Editorials||The uncertain economic story||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Annual Report, released last week, has a detailed assessment on the state of the economy. The report (expectedly) lauds both the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic’s economic impact. However, it does well to reiterate some basic principles of economic policy as far as dealing with a pandemic is concerned. It rightfully notes that “compared to financial crises, a health crisis can be more pervasive, persistent and debilitating in its impact on the real economy” and “letting down the guard is perilous; it is best to prepare for future waves”. This has both a short-term and medium-term message for policy-makers. India paid heavily for letting down vigilance in the month of March when economic activity was finally beginning to gain momentum — as was a second wave. Any signs of revival in the infection curve must be nipped in the bud from now on.Given the fact that the economy has been battered by two waves of the pandemic, it will be overly optimistic to assume that it will return to normal quickly. The policy hubris around a V-shaped recovery ought to be discarded. The report notes how “private investment is the missing piece in the story of the Indian economy in 2020-21” and “reviving it awaits an environment in which ‘animal spirits’ are rekindled and entrepreneurial energies are released”, clearly pointing towards a persistence of weak demand in the economy. RBI’s report is categorical that the second-wave’s economic impact being confined to the first quarter of 2021-22 is the “most optimistic scenario”. These observations should provide clear guidance for economic policy. Not only can we not take economic recovery for granted, but even future shocks cannot be ruled out. Just a flattening of the infection curve will not lead to the restoration of a normal growth trajectory, and it will take a demand stimulus to do so. Because states have done most of the heavy lifting during the pandemic and are already pushed to their fiscal limits, only the Centre can lead the charge on this front. To be sure, the report seeks the cherished goal of “a secure path of strong and sustainable growth with macroeconomic and financial stability”. However, given the demand deficiency in the economy, a delayed stimulus is a bigger risk at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-uncertain-economic-story-101622375320447.html
30-05-2021||Editorials||Breaching the 1.5 degree Celsius mark||There is a 40% chance of the annual average global temperature reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels temporarily over at least one of the next five years, the World Meteorolo-gical Organization (WMO) warned last week. There is a 90% likelihood of at least one year between 2021 and 2025 becoming the warmest on record, which would beat 2016 for being the warmest, it added. The goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement is to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C.Releasing the report, WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas, said that data in the report must not be seen as just statistics. This is indeed true; it must prompt stronger climate action. In India, the direct effects of rising temperatures will manifest not just in more intense and frequent heat waves, but also in a more pervasive, long-term impact, which will go beyond ecological destruction. A 2018 World Bank study shows that shifting average temperatures and rainfall patterns will depress living standards. There is an optimal temperature beyond which any increases in temperature lead to a fall in household consumption expenditure. This is because abnormal heat increases the chances of heat-related illnesses, fuels the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya, increasing the health expenses of households. This could further dent the battle against poverty and inequality. The WMO report and available scientific literature must push India to double up its climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/breaching-the-1-5-degree-celsius-mark-101622375080366.html
