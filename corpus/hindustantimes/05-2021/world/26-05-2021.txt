A report in dominicannewsonline.com stated that Indian-born Choksi was in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) in Dominica after he was caught on Tuesday night on the basis of an Interpol ‘yellow notice’. It added that arrangements were being made to hand him over to the Antigua police. Officials in Indian agencies said they are in touch with authorities in both the Caribbean countries to ascertain more details but it appears that he was trying to flee somewhere else. “He may have taken a private boat to flee to Dominica. We are gathering more details,” said an officer. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal said – “I have spoken to his family, his family is happy and relieved that finally whereabouts of Mehul Choksi are known. And efforts are being made to speak to him so that one can know the clearer picture that how he was taken to Dominica”. On Tuesday, Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne had said that if Mehul Choksi had fled the country, he would have done so using a boat. The Antiguan government has said on several occasions that it is ready to extradite Choksi to India for which the process is already going on. His extradition case as well as revocation of citizenship by Antigua is currently being pursued in a court there, which he has challenged. Choksi, who has sought refuge in Antigua after allegedly cheating the Punjab National Bank of ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, and fleeing India in 2018, left his home on Sunday to go for dinner at a well-known restaurant in the southern part of the island and was never seen again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-apprehended-in-dominica-101-nautical-miles-from-antigua-101622052674983.html

Biden also said that the US, along with other countries, will press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation.In a statement released by White House, Biden said that he received a report from the intelligence agencies on Covid-19, which was first reported from China in late 2019, in April, but it was not conclusive.The US President said he has asked intelligence agencies to "redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion".Biden has sought a report on whether the Covid-19 virus first emerged in China from an animal source or from a laboratory accident.Also read: Why is Chinese state media targeting Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy? All you need to knowThe move by Biden to bring the discussion of China's role in the origin of Covid-19 signals an escalation in mounting controversy over how the virus first emerged.The probe will have immense implications both for China, which says it is not responsible for the pandemic, and for US politics, where the lab theory has been used by Republicans to attack Beijing.Here is the full text from White House's statement:Back in early 2020, when Covid-19 emerged, I called for the CDC to get access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more effectively. The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of Covid-19.Nevertheless, shortly after I became President, in March, I had my National Security Advisor task the Intelligence Community to prepare a report on their most up-to-date analysis of the origins of Covid-19, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. I received that report earlier this month, and asked for additional follow-up. As of today, the US Intelligence Community has “coalesced around two likely scenarios” but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question. Here is their current position: “while two elements in the IC leans toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter – each with low or moderate confidence – the majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.”I have now asked the Intelligence Community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China. I have also asked that this effort include work by our National Labs and other agencies of our government to augment the Intelligence Community’s efforts. And I have asked the Intelligence Community to keep Congress fully apprised of its work.The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/full-text-president-biden-orders-us-intelligence-to-give-final-report-on-covid-origin-101622050590598.html
26-05-2021||World||Biden asks US intel officials to investigate Covid-19 origin amid Wuhan lab controversy||President Joe Biden on Wednesday asked U.S. intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab.After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have promoted the theory that the virus emerged from a laboratory accident, rather than naturally through human contact with an infected animal.Biden in a statement said the majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around those two likely scenarios but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.” He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies lean toward the animal link and “one leans more toward” the lab theory, adding, "each with low or moderate confidence."Also Read | Why is Chinese state media targeting Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy?Biden directed U.S. national laboratories to assist with the investigation and called on China to cooperate with international probes into the origins of the pandemic.“The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence," he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the White House supports a new World Health Organization investigation in China, but added it “would require China finally stepping up and allowing access needed to determine the origins.”Biden, for his part, held out the possibility that a firm conclusion may never be known, given the Chinese government's refusal to fully cooperate with international investigations.“The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-asks-us-intel-officials-to-investigate-covid-19-origin-amid-wuhan-lab-controversy-101622049636352.html
26-05-2021||World||Former South Africa President Zuma accused of taking 'hundreds of bribes'||Former South African President Jacob Zuma accepted more than 700 bribes over the course of a decade before he was president, including cash payments from French arms company Thales, prosecutors alleged on the first day of Zuma's corruption trial on Wednesday.Zuma, the president of Africa's most developed economy from 2009 until he was forced out amid other graft scandals in 2018, was charged with multiple counts of corruption, as well as racketeering, fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and claimed the trial was politically motivated.Also Read | Corruption trial against South African ex-President Jacob Zuma to start in MayThe 79-year-old Zuma, who wore a blue suit, red tie, and a face mask in court, also filed papers asking for the chief prosecutor to be removed from the case, claiming he was biased. The judge said he would consider Zuma's application.Zuma could be jailed for 25 years if convicted.After the trial was adjourned until July 19, Zuma addressed hundreds of his supporters outside the courthouse.“I have never taken anything from anyone. I have done nothing wrong,” he said.The corruption charges relate to the time before Zuma was head of state but a political figure on the rise, and include the period when he was deputy president of South Africa from 1999 to 2005.Prosecutors alleged he received bribes from various sources, not just Thales, between 1995 and 2005. During those years, he progressed from provincial politician to deputy president of the ruling African National Congress party, and then deputy president of the country.Thales is also facing charges at the trial and pleaded not guilty to racketeering and money laundering. Together, Zuma and Thales face 18 charges. The trial was postponed until July 19.Prosecutors said Zuma and Thales were involved in what was effectively an organized criminal enterprise between 1995 and 2001. Zuma agreed to accept annual payments of around $40,000 from Thales, prosecutors alleged, in return for him providing “political protection” and ensuring there was no investigation into a major arms deal Thales secured with the South African government. The deal was signed in 1999 while clouded by allegations of graft.Zuma was first formally implicated by prosecutors over the deal in 2005 and fired as deputy president as a result. The charges were dropped and reinstated numerous times over the next 13 years amid allegations of political interference. Meanwhile, Zuma revived his political career to become South African president just four years after being fired as deputy president.The charges were reinstated by the National Prosecuting Authority in 2018 and Zuma finally answered to them Wednesday in a courthouse in the eastern city of Pietermaritzburg, 16 years after he was first linked to the case.In the indictment, prosecutors provided a list of 791 payments made either directly to Zuma's bank accounts or to others for services on behalf of Zuma between October 1995 and June 2005. The money came from companies connected to Zuma's former financial advisor, who was convicted of corruption in 2005. The advisor is accused of soliciting bribes for Zuma from Thales and being the go-between, but also of bribing Zuma for his own business interests.Some of the payments were for as little as $7 and others for as much as $28,000. They were listed in bank records as “Zuma family costs," "Zuma children education" and “Zuma household costs,” among other descriptions, prosecutors said. They totaled nearly $300,000. It was unclear if those payments included any of the alleged bribes from Thales.Zuma, who faces separate allegations of graft while he was president at an ongoing inquiry, has often characterized accusations of corruption against him as politically motivated. He even claimed in his papers seeking the removal of chief trial prosecutor Billy Downer that South African prosecution officials had colluded with foreign intelligence agencies over the years to frame him.While it appears none of Zuma's alleged involvement in graft while president will form part of this trial, he is already facing allegations at the separate judicial inquiry that he oversaw massive levels of corruption while president. Zuma has refused to testify at that inquiry despite an order to do so, leading the judge in charge to ask a court to send him to jail for two years for contempt of court.

26-05-2021||World||French social media influencers offered money to discredit Pfizer vaccine. Some claim Russia behind it||Several European influencers have claimed that they have been offered money by a communications agency to discredit the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech. They were asked to create videos for YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms questioning the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. One influencer told French TV that he was offered about $2,500 for a video.French YouTuber Léo Grasset, whose popular science channel has nearly 1.2 million subscribers, recently shared the information about the “strange” proposal he received and posted screenshots of the request from his Twitter handle. Grasset said that the agency, posing as based in London, informed him about their “colossal budget” and asked to hide the sponsorship details if he accepts the offer.“Present the material natively. Act like you have the passion and interest in this topic. Present the material as your own independent thought,” the screenshot read.The agency, as per the screenshot, requested Grasset to falsely claim that the death rate among those vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine is almost three times higher than those with AstraZeneca vaccine. “Put a question like ‘Why some governments actively purchasing Pfizer vaccine, which is dangerous to health of the people?’” it said.Grasset later informed his followers that the address of the “London agency” was bogus since there is an “aesthetic laser centre”. He also noticed that all the employees said to be working for the agency had “weird” LinkedIn profiles, which he found had now disappeared, and everyone had worked in Russia in the past.“Unbelievable. The address of the London agency that contacted me is bogus. They never had premises there, it is an aesthetic laser centre! All employees have weird LinkedIn profiles ... which have been missing since this morning. Everyone has worked in Russia before,” he tweeted.According to a Wall Street Journal report, French counterintelligence authorities are investigating whether the Russian government is in any way involved in the attempt to create doubt about the vaccine widely used in the United States and Europe. French health minister Olivier Véran slammed the effort to discredit the vaccine, calling it “dangerous” and “irresponsible”."I do not know where it comes from, I do not know if it comes from France or from abroad", as Véran on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-social-media-influencers-offered-money-to-discredit-pfizer-vaccine-101622048533442.html

Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in his health minister."They've been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives," the spokesman said adding that the government would not respond to individual accusations about Hancock's conduct.Cummings, asked for an example, said Hancock had said that all patients got the treatment they needed during the first peak of the virus even though the government's health experts had said some patients had not received the necessary treatment.He also said Hancock had told ministers the supply of personal protective equipment was under control in April, but that had later proved not to have been the case.Cummings, who said Johnson had come close to removing Hancock from his job in April last year, criticised the health minister's role in the establishment of an expanded coronavirus testing system.He also told the committee that the country's top civil servant had told him he had lost confidence in Hancock's honesty, and had also relayed those concerns to Johnson.Asked in parliament whether those concerns had been relayed to him by the head of the civil service, Mark Sedwill, Johnson said: "The answer to that is no ... and I'm afraid I haven't had the benefit of seeing the evidence that he's (Cummings) bringing to the house."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-should-have-been-fired-over-covid-says-johnson-s-exadviser-101622038554173.html
26-05-2021||World||China will donate 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Nepal: President Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday announced a donation of one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines for Nepal, which is facing a severe shortage of jabs for providing the second shots to more than one million people. Xi announced the provision of the vaccines as grant assistance during a phone conversation with his Nepalese counterpart Bidya Devi Bhandari, according to a statement from Nepal’s foreign ministry. China had provided 800,000 doses of Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV vaccine to Nepal in March. The Chinese assistance comes at a time when Nepal is grappling with a second wave of Coronavirus infections, with 6,677 new cases reported since Tuesday to take the national tally to 535,525. The country’s death toll is nearly 6,900. Xi acknowledged the difficulties Nepal has been facing due to the second wave of the pandemic and expressed his government’s full support for the fight against Covid-19, the statement said. “During the conversation, the Chinese President announced that China will provide additional 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to Nepal as grant assistance. President Xi also assured that Nepal will remain on a priority of China in vaccine support and cooperation,” the statement added. Bhandari’s conversation with Xi came days after she wrote a letter to her Indian counterpart Ram Nath Kovind to take initiatives to ensure vaccines for Nepal, The Kathmandu Post reported. Nepal had been looking for commercial supplies from Serum Institute of India (SII) and vaccines from the WHO-backed COVAX facility to meet most of its needs for plans to inoculate more than 70% of the population of some 30 million. However, Nepal has struggled to procure vaccines since India restricted exports in late March to cope with its own devastating second wave of infections. A priority for Nepal has been the supply of two million doses of the Covishield vaccine under a commercial contract finalised with SII earlier this year. SII has so far supplied one million doses and the remainder has been held up despite Nepal making 80% of the payment in advance, Nepalese officials have said. India also provided 1.1 million doses of Covishield as grant assistance in January and March and Nepal received another 348,000 doses of Covishield from COVAX in March. Some 1.3 million people above the age of 65 were given the first shot between March 7 and 15, and Nepalese officials have said the process of giving them the second shot has already been delayed by more than a week in view of original plans for the booster shot to be given eight weeks after the first jab. COVAX recently informed the Nepal government that further supplies of Covishield from the facility are unlikely before next year, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-will-donate-1-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-nepal-president-xi-jinping-101622042234269.html

Beginning Wednesday, those on both services will be able to hide the numbers that show how many people liked their posts and photos.Instagram began hiding likes in 2019 as part of an effort to make people's time on the app less stressful and depressing. While many users welcomed the feature, others, including some influencers, worried it might take away from the social media experience. At the time, the platform didn’t give users a choice to hide or unhide the like counts, which didn't sit well with some users.Now, after a test the company announced last month, users will be able to flip a switch that hides public like counts. Instead of a number telling you how many people liked your latest puppy photo, you'll see “liked by Beyoncé and others" (if Beyoncé and others did, in fact, like your photo).To hide like counts on Instagram, you can go to your settings and click on the “posts" section. If you choose to turn off like counts here, it will apply to all your posts. In addition, you will also be able to hide the counts for individual posts before you share them.You can also choose to hide like counts before sharing a post. You can turn this setting on or off, even after it goes live.The feature will be available to Instagram users beginning on Wednesday and to Facebook users in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-instagram-will-now-let-users-hide-like-counts-on-posts-101622036254439.html

And all passengers must adhere to the paid quarantine procedure."The Colombo airport was acting as a transit hub for Indians travelling to West Asia, but the facility was withdrawn in early May due to the current surge in the pandemic.Before the current wave, Sri Lanka and India were making arrangements for a tourism travel bubble.India remained Sri Lanka's top inbound travel market before the onset of the pandemic.Sri Lanka has reported 1.7 lakh COVID-19 cases so far with 1,269 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-sri-lanka-to-lift-ban-on-incoming-travellers-from-june-1-101622038047417.html
26-05-2021||World||US citizenship agency eyes improved service without plan to pay||Less than a year after being on the verge of furloughing about 70% of employees to plug a funding shortfall, the U.S. agency that grants citizenship wants to improve service without a detailed plan to pay for it, including waivers for those who can’t afford fees, according to a proposal obtained by The Associated Press.The Homeland Security Department sent its 14-page plan to enhance procedures for becoming a naturalized citizen to the White House for approval on April 21. It involves U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of Homeland Security and operates entirely on fees.The plan describes changes that reflect “a realistic assessment of our aspirations and limitations,” including more video instead of in-person applicant interviews, authorizing employees to administer citizenship oaths versus relying on federal judges, and promoting online filing to reduce processing times.Homeland Security says it can be done without the approval of Congress, where consensus on immigration has proven elusive.Taken together, the changes mark a complete break from the Trump administration, when the agency focused on combatting fraud and adjusted to shrinking immigration benefits.The plan also seeks to give potential U.S. citizens the benefit of the doubt. For instance, it specifies that an immigrant who mistakenly registers to vote in U.S. elections before becoming a citizen won’t be punished. Doing so now can lead to deportation or criminal charges, likely ending a person’s chance for citizenship.The issue has been in the spotlight amid a recent surge in automatic voter registration and former President Donald Trump’s repeated unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. Last year, Illinois’ automatic voter registration program mistakenly registered hundreds of people who said they weren’t U.S. citizens. At least one voted.The agency will improve the citizenship process to “encourage full participation in our civic life and democracy” and to deliver services effectively and efficiently, according to the document.It doesn’t provide cost estimates for the proposed changes, though there are options on the table and some measures appear designed to save money and achieve efficiencies. It also acknowledges success depends on long-term financial stability, which includes asking Congress for money.Under the plan, the agency would continue subsidizing the costs of becoming a citizen to make sure the process is available to as many people as possible. The administration “recognizes that the cost of fees can be a barrier” so "other fee-paying applicants and petitioners will continue to subsidize this policy decision to ensure full cost recovery,” the document reads.Asked about the status of the proposal, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it's reviewing policies and practices.“Under the Biden Administration, the agency has made considerable strides in reallocating our resources and priorities to fulfill this mission and address challenges like the ones caused by the COVID-19 pandemic," spokesman Joe Sowers said in a statement Tuesday. "Ultimately, USCIS is committed to administering our nation’s legal immigration system in a way that empowers immigrants to pursue citizenship and the privileges that accompany it.”Immigration attorneys called the proposed changes a welcomed shift after the Trump administration.Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, director of government relations for the American Immigration Attorneys Association, said expanding video interviews would be more efficient and convenient for people far from immigration offices, some of which continue to operate at reduced capacity because of the pandemic.“They have a huge backlog they need to work out of,” she said. “Having those creative solutions, will help them dig out of that backlog.”Danielle Spooner, head of the union representing agency workers, said video would benefit employees who've been working from home, but administering the oath, a once-in-a-lifetime experience, should be left to judges.Questions about how the agency would fund the changes made her uneasy, saying employee morale remains low since last summer's near financial catastrophe.That's when the agency threatened more than 13,000 furloughs to tackle a projected $1.26 billion shortfall. But a few tense months later, it said it didn't need the money after all and would end the year with a surplus. Agency leaders said application fees rebounded more than expected as offices reopened from coronavirus shutdowns and contracts were reviewed for cost savings.The anticipated shortfall first surfaced in November 2019, when the agency proposed major fee increases — well before COVID-19 threatened finances.The budget whiplash raised doubts about how the agency's finances deteriorated so rapidly then suddenly recovered. Ur Jaddou, who was nominated by President Joe Biden in April to lead the agency and has a Wednesday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was among those with questions.Jaddou, who served as the agency's chief counsel under President Barack Obama, said in October that the agency needed a financial audit. She questioned some Trump administration changes, including justification for a major expansion of an anti-fraud unit, since abandoned by Biden.“It really is a bunch of bureaucratic red tape,” she said when discussing agency financial woes.Fees were set to increase by an average of 20% last October but a federal judge blocked them. The wait to process a citizenship application grew to more than a year by the end of Trump's presidency from less than eight months four years earlier.Emilio Gonzalez, a former agency director who oversaw massive fee hikes under the second Bush administration, said the agency should avoid going to lawmakers for funding.“By having your own budget, you can be very nimble,” he said. “Losing your budget leaves you at the whim of Congress and all of a sudden immigration gets politicized.”One potential avenue for boosting revenue is expanding the use of so-called “premium processing.” For a hefty fee, it allows limited applicants a 15-day turnaround on some paperwork. Under emergency legislation in October, the agency raised it from $1,440 to $2,500 and allowed revenues to be used for operating expenses. USCIS appears on board, allowing the expedited option in February to some Australian nationals.Broadening it to more eligible forms could generate up to $626 million annually, according to an analysis co-authored by Doug Rand, a former Obama administration official who founded an organization that helps people with immigration.“When USCIS is plagued with problems and not delivering the services it is supposed to in a reasonable time, that’s not just bad news for immigrants, it is bad news for U.S. citizens navigating the system,” Rand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-citizenship-agency-eyes-improved-service-without-plan-to-pay-101622032472093.html

It also has a clinic, gym, cinema, sauna and even a church.- 'Like a space station' -All the facilities are linked by heated tunnels, allowing the 150 or so servicemen to avoid the harsh weather outside, where temperatures can drop to a chilling -42 degrees Celsius (-43 degrees Fahrenheit)."This complex is like a space station, the only difference being that it is not in orbit but in the Arctic desert," says General Igor Churkin, one of the commanders of Russia's Northern Fleet that occupies the base.Despite the strong winds and brutal weather conditions, the base also has a giant airfield. It was from there that two MiG-31 fighter jets, one of the fastest aircraft in the world, completed a flight over the North Pole in March, a first for the Russian navy.The base also boasts a Bastion coastal defence system with a range of 360 kilometres (220 miles). It has demonstrated its reliability in the extreme weather conditions of the Arctic, says commander Balabek Eminov.As Moscow seeks to assert its influence in the Arctic, military disputes have intensified in recent years, with both Russian and NATO forces carrying out manoeuvres to display their ambitions.Glushchenko, one of the base's officers, says his men spotted a Norwegian reconnaissance plane earlier that week.Although it passed without violating the border, the Russian forces sent one of their aircraft to "accompany" it for a few hours.- 'Provocative' actions -US and NATO forces are conducting manoeuvres in the Arctic with increasing regularity, according to Alexander Moiseyev, the commander of the Northern Fleet."We had not seen this since the end of the Second World War," he says, speaking from aboard a nuclear battlecruiser in the port of Severomorsk, a closed city on Russia's Arctic coast and the base of the Northern Fleet.He denounces Washington's "provocative" actions in the region, such as its strategic bomber flights close to Russian borders, and the deployment of US ships to the Barents Sea and off the coast of NATO member Norway.Russia has also bolstered its military presence in recent years, in particular by deploying its state-of-the-art S-400 air defence systems to the region.As ice cover in the Arctic decreases, Russia is also hoping to gain economic influence and make use of the Northern Sea Route shipping channel to export oil and gas to overseas markets.Russia has invested heavily to develop the route, which cuts the journey to Asian ports by 15 days compared with using the traditional Suez Canal route.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday warned other countries of staking claims in the Artic."This is our land and our waters," he stressed.Lavrov is expected to hold his first face-to-face meeting with US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit at a time of spiralling tensions between Moscow and Washington.But for the soldiers stationed at the "Arctic Trefoil" invasions are so far limited to the appearance of polar bears. Officer Sergei Murzayev says he has seen three in his two-and-a-half years there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-to-outmuscle-us-in-arctic-with-northern-military-base-101622033523513.html
26-05-2021||World||France to impose mandatory quarantine for UK to curb spread of Covid variant||France will impose a mandatory quarantine on visitors from Britain to prevent the spread of a worrying virus variant first detected in India, the French government said Wednesday.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said the new measure will be similar to limits imposed in Germany on people traveling from the UK. “France is going to take similar measures and so put in place obligatory isolation for people who come from the United Kingdom," he said.He didn't say when the quarantine will be introduced. He said more information would be released shortly.From Sunday, Germany started requiring people arriving from the UK to go into quarantine for 14 days. The decision responded to the spread in Britain of the Indian variant.Under Germany's tighter rules, airlines and others are also only be able to transport German citizens and residents from Britain.The possibility of tighter French restrictions for British visitors was first raised Sunday by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.The minister suggested that Britain could be put in a health category of its own, somewhere in between the strictest measures that France is imposing on visitors from India and 15 other countries, and more relaxed requirements being readied for visitors from the European Union and some other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-impose-mandatory-quarantine-for-uk-to-curb-spread-of-covid-variant-101622033707536.html
26-05-2021||World||EU seeks fine from Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca for alleged contract breach||A lawyer for the European Union accused AstraZeneca on Wednesday of failing to respect its contract with the 27-nation bloc for the supply of Covid-19 vaccines and asked a Belgian court to impose a large fine on the company.The EU took the Anglo-Swedish firm to court in April after the drugmaker said it would aim to deliver only 100 million doses of its vaccine by the end of June, instead of the 300 million foreseen in the supply contract.Brussels wants the company to deliver at least 120 million vaccines by the end of June. AstraZeneca had delivered 50 million doses at the beginning of May, one-fourth of the 200 million vaccines foreseen in the contract by then."AstraZeneca did not even try to respect the contract," the EU's lawyer, Rafael Jafferali, told a Brussels court in the first hearing on the substance of the legal case.He said the EU was seeking 10 euros ($12.2) for each day of delay for each dose as compensation for AstraZeneca's non-compliance with the EU contract. This penalty would apply from July 1, 2021, if the judge accepted it.The EU lawyer said the EU was seeking an additional penalty of at least 10 million euros for each breach of the contract that the judge may decide.A verdict is expected next month.NOT A CONTRACT FOR SHOES"This is not a contract for the delivery of shoes or T-shirts," AstraZeneca's lawyer Hakim Boularbah told the court later on Wednesday, stressing the complexity of manufacturing a new vaccine.The company has repeatedly said the contract was not binding as it only committed to make "best reasonable efforts" in delivering doses. AstraZeneca's lawyer told the judge the vaccine was sold at cost.Jafferali said that principle had not been respected because the drugmaker had not delivered to the bloc 50 million doses produced in factories that are listed in the contract as suppliers to the EU, of which 39 million doses manufactured in Britain, 10 million produced in the United States and 1 million in the Netherlands.The lawyer said these doses were "diverted" to other clients.The company has said that doses produced in Britain were reserved under a contract the British government signed with the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine.Jafferali said AstraZeneca had pledged in the EU contract not to have other engagements that would prevent it from abiding by the terms of the deal.The lawyer also said AstraZeneca had failed to communicate to the EU in a timely manner the magnitude of its supply problems because it repeatedly sent messages, including publicly, that it was able to meet its targets, before finally admitting there were large shortfalls in March.The company had warned the EU in December of production problems, but communicated only at the end of January, just before the start of deliveries, a much larger cut than initially expected for the first-quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-fine-from-covid-vaccine-maker-astrazeneca-for-alleged-contract-breach-101622032364875.html
26-05-2021||World||Former Republican senator John Warner, who married Elizabeth Taylor, dies at 94||Former U.S. Senator John Warner of Virginia, who at times clashed with fellow Republicans during his three decades in office, has died of heart failure. He was 94.Warner died late on Tuesday, with his wife and daughter at his side, his chief of staff Susan Magill said in an email to family and friends, according to a Politico report on Wednesday. The Washington Post said he died in Alexandria, Virginia.Warner was an influential voice in Congress on military policy and served in the U.S. Senate for five terms from 1979 to 2009.A former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Warner openly criticized President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and called on him in 2007 to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq.The decision put Warner in the center of a growing debate in Congress over the conflict. Warner spent months trying to develop an approach to U.S. policy in Iraq that was supported by Republicans and Democrats.During his time in office, Warner clashed with fellow Republican senators on domestic issues, voting in some cases for government funding of abortions and supporting some gun control measures. In 1994, he refused to support the conservative Republican candidate for Senate, Oliver North.Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said he often turned for advice to Warner, whom he called a "public servant who stood on principle, made us proud, and exemplified the best of what politics can be.""He was a Gentleman who maintained civility in his politics in an era of rising intolerance," fellow Virginian U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat, said on Twitter.Warner, who enlisted in the Navy during World War II at the age of 17, also served in the Marine Corps in Korea. He was secretary of the Navy from 1972-74 in President Richard Nixon’s administration.He was the sixth husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-republican-senator-john-warner-who-married-elizabeth-taylor-dies-at-94-101622032709122.html
26-05-2021||World||Explained: How vaccine passports for global travel will work||Boarding pass, suitcase, passport and ... digital vaccination certificate?Keen to avoid losing another summer of holiday revenue to the coronavirus pandemic, the European Union, some Asian governments and the airline industry are scrambling to develop so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports to help kickstart international travel.They're working on systems that would allow travelers to use mobile phone apps to prove they've been vaccinated, which could help them avoid onerous quarantine requirements at their destinations.But the multiple efforts underscore the lack of one central international system to electronically verify vaccination status. The projects also face technical challenges in working together, while questions about privacy and vaccine inequality linger.Vaccination passports would add another digital layer to the multitude of existing coronavirus health and contact tracing apps many countries and U.S. states have rolled out. Their use domestically to reopen local economies has been hotly debated, with many opposed to requiring them for pubs, concerts and sporting events. However, there's more momentum to use them for international travel, especially as countries like Iceland open their borders to vaccinated visitors and others like Saudi Arabia start allowing vaccinated citizens to travel abroad. The EU's decision last week to open its borders to fully vaccinated travelers adds even more urgency.Here's a look at how vaccine passports work:Official effortsThe first part of a vaccination passport is the user's official or approved electronic immunization record.The European Union, China and Japan are all working on their own digital vaccination certificates for cross-border travel. The U.K., meanwhile, updated its National Health Service app last week to let fully vaccinated users prove their status when traveling abroad, coinciding with an easing of travel rules.Testing is under way for the EU's digital certificate, which will also confirm Covid-19 test results or recovery from the virus and is set to go live by the end of June, allowing residents to reunite with friends and relatives living across 30 European countries. It’s still unclear where and how exactly travelers in the EU, which doesn’t have internal border checkpoints, will have their certificates checked. Officials in Brussels say that will be up to individual countries. The idea is that travelers will flash a QR code on their phones so it can be scanned at, say, an airport or train station, using an official verification app that checks with national databases, via an EU technical “gateway.”The World Health Organization doesn’t recommend vaccination proof as a requirement for international travel, citing unequal distribution of vaccines, even as it consults on interim guidance for developing a “Smart Vaccination Certificate.”Travel AppsTravelers also need a smartphone app to carry any eventual official vaccination certificates.The EU's project includes open source technology European countries can use to build their own official mobile wallets.The International Air Transport Association, an airline industry group, has its smartphone IATA Travel Pass, which airlines including Qantas, Japan Airlines, Emirates, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have signed up to. A rival effort, the nonprofit CommonPass, has gained traction with carriers like Cathay Pacific, JetBlue, United and Lufthansa.Travelers can already use the apps to verify that their Covid-19 test results are accepted at their destination. Travel Pass and CommonPass are so far only available to travelers on airlines that are using them. Both can also be integrated into airline travel apps so users can verify their vaccine status when they check in online. Both are also expected to work with the EU certificates. CommonPass says users will be able to import vaccine credentials by mid-June.Amid a pandemic-dimmed travel outlook, CommonPass CEO Paul Meyer said vaccine passports will only become more widespread. “Our expectation is it will remain a requirement for international travel."What Travelers WantBusiness travelers like British public relations executive Richard Fogg welcome vaccine passports. Fogg's firm scaled back plans to attend a major telecom trade show in Barcelona next month, given quarantine rules for people returning to the U.K.“Those 10 days of quarantine will have negative business implications – there’s no way around it,” Fogg said, while acknowledging tradeoffs including concerns about data privacy.Eymeric Segard, CEO of Geneva-based private jet broker Lunajets, noted travelers already hand over passports with personal data on arrival.“Personally, you know, I would be happy to tell anybody, yes, I am vaccinated or no I’m not vaccinated," he said, adding that vaccine passports would help avoid the “logistical nightmare" of multiple Covid-19 tests Europeans face when visiting other EU countries.What About Fakes?Phony paper Covid-19 document s sold by fraudsters have been a problem during the pandemic but developers say digital versions have safeguards that make them hard to fake.IATA says it doesn’t verify test results or vaccination status but acts as the conduit for registered labs to securely send those details to travelers whose identity the app can match to the person who took the test or vaccination. The app scans a traveler's face using the phone camera and matches it to passport biometric details, and there are checks to prevent someone else using their identity.Security and PrivacyVaccination passports are a polarizing topic, with online discussion highlighting unfounded fears that they’ll be used to control people, restrict freedom and erode privacy. Developers stress that minimal personal data is kept on phones, and the only thing that gets transmitted are encryption keys allowing information to be exchanged securely.“If done correctly, this doesn’t bring an additional level of privacy risk because you’re just putting in a credential status of yes or no,” said Kevin Trilli, chief product officer at ID verification company Onfido, which is working on vaccination cards technology.There's also the question of how well various vaccine credential systems will work together and whether countries will recognize each others' certificates. The U.K. government has warned that not many countries currently accept proof of vaccination from travelers.“You can’t have an interoperable system on day zero,” but over time the kinks will be worked out, which helps lay the groundwork for the next pandemic, Trilli said.What about people who don’t have smartphones? Or families that don't have a device for each member? IATA and EU officials say they're are working on solutions, including paper-based options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-vaccine-passports-for-global-travel-will-work-101622024718722.html
26-05-2021||World||Solar eclipse to occur on June 10, some regions to witness 'ring eclipse'||After witnessing a super blood moon during the lunar eclipse on Wednesday, the world is ready for the solar eclipse on June 10. It will be an annular eclipse in many parts of the world, with the Sun and Moon being exactly in line with the Earth. The upcoming solar eclipse is getting a lot of attention since it is dubbed as 'ring eclipse', a phenomenon when the Sun appears as a very bright ring surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.A total solar eclipse also requires the Moon and the Sun to be in the direct line of the Earth. However, it is visible from a small area since people who see the total eclipse are in the centre of the Moon's shadow when it hits Earth. An annular eclipse differs from a total eclipse based on the distance of the Moon from the Earth. It occurs when the Moon is farthest from Earth, which makes it look smaller than usual and does not block the entire view of the Sun.Also Read | Four eclipses in 2021, two to be visible in IndiaMuch of Europe, Asia and North America, Atlantic, Arctic regions will witness at least a partial eclipse. While the eclipse will not be visible from India, except in some parts of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, people can see the eclipse via a live webcam. Some parts of Canada, Russia, and Greenland will witness an annular eclipse. Major global cities like New York, Washington DC, London, and Toronto, will see a partial eclipse, with New York to witness more than 70 per cent coverage of the Sun.Unlike lunar eclipses, solar eclipses last only a few minutes and eclipse enthusiasts should never look directly at the Sun. They are advised to use proper safety equipment to look at any type of solar eclipse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-to-occur-on-june-10-some-regions-to-witness-ring-eclipse-101622030014637.html

26-05-2021||World||Why is Chinese state media targeting Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy? All you need to know||The recent remark by top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on the origins of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has drawn the ire of the Chinese state media. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, wrote a blistering opinion piece on Tuesday, accusing Dr Fauci of attempting to hype “the old and groundless narrative” of coronavirus leaking from a Wuhan laboratory. “In terms of expertise and influence, American experts such as Fauci can hardly match Chinese top experts,” wrote Hu.“American experts are weaker than their Chinese counterparts in understanding the epidemic and influencing the anti-virus fight,” he added.The theories over the origins of coronavirus have been contested since the early days of the outbreak as many experts suggested a possible laboratory accident in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epicentre of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. But a global study, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), deemed it “extremely unlikely”.Why is Dr Fauci 'not convinced'?An international team of experts, who visited Wuhan in January to probe the origins of the virus, identified two most likely scenarios that might have caused SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the human population, including the one involving intermediary host species. At a virtual event titled ‘United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking’, Fauci was asked whether he was fully convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.”"I am not convinced...I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened," said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus," he added.Watch | ‘Not 100% sure Covid-19 developed naturally’: Dr Anthony FauciUS intelligence report on Wuhan labWhile the comments by Fauci were made on May 11, the footage of the event gained traction after The Wall Street Journal, citing US intelligence, reported that three scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalised in November 2019. The report was followed by the United States demanding a “transparent” second phase of investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and the route of introduction to the human population."Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based, and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak," US health secretary Xavier Becerra said in a video message at the 74th World Health Assembly (WHA).Another Global Times article called The Wall Street Journal report “an outright lie that came from nowhere.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had not been exposed to Covid-19 before December 30, 2019, and there has been a "zero-infection" record among its staff and graduate students so far. “What is the real purpose for the US to continue to play up the so-called "lab leak theory"? Does it really care about the origin-tracing of the virus or just wants to divert attention?” Zhao asked rhetorically at a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-is-chinese-state-media-targeting-fauci-amid-us-intelligence-on-wuhan-lab-101622023182659.html
26-05-2021||World||Biden set to name close ally as ambassador to India||US President Joe Biden is reportedly ready to name a close political ally Eric Garcetti, current Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, as ambassador to India.Axios, which first reported Biden could pick Garcetti some time ago, said in a report on Tuesday that the president appears to have settled on him for India and an announcement could be made as early as next week, along with other ambassadorial nominations that will be sent together to the Senate for confirmation.Garcetti, 50 was one of the co-chairs of Biden’s presidential campaign and was also part of a panel that the then Democratic nominee had set up to look for his running mate. After the election, Garcetti was named one of the co-chairs of the inauguration committee.The Los Angeles mayor was widely expected to get a cabinet berth and reports had suggested that time he was being considered for secretary housing. But, his chances dimmed after he was seen as being indifferent to allegations of sexual harassment against a top aide, including by a journalist.American presidents are known to send close political allies and donors on ambassadorial assignments. Host countries are most willing to welcome political allies who apparently have the ability to reach the president, or the White House, directly, skipping over the multiple layers of state department bureaucracy.After BA and MA from Columbia University, Garcetti went to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar (as former president Bill Clinton) and then went on to the London School of Economics. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist (and secretary of state Antony Blinken plays the guitar and has his own band) and a photographer.If named and confirmed by the Senate, Garcetti will succeed Ken Juster, who was sent by former president Donald Trump, and will from New Delhi helm a bilateral relationship that has grown in depth and breadth significantly in recent years, across administrations of both the parties.Picking up from where president Trump left off, President Biden signaled an early commitment to the relationship. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders he called after moving into the White House and hosted the first summit of the leaders of the Quad, which includes India. Biden dispatched one of his senior cabinet members defence secretary Lloyd Austin to New Delhi as part of first foreign visits by his top officials; invited Modi to a climate summit; backed a proposal by India and South Africa to temporarily waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines; and sent $100 million worth of oxygen supplies, PPEs and therapeutics to help India deal with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 cases.Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar is currently on a five-day tour of the United States and reaches Washington DC on Wednesday for the first in-person engagement by an Indian cabinet member with the Biden administration in the US. He is meeting secretary of state Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and US trade representative Katherine Tai, and others, including business leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-set-to-name-close-ally-as-ambassador-to-india-101622020453329.html

He was flown to an Anchorage hospital.Rawski had been descending Denali, which stands at 20,310 feet, when he fell, park spokeswoman Sharon Stiteler said.After climbing was shut down last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, crowds are back on North America's highest peak. There were 382 climbers on the mountain on Tuesday, six of whom had made it to the summit, Stiteler said.Rawski’s fall was this season’s third serious climbing accident in mountainous Denali National Park, though the first on Denali itself.On May 3, a ski mountaineer died after falling into a glacial crevasse in the southeastern part of the park. Ten days later, a climber was killed and his partner injured when they were struck by a block of ice that fell on them while they were ascending a ridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-climber-critically-injured-in-1-000-foot-fall-on-denali-101622014892412.html
26-05-2021||World||NY prosecutors convene grand jury in Trump probe||Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, has convened a grand jury that will decide whether or not to indict former president Donald Trump, executives of his company or the business itself based on evidence brought before it, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday.The grand jury, whose proceedings are not open to public, will meet three days a week. That, Vance has convened the panel is being taken as a sign that his investigations have reached a stage where his prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to seek indictments.If indicted, Trump, who has never been charged criminally, will be the only American president charged with committing a crime. He already holds the dubious distinction of being the only president impeached twice, he picked up the second just days before leaving office in January.Trump dismissed the development as the “continuation of the greatest witch hunt in American history”.“This is purely political, and an affront to the almost 75 million voters who supported me in the presidential election, and it’s being driven by highly partisan Democrat prosecutors,” Trump said. “Our country is broken, our elections are rigged, corrupt, and stolen, our prosecutors are politicised, and I will just have to keep on fighting like I have been for the last five years!”Vance’s criminal investigation is one of the two Trump is facing in New York, where he had lived and worked before moving to Florida. The other is a civil case by New York state attorney general Letitia James that she recently broadened to investigate the Trump Organization in a “criminal capacity”. Both Vance and James are Democrats.Both cases started in 2018, stemming from a congressional testimony given by Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer and fixer, after he was convicted of making hush-money payments to women who claimed to have had sexual relations with Trump (Trump has denied those allegations), and for lying to Congress. Cohen told lawmakers the Trump Organization manipulated valuation of its properties and assets to gain favourable loans and decrease tax liability.Vance expanded his probe speedily to look into Trump’s financial records and is reportedly pressuring Trump Organization’s chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg into cooperating against his boss. His former daughter-in-law is, in fact, cooperating with Vance’s office and has turned over copious amounts of documents to his prosecutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-prosecutors-convene-grand-jury-in-trump-probe-101622008332981.html
26-05-2021||World||John Cena apologies to furious Chinese fans for calling Taiwan a ‘country’||Professional wrestling and F9 star John Cena has had to make a public apology to millions of Chinese fans after calling Taiwan a country, saying the comment was not appropriate.Cena described Taiwan as a country in a promotional video for the movie Fast and Furious 9 earlier this month to a Taiwanese broadcasting channel, triggering a big backlash in China.China regards Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, a breakaway region and has never ruled out reunification by military force.Following the online backlash, Cena posted a video message in Mandarin on his Twitter-like Weibo account in China on Tuesday, apologising for making the comment.Cena said he was “sorry” for making the mistake without specifically describing what the mistake was.“I made a mistake. I must say right now. It’s so important, I love and respect Chinese people,” Cena said to his 600,000 fans on his Weibo account.“I’m very sorry for my mistakes. Sorry. Sorry. I’m really sorry. You have to understand that I love and respect China and the Chinese people.”Earlier in May, Cena said Taiwan would be the first country where the film, the latest in Hollywood star Vin Diesel-led blockbuster franchise, would be screened.The movie was expected to release on May 18 in Taiwan but was postponed following a surge in Covid-19 cases.Cena’s apology seems to have been made in time.Fast and Furious 9 is raking in the money in China, which, driven by post-pandemic recovery, is now the largest movie market in the world. It surpassed the US last year, making it a critical sector for Hollywood’s big releases.According to Chinese state media, Cena’s apology was welcomed by some Chinese netizens, who said he may have been guided by misinformation.“As Cena said, he is given a lot of information every day, so it’s possible that in the interview in Taiwan, he was deliberately given the wrong information and made a slip of the tongue… but at least he came up and corrected his mistake, rather than hiding and not responding to it,” a Weibo user was quoted as saying by the Global Times.F9 has been leading China’s box office since Monday, the fourth day of its release. “Featuring a new adventure with the leading characters as high-performance drivers, the movie raked in 67 million yuan (about $10.45 million) on Monday, accounting for nearly 72% of the total daily box office sales,” the official news agency Xinhua reported.The film was officially released on the Chinese mainland on May 21. It has earned 990 million yuan ($155 million) as of Tuesday evening.The film worldwide earned $162 million during last weekend, of which a massive $135 million came from China, according to state media.Cena is the latest western star to be criticised by Chinese online nationalists over Taiwan.Last week, The popular Thai drama Girl from Nowhere distributed by Netflix - even though the streaming site is blocked in China - faced backlash in China after showing the Taiwan flag.In the past, China has targeted western entertainers for meeting or interacting with the India-based Tibetan spiritual leader, Dalai Lama.More recently foreign retailers, airlines and hotels have been attacked online in China over Taiwan and on the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-cena-apologies-to-furious-chinese-fans-for-calling-taiwan-a-country-101622005994861.html
26-05-2021||World||Jaishankar, Guterres discuss Covid-19 vaccines, Afghanistan||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has stressed the need for finding “urgent and effective” global vaccine solutions and called for “greater production” and “fairer distribution” in his meeting with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres.At their first in-person meeting on Tuesday since India began its eighth term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in January, the two leaders also discussed a full range of subjects including climate change, counterterrorism, developments in India’s neighbourhood and underscored the need to adequately protect the “gains” of the last two decades in Afghanistan in the context of US withdrawal of troops.“Discussed the Covid challenge, underlining the importance of finding urgent & effective global vaccine solutions,” Jaishankar wrote on Twitter after the meeting, which was held at the United Nations in New York. “Critical to ramp up the vaccine supply chain to ensure greater production & fairer distribution.”They discussed that the proposal by India and South Africa for TRIPS waiver of Covid-19 vaccine patents can also contribute to greater production and more equity, said a readout of their conversation issued by India. The United States recently announced support for the proposal paving the way for negotiations to start towards adopting a text to that effect.Jaishankar also expressed appreciation of Guterres’s leadership of the United Nations “especially in these challenging times”; and conveyed to him India’s support for a second term. A former Portuguese prime minister, Guterres was elected secretary-general in 2016 and is seeking a second term calling himself a “bridge-builder and an honest broker”.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the two leaders had a “very good discussion” and “discussed Covid-19, the issue of vaccines, and also a number of other peace and security issues in general”.Jaishankar is on a five-day tour of the United States, with two days in New York and the last two in Washington DC where he is expected to meet secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and other officials for a wide range of discussions, including on Covid-19, increasing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and the Quad.At the UN meeting, the two leaders exchanged views on climate action, and minister Jaishankar said, “Greater resources are essential for larger ambitions. Financing will determine our seriousness and credibility.” India has called for increased financing to help developing countries meet their mitigation targets.The two leaders “agreed that greater ambitions required more resources and greater commitment from the developed world”, said the readout.Jaishankar also highlighted India “constructive role” at the UN Security Council and conveyed priorities for India’s presidency of the body for August, which will include “high-level events on maritime security and on technology and peacekeeping”.About “regional challenges” in India’s neighbourhood, the minister shared “concerns about ensuring that the gains of the last two decades in Afghanistan are adequately protected”. President Joe Biden has said all US troops will leave Afghanistan before September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that brought US-led international forces to the country in search of Al-Qaeda leaders and operatives.He added that countering terrorism and radicalisation “remain priorities for the entire region”.The two leaders also discussed recent developments in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jaishankar-guterres-discuss-covid-19-vaccines-afghanistan-101622003773975.html
26-05-2021||World||Pakistan FM Qureshi rules out providing military bases to US in future||Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Tuesday said in the Senate that Pakistan would not provide its military bases to the United States for future counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and also not allow drone attacks inside Pakistan.The foreign minister also rejected as unfounded the reports of providing the US, bases in Pakistan, making it clear that Prime Minister Imran Khan would never provide its bases to the US, nor would allow drone attacks inside Pakistan, reported The News International."I want to assure the House that Pakistan is in safe hands," he remarked.The remarks came after a Pentagon official said that Pakistan had allowed the US military to use its airspace and given ground access so that it could support its presence in Afghanistan.Responding to the concerns of a senator, the Qureshi said, "Because what we were fearing and we still fear and are concerned that a vacuum created in Afghanistan can drag or suck the country back into the decade of 1990s".Qureshi contended that as the US planned to withdraw its remaining troops from Afghanistan by September 11, Pakistan would continue playing its role for advancement of the peace process in that country, reported The News International.Mian Raza Rabbani, ex-chairman Senate, also said that Pakistan should not allow the United States the use of its air and ground facilities for action in Afghanistan and an international mechanism be thrashed out to prevent such circumstances from happening again.Meanwhile, diplomatic sources in Washington told Dawn that Pakistan had always allowed overflights and ground access to the US to facilitate its military presence in Afghanistan and would continue to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fm-qureshi-rules-out-providing-military-bases-to-us-in-future-101621997594440.html
26-05-2021||World||Covid-19 variant first detected in India found in at least 53 territories: WHO||The coronavirus variant first detected in India has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, a World Health Organization report showed Wednesday.Additionally, the WHO has received information from unofficial sources that the B.1.617 variant has been found in seven other territories, figures in the UN health agency's weekly epidemiological update showed, taking the total to 60.The report said B.1.617 had shown increased transmissibility, while disease severity and risk of infection were under investigation.Globally over the past week, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decrease, with around 4.1 million new cases and 84,000 new deaths reported -- a 14 percent and two percent decrease respectively compared to the previous week.The WHO's European region reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths in the past seven days, followed by the southeast Asia region.The numbers of cases reported by the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and the Western Pacific region were similar to those reported in the previous week."Despite a declining global trend over the past four weeks, incidence of Covid-19 cases and deaths remain high, and substantial increases have been observed in many countries throughout the world," the document said.The highest numbers of new cases in the past seven days were reported from India (1,846,055 -- down 23 percent); Brazil (451,424 -- up three percent); Argentina (213,046 -- up 41 percent), the United States (188,410 -- down 20 percent), and Colombia (107,590 -- down seven percent).- Variant detection -The update gave information on the four mutations classed as variants of concern: those first reported in Britain (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1) and India (B.1.617).When counting up the total number of territories reporting each variant, the WHO added together those from which it had official and unofficial information.B.1.1.7 has now been reported in 149 territories; B.1.351 in 102 territories and P.1 in 59 territories.The WHO split up figures for the B.1.617 variant into three lineages (B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3).The first has been reported in a total of 41 territories, the second in 54 and the third in six: Britain, Canada, Germany, India, Russia and the United States.Together, lineages of the B.1.617 variant were officially recorded in 53 territories and unofficially in another seven.The update also listed six variants of interest that are being monitored.One was first discovered in multiple countries, two of them were first found in the United States, while the three others were first discovered in Brazil, the Philippines and France."Virus evolution is expected, and the more SARS-CoV-2 circulates, the more opportunities it has to evolve," the report said."Reducing transmission through established and proven disease-control methods... are crucial aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-covid-19-variant-found-in-at-least-53-territories-who-101621996910662.html
26-05-2021||World||New grand jury seated for next stage of Trump investigation||New York prosecutors have convened a special grand jury to consider evidence in a criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump's business dealings, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Tuesday.The development signals that the Manhattan district attorney's office was moving toward seeking charges as a result of its two-year investigation, which included a lengthy legal battle to obtain Trump's tax records.The person familiar with the matter was not authorised to speak publicly and did so on the condition of anonymity. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into a variety of matters such as hush-money payments paid to women on Trump's behalf, property valuations and employee compensation.The Democratic prosecutor has been using an investigative grand jury through the course of his probe to issue subpoenas and obtain documents. That panel kept working while other grand juries and court activities were shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.The investigation includes scrutiny of Trump's relationship with his lenders, a land donation he made to qualify for an income tax deduction and tax write-offs his company claimed on millions of dollars in consulting fees it paid.The new grand jury could eventually be asked to consider returning indictments. While working on that case, it also will be hearing other matters. The Post reported that the grand jury will meet three days a week for six months.Trump contends the investigation is a "witch hunt"."This is purely political, and an affront to the almost 75 million voters who supported me in the Presidential Election, and it's being driven by highly partisan Democrat prosecutors," Trump said in a statement.Vance's office declined to comment.The new grand jury is the latest sign of increasing momentum in the criminal investigation into the Republican ex-president and his company, the Trump Organization.Attorney General Letitia James said last week that she assigned two lawyers to work with Vance's office on the probe after her civil investigation into Trump evolved into a criminal matter.James, a Democrat, said her office also is continuing its civil investigation into Trump. She did not say what prompted her office to expand its investigation into a criminal probe.In recent months, Vance hired former mafia prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to help run the investigation and has been interviewing witnesses, including Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.Vance declined to run for reelection and will leave office at the end of the year, meaning the Trump case is likely to pass to his successor in some form. An election next month is all but certain to determine who that will be.Trump said in a statement last week that he is being "unfairly attacked and abused by a corrupt political system". He contends the investigations are part of a Democratic plot to silence his voters and block him from running for president again.In February, the US Supreme Court buoyed Vance's investigation by clearing the way for the prosecutor to enforce a subpoena on Trump's accounting firm and obtain eight years of tax returns and related documents for the former president, the Trump Organization and other Trump entities.The documents are protected by grand jury secrecy rules and are not expected to be made public.Vance's investigation has appeared to focus in recent weeks on Trump's longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg. His former daughter-in-law, Jen Weisselberg, is cooperating with both inquiries.She has given investigators reams of tax records and other documents as they look into whether some Trump employees were given off-the-books compensation, such as apartments or school tuition.Allen Weisselberg was subpoenaed in James' civil investigation and testified twice last year. His lawyer declined to comment when asked on Tuesday if he had been subpoenaed to testify before the new grand jury.A message seeking comment was left with Jen Weisselberg's lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-grand-jury-seated-for-next-stage-of-trump-investigation-101621995268206.html
26-05-2021||World||Floyd family meets Biden a year after death, push for law||They mourned together and laughed together in the Oval Office -- and spoke of what President Joe Biden called "the hard reality that racism has long torn us apart".The first anniversary of George Floyd's death was supposed to be a milestone moment in Washington, a time to mark the passage of a policing law to make criminal justice more just. Instead, Floyd's family met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House on Tuesday to commemorate their loss and continue to push for legislation."It was a remembrance of what happened to my brother," Philonise Floyd said of the meeting with Biden, calling the president "a genuine guy".Biden told them "he just wants the bill to be meaningful and that it holds George's legacy intact", said George Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams. Williams said Biden showed "genuine concern" for how the family is doing.Biden took time during the meeting to play with George Floyd's young daughter Gianna, who enjoyed some ice cream and Cheetos, the president said, after she told him she was hungry.Later, she stood before the cameras outside the White House and softly called out, "say his name". Family members chanted in return: "George Floyd."A sister, Bridgett Floyd, stayed away, aiming to come to Washington only when there is a bill to be signed into law."That is when I will make my way to DC," she said from Minnesota.She and several other family members joined Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others marking the anniversary in the city where George Floyd died, and other events took place in New York, Los Angeles and other cities in the US and abroad.Speaking to reporters at the end of the day, Biden said he had spoken with congressional negotiators and was "hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day, we will have an agreement".With the proposed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act still pending, his family began the day meeting with legislators and headed back to Capitol Hill later from the White House.They met Tuesday morning with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Karen Bass, D-Calif., who ushered the bill through the House. The Floyds met late in the day with Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate's lead negotiators on the bill. The family then visited Black Lives Matter Plaza, the site near the White House where protesters gathered throughout last summer."I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by their thoughts," Scott said of the family. "I wish I was negotiating with them," he said, though he also repeated the line of the day that progress was being made.Earlier at the Capitol, alongside Pelosi and other lawmakers, Philonise Floyd declared of his brother: "Today is the day that he set the world in a rage.""We need to be working together to make sure that people do not live in fear in America anymore," he said.The Floyd family's meetings with some of Washington's most powerful officials produced plenty of comments about optimism and moving forward. Nonetheless, the lack of a final deal contrasted sharply with advocates' high hopes just last month, when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's conviction for Floyd's killing and then Biden's nationally televised speech to Congress calling for action by May 25 gave supporters a sense of momentum.The current standoff underscores the political complexities of an issue that is a top concern for many of both parties' voters -- Democrats' progressives and voters of colour, and Republicans' law-and-order conservatives.Floyd died on May 25, 2020, after police officer Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes while arresting him. His death sparked months of nationwide racial protests, a worldwide global reckoning over racism and a renewed debate over police reform. Chauvin was convicted last month of multiple charges.Though a legislative response has been elusive, negotiators have displayed a steady solidarity that is unusual for such talks, never publicly sniping at each other.It is a high-profile legislative fight in which Biden has notably taken a back seat, preferring to leave the work of crafting a compromise to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in contrast to his fevered advocacy, both public and private, for his infrastructure bill and COVID-19 relief package."We have been respecting the space needed for negotiators to have these discussions," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday.She and congressional negotiators declined to offer a new deadline for reaching an agreement. Bass, the top House Democratic bargainer, said talks would continue "until we get the job done". Scott said negotiations "have a long way to go still, but it is starting to take form".The Democratic-controlled House approved a sweeping bill in March that would make it easier for individual police officers to be sued and charged with crimes. It would also ban chokeholds, limit no-knock warrants and create a national database of officers with histories of complaints and disciplinary problems.That bill has gone nowhere in the Senate, where the 50 Democrats will need support from at least 10 Republicans to overcome a bill-killing filibuster.GOP lawmakers have preferred more modest changes.Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump said Biden told them "he does not want to sign a bill that does not have substance and meaning"."So he is going to be patient, to make sure it is the right bill, not a rushed bill," Crump said.

26-05-2021||World||'Need transparent process from China' on virus origin: White House Covid adviser||A senior White House coronavirus adviser has said the world needs to "get to the bottom" of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic while adding that the WHO and China need to do more to reach the definitive answers in the matter."It is our position that we need to get to the bottom of this and we need a completely transparent process from China. We need the WHO (World Health Organization) to assist in that matter. We don't feel like that we have that now," said WH Covid advisor Andy Slavitt on Tuesday during a briefing."We need to get to the bottom of this whatever the answer may be and that's a critical priority for us," he added.Answering the same question during the briefing, Dr Anothy Fauci, the Biden administration's top medical adviser said they "feel strongly" that the world should continue with the investigation and go to the next phase of the probe that the WHO has done."Because we don't know 100 per cent what the origin is, it's imperative that we look and do an investigation," he added.This statement comes a few days after an explosive Wall Street Journal report stated that three researchers from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology sought hospital care after they fell ill in November 2019, a month before Beijing reported the first patient with Covid-like symptoms."The US government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses," the report read, fueling debate of the lab leak theory.The revelations come amid growing calls for a fuller probe on whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the Chinese laboratory. It also comes on the eve of a meeting of the WHO decision-making body, which is expected to discuss the next phase of investigation into the origin of Covid-19.Earlier this year, the WHO report determined that the possibility the virus came from a lab was "extremely unlikely," noting there was "no record" any lab had closely related viruses. The probe was criticized by various countries including the US, and UK over its limited access to "complete, original data and samples."The organization was also accused of being overly deferential to China throughout the course of the study, which was co-authored by 17 Chinese scientists -- several of them from state-run institutions.China refused to give raw data on early Covid-19 cases to the WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been accused of delaying access to international investigators for months after the initial outbreak, virtually guaranteeing that the lab had been deep-cleaned before any forensic analysis could be done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-transparent-process-from-china-on-virus-origin-white-house-covid-adviser-101621989902198.html
26-05-2021||World||As global outrage grows, airlines shun Belarus air space||Airlines shunned Belarus’s air space on Tuesday and Belarusian planes faced a possible ban from Europe as international outrage mounted over Minsk forcing down a jetliner and arresting a dissident journalist who was on board.A video released overnight showed 26-year-old Roman Protasevich confessing to having organised anti-government demonstrations hours after he was pulled off a flight from Greece to Lithuania forced down in the Belarusian capital Minsk.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the video made for “distressing viewing” and Belarus would face consequences.Belarus did not immediately comment on the torture allegation but has consistently denied abusing detainees. Rights groups have documented hundreds of cases of as abuse and forced confessions during a crackdown on pro-democracy activists.France and Ireland have described the incident as piracy. On Tuesday NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called it a “state hijacking”.Belarusian state media have reported that President Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the flight to be intercepted. Belarus says it was responding to a bomb scare that later proved to be a false alarm. The UN agency ICAO has said the incident may have violated the foundational treaty governing international civil aviation, the 1944 Chicago Convention.European Union leaders at a summit on Monday called for airlines based in the 27-member bloc to halt flights over Belarusian air space, which is along a major corridor connecting Europe and Asia and earns hard currency from overflight rights.The EU leaders directed officials to draw up new sanctions against Belarus, and to work out a way to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc’s skies. Belarus’s neighbour, Ukraine, also announced a ban on flights to or from Belarus, and on its own airlines using Belarusian air space.Lukashenko has so far shrugged off Western sanctions, which bar various officials from travelling or doing business in the United States and EU.Politicians in the West have called for tougher measures. But they have failed to influence the behaviour of Lukashenko, who enjoys unwavering financial and security support from Russia.Moscow denied suggestions by the West that it may have assisted Belarus in the operation. Russia has also accused Western countries of hypocrisy, noting a Bolivian presidential plane was diverted to Austria in 2013 after reports it carried US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-global-outrage-grows-airlines-shun-belarus-air-space-101621989426678.html
26-05-2021||World||George Floyd's family lobbies Biden for US police reform on anniversary of death||A year after his killing sparked a national reckoning over U.S. racial injustice, George Floyd's relatives met on Tuesday with President Joe Biden at the White House and with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to urge passage of police reform legislation in their loved one's name.Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died in handcuffs with his neck pinned to a Minneapolis street under a white police officer's knee, become the face of a national movement against police brutality and bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.His dying words, "I can't breathe," have echoed as a slogan in street demonstrations that convulsed the United States and the world last summer in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic.But Monday's private Oval Office visit marked the first time any of Floyd's family had been hosted at the White House, occupied since January by a Democratic administration.Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, was widely criticized for political rhetoric seen as inflaming racial tensions heightened in the aftermath of Floyd's death.Floyd's relatives used their pilgrimage to Washington on the anniversary of his death to lobby Biden and Congress for the enactment of legislation ensuring the just treatment of minorities by law enforcement.In March, the Democratic-majority House of Representatives passed a bill, dubbed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, to ban contentious police tactics such as "choke holds," while making it easier to sue individual police officers for unlawful conduct.A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been working to hammer out a compromise to win enough Republican support to ensure passage in the Senate, where Democrats hold a razor-thin margin of control."If you can make federal laws to protect the (national) bird, which is the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of color," Floyd's brother Philonise said on the White House driveway he after five other family members met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.He described Biden as supportive, calling him "a genuine guy.""He did let us know that he supports passing the bill, but he wants to make sure that is the right bill and not a rushed bill," said Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams.Moments before departing the White House by helicopter a short time later for a flight back to his home state of Delaware, Biden told reporters he had spoken to negotiators on the bill and said he was "hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day we'll have an agreement.""We have to act," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we're all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart."Earlier in the day, Floyd's family, including his daughter, Gianna, and two other brothers, met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers who promised to secure passage of the legislation.Senator Tim Scott, the lead Republican negotiator, told reporters on Tuesday that a main point of contention remained qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields individual police officers from lawsuits in certain circumstances.Republicans oppose provisions in the bill rolling back such immunity, while many liberal Democrats say they would only support a bill that abolished it."We have a long way to go still, but it's starting to take form," Scott said.Floyd's life celebratedIn Minneapolis, a foundation created in Floyd's memory by some in his family organized an afternoon of music and food in a park near the downtown courtroom where Derek Chauvin, the former officer, was convicted last month of murdering Floyd.Chauvin, 45, faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced on June 25. Three other officers at the scene have pleaded not guilty to aiding and abetting Chauvin, and will go on trial next year. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the day after Floyd was killed.Later on Tuesday, mourners were set to gather for a candlelight vigil at the stretch of road where Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck. Darnella Frazier, a teenage bystander, recorded the killing on her cellphone, uploading video to Facebook that horrified people around the world. Floyd had been suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.By the afternoon, small crowds were gathering at the intersection for a festive, sunny afternoon of music and children's activities. A man set out paint ready to create a fresh mural in the square, which has been closed to most vehicle traffic for a year and is filled with flowers and art commemorating Floyd and other Black victims of police violence.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were due to join activists in a city park for nine minutes and 29 seconds of silence in memory of Floyd's murder.Demonstrations were planned in New York City. Earlier on Tuesday, Shaun Donovan, a Democratic candidate for mayor, was among a group of five protesters arrested for blocking traffic near a major tunnel into Manhattan.Legislation has been pursued in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to increase the accountability or oversight of police, and 24 states have enacted new laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-family-lobbies-biden-for-us-police-reform-on-anniversary-of-death-101621987122449.html
26-05-2021||World||UK's Covid 'disaster' to be laid bare by PM Johnson's ex-chief adviser||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief adviser will on Wednesday cast his former boss as a dithering leader surrounded by fools whose ineptitude led to a "disastrous" response to the most devastating global pandemic in decades.With almost 128,000 deaths, the United Kingdom has the world's fifth worst official Covid toll, and Johnson was slow to appreciate the significance of the threat from the virus in early 2020 as it spread from China towards Britain's shores.Dominic Cummings, the strategist behind the 2016 Brexit campaign and Johnson's landslide election win in 2019, will be quizzed by British lawmakers from 0830 GMT on the lessons that can be learned from the pandemic.Cummings, who left the government late last year, has said the British health ministry was a "smoking ruin", that Western governments failed during the crisis, and that the secretive British state was woefully unprepared for the pandemic."The Covid plan was supposed to be 'world class' but turned out to be part disaster, part non-existent," Cummings said on May 18 in one of dozens of tweets forming a critique of Britain's response."If we'd had the right preparations competent people in charge, we would probably have avoided lockdown1, *definitely* no need for lockdowns 2&3," he said.Cummings, played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the film "Brexit: The Uncivil War", casts the British state as an outdated system run by incompetent amateurs who are resistant to any innovation that would bring them closer to the modern world.British officials, he said, failed to learn the early Covid lessons from Asia, were resistant to new ideas from young scientists, overly secretive, overly bureaucratic and lacked any real scrutiny from a compliant domestic media.Asked about Cummings' criticism, Johnson's spokesman said: "At all times we have been guided by the data and the latest evidence we had."In a series of investigations, Reuters has reported how the British government made several errors: it was slow to spot the infections arriving, it was late with a lockdown and it continued to discharge infected hospital patients into care homes.The government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said in March 2020 that 20,000 deaths would be a good outcome. Soon after, a worst-case scenario prepared by government scientific advisers put the possible death toll at 50,000. The toll is now close to 128,000.Johnson has admitted that mistakes were made and that lessons need to be learned, but his ministers say they were working at pace in the biggest public health crisis in a century.Johnson has pointed to Britain's vaccination programme as a success that will allow the economy to rebound before its peers.Britain has the world's fifth fastest vaccination programme, based on shots per 100 people, behind the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Bahrain and Chile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-covid-disaster-to-be-laid-bare-by-pm-johnson-s-ex-chief-adviser-101621985411168.html

They have interacted virtually before, including at a climate summit hosted by the American president.“The leaders will discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the US-Russia relationship,” the White House said. The Geneva meeting comes amid rising tensions between the two countries over a growing list of issues, including Russian meddling in US elections, the SolarWinds hacking of the networks of the US government and companies, and Moscow’s handling of the jailed dissident Alexei Navalny.US secretary of state Antony Blinken met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Reykjavik, Iceland last week on the sidelines of a meeting of the Arctic Council.Blinken had conveyed to Lavrov at that time that the US desired “a more stable and predictable relationship with Moscow”.Blinken had listed out the issues hanging over the relationship: Russia’s continued military deployment in and near Ukraine, actions against VOA and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the health of Navalny, and the “repression of opposition organisations”.They had also discussed Syria, the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and “areas in which both of our people could benefit from sustained and enhanced cooperation” such as Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programme.Just hours before the meeting, the Biden administration announced it was calling off proposed sanctions on a Russian company that runs pipelines carrying natural gas to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-and-vladimir-putin-to-meet-in-geneva-on-june-16-101621969091828.html
26-05-2021||World||Nepal gets a consulate in Chinese city of Chengdu where India was promised one||Nepal has opened a consulate general in China’s southwestern city of Chengdu, its fifth diplomatic mission in the country, in the latest symbol of increasingly close ties between Kathmandu and Beijing.India and China had reached an agreement in 2015 to establish an Indian consulate in Chengdu and one for China in Chennai. Neither has come up.Apart from an embassy in Beijing, Nepal has a consulate each in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), and Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, an economic powerhouse. It also has a consulate office in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China.Nepal will be among the handful of countries to have a diplomatic mission in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.The Himalayan country, sandwiched between India and China, is the only one to have a consulate general in Lhasa.Speaking at the inauguration on Monday, Nepalese ambassador Mahendra Bahadur Pandey said mutual trust, understanding and good neighbourliness have remained the hallmarks of Nepal-China bilateral relations since ancient times.According to a press statement released by the Nepalese embassy in Beijing, the vice-governor of Sichuan government, Li Yunze said the establishment of the consulate general would facilitate the promotion of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.Incidentally, during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China in 2015, New Delhi and Beijing had reached an agreement to establish new consulates in each other’s countries - in Chengdu and in Chennai.The decision to open an Indian consulate in Chengdu was taken after China said no to India’s request to open a consulate in Lhasa.Six years later, neither the Indian nor the Chinese consulate has been established, a sign of fraught bilateral ties.In the interim period, ties between China and Nepal seemingly deepened. According to the Nepalese government, China has been topping in FDI pledges to Nepal since 2015.“Of total FDI pledges that stand at $95 million, China alone pledged $88 million during the first quarter, according to the department. This represents nearly 93% of total foreign investments committed FDI, showing the dominant position of China when it comes to FDI commitments to the Himalayan nation,” a report by the Chinese news agency Xinhua said in 2019.Beijing also has plans to build the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network through TAR and Nepal as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation between the two countries.The opening of the new Nepalese mission in China comes weeks after Nepal took part, along with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, in a China-led foreign ministers’ virtual meeting with focus on controlling the Covid-19 pandemic.Chinese President Xi Jinping had visited Kathmandu in October 2019 for the first state visit to Nepal by a Chinese head of state in 23 years following his informal summit with Modi in Chennai.Last December, Xi and his Nepalese counterpart, Bidya Devi Bhandari, jointly announced the new height of Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, to be 8,848.86 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-gets-a-consulate-in-chinese-city-of-chengdu-where-india-was-promised-one-101621967893626.html
