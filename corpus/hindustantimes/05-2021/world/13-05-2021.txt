All 15 council members also have to agree to a meeting under rules guiding the body's virtual operations during the Covid-19 pandemic.Israel unleashed its offensive on militants in Gaza after Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.Worried hostilities could spiral out of control, the United States is sending an envoy to the region. Truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have so far offered no sign of progress."The Security Council and international community should do its outmost to contribute to avoid a full-scale crisis," Norway's UN Ambassador Mona Juul said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-objects-to-un-meeting-on-israel-gaza-on-friday-officials-101620929466924.html
13-05-2021||World||UK 'anxious' about Covid-19 variant first identified in India: PM Johnson||Britain is anxious about the spread of the novel coronavirus variant first detected in India and rules out nothing when it comes to re-introducing local restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday.Johnson has laid out a "cautious but irreversible" route out of lockdown for England, with the next step planned for next week. He has warned new variants, such as the B.1.617.2 variant, pose a risk to that plan."We are anxious about it - it has been spreading," Johnson said, adding that there would be meetings later on Thursday to discuss what to do."We're ruling nothing out," Johnson said.There has been a surge in cases of the variant in north-west England, and local politicians have called for a change in policy so any adult in the area can get a shot, even if they don't meet age-based priority criteria.The local council of the town of Blackburn said additional Covid-19 vaccination clinics would open next week to speed up shots, but denied reports that vaccines would be widely available to all over-18s in the area, saying eligibility for the shots would follow current guidance.After England's initial Covid-19 lockdown, Johnson had sought a regional approach to restrictions, which ultimately failed, and two further national lockdowns followed.He has sought a nationwide approach to the easing of restrictions this time, and reiterated that, despite the local surges in variant cases, he hoped restrictions would end across the whole nation in June."At the moment I can see nothing that dissuades me from thinking we'll be able to go ahead on Monday and June 21 everywhere," he added, referring to further steps to ease lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-anxious-about-covid-19-variant-first-identified-in-india-pm-johnson-101620929039920.html
13-05-2021||World||Gas crunch continues across much of US after pipeline hack||Gas pumps remained shrouded by plastic bags Thursday at thousands of service stations across more than a dozen US states, but the situation could improve as a pipeline company reported “substantial progress" in resuming operations after a computer hack led to its shutdown.Despite signs of progress in restarting the pipeline, nearly 70% of North Carolina's gas stations on Thursday were still without fuel, as were about half the stations in South Carolina and Georgia, GasBuddy.com reported. Drivers on the East Coast were also having trouble, with more than half the stations tapped out in Virginia. Washington, DC, was among the hardest-hit places Thursday, with 73% of stations out, the site's tracking service showed.President Joe Biden said Thursday that US officials do not believe the Russian government was involved in the Colonial Pipeline hack, but “we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia. That’s where it came from.”The US had been in direct communication with Moscow about the need to take action against ransom networks, Biden said. The FBI has said the ransomware belonged to a criminal syndicate known as DarkSide.In a Thursday update, the Georgia-based pipeline company said gasoline delivery is now underway in most of its markets.The Colonial Pipeline stretches from Texas to New Jersey, but the northeastern US has seen fewer disruptions since those states are supplied more by other sources such as ocean tankers.Gas is flowing again across most of the Deep South, and other parts that were offline in the Mid-Atlantic region were expected to become operational later Thursday, the company said.“We are not out of the woods yet, but the trees are thinning out,” Richard Joswick, global head of oil analytics at S&P Global Platts said in an email. He estimates that full recovery for the East Coast and Gulf Coast will take a couple of weeks at least due to lags and limits for all shipping options.The cybersecurity attack on the Colonial Pipeline forced a temporary shutdown of the nation's largest fuel pipeline, prompting panic-buying and long lines that quickly wiped out supplies around the southeastern US The company resumed pipeline operations late Wednesday, but said it would take several days for deliveries to return to normal.In Virginia, the run on gas prompted an urgent warning Thursday that people should never siphon gasoline after calls in recent days about people being poisoned.There have been a handful of cases in the region covered by the Blue Ridge Poison center at UVA Health, including a significant one Wednesday that prompted the warning, said Dr. Chris Holstege, the center’s medical director.A man using an opaque hose to siphon gasoline from a vehicle sucked gasoline right into his lungs, causing significant distress, Holstege said. He is expected to recover and didn’t have to go to intensive care, he said.The governors of both North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency to help ensure access. Other governors urged people not to hoard supplies.“Now that Colonial has restarted pipeline operations, we will see a gradually increasing return to normal conditions that will take several days,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement Thursday.Mary Goldburg, 60, of Norfolk, Virginia, said she needs her car for work but also to see her grandchildren — whom she barely got to see last year. Her job includes delivering T-shirts for events and other promotional products.“I can’t get paid until my customers get their products,” Goldburg said at a 7-Eleven.The Colonial Pipeline delivers about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast. There is no gasoline shortage, according to government officials and energy analysts, just delays in delivering the fuel from Gulf Coast refineries.The distribution problems have been fraying nerves.Two people were charged with assault after spitting in each other's faces over spots in a line at a Marathon station in Knightdale, outside Raleigh, on Tuesday afternoon, authorities said.In Walton County, Georgia, paramedic Jeff Lisle had just under a quarter-tank of gas in his Jeep and found a small amount in the cans he uses for his lawnmower in case he needed the extra boost to get to work.The shutdown even affected hikers long the Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine. They depend on cars and vans to access the trail and get supplies.“Everybody’s out here buying from the same gas pumps, so the lines are long, some are out -- you’ve really got to look for it,” said Ron Brown, who operates Ron’s Appalachian Trail Shuttles, which takes hikers from Atlanta’s airport into the north Georgia mountains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gas-crunch-continues-across-much-of-us-after-pipeline-hack-101620928388793.html
13-05-2021||World||Myanmar to free Japanese journalist as gesture to Tokyo||A Japanese freelance journalist in Myanmar who was jailed and charged with spreading false news or information that could cause public unrest will be freed by the country’s ruling junta as a gesture of friendship with Japan, a state television report said Thursday.The announcement on Myanmar's army-run Myawaddy TV said Yuki Kitazumi had been arrested on April 18 for “inciting” the country’s anti-military civil disobedience movement and riots.“Although the journalist is a lawbreaker, the case will be closed and he will be released at the request of the Special Envoy of the Japanese Government for National Reconciliation in Myanmar, in view of the close ties and future relations between Myanmar and Japan," said a news reader, quoting an official statement from the junta, formally called the State Administrative Council.The military seized power on Feb. 1, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. It has faced large and constant popular opposition, which it has tried to suppress with the use of force that has cost hundreds of lives and by muzzling the news media.Also Read| Japanese journalist, arrested in Myanmar, charged with spreading false newsJapan has criticized the military government’s deadly crackdown on opposition but has taken a milder approach than the United States and some other countries that imposed sanctions against members of the junta.Kitazumi, a former reporter for Japan’s Nikkei business news, had also been charged with violating visa regulations. He was the first foreign journalist to be charged under a statute which the state press has described as aiming at “fake news.”He has posted reports and views about developments in Myanmar on Facebook. Hours before his arrest, he posted a video showing Myanmar citizens gathering at a Tokyo temple to pay tribute to people killed by Myanmar security forces trying to quell protests.Kitazumi had been detained briefly by police in late February while covering pro-democracy protests in Myanmar.The announcement that he had been granted clemency came a day after a military court sentenced a Myanmar journalist to three years in prison for his reporting on similar charges.Min Nyo is a correspondent for DVB -- the Democratic Voice of Burma, an online and broadcast news agency — which has continued to operate despite being banned by the junta.A statement issued by DVB said Min Nyo had been covering a March 3 anti-junta protest in the town of Pyay, 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Yangon when he was arrested and severely beaten by police.About 80 journalists have been arrested since the military's takeover. Roughly half are still detained and most of them are being held under charges like the one for which Min Nyo was convicted, as are many activists opposed to the military regime.Rights group Amnesty International said Min Nyo’s case showed the ruthlessness of the junta and the risks faced by journalists exposing the junta’s abuses.“Min Nyo’s conviction must be quashed, and he should be released immediately – along with all other journalists, activists and human rights defenders imprisoned and detained solely for their peaceful opposition to the military coup,” Amnesty Deputy Regional Director Emerlynne Gil said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-to-free-japanese-journalist-as-gesture-to-tokyo-101620926690857.html
13-05-2021||World||K P Sharma Oli set to be reappointed as Nepal PM as Oppn fails to muster majority support||K P Sharma Oli was set to be reappointed as Nepal Prime Minister as the Opposition alliance of Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) on Thursday failed to muster majority support to form the next government.President Bidya Devi Bhandari had asked the Opposition parties to come up with the support of majority lawmakers to form a new government by 9 PM on Thursday after Oli lost a crucial trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday.As the Opposition parties failed to claim majority government under article 76 (2) of the Constitution, President Bhandari is likely to re-appoint Oli, 69, as Prime Minister under article 76 (3) tonight, sources said.Although Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba had received support from CPN Maoist chairman Pushpakamal Dahal 'Prachanda', he could not get support from Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP).JSP's President Upendra Yadav had assured to support Deuba but the party's another president Mahanta Thakur had rejected the idea.Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre have 61 and 49 seats in the lower house. Their combined strength was 110, which is insufficient to win majority vote.At present 136 votes are needed to form a majority government. JSP has 32 seats in the House. If JSP had extended support Deuba would get chance to claim for PM.The UML has 121 seats in the 275 member House. Madhav Nepal faction with 28 MPs had decided not to tender enmasse resignation after caretaker Prime Minister Oli and Nepal had inked a deal on Thursday.Oli withrew the action taken against four UML leaders including Nepal and assured to address their other demands. If 28 UML MPs had resigned, the total strength of the House of Representatives would be reduced to 243. Currently there are 271 valid members in the House. If they had resigned only 122 votes would be sufficient to stake claim for majority government.Earlier, Nepali Congress president Deuba and CPN-Maoist Centre chairman "Prachanda" held a meeting at the former's residence to discuss the formation of the new government.Similarly, caretaker Prime Minister and chairman of ruling CPN-UML Oli and dissident leader of the party Madhav Kumar Nepal held a meeting in an attempt to make the last effort to patch up their differences.Earlier, Baburam Bhattarai, a senior leader of JSP-N, said all parties needed to form a new national coalition government and hold elections in one year.Bhattarai said such a government should not be led by a former prime minister or the current prime minister.Bhattarai said such a government should be run based on a common minimum programme, should resolve the Covid crisis, and ensure economic relief packages, constitution amendment, and truth and reconciliation.Given the parties’ strengths and particularly the factional feuds in the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi, many say the current numbers game is just a futile exercise and that the country, which has had eight different governments in a decade, would sooner or later head towards early polls, the Kathmandu Post reported.After Oli lost the trust vote, the NC, the CPN -MC and the faction of the JSP led by Yadav urged President Bhandari to invoke Article 76 (2) of the Constitution to pave the way for the formation of a new government.It says in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President shall appoint as the prime minister a member of the House who can command the majority with the support of two or more parties in the lower house of Parliament.If two or more political parties failed to give a majority Prime Minister by Thursday evening then the President will invite parties to submit the name of a minority Prime Minister from the largest party as per Article 76 sub-clause 3 of the Constitution.In that case, Oli, whose party has 121 seats in Parliament, may again claim stake as the new prime minister. If Oli is appointed under the Constitution, he also needs to win the vote of confidence within 30 days from the date of the appointment.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls. Known for his pro-China stance, Oli had earlier served as the country's prime minister from October 11, 2015 to August 3, 2016 during which Kathmandu's ties with New Delhi had strained.Nepal's Covid-19 cases reached 431,191 as 8,842 fresh cases were reported in the past 24 hours on Thursday. As many as 214 more deaths were also logged, taking the national toll to 4,466.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oli-set-to-be-reappointed-as-nepal-pm-as-oppn-fails-to-muster-majority-support-101620925364656.html

Daily cases this month have so far averaged around 6,700 in the country, which has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia.Gatherings for religious events as well as for funerals for those who died of causes other than Covid-19 will be allowed but limited to up to 10% of the venue capacity.Duterte appealed to the public to "tone down" any religious gatherings and to stay mindful of the current situation."There is no way of knowing how long this (pandemic) will last," he said in a regular televised address.Heightened restrictions would still be in place, he said, and warned that he would hold local government officials responsible for any violations of health and safety protocols.The government remains on guard especially against more infectious coronavirus variants, and has temporarily barred travellers coming from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh.The health ministry said on Tuesday that the country has detected two cases of a variant first identified in India, which is facing a devastating Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-to-ease-covid-19-curbs-in-capital-as-daily-cases-decline-101620923507042.html
13-05-2021||World||Germany's small liberal party eyes big role in Merkel succession||After 16 years of rule under Angela Merkel, a small party that believes in big tax cuts and legalising cannabis wants to play kingmaker in Germany's next government. They might just pull it off.The latest opinion polls indicate that no two parties will command a comfortable majority after September's national election, offering the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) the chance to make up the numbers and wield outsized influence in the era following Merkel's exit after four terms as chancellor.Polling 10-12% now, the business-friendly FDP would likely be the third party to join the conservatives and the ecologist Greens if they cannot muster a majority, or to team up with the Greens and the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD).Those scenarios would see either conservative Armin Laschet or the Greens' Annalena Baerbock succeed Merkel as leader of Europe's largest economy and most populous country."Many constellations are conceivable," FDP leader Christian Lindner told Reuters in an interview. "There is a high probability that we will play a role."The FDP, which has contributed to the historical giants of German politics such as late foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has been in national government before, mostly in coalitions with the conservative CDU/CSU bloc or centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).After Germany's last election in 2017, the FDP entered talks with the conservatives and Greens on forming a so-called "Jamaica" coalition, named after their respective party colours which match the Caribbean nation's flag. But Lindner walked out, infuriating the others and forcing a repeat of the conservatives' awkward "grand coalition" with the SPD."Our red lines were broken, nothing was right back then," Lindner said, recalling that tax relief, strengthened education and the FDP's idea for a ministry for digitalization were not on the table. "We will be guided by such questions this time too."COALITION OPTIONSDespite the 2017 experience, Laschet has stated his clear preference for the FDP as his coalition ally, though they lack the numbers so far. He already governs with the FDP in his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia.Neither the Greens nor the Social Democrats with their chancellor candidate, current Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have signalled a preference for the next coalition.In the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the SPD and Greens have just renewed their coalition with the FDP, though the region's FDP chairman said after a March vote that "state politics and federal politics cannot be compared".Lindner told Reuters the conservatives are "the closest to us" and that "the CDU is rather undervalued". Several polls show the Greens overtaking Laschet's Christian Democrats (CDU).A sports car fan and reserve officer in the Luftwaffe air force, Lindner has badgered Merkel's government during the COVID-19 pandemic with questions about whether strict lockdowns against the coronavirus are necessary.Who would he like to share government with, and at what price?"We are not ruling out anything in terms of coalition options," Lindner said. "But the question does not arise at this point in time. We have to make it very clear what our priorities are in terms of content."The FDP, which champions individual civil rights, wants to allow the sale of cannabis in licensed shops, ease bureaucratic burdens on business and cut taxes to help shore up German industries hard hit by the pandemic.The Free Demovrats will convene a congress this weekend to formally adopt their election programme."Our goal is for black-green or green-black to fall short of a mandate majority," Lindner said with reference to the ecologist Greens and the conservative alliance of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Oskar Niedermayer, political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, said polling gave weight to the FDP's position: "This is not a flash in the pan anymore," he said.Whether the FDP can indeed wield the balance of power after the election "depends on how much change the stability-oriented Germans really want," said Karl-Rudolf Korte from the NRW School of Governance in Duisburg-Essen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-small-liberal-party-eyes-big-role-in-merkel-succession-101620907201542.html
13-05-2021||World||Judge postpones trial for 3 ex-cops charged in George Floyd’s death||The trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting in the death of George Floyd will be pushed back to March 2022, a judge ruled Thursday.Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao were scheduled to face trial Aug. 23 on charges they aided and abetted both murder and manslaughter. The officers’ co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, has already been convicted of murder and manslaughter counts. All four officers also face federal charges that allege they violated Floyd’s civil rights during his May 25 arrest.Judge Peter Cahill said he changed the date so the federal case can go forward first. He also said he felt the need to put some distance between the three officers’ trial and Chauvin’s due to all the publicity around the case.The news that the trial was being pushed back came during a Thursday hearing on pretrial motions. Defense attorneys for all three former officers agreed to the postponement. The state, via Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank, did not support the delay. It wasn’t made clear at Thursday’s motions hearing who originally sought the change.Cahill also weighed Thursday a request that prosecutors be sanctioned after media reports that Chauvin had planned to plead guilty a year ago, and allegations that they haven't disclosed information about the alleged coercion of a witness.Attorneys for Lane, Kueng and hao have said they want the court to require prosecuting attorneys to submit affidavits under oath that they aren't responsible for the leak to the media. In a filing late Wednesday, Thao's attorney also alleged that the Hennepin County medical examiner was coerced to include “neck compression” in his findings — and that prosecutors knew of it.The former officers waived their right to appear at Thursday’s hearing.Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is prosecuting the officers, has said allegations that his office was involved in a leak are false. His office had no immediate comment on the allegations of coercion. A spokeswoman for Dr. Andrew Baker, the medical examiner, said they could not comment due to the pending case.Chauvin, who was seen in widely viewed bystander video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck as the Black man said he couldn’t breathe, was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He’s to be sentenced June 25.Lane, Kueng and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Their trial was separated from Chauvin's to comply with COVID-19 courtroom spacing restrictions.Bob Paule, Thao's attorney, said in a court filing Wednesday that Baker initially said there was no physical evidence that Floyd died of asphyxiation. But after talking twice to Dr. Roger Mitchell – a former medical examiner in Washington, D.C. – he amended his findings to include neck compression as a factor, according to Paule.Paule said that in one of the conversations, Mitchell called Baker and told him he was going to submit an opinion piece critical of Baker's findings to the Washington Post. When Baker released final autopsy findings June 1, they included neck compression, Paule wrote, and Mitchell never submitted his piece to the newspaper.Mitchell, now chairman of the Department of Pathology at the Howard University College of Medicine, did not immediately respond to a phone message left at the department after hours.Paule also took aim at Mitchell's criticism of Dr. David Fowler, a key defense witness for Chauvin who testified that the former officer was not responsible for Floyd's death. Mitchell sent a letter — signed by 431 doctors from around the country — to the Maryland attorney general, saying Fowler's conclusions were so far outside the bounds of accepted forensic practice that all his previous work could be questioned.Maryland officials then announced they would review all in-custody death reports during Fowler's tenure. Paule said Mitchell's accusations had a chilling effect on Thao's ability to find medical experts unafraid to testify on his behalf.He said prosecutors have yet to give the defense evidence about Mitchell's actions. He's asking that the case against Thao be dismissed.Paule also said in a court filing in February that he wants an order sanctioning the state for “its role — directly or indirectly — in the leaking of highly prejudicial information related to potential plea agreements of co-defendants.”The New York Times reported Feb. 10 that Chauvin was ready to plead guilty to a third-degree murder charge last year but then-Attorney General William Barr rejected the agreement. The Associated Press published a similar report the next day, citing two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the talks. Paule alleged that the leaks came from the state, and asked that anyone who did so be barred from participating in the trial. Tom Plunkett, Kueng's attorney, echoed his statements.Ellison earlier dismissed Paule's motion as “completely false and an outlandish attempt to disparage the prosecution.”Earl Gray, Lane's attorney, has a motion asking Judge Peter Cahill to compel the state to disclose all use-of-force reports over the past 50 years in which a Minneapolis police officer used force and another officer intervened verbally or physically. Gray said it's necessary to show the jury that no such intervention has been made in the past 50 years, which would call into question the state’s expert testimony about the duty of officers to intervene.Prosecutors have said that request should be denied. They've noted that department policy requires officers to intervene when excessive force is used, and say Gray hasn’t shown how the testimony of experts could be called into question by a lack of interventions.All four officers have also been indicted on federal charges alleging they violated Floyd’s civil rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-postpones-trial-for-3-ex-cops-charged-in-george-floyd-s-death-101620920692380.html

His arrest the previous month sparked nationwide protests at which police arrested thousands of people after declaring the rallies illegal.After a pause, Navalny's team staged a protest last month to demand proper medical care for Navalny while he was on hunger strike in prison. Turnout was more modest than expected.With the movement about to be declared "extremist", Volkov said formal protests were no longer an option."It's hard to imagine that new protests will happen in the same format that we got used to from 2017-21: when a date was announced in advance and preparations in dozens of towns got under way," Volkov wrote on the Telegram messenger service."But since it's obvious that the fundamental reasons for protesting are not going away ... it's clear that the protests will not go away. It's just that if there are no organisers, they will break out spontaneously."During a virtual discussion organised by the University of Chicago on Wednesday, Volkov predicted Russian opposition protests would start to resemble those that erupted in Tunisia in 2011 and eventually toppled a veteran leader.The Levada Center, an independent pollster, published data on Thursday indicating public support for street protests backing Navalny had fallen to 16% of the population in April from 22% in January.Navalny's allies have suspended the work of his network of regional campaign offices, which has been added to a list of organisations said to be involved in "terrorism and extremism", but Volkov has said they are capable of regrouping.Navalny, who last year survived what German doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning, is serving a 2-1/2 year jail sentence for violations of parole terms on a suspended sentence he had been serving on embezzlement charges that he says were trumped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-s-team-abandon-formal-street-protests-says-ally-101620916461220.html

He was charged with carrying a sword and a black flag, Saiful Islam, deputy commissioner of the counter-terrorism unit, was quoted as saying in the report.Osama was arrested on May 6 and police did not provide any details about him, the report said.Sakib was reportedly motivated by Osama's words and “came to embrace martyrdom while attacking the parliament,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-arrested-in-bangladesh-for-plotting-attack-on-parliament-101620908931622.html
13-05-2021||World||Greensill Capital case: Ex-UK PM Cameron denies lobbying for 'personal gain'||Former British Prime Minister David Cameron is facing questions over the collapse of Greensill Capital, after releasing phone and email messages showing his intensive lobbying efforts on behalf of the firm.Under early questioning, Cameron denied being motivated by personal gain when he sent top government ministers and officials at the Bank of England text messages and emails in a bid to persuade them to include Greensill in a program of state-backed lending.He is giving oral evidence to the Treasury committee and the public accounts committee, two senior panels of lawmakers that are investigating the failure of Greensill, which has now put thousands of U.K. jobs at risk.Cameron was questioned why he finished a text message to Tom Scholar, a top Treasury official who was his former aide, with the sign-off “Love Dc”.He replied that “anyone I know at all well” receives the sign-off. “I don’t know why; I just do,” Cameron said. “My children tell me I don’t need to sign of text messages at all.”Cameron also said he met Scholar for drinks a “couple of times” since leaving office.Cameron Earned More at Greensill Than as PM (3:00 p.m.)Greensill paid Cameron “far more” than he earned as U.K. prime minister, he told the committee, acknowledging that he held shares in the company. But he also dismissed as “completely absurd” reports that his interest totaled 60 million pounds ($84 million).“I wanted this business to succeed,” he said. “I was being paid, I had shares, I had an interest in it.”Asked about his assiduous lobbying for access to one of the Bank of England’s Covid relief schemes in the first half of 2020, Cameron said personal interest “was not what motivated me.”Cameron Says Greensill Not in Jeopardy at Start of Pandemic (2:45 p.m.)Lawmakers are now questioning Cameron. He insisted that at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Greensill was in a good financial position. He has previously said that the first he knew of difficulties was in December 2020.“There was no sense of jeopardy” at the outset of the pandemic, Cameron said. “Greensill had a successful 2019, it was set to have a successful 2020.”“I wanted this business to succeed,” he said. “I was paid an annual amount, a generous amount, much more than I was paid as prime minister.”Cameron Makes Contrite Opening Statement (2:35 p.m.)Cameron opens his testimony with a statement, saying that this session marks a “painful” return to Parliament, which he cals as “a place that I love and respect so much.” Cameron explained his motivations in working for Greensill, and stressed that he abided by all the rules in place on lobbying.“But rules alone are never enough. We learned that in this place there are so many issues, personal conduct and codes of behavior and how such conduct and behavior appears and can be perceived, these things matter too,” he said. ”I believe there are important lessons to be learned,” Cameron added.“I completely accept that former prime ministers are in a different position to others because of the office that we held, and the influence that continues to bring.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greensill-capital-case-ex-uk-pm-cameron-denies-lobbying-for-personal-gain-101620916254280.html

He accuses the man of not wearing a mask and of breaking social distancing rules, and asks where he served his National Service (a compulsory service for Singaporeans).The alleged perpetrator also says “this is my country” and “you are spreading the virus” during the exchange, according to the Channel report. Police investigations are ongoing and the man is assisting with investigations, SPF said.The offence of public nuisance carries a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to SGD2,000, or both.Offenders who utter words with deliberate intent to wound the racial feelings of any person face up to three years in prison, a fine of up to SGD 5,000, or both.Last Friday, police arrested a 30-year-old man of Chinese ethnicity for allegedly assaulting a 55-year-old woman of Indian origin.The man was arrested “for public nuisance, uttering words with intent to wound the racial feelings of others and voluntarily causing hurt”, the SPF said on Tuesday.The woman was walking along a walkway at Choa Chu Kang Drive at about 8.45am on May 7 when she was confronted by a Chinese couple who told her to wear her mask properly as a safety measure for the public in fight against Covid-19, said the SPF of the case earlier this week.Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam has also told parliamentarians that Singapore will fail if the country allows racism and xenophobia to become prevalent.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Ministers have also condemned the attack on the woman who was brisk walking, one of the exercises for which wearing a face mask is exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-police-investigate-another-hate-crime-against-indian-family-101620910744108.html
13-05-2021||World||China hails removal of Xiaomi from US govt blacklist, calls move 'beneficial'||China’s commerce ministry on Thursday welcomed the removal of Xiaomi Corp. from a U.S. government blacklist, a day after the U.S. reversed a ban on U.S. investments in the smartphone maker that was imposed under former President Donald Trump.“China has always believed that removing sanctions and restrictions and stopping suppression of Chinese companies will benefit China, the United States, and the world,” Gao Feng, spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said at a news briefing Thursday.Xiaomi, a Beijing-based company known for its value-for-money smartphones and smart devices, was added to a Defense Department blacklist in January this year in the last few days of the Trump administration, which accused it of links to China’s military.U.S. investors were ordered to divest their stakes held in Xiaomi by November.In response, Xiaomi sued the U.S. government over the ban, demanding to be removed from the list. It denies having any links with China’s People’s Liberation Army.On Wednesday, a U.S. court filing said that the U.S. Department of Defense will remove Xiaomi from the blacklist after the two parties reached an agreement, media reports said.A Xiaomi spokesperson said that the company was paying close attention to the issue.The company's Hong Kong-listed shares fell nearly 2.9% Thursday, a day after gaining 6% on news of it was being removed from the U.S. blacklist.Under the Trump administration, Chinese technology companies such as drone maker DJI and telecommunications equipment supplier Huawei were put on a trade blacklist out of concerns such companies might be security risks.U.S. companies and individuals are banned from dealing with companies on such lists or in some cases must seek special permission in advance.Companies like Huawei and DJI have both denied that they send any data to China, although China hawks say that such companies may be obliged to assist espionage efforts as stipulated in China’s national intelligence law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hails-removal-of-xiaomi-from-us-govt-blacklist-calls-move-beneficial-101620910150342.html

Before the pause, 25% said they were “rather unlikely” or “very unlikely” to get it.“These findings reflect a failure to deliver persuasive and clear communication regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccines,” Daphne Ahrendt, senior research manager at Eurofound, said in a statement Thursday. “Trust in vaccines is related to trust in institutions, and this is an issue primarily for policymakers, but we also all have a collective responsibility, across society, to ensure that we communicate and publish accurate and sound information on the safety and importance of vaccines.”The EU’s vaccine rollout got off to a slow start and was held back by concerns over rare blood clots possibly linked to Astra’s shot. The European Medicines Agency updated its guidance in April to include the condition as a possible side effect, but has said the vaccine’s benefits still outweigh its risks. Almost 30% of the EU’s population has received at least one dose, compared with 46% in the U.S., according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker.In the entire period of Eurofound’s survey across February and March, the vaccine hesitancy figure was 27%. Skepticism was highest in Bulgaria, with 61% of survey participants indicating misgivings, and below 10% in Denmark, Malta and Ireland. The U.K., which recently left the EU, has one of the lowest hesitancy rates in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-hesitancy-rose-in-eu-after-pause-in-astrazeneca-covid-19-shots-101620909320138.html
13-05-2021||World||Twitter picks up acquisition pace, driven by new product push||Twitter Inc. has stepped up its pace of acquisitions in recent months after years of languid deal-making, a change that reflects the social network’s stronger financial standing and a renewed effort to speed up the addition of new features.Last week Twitter announced the purchase of news reader service Scroll with a goal of adding the product to an eventual subscription offering for its social network. The deal was Twitter’s sixth announced so far this year, and the seventh since December.While many of Twitter’s transactions have been small and driven by a desire to quickly add more employees or technical expertise, Twitter’s activity this year is markedly different from 2017 and 2018, when the company completed just one public acquisition in two years. Twitter, which a few years ago was itself a buyout target, is also taking bigger swings, and has been part of the conversation around higher-profile deals since last year, including efforts to acquire Discord Inc., Clubhouse and even TikTok.The shift is part of a concerted push to launch products at a faster rate, following the admission from Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey in February that the company has been dragging its feet for years on new tools for its platform. Twitter set out to double its “development velocity” and the “number of features per employee” that affect revenue and user growth, and acquiring teams and products that align with the company’s plans bolsters that effort.“The pace has picked up as our hiring needs have picked up, as our clarity has picked up, as our investing levels have picked up,” Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said of the acquisition strategy in an interview. “It shouldn’t surprise you or others to see our name mentioned around things big and small.” He declined to comment on specific deals.Twitter’s six purchases so far in 2021 -- less than halfway through the year -- are the most the company has made in a calendar year since 2015, when it publicly announced eight acquisitions. Many this year have been directly related to Twitter’s effort to build a subscription offering, which would generate revenue outside of the main advertising business.In addition to Scroll, Twitter acquired startup Revue with plans to build out a subscription newsletter business. Other employees added through deals this year are working on “super follows,” or letting Twitter accounts charge followers for special content or access. Twitter will eventually take a cut of these subscriber fees, providing the company with a more predictable revenue stream than its current advertising business.This focus on a specific product road map seems to be the most likely explanation for Twitter’s flurry of deal activity, said Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. At Twitter’s Analyst Day presentation in February, the plan outlined was the “most put together and coherent” he’d ever seen from the company, he said.“It all starts with the clarity of ‘where is the North Star and how are we getting there?’” Shmulik said. “For a long time, they didn’t really have that.”Adding startups to help with new consumer features is the most likely reason for Twitter to make deals moving forward, said Mandeep Singh, a technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He pointed to commerce and augmented reality as industries where rival social media platforms like Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. are currently invested.Singh also suggested that Twitter should look at advertising technology startups for possible deals. The company spent the past few years telling investors it plans to improve its direct response advertising business -- essentially helping advertisers drive specific outcomes, like an app download. Twitter could benefit from adding more employees or technology to help it catch up with competitors in this space. “That is one area where they would want to close the gap,” he said.Perhaps just as noteworthy are the deals Twitter hasn’t made, but has been interested in, which show the company is considering adding a new product outside of its core social media service for the first time in years.The company tried to acquire Discord, the video-game chat company that rejected a $12 billion bid from Microsoft Corp. last month. Twitter also attempted to buy the audio-chat app Clubhouse for $4 billion, and is now building its own rival product, called Spaces. The San Francisco-based social network was also one of the many interested companies bidding on TikTok’s U.S. operations last summer, though it is likely Twitter would have been a smaller partner in any transaction for the popular video-sharing app.It’s possible Twitter could benefit from the current regulatory climate. Facebook Inc. and Google, always considered top acquirers for any consumer technology deal, are both under intense antitrust scrutiny in Washington, making it less likely either company could get a sizable deal through the regulatory process. Facebook is confronting government threats to unwind its past deals for Instagram and WhatsApp.Twitter, which is much smaller than its digital advertising competitors, has almost $9 billion in cash or cash equivalents on its balance sheet, and a “board that’s supportive of our plan,” Segal said. Once a perpetual money-losing business, Twitter is now profitable.Still, Segal dismissed the idea that Twitter’s more aggressive stance on deals has anything to do with a weaker field of acquirers. “Even if the people with whom you are competing may change from one year to another, the amount of competition doesn’t change,” he says.It wasn’t long ago that Twitter itself was a possible takeout target after a dramatic internal restructuring, including the return of founder Dorsey to the helm in October 2015. At the time, Twitter was focused on downsizing as a means to attract a possible suitor. It laid off employees two years in a row, shuttered its video app Vine, and sold off its developer products to Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Buyout interest from a range of companies, including Salesforce.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co., failed to result in a deal, and Twitter was left with a smaller staff but fewer side projects left to distract them.And just because Twitter is exploring a big acquisition doesn’t mean it will land one. The main reason a Twitter deal for Discord never progressed is that the interest was one-sided, according to people familiar with the talks. Any deal for Discord, Clubhouse or ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok would dwarf the company’s most expensive purchase ever -- a $479.1 million ad-tech deal for TellApart in 2015 -- and most of the acquisitions Twitter is making are so small that pricing isn’t required to be disclosed.“I don’t know if they’ve won the right or earned the right from investors to go down that path” to a multibillion-dollar deal, Shmulik said. If Twitter does stay active, he expects that it will go after companies that fit with product plans around creators and helping Twitter users make money from the service. “It’s all about reducing time to market,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-picks-up-acquisition-pace-driven-by-new-product-push-101620905710707.html
13-05-2021||World||President Biden lifts US ship mandate to ease gasoline shortages||The Biden administration temporarily eased century-old US shipping requirements to allow a foreign tanker to transport gasoline and diesel to fuel-starved areas of the country following the Colonial Pipeline outage.A waiver has been issued for a single company under the 101-year-old Jones Act, which stipulates goods transported between US ports be carried on ships built and registered in the US as well as crewed by American workers, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a Thursday statement.A White House official said Thursday that the waiver applied to a single tanker and other waiver requests are under consideration.The move is designed to address fuel shortages spurred by the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which shut down a major artery for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel across the U.S. East Coast. Even with fuel shipments resuming from around 5 p.m. New York time Wednesday, it’s unclear how long it will take for the network to return to normal.“This waiver will enable the transport of additional gas and jet fuel between the Gulf Coast and East Coast ports to ease supply constraints,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.Biden is also urging Americans “to just purchase what they need, and not hoard fuel, as supply is restored,” Psaki said. Gasoline stations from Florida to Virginia have reported running dry after Colonial was forced to take systems offline May 7, and pump prices soared above $3 a gallon for the first time in six years.While the government has temporarily lifted U.S. ship requirements to combat fuel shortages after major storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Harvey, the issue is politically fraught. The Jones Act is championed by some of the nation’s biggest shipbuilders and vessel operators, as well as their allies on Capitol Hill. It also has the backing of a key Biden constituency in organized labor, including the Seafarers International Union.Waiving the requirements allows foreign-flagged tankers to fill the supply gap left by the interruption to the pipeline. It would take an estimated six to seven days for a tanker to carry fuel from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor. A single cargo delivery into the U.S. East Coast is usually about 300,000 barrels.The company and tanker affected by the Jones Act waiver have not been identified.Under federal law, the U.S. could waive Jones Act shipping requirements if “necessary in the interest of national defense.” However, first, the Maritime Administration “would have to determine that qualified U.S.-flag vessels cannot meet the need,” said Charlie Papavizas, an expert in Jones Act law at Winston & Strawn LLP.The Maritime Administration completed a survey of available Jones Act-compliant tankers on Tuesday, though the results have not been made public.The American Maritime Partnership, a group that represents U.S.-flagged ship owners and has opposed efforts to scale back Jones Act protections, did not immediately respond to the administration’s move. Previously, Wednesday, the group’s president said it “does not object to a targeted approach to issuing waivers when there is a legitimate need and when such action does not reward those who would utilize foreign vessels to game the system at the expense of American jobs and national security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-lifts-us-ship-mandate-to-ease-gasoline-shortages-101620905675574.html

It has also banned imports of foreign waste.China has also launched various recycling schemes as well as a "waste-free city" programme aimed at tackling a solid waste treatment backlog estimated at up to 70 billion tonnes in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-aims-to-re-use-60-of-its-trash-by-2025-101620901755453.html

13-05-2021||World||China sets up new health body after botched early Covid response||China announced a new disease prevention and control agency under the aegis of its top health body, in what is its biggest move yet to address gaps that caused critical delays in sounding the alarm about Covid-19 when it first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.The new National Disease Prevention and Control Bureau will draft policies regarding infectious disease control and provide guidance on the surveillance of epidemics, among other public health mandates, state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.While no further detail was given, the new bureau will be headed by a long-time health official Wang Hesheng, who had been tasked to take over the crisis in Wuhan in early 2020 after the officials there were sacked. Wang’s appointment suggests that mistakes made during the Wuhan outbreak, in which local whistleblower doctors were initially reprimanded by police and information kept from the outside world, will inform the new body’s work.China has been criticised by the US and other countries for covering up the outbreak’s severity in its early days, which allowed the pathogen to spread around the world before governments realised. While Beijing has always denied that it hid information from the world, President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to reform the country’s public health system because it lacks the capability and nimbleness to deal with large-scale outbreaks.The unit is affiliated with China’s National Health Commission, which currently oversees the country’s Covid-19 response. The Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control -- chiefly a research body -- has provided technical guidance to the NHC.Xi last year urged Communist Party cadres and government officials to reflect on the “problems and shortcomings” exposed in China’s epidemic control. A key issue in Wuhan was that local officials and experts were not empowered to react to signs of emerging outbreaks quickly by alerting the highest levels of government or external health bodies like the World Health Organization. Instead, precious days were lost as information was bottlenecked in bureaucracy.One of Wang’s deputies will be top medical expert Shen Hongbin, whose research focuses on lung cancer. The other two are bureaucrats with extensive experience in managing hospitals and health-related emergency responses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sets-up-new-health-body-after-botched-early-covid-response-101620901209290.html

In Ireland, only 10% of adults said they would not get the shot.The survey found an east-west divide across Europe. Except for France and Austria, the intention to get vaccinated was above 60% in all Western member states - with Nordic and Mediterranean countries, Denmark and Ireland having even higher rates.The rate of planned uptake in Eastern member states was much lower, ranging from 59% in Romania to 33% in Bulgaria.The main influence on vaccine hesitancy was the time spent on social media and which medium was used, the survey said. The proportion rises to 40% among those who use social media as their primary source of news.Among people who used traditional media including press, radio and television, only 18% of respondents were vaccine sceptics.The survey also found that students, employed or retired people were less vaccine hesitant than average, while 39% of unemployed people or those with a long-term disease of disability were more hesitant.The survey was conducted between February and March 2021, after a full year of living with Covid-19 restrictions across the bloc's 27 member states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-a-quarter-of-eu-adults-would-refuse-covid-19-shot-survey-101620897997279.html

There’s even been reports of farmers’ feet being bitten while they sleep.A viral video showed a giant vacuum sucking up the mice from storage containers, but methods to treat the intrusion have so far offered little respite for farmers.The crisis has prompted the New South Wales government to release A$50 million ($39 million) in funding to tackle the infestation it calls an economic and public health crisis. The state is asking the federal government for approval to use Bromadiolone, a potent pesticide that’s normally banned in the country.“It’s actually the strongest mouse poison we can get anywhere on the face of the earth that actually will kill these things within 24 hours,” said Adam Marshall, the state’s agriculture minister.Mouse numbers across the state have exploded after a bumper crop last season, which followed plentiful rains that broke a years-long drought. Though good news for farmers who endured years of disappointing crop yields, the sharp increase in grain volumes has provided more food for the pests.Mouse PooThe infestation that’s spreading quickly across New South Wales and Queensland state is causing havoc to crop yields and contaminating sorghum exports with animal droppings, causing quality downgrades and leading to canceled shipments of the grain.“From an export perspective, there’s zero to no tolerance on mouse poo,” said Nick Carracher, chief executive of Lachstock Consulting, an agricultural service and advice provider based in Victoria. “It’s very difficult to clean -- virtually impossible.”Contamination issues aside, there’s likely to be further fallout as farmers head into the next planting season for winter crops like wheat and barley. While Australia is predicted to see another fairly favorable harvest this season, the plague could dent those forecasts.Mice, which are partial to newly sown seeds, are likely to feast upon the upcoming crop before it even gets to germination stage.“Freshly sown crops are going to have lower germination because there’s bloody mice everywhere!” Carracher said. “That’s definitely a genuine threat in those areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-mice-plague-forces-australia-to-turn-to-banned-poison-101620900289981.html

"Citizens please remain calm and there's no need for panic."All units of the Hsinta power plant in Kaohsiung were shut after an "incident", Lo added, but did not give details or say what caused the outage.Utility Taipower said more than six million homes were hit by the outage, which it blamed on a technical failure at the power plant.The blackouts will run in rotation until 4:40 p.m. (0840 GMT), it said, with a decision on any extensions to be made later.The economic ministry said it was working to restore supply by evening. The main international airport near Taipei, the capital, and the high speed rail line were operating normally, the transport ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-hit-by-power-outage-aims-to-restore-normal-supply-by-evening-101620897381163.html

Groping in the dark, the 50-year-old grabbed her four children and ran as Israeli bombs struck their apartment building Wednesday, shattering windows, ripping doors to splinters, and blasting away concrete.While casualties mounted this week in the most severe outbreak of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip since a 2014 war, al-Rayyes and other Palestinians in the line of fire faced an all-too-familiar question: Where should we go?“This whole territory is a tiny place. It's a prison. Everywhere you go, you're a target,” al-Rayyes said by phone from a neighbor's house, where she sought refuge with her teenage sons and daughters and a few bags of clothes after the Israeli airstrike that she says came without warning.In Gaza, a crowded coastal enclave of 2 million people, there are no air raid sirens or safe houses. Temporary United Nations shelters have come under attack in previous years of conflict. In the past two days, Israeli airstrikes brought down three huge towers housing important Hamas offices and some businesses after the Israeli military fired warning shots, allowing occupants to flee.Fighter jets also targeted without warning multiple residential buildings, located in teeming neighborhoods where Israel alleged militants lived. In all, more than 65 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Monday, including 16 children. Among the dead were both militants and civilians, including at least two women and children who died during the apartment building strikes.At a Gaza City hospital, distraught families told of pulling bloodied relatives from piles of rubble. One woman said her 4-year-old grandson and pregnant daughter-in-law were killed when an Israeli air raid hit their two-story building on Wednesday.“They bombed them without any warning. The house had nothing but the kids,” Umm Mohammad al-Telbani cried in the hospital morgue.The Israeli government long has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields against retaliatory strikes; militants often launch rockets from civilian areas and set up command centers inside residential buildings. Yet Israel received heavy criticism for its tactic of bombing buildings during the 2014 war with Hamas.Recalling the horror of past wars, Gaza residents say they feel nowhere is safe. They also cannot leave the narrow territory, one of the world's most densely populated places. It has been under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized control in 2007. Along its borders, Gaza is encircled by sensor-studded fences, concrete walls, galvanised steel barriers, and the Mediterranean Sea, where Israel restricts boats from Gaza to some 16 nautical miles offshore.“There is nowhere to run, there is nowhere to hide,” said Zeyad Khattab, a 44-year-old pharmacist in Gaza City, who fled to the family home where he grew up in the central Gaza district of Deir al-Balah with a dozen relatives when bombs pounded his residential high-rise. “That terror is impossible to describe.”As Hamas and other militant groups fired hundreds of rockets into Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, killing at least seven Israelis, worries grew that the latest violence could spiral into a protracted conflict. The Hamas barrages sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis running to bomb shelters across the country and hit numerous civilian targets, including a bus and a school in the city of Askhelon that was empty because authorities had ordered all schools closed.The people killed by the indiscriminate fire at Israeli population centers included three women and two children, spreading fear on both sides of the border.“There is always this undercurrent of anxiety, but this time is different,” Khattab said. Airstrikes shook the walls and windows of his apartment building during the devastating wars of 2008 and 2014, but the building that houses some 400 people collapsed on Wednesday.In any other year, Palestinians would be thronging the dusty streets of Gaza City this week ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday, one of the biggest and most joyous festivals on the Muslim calendar that marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Markets would be hives of activity as shoppers stocked up on new clothes and pastries for feasts. Beachside restaurants would brim with families. Barbershops would be full of men getting fresh haircuts.Instead, shops stood shuttered and the city's streets were eerily empty. Almost nothing moves on the roads except for ambulances and Hamas security vehicles. Bombs thunder in the distance. Plumes of black smoke billow from stricken buildings. Residents walk by rubble-strewn stores and downed power lines, surveying the latest damage to a city already riddled with scars from intense clashes.“It's the same atmosphere of 2014,” Saud Abu Ramadan, a freelance journalist in Gaza City, said, referring to the bloody 7-week war that killed over 2,000 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, and inflicted widespread destruction on Gaza's infrastructure. “Warplanes are buzzing, and people are just trying to keep their heads down."This week's mayhem stemmed from clashes at the most sensitive place in Jerusalem, the revered plateau site of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the iconic golden Dome of the Rock. Analysts long have considered flaring tensions at the compound, sacred to both Muslims and Jews, to be the most dangerous accelerant to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shattered-homes-dead-relatives-gaza-residents-ask-where-should-we-go-101620893087636.html
13-05-2021||World||On Eid, Xinjiang imams defend China against US criticism||Muslim leaders from the Xinjiang region rejected Western allegations that China is suppressing religious freedom, speaking at a reception Thursday for foreign diplomats and media at the end of the holy month of Ramadan.The event was the latest in a series of moves by the Chinese government to counter accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. It came a day after human rights groups and Western nations demanded unfettered access for U.N. human rights experts to the region and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned China for “crimes against humanity and genocide against Muslim Uyghurs” during the release of an annual report on international religious freedom.The Uyghurs are a mostly Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang, a remote northwest region where China has been accused of mass incarcerations, forced labor and forced sterilization in recent years as it imposed a strict security regime after a series of terrorist attacks.Echoing the government line, the president of the Xinjiang Islamic Association said China had eradicated the breeding ground for extremism by improving livelihoods, teaching people about the law and setting up vocational training and education centers. Foreign analysts say the centers are part of a detention system that has locked up an estimated 1 million people or more over time.Abdureqip Tomurniyaz, who heads the association and the school for Islamic studies in Xinjiang, accused anti-China forces in the U.S. and other Western nations of spreading rumors and lies.“They want to sabotage Xinjiang’s harmony and stability, contain China’s rise and alienate relations between China and Islamic countries,” he said.He also said the U.S. is turning a blind eye to its own human rights violations, citing the U.S. involvement in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other Muslim countries and anti-Muslim discrimination at home.Religious leaders from five mosques spoke at the 90-minute presentation, three in person and two on video. They all described prayers and feasting for Eid al-Fitr and rejected criticism of China's religious policies. Videos showed men praying inside mosques and people dancing in squares outside.Mamat Juma, the imam of the historic Id Kah mosque in the city of Kashgar, said that all ethnic groups in Xinjiang support the steps taken to combat terrorism. He said that people are grateful to the ruling Communist Party for restoring stability and promoting economic growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-eid-xinjiang-imams-defend-china-against-us-criticism-101620892955673.html
13-05-2021||World||Nepal's hospitals stop admitting Covid-19 patients due to scarcity of oxygen||Patients in Nepal are gasping for breath, as authorities said they were facing an acute shortage of medical oxygen due to which 16 people infected with Covid-19 died recently, according to media reports.The deadly virus has so far infected 413,111 people and claimed 4,084 lives in the country, which has a population of approximately 29.5 million.The government on Wednesday asked private hospitals to instal their own oxygen plants to meet the need of oxygen within 15 days, the Himalayan Times reported.According to the decision, all private hospitals with more than 100 beds will have to install their own oxygen plant and the government will provide the necessary support for this purpose.The Ministry of Health and Population said it was the responsibility of all the hospitals to set up their own oxygen plants."Since many private hospitals have not done so, we will help them set up the plant to meet the increasing demand of oxygen for Covid patients," said Dr Jageshwor Gautam, spokesperson for the ministry.The government has estimated that around 15,000 oxygen cylinders are required to meet the current demand for oxygen. In contrast, there are only around 8,000 oxygen cylinders in the country.Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre, an apex government body for dealing with the pandemic, during Wednesday's meeting, pointed out that the country might need 50,000 oxygen cylinders by July-end.Some government hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley on Wednesday said that they no longer had oxygen supply to treat Covid patients, but they had enough cylinders to fill oxygen, the report said.At least 12 hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have announced plans to stop admitting Covid-19 patients for treatment due to shortage of oxygen, My Republica reported on Wednesday.“The hospital is facing an acute shortage of oxygen and the government is providing only 100 oxygen cylinders per day so we cannot admit any new Covid-19 patients to the hospital,” the Grande International Hospital in Kathmandu said.Various hospitals in the Bhaktapur district of the Valley are struggling to save the lives of Covid-19 patients due to the shortage of medical oxygen, the Himalayan Times reported.Many hospitals in the district have been flooded with patients following the second wave of the infection. Due to the shortage, many hospitals have refused to admit coronavirus patients.Meanwhile, in Rupandehi district of Nepal, a total of 16 Covid-19 patients died due to oxygen shortage on Wednesday, the Kathmandu Post reported.Seven patients died at Bhim Hospital of Bhairahawa, five at Butwal's Covid Special Hospital, and four at Bhairahawa's Universal Teaching Hospital.Most Covid-19 health facilities in Rupandehi have been reporting a shortage of oxygen supply since Tuesday.The hospitals providing treatment to Covid-19 patients had appealed to the government bodies seeking help and informing them about the catastrophic results if immediate steps were not taken.“Efforts are on to refill oxygen from Chitwan, Pokhara and Biratnagar excluding the production within the province. Liquid oxygen is also being ferried,” Shankar Pokharel, chief minister of Lumbini Province, posted on Facebook on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-hospitals-stop-admitting-covid-19-patients-due-to-scarcity-of-oxygen-101620890233276.html

Portugal is the main holiday destination currently on the "green list"."We're calling on package holiday companies to make the refund process less hassle in the future," CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement.The CMA said action it had already taken had helped refund more than 200 million pounds ($281 million) to customers.Under package holiday rules, cancelled holidays must be refunded within 14 days and customers must be offered a refund, not just a credit note.Authorities are worried there could be more cancellations this summer as many holiday companies are currently selling vacations to countries such as Spain and Greece which are now on Britain's amber list for travel.According to the government, people "should not travel to amber list countries or territories for leisure purposes".On the Beach, an online travel agent, said late on Wednesday that it would not be selling holidays for travel until September given ongoing pandemic uncertainty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-watchdog-warns-holiday-companies-over-refunds-as-travel-restarts-101620890304381.html
13-05-2021||World||White House weighs evacuating Afghans as time runs out||The Biden administration is debating how to get thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. out of the country before American forces withdraw in a few months, amid fears that time is running out ahead of a potential Taliban takeover.White House national security aides have held several meetings about the issue in recent days to trade ideas, discussing options including a mass evacuation of thousands of people to a third country where they could be processed and brought to the U.S.The biggest concern for U.S. officials is that Afghan citizens who played an invaluable role serving American forces and contractors such as translators, consultants, office assistants and drivers would be quickly targeted by Taliban forces, especially if they continue to gain ground on President Ashraf Ghani’s government in Kabul.The likeliest scenario for the U.S. would involve extracting Afghans through an existing program called special immigrant visas -- which has a long backlog -- and allowing Afghan interpreters to seek refugee status, according to several people familiar with the matter. They asked not to be identified because no decision has been made.The White House is getting closer to presenting options to advocates and members of Congress impatient with President Joe Biden, who promised withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war and U.S. occupation. Biden’s spokespeople declined to comment.But with U.S. forces due to fully depart Afghanistan by Sept. 11, there’s little time left.Besides preventing a human tragedy, the Pentagon and Biden administration want to avoid recreating the most indelible image of America’s Vietnam War withdrawal: a long line of people desperate to leave the country gathered on a Saigon rooftop, waiting to board a helicopter. The April 1975 photograph was widely seen as emblematic of America’s defeat in a war that also lasted about two decades.About 35,000 Afghans meet the legal requirement for the special immigrant visa program, according to James Miervaldis of No One Left Behind, a nonprofit organization that helps with resettlement. The number includes about 9,000 people who worked directly for the U.S. military, plus their spouses and children, he said.The visa program doesn’t fall under the U.S. refugee cap, but its rules are narrow and stringent, and it already has a years-long backlog of more than 17,000 applicants, Miervaldis said. If the Biden administration were to open a pathway for Afghans through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the qualifications are broader, but numbers would fall under the refugee quota.Understaffed EmbassyWhite House officials wrestling with the humanitarian dilemma include deputy national security advisers Russ Travers and Jon Finer and National Security Council aides Kristen Stolt and Katie Tobin.One challenge the administration faces: The U.S. embassy in Kabul is understaffed, while Department of Defense contractors who would normally process applications have either left as part of the U.S. withdrawal or are getting ready to do so.Planning efforts to help Afghans who worked with Americans started far too late, according to people inside and outside the administration. The coronavirus pandemic poses an additional challenge, making it harder for other countries to consider accepting possible refugees.More than 18,000 Afghans are waiting for their special immigrant visas, according to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith and Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who served in Afghanistan.Congress should increase the quota for visas, David Helvey, acting assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday.But lawmakers won’t have the money to accommodate all the needed visas unless there’s an agreement to cut funding from elsewhere in the budget, Smith said.‘Special Responsibility’State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters May 10 the administration had boosted consular staffing at the embassy in Kabul to handle more visas and the U.S. will “continue to look for ways to speed up this process.”“We have been acting with the utmost urgency knowing that, again, we have a special responsibility to the women and men who have, in many cases, placed themselves in harm’s way to assist the U.S. government over the years,” Price said.Top Pentagon officials say a Taliban victory in Afghanistan by year end isn’t inevitable, but the group controls a large swath of the country and has shown little interest in working with Ghani’s government.“The Afghan security forces can fight, and they are fighting for their own country now,” General Mark Milley, the head of the Joint Chief of Staff, said last week. “There’s a significant military capability in the Afghan government and we have to see how this plays out.”A Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in September will discuss the departure of foreign troops from Afghanistan, bloc Secretary General Vladimir Norov said Thursday at an event in Beijing to mark Eid al-Fitr.“We are now witnessing in northern Afghanistan rising terrorist activity,” he said. “With the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, security and stability in Afghanistan will impact stability for Central Asia.”The U.S. has conducted mass evacuations from war zones in the past. About 140,000 people were evacuated from Cambodia and South Vietnam to Guam in 1975, according the General Accounting Office. In 1996, about 6,000 Iraqi Kurds were flown to Guam, and 20,000 Kosovar Albanians were airlifted to Fort Dix, N.J. in 1999, according to the Truman National Security Project.But there are potential bureaucratic complications and a risk of abuse in any new program.In January, the State Department imposed a 90-day pause on a program designed for Iraqis who helped the U.S. during the Iraq war after evidence emerged that a group of co-conspirators had falsified numerous applications over several years. Three people have been indicted in the case.Domestic immigration politics have also complicated the Afghanistan matter. Some Biden aides are sensitive to Republican accusations that their administration favors “open borders,” and the crisis on the southern border, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have tried to cross into the U.S. since the start of the year, is also weighing on evacuation talks, according to the people familiar with the matter.‘Moral Obligation’Matt Zeller, a fellow at the Truman Center and a retired Army major who served in Afghanistan and arranged for his interpreter to immigrate to the U.S., wrote in an op-ed in the Military Times on Tuesday that associates had recently briefed the National Security Council on the issue.“They walked away fearful the Biden administration was more concerned about the optics of an evacuation than doing our moral obligation,” Zeller wrote.Zeller said that an evacuation would require multiple flights per day for weeks on end from the Kabul airport. The urgency of an evacuation has risen, he said, after reports that the Turkish military may abandon an agreement to provide protection for the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-weighs-evacuating-afghans-as-time-runs-out-101620881124938.html

But unfortunately, no result has been obtained, because a clear stance is not displayed."In several days of conflict, Hamas has fired volleys of rockets towards Israeli cities and Israel has launched airstrikes against the Islamist faction in the Gaza Strip.At least 67 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Seven people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said.With the conflict beginning to resemble the Gaza war of 2014, world powers have demanded de-escalation and the United States said it planned to send an envoy for talks with Israel and Palestinians.Turkey's president, Tayyip Erdogan, who has repeatedly condemned Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinians, said on Saturday Israel was a "terror state" after Israeli police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades at Palestinian protesters at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque.Oktay said Muslims had a responsibility to act."Everyone who does not display a clear stance against this is a party to this torment," Oktay said. "Unfortunately, when we look at the Muslim countries that do not display this unity and togetherness, everyone there who does not display a clear stance is a party to this."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/take-a-clear-stance-turkey-rallies-muslim-nations-over-israel-hamas-conflict-101620884243470.html
13-05-2021||World||'Better chances of winning lottery than getting vaccine shots': Race for jabs in 18-44 online slot||It's 2:00 am and Ananya Maskara's face is lit up by her smartphone as she nervously scrolls through a list -- looking for a green or yellow tab indicating that a Covid-19 vaccination slot is available in India's capital New Delhi.For anyone aged between 18 and 44, getting a slot in India's expanded vaccination drive -- already plagued by shortages and political squabbles -- has been like buying tickets for a rock concert where popular bands sell out in minutes."It was... a rollercoaster of emotions," the 19-year-old told AFP of her frantic, multi-day search to find a slot on India's online or app vaccination portals."It was really difficult... A lot of my friends haven't gotten a slot until now and they are still waiting."Maskara, like millions of younger Indians terrified by the current surge in infections, is rushing to get vaccinated against the coronavirus after the country this month opened up its inoculation drive to all adults.But the expansion came with restrictions, including only online registrations for the 18-44-year-olds, locking out up to half of India's population, particularly in poor and rural areas, who don't have smartphones or internet access.Numerous Indian states are also struggling with vaccine shortages, meaning there are limited slots available for the up to 600 million people in the 18-44 cohort now eligible for jabs.Maskara was eventually successful in finding a slot, but many others are still desperately searching."I have better chances of winning the lottery than getting a vaccination shot," grumbled one Mumbai-based Twitter user.So far, only three percent of India's 1.3 billion people -- or 39.5 million -- are fully vaccinated with both doses. An additional 10.6 percent have received just their first shot.- Hackathon -Techies have developed workarounds to help users in some cities where slots have been opening up at random times of day and are filled within one or two minutes.Berty Thomas, 35, a Chennai-based hobbyist programmer and business analyst, created a tool that alerts users via the Telegram messaging app when slots in their district open. It's already gotten more than 400,000 subscribers."My focus right now is to expand these alerts to multiple small towns and villages across the country," Thomas told AFP, adding that some users wanted to book for relatives in regional and rural areas."(Getting slots) has been an issue, particularly in the villages where internet is scarce. So the only way is... for people who have access to internet to help those who don't."Local media say some families have even travelled long distances to secure slots for their younger members.Devang Bhatt, 28, told AFP that after days of scouring the vaccine portal for a slot in Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat, he found one on the outskirts of the city."It was tiring, but worth it," Bhatt said of his vaccine trip.- No internet, no vaccination -But for Seema, a house-help working in the northern city of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh state -- which has been ravaged by the virus -- getting vaccinated seems unlikely."I don't have access to the internet... A few boys in my neighbourhood do have smartphones but they don't know how to use it for this (registration)," the 40-year-old who goes by one name told AFP."(The government) should think about people like us. Every day I run the risk of exposing myself to the disease as I work for three households. I wish I could get myself vaccinated."Experts say that the government should allow walk-ins at vaccination centres -- a measure already introduced for people above 45 years old.Authorities should also consider "taking vaccines to the people rather than having people coming to the vaccines", Ashoka University physics and biology professor Gautam Menon told AFP. He suggested steps like mobile vaccination clinics in remote areas.For Mohendra Sharma, who doesn't own a mobile phone, such changes can't come soon enough."There needs to be a system for door-to-door vaccination. Those who don't have a smartphone -- what will they do?," the 26-year-old told AFP at a milk store in Delhi where he works."I am worried for my family and for myself if we don't get the vaccination."grk-str/lb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/better-chances-of-winning-lottery-than-getting-vaccine-shots-race-for-jabs-in-18-44-online-slot-101620882260481.html

China maintains that changes in birth rates are linked to improved health and economic policy and it strongly rejects accusations of genocide.The ASPI analysis is based on Chinese government data, including regional population figures released in March."Our analysis builds on previous work and provides compelling evidence that Chinese government policies in Xinjiang may constitute an act of genocide," it said.The ASPI report said birth rates in counties with a 90 percent or greater indigenous population declined by an average of 56.5 percent from 2017 to 2018, far more than other regions in Xinjiang and China during the same period.Fines, internment, or the threat of internment, were among the methods used by authorities to discourage births, it said.There have been growing calls among some western states for an investigation into whether Beijing's actions in Xinjiang amount to genocide.The United States government and parliaments in countries including Britain and Canada have described China's policies in Xinjiang as genocide.According to the 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention, there would need to be proof of intent by Beijing to destroy an ethnic population in part to meet that determination.Rights groups, researchers, former residents and some western lawmakers say Xinjiang authorities have arbitrarily detained around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in a network of camps since 2016.Beijing initially denied the camps existed but has since said they are vocational training centres designed to combat religious extremism, and that all people in the centres have "graduated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-uses-coercive-policies-in-xinjiang-to-drive-down-uyghur-birth-rates-report-101620880544131.html

It is among a list of variants, including those first found in South Africa and Brazil, currently being monitored as VOCs in Britain.So far, 127,890 lives have been lost and 4,455,446 people have been infected by the coronavirus in the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-says-looking-at-solutions-for-covid-19-variant-first-identified-in-india-101620870196547.html
13-05-2021||World||'Israel has a right to defend itself', says US president Joe Biden as Gaza violence escalates||Fierce clashes between the Israeli military and rocket squads in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip spurred a concerted diplomatic push to end the most serious fighting to convulse the area since a 2014 war.“My expectation and hope are that this will be closing down sooner than later,” US president Joe Biden told reporters at the White House. “But Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.”The US dispatched an envoy to the region and Egypt and Qatar sought to help broker a truce as relentless Israeli air raids and Palestinian rocket barrages sent the death toll climbing through the night on Wednesday. More than 60 Palestinians have been reported killed in Gaza and at least six people in Israel since the violence abruptly exploded late Monday.The bombardments continued unabated into Wednesday evening as Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets at metropolitan Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial heartland, and the nation’s south that overwhelmed missile defenses. Sirens were heard also in the north. Netanyahu warned that “Hamas will pay a very heavy price for its aggression,” and a torrent of airstrikes followed, targeting military facilities, buildings used by the Islamic militant group, and key intelligence and military commanders.National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke on Wednesday with Qatari Foreign Minister Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani while Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after talking to Netanyahu and telling him it is “vital now to deescalate.”“Images that came out overnight are harrowing and the loss of any civilian life is a tragedy,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday. “I’ve asked Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Hady Amr, to go to the region immediately to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.”Egyptian efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas have so far failed to lead to a breakthrough, several Israeli and Arab media outlets reported.Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the country’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, and emphasized “the need to stop the Israeli attacks on the Palestinian territories and on the importance of sparing the people of the region any further escalation and the use of force.”Israel reported in excess of 1,500 rocket strikes, including a new nighttime barrage in response to the assassination Wednesday of a group of Hamas military commanders. Hamas said more than 550 government and residential buildings had been targeted in Israeli raids.Israeli defense officials accused militants of using Gaza civilians as human shields by launching rockets from civilian structures such as schools and populated neighborhoods.‘Only the Beginning’Netanyahu warned that other senior militant commanders would be targeted for assassination. “It’s only the beginning,” he said at a Tel Aviv-area hospital where some of the Israeli wounded had been taken. “We will strike at them in ways they never dreamed of.”Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus told reporters in a briefing that preparation for a ground maneuver “is not where we are at this stage.”The United Nations Security Council met for a second emergency session on the crisis for Wednesday, though the U.S. is so far holding up any statement.The hostilities spilled over from weeks of clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinians in contested Jerusalem. The holy city, home to Jewish, Muslim, and Christian shrines, lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and competing claims to it have underpinned the latest confrontation.“The occupation set this fire in Jerusalem and is responsible for any bombing that takes place,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said late Tuesday. “If the occupation wants to escalate, then the resistance is ready, and if it wants to stop, the resistance is also ready.”The violence has set off a wave of protests by Israeli Arabs in support of the Palestinians, and unprecedented clashes with Jews, and destruction of property in several cities. A curfew was imposed Wednesday in the central city of Lod, where Jews and Arabs live in a mixed community after Arab assailants set synagogues, shops, and cars on fire following the killing of an Arab resident by a Jewish man.Israel and Gaza have skirmished repeatedly since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, and have fought three wars, the last seven years ago.The current round has roots in tensions that have been festering since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in April. Israeli restrictions on gathering at a traditional Ramadan meeting place outside Jerusalem’s Old City touched off the unrest, but after they were lifted, protests were rekindled by the threatened evictions of Palestinians from longtime homes in the eastern sector of the city that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967. The Palestinians and much of the international community consider East Jerusalem occupied territory.Fighting is flaring at a time when Netanyahu’s rivals are trying to piece together a government after the fourth election in two years, and it has already impeded those efforts.Mansour Abbas, head of the Islamist United Arab List faction, froze negotiations to join that potential coalition, citing the ongoing conflict. The lethal surge in violence has made it untenable for Abbas to join a Zionist-led government at this time, but he told Israel Radio on Wednesday that he’ll go back to talks once the fighting is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-has-a-right-to-defend-itself-us-president-joe-biden-jew-arab-palestine-hamas-gaza-violence-101620876933789.html
13-05-2021||World||Religious, political events among factors behind Covid spike in India: WHO||The World Health Organisation has said a recent risk assessment of the situation in India found that “resurgence and acceleration” of Covid-19 transmission in the country had several potential contributing factors, including "several religious and political mass gathering events which increased social mixing".The WHO, in its Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, published Wednesday, said that viruses in the B.1.617 lineage were first reported in India in October 2020."The resurgence in Covid-19 cases and deaths in India has raised questions on the potential role of B.1.617 and other variants (e.g., B.1.1.7) in circulation,” the update said.WATCH: India receives Covid medical supplies from Germany, Finland and Greece"A recent risk assessment of the situation in India conducted by WHO found that resurgence and acceleration of Covid-19 transmission in India had several potential contributing factors, including increase in the proportion of cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially increased transmissibility; several religious and political mass gathering events which increased social mixing; and, under use of and reduced adherence to public health and social measures (PHSM). The exact contributions of these each of these factors on increased transmission in India are not well understood,” it said.The update said that approximately 0.1% of positive samples in India have been sequenced and uploaded to GISAID to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. GISAID enables rapid and open access to epidemic and pandemic virus data.The WHO update said that "the prevalence of several VOCs including B.1.1.7 and B.1.612 sublineages increased concurrent to the surge in Covid-19 cases reported in India.""Since the identification of these variants through late April 2021, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 21% and 7% of sequenced samples from India,” the update said, adding that preliminary analyses conducted by WHO using sequences submitted to GISAID suggests that B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 have a substantially higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility compared.The update said that outside of India, the UK has reported the largest number of cases sequenced as B.1.617 sub-lineages, and recently designated B.1.617.2 as a “national variant of concern.”Giving a global overview of the Covid-19 situation, the update said that the number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths globally decreased slightly this week, with over 5.5 million cases and over 90000 deaths."While India continues to account for 95% of cases and 93% of deaths in the South-East Asia Region, as well as 50% of global cases and 30% of global deaths, worrying trends have been observed in neighbouring countries,” it said.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from India (2,738,957 new cases; 5% increase), Brazil (423,438 new cases; similar to previous week), the USA (334,784 new cases; 3% decrease), Turkey (166,733 new cases; 35% decrease), and Argentina (140,771 new cases; 8% decrease).The South-East Asia Region reported over 2.8 million new cases and just under 29,000 new deaths, a 6% and a 15% increase respectively compared to the previous week. This marks the ninth consecutive week the incidences of cases and deaths have been increasing in the region.The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (26,820 new deaths; 1.9 new deaths per 100.000; a 15% increase), Indonesia (1190 new deaths; 0.4 new deaths per 100,000; a 3% increase), and Bangladesh (368 new deaths; 0.2 new deaths per 100,000; a 34% decrease).Earlier this week, the B-1617 variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, had been classified as a “variant of concern” at the global level by the World Health Organization (WHO).Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 Technical Lead at the WHO, said on Monday that the Epi team and WHO lab team has been discussing with the WHO virus evolution working group this variant and everything that “we know about it in terms of transmissibility and any studies that are being done in India as well as in other countries where this virus is circulating."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-political-events-among-factors-behind-covid-spike-in-india-who-101620874768317.html

The Mack truck had crashed and overturned five minutes earlier, blocking two lanes of the highway, the report said.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.NHTSA said it previously had opened 28 special investigations into Tesla crashes, with 24 pending.Police in Texas last month said they believed an April 17 fatal crash near Houston occurred with no one in the driver's seat. A preliminary government report Monday said footage from the owner’s home security cameras showed the owner entering the driver’s seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-safety-agency-opens-probe-of-fatal-tesla-crash-in-california-101620867438609.html

It follows a cyberattack against the Colonial Pipeline that caused some internal computer systems to be disabled with ransomware. This led Colonial to shut the pipeline, triggering fuel shortages and panic buying in the southeastern United States.On Wednesday, Atlanta-based Colonial said it "initiated the restart of pipeline operations at 5 p.m. ET."The order also requires that software companies selling to the government maintain certain cybersecurity standards in their products and report whether they themselves have been compromised by hackers. The requirement was first reported by Reuters in March.A senior administration official described the executive order as having a "very significant" impact on the government's ability to detect and respond to hacking incidents.The pipeline cyberattack is the latest in a string of high profile cyber incidents against U.S. companies and government agencies over the last six months.In December, a Russian supply chain hacking operation became public which burrowed into nine federal agencies. More recently, the government has been investigating a different hacking campaign with ties to China that affected five civilian agencies."It's hard to learn from each incident and ensure that broadly government and companies have information to protect themselves," said the official. "So, we have pushed the authority as far as we could and said anybody doing business with the US government will have to share incidents , so that we can use that information to protect Americans."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-cybersecurity-executive-order-after-colonial-pipeline-attack-101620862249674.html
13-05-2021||World||Israeli president warns of civil war as Jews, Arabs clash over Gaza||Israel's president warned of a civil war between the country's Arabs and Jews on Wednesday as fury and fear over shelling exchanges with Palestinian militants in Gaza ignited violence in Israel's streets.Appeals by religious and political leaders for calm, and police reinforcements and mass-arrests, appeared to do little to stem riots in several ethnically mixed towns. Israeli TV showed what it described as "near-lynchings" of Jewish and Arab motorists.The strife was touched off by sometimes violent pro-Palestinian protests by members of the Arab minority incensed at an Israeli air barrage launched on Gaza on Monday after Islamist Hamas-led militants fired salvoes of rockets across the border.A synagogue and cars were torched in the Tel Aviv suburb of Lod, motorists were stoned on some roads, and Palestinian flag-waving protesters scuffled with police in northern Haifa port.By Wednesday, police said the assaults appeared to be more by Jews against Arabs - including one seen on live TV as he was dragged from his car and pummelled by a mob in coastal Bat Yam.The broadcast on the top-rated Channel 12 cut to a phoned-in appeal by President Reuven Rivlin to "please stop this madness"."We are endangered by rockets that are being launched at our citizens and streets, and we are busying ourselves with a senseless civil war among ourselves," said the president, whose role is largely ceremonial.Israel's 21% Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country’s 1948 creation.Most are bilingual in Arabic and Hebrew, and feel a sense of kinship with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They often complain of systemic discrimination, unfair access to housing, healthcare, and education services.Israel's domestic unrest has been welcomed by Hamas, one of whose spokesmen urged Arab citizens to "rise up" against "our enemy and yours".Ayman Odeh, a senior Israeli Arab lawmaker, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative government and potential far-right allies of inflaming ethnic tensions."We must not yield to this," Odeh said on Twitter. "A common struggle by Arabs and Jews is the response to the violent vision of Netanyahu, (Itamar) Ben-Gvir and (Bezalel) Smotrich."Netanyahu, however, issued a video statement in which he pledged to grant police emergency powers for a crackdown."This violence is not who we are," he said. "I don't care if your blood's boiling."In Lod, police imposed a rare night-time curfew. But Israeli media showed young Jewish men, some with bats, on the streets.Ibrahim, an Arab councillor with the Lod municipality, said: "What is happening now is (an) uprising that is going on (in) cities like Ramle, Lod, Jaffa, Acre and Haifa".He called events in Gaza and in Jerusalem - where Israeli police have clashed with Palestinians and Israeli Arabs at a mosque during the Ramadan holy month - a "red line".Another local Israeli Arab politician was more circumspect."We condemn that our people's solidarity and cohesion with our brethren in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip is being channelled through acts of sabotage to public and private property," said Samir Mahamid, mayor of the northern Arab town of Umm al-Fahm.Benny Gantz, Israel's defence minister, called the Jewish-Arab violence "no less dangerous than the Hamas rockets"."We must not win the Gaza battle and lose at home," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-president-warns-of-civil-war-as-jews-arabs-clash-over-gaza-101620861017904.html
13-05-2021||World||Joe Biden speaks with Netanyahu amid Israeli-Palestinian clashes||President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday amid a surge of Israeli-Palestinian violence, which he said he believes is resolving itself.“My expectation and hope is that this’ll be closing down sooner than later,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “But Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.”The most violent clashes between Israel and the Palestinians in years erupted earlier this week, with the militant group Hamas repeatedly firing rockets deep into Israel from the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military responding with air strikes. At least 56 Palestinians have been reported killed in Gaza and six people in Israel.The bombardments escalated sharply Tuesday evening as Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets at metropolitan Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial heartland, and Israel’s south, overwhelming its missile defenses. Netanyahu warned that “Hamas will pay a very heavy price for its aggression,” and a torrent of air strikes followed, targeting military facilities, buildings used by the group, and key intelligence and military commanders.The U.S. is sending Hady Amr, the deputy assistant secretary of State for Israeli and Palestinian Affairs to the the region. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also spoken to Netanyahu and told him it was “vital now to deescalate.”During his call with Netanyahu, Biden “condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups,” the White House said in an account of the conversation. The president conveyed “his unwavering support for Israel’s security and for Israel’s legitimate right to defend itself and its people, while protecting civilians.”Biden also told Netanyahu that the US encourages “a pathway toward restoring a sustainable calm.”He used the call to update Netanyahu on American officials’ recent diplomatic engagements with Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Palestinian officials. They agreed to stay in touch in the days ahead and for their teams to continue close consultation, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-speaks-with-netanyahu-amid-israeli-palestinian-clashes-101620857564473.html

13-05-2021||World||CDC back use of Pfizer-BioNTech shot in kids||A group of medical experts said children ages 12 to 15 years old can safely take the Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, opening an important new phase of the US immunization effort.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 14 to 0, with one recusal, on Wednesday to support the two-dose vaccine’s emergency authorization after it was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky must now sign off on the recommendation before it becomes final.The vaccine could be deployed to teens as soon as Thursday in a move that’s long been anticipated as paving the way for the mass vaccination of middle and high-school students before the next school year begins.“I’m very excited to have this vaccine approved for this age group,” said Camille Nelson Kotton, a panelist and infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, following the vote. “This is a really important issue for this summer, and also a very good way to provide better community immunity.”The vaccine has been available in the US for those 16 and older since mid-December. Other shots made by Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson are only currently available to those 18 and older.In comments at the White House, President Joe Biden encouraged families to get their teenagers vaccinated now that they are eligible. He said more than 15,000 pharmacies in the US will be able to vaccinate this age group and doses also will be available in the offices of pediatricians and family doctors.“The bottom line is this: A vaccine for kids between the ages of 12 and 15 is safe, effective, easy, fast and free,” he said. “So my hope is parents will take advantage of the vaccine and get their kids vaccinated.”He also said that if teens are “on the move this summer, they can get their first shot in one place and their second shot in another.”Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a Monday briefing that pharmacies and other distribution centers can now “extend down to the younger age group” since the clearance is for the same dose and formulation being administered to those 16 and up. Pediatricians, though, will need to make arrangements to deploy the shot given its ultra-cold storage requirements, she said.New York-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech said in March that their two-shot vaccine was 100% effective in the 12-to-15 age group in a final-stage trial. The shot produced antibodies exceeding the level seen in vaccinated young adults, and didn’t result in any new or worrisome side effects.Nearly 60% of Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. But the nationwide campaign to get everyone to take the shot has begun to slow. The US is giving an average of 2.2 million shots a day as of Tuesday, down from 3.37 million about three weeks ago.Now, the next leg of the campaign is poised to begin. There are almost 17 million adolescents ages 12 to 15 in the US, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, or 5.3% of the US population.“Socializing is a critically important part of a child’s development,” said William Gruber, a trained pediatrician who is Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development. “Just as the vaccine has proven liberating to adults, I fully expect the CDC to liberate adolescents.”At the same time, Covid-19 caused more adolescents to be hospitalized than the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, according to Sara Oliver of the ACIP Covid-19 Vaccines Work Group, and the virus is estimated to have been a top-ten cause of death among the age group in 2020 based on fatality data from the previous year.“There’s a misperception that kids aren’t impacted at all by Covid,” said Lee Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in an interview. “Thankfully, death in children has been a rare event, but we’re seeing kids who have long-haul symptoms, and some with cardiac symptoms after being infected.”During the ACIP meeting, the CDC suggested a multipronged approach to vaccine implementation designed to improve access and equity. Those at the forefront of vaccination campaigns should use existing provider networks, they said, including mass vaccination sites and public health facilities while tapping both pediatric providers and family doctors.Co-administrationPreviously, the CDC has said people should wait two weeks between getting a Covid-19 shot and other immunizations based on an “abundance of caution,” rather than any specific negative outcome. On Wednesday, that recommendation changed, drawing some debate.The CDC’s Kate Woodworth said Covid-19 vaccines can be co-administered with other shots, an adjustment that could help boost adolescent immunization rates that have fallen during the pandemic. When non-Covid vaccines are given at the same time as other shots, extensive data has shown they work just as well and have similar adverse effects as when they’re administered individually, Woodworth said.However, it’s unknown whether people will react more strongly when Covid shots are combined with other vaccines. And some panelists said the policy shouldn’t be changed without seeing data specific to the Covid vaccines, particularly since the Pfizer shot and the vaccine made by Moderna Inc. use new technology.The CDC responded by saying providers could consider whether the patient is behind or at risk of becoming behind on recommended vaccines, as well as the reaction profile of the vaccines.Immune ResponseThe trials in the 12-to-15 age group were designed to focus on evaluating the immune response generated by the vaccine, rather than overarching efficacy, which is determined by comparing the number of Covid-19 cases accrued in the vaccine arm of the study to those seen in the placebo arm.Pfizer’s large, final stage study of those 16 and older included more than 40,000 participants. The adolescent trial of 12-to-15 year olds, in comparison, included 2,260 participants. That’s in part because the trial was powered to simply assess the immune response generated by the vaccine, rather than how effective it was in preventing symptomatic Covid-19. Many infected children also do not show symptoms of Covid.However, Pfizer began recruiting the younger adolescents in the late fall, even before it secured efficacy results from those 16 and older. That early enrollment work meant the drugmaker was actually able to evaluate the shot in teens over the holiday season, when new cases of the virus were surging in the US, Gruber said in an interview.No DeathsNo deaths were reported among any of the teen and pre-teen trial participants, and side effects were similar to those noted with adults. The most common were pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache, most of which resolved within a few days.Pediatric researchers are investigating whether Covid is becoming more severe for children now that variants are causing localized flare-ups. The rate of cases in young kids and early teens began surpassing that of those 65 and older in early April, and hospitalizations among children aren’t falling as quickly as for those 18 and older.The CDC is also investigating a rare but serious condition associated with Covid called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C. More than 3,000 cases had been identified by April 1, and the agency will soon update its tally.“Pediatricians are in an ideal position to be talking to parents about the vaccine,” Beers said, noting she expects pediatricians and family doctors to soon take on a bigger roll in the distribution process. “Vaccine delivery is a really important part of what we do. We have lots of experience answering parents questions.”Since 12-to-15 year olds will be given the same vaccine as adults, the regimen will be priced the same. In the US, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine costs $39 for a full course. Currently, the shots are paid for by the US government, with no out-of-pocket cost for vaccine recipients.Meanwhile, Moderna has said that initial results from its trial of its Covid vaccine in adolescents ages 12-to-17 showed that it was 96% effective, with no serious safety problems identified so far. The company is still collecting data and is in discussions with regulators about amending its emergency use authorization to include teenagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-back-use-of-pfizer-biontech-shot-in-kids-101620854243075.html
13-05-2021||World||Mob 'lynching of Arab' aired live on Israeli TV||Footage of a far-right Israeli mob attacking a man near Tel Aviv they believed to be an Arab was aired live on television Wednesday night, as the Israel-Palestinian conflict raged on.The shocking images show a man being forcibly removed from his car and beaten by a crowd of dozens until he lost consciousness.The attack, broadcast by public broadcaster Kan, took place on the seafront promenade of Bat Yam, south of Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv.Police and emergency services did not arrive on the scene until 15 minutes later, while the victim lay motionless on his back in the middle of the street.Those in the crowd justified the attack by saying the man was an Arab who had tried to ram the far-right nationalists, but the footage shows a motorist trying to avoid the demonstration."The victim of the lynching is seriously injured but stable," Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital said in a statement, without revealing his identity.Far-right lawmaker Betzalel Smotrich, head of the "Religious Zionism" party, said he was "ashamed" of the "atrocious cruelty" of the attack."Jewish brothers, stop! We cannot under any circumstances allow ourselves to take part in violent acts," he said.Israel's chief rabbi Yitzhak Yossef called for an end to attacks by Jews."Innocent citizens are being attacked by terrorist organisations, the heart is heavy and the images difficult, but we cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into provocations and aggressions," he said.Issawi Fredj, an Arab deputy from the left-wing Meretz party, said the images were a sign that the country was heading towards "civil war".Demonstrations by far-right activists broke out Wednesday night in several cities, leading to clashes with police and sometimes Arab Israelis.Police said they were responding to violent incidents in cities including Acre, Haifa and Lod.In Acre, a mixed Arab-Jewish town in northwest Israel, a Jew was seriously injured by stone throwers, police said."The rioters in Lod and Acre do not represent Israeli Arabs, the rioters in Bat Yam... do not represent Israeli Jews, violence will not dictate our lives," said opposition leader Yair Lapid, who is currently tasked with forming a government after March elections.Palestinian militants in Gaza have launched hundreds of rockets since Monday at Israel, which has carried out air strikes on the crowded coastal enclave.The most intense hostilities in seven years between Israel and Gaza's armed groups were triggered by weekend unrest at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mob-lynching-of-arab-aired-live-on-israeli-tv-101620852994871.html
13-05-2021||World||US airlines cancel flights to Tel Aviv amid escalating conflict||United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have canceled flights between the United States and Tel Aviv, according to data by flight tracker FlightAware, amid an escalating conflict in Israel.Israel said it killed 16 members of the Hamas armed wing in Gaza in a barrage on Wednesday, and Palestinian militants rained rockets into Israel in one of their most intense hostilities in years.United Airlines said it had canceled flights from Chicago and Newark, New Jersey to Tel Aviv on Tuesday and flights from San Francisco and Newark on Wednesday."We have issued a travel waiver to allow customers to adjust their travel through May 25 and will continue to monitor the situation," a United spokeswoman said.A spokesman for Delta, which flies to Tel Aviv from New York's John F. Kennedy International (JFK) airport, said it has issued a travel wavier for flights between Tuesday and Thursday and has "no determination about resumption at this juncture".American Airlines, which also flies between Tel Aviv and JFK, said it had rebooked customers due to fly on Wednesday and Thursday on alternative flights, without providing details, and had issued a waiver for travel scheduled through May 25.El Al Israel Airlines said earlier on Wednesday it stood ready to operate extra flights as required "to keep Israel's skies open." This could include special flights to repatriate Israelis stranded "in locations from which it is not possible to return home," it said in a statement.Israel on Monday briefly halted takeoffs from its main Ben Gurion Airport and diverted incoming flights after a Hamas rocket barrage on the Tel Aviv area. The country has a smaller airport in the South, called Ramon, designed to serve as a stop-gap should wartime threats force longer closures of Ben Gurion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-cancel-flights-to-tel-aviv-amid-escalating-conflict-101620852444607.html
13-05-2021||World||Hindu sect in the US accused of forced labour to build temple||US federal law enforcement agents conducted a court-authorised action at a sprawling temple complex of a prosperous and politically influential Hindu sect in New Jersey Tuesday after temporary workers brought from India filed a lawsuit alleging “shocking” violations of the most basic laws for workers, including those preventing forced labour.About 200 workers alleged they were paid less $1.20 an hour, which was the minimum federal wage way back in 1963, instead of the mandated ₹12/hour, in New Jersey’s Robbinsville. They said they were forced to work nearly 13 hours a day, all seven days a week; lived in crowded temporary shelters at the temple complex; were prevented from leaving the area unaccompanied; and were verbally abused as “worms” by their employers.Many of them identified themselves as Dalits.The temple -- being touted as the largest Hindu shrine in the US -- is being constructed by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), which describes itself as a socio-spiritual Hindu organisation. Members of the sect, which has 3,850 centres around the world, call themselves Swaminarayan followers and are considered to be influential in political circles.According to the lawsuit filed in the US District Court, District of New Jersey, on Tuesday, the workers said that their employers’ actions “constitute forced labor, trafficking with respect to forced labor, document servitude, conspiracy, and confiscation of immigration documents in the course of and with the intent to engage in fraud in foreign labor contracting”.The class action lawsuit was filed by civil rights lawyers representing six workers of the temple as plaintiffs and 200 in all. The six plaintiffs are Mukesh Kumar, Keshav Kumar, Devi Laal, Niranjan, Pappu, and Brajendra; they say they are Dalits from Rajasthan.The Indian embassy in Washington DC is believed to have sought more information on the matter from relevant US authorities, according to officials aware of the developments.“This is a horrific case of worker exploitation and it is even more disturbing that it has gone on for years in New Jersey behind the temple’s walls,” said Daniel Werner, one of the lawyers representing the workers. “These workers were coerced through lies to come to the United States to work and then suffered tremendously – they were basically forced into servitude,” he said.The FBI said its agents conducted a “court authorised” action at the complex on Tuesday and on Wednesday it sought “any info or tips” pertaining to the order. The India Civil Watch International (ICWI) told news agency PTI that the FBI rescued around 200 workers, “most of them Dalits, Bahujans, and Adivasis” on Tuesday.The lawsuit said these workers were brought to the US between 2011 and now, on R-1 visa, which is meant for foreigners engaged in religious vocation and work. But at the temple, they “performed solely manual — not religious — labor”, the lawsuit said.They were recruited in India through agents and on arrival in the US — John F Kennedy airport in New York — their Indian passports were taken away to “prevent them from leaving”, according to the complaint.Once on the temple campus, the workers “were forced to live and work in a fenced, guarded compound which they were not allowed to leave unaccompanied”. They lived under the watchful eyes of security guards in BAPS uniforms and cameras “monitored and recorded” their activities. They were prohibited from speaking to outsiders and failure to obey rules could result in pay cuts, the lawsuit alleged.They were housed in “crowded trailers” at the temple complex and began working the day after arriving. They were paid approximately ₹31,000 to ₹35,000 (about $425 – $450) a month, the lawsuit said. They were each given $50 in cash and the rest was transferred into their Indian bank account. They were never given salary receipts.There was no response from BAPS to requests for comments. However, Kanu Patel, one of those named as defendants in the lawsuit, told The New York Times, “I respectfully disagree with the wage claim.” He also said he was not in charge of daily operations at the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-sect-in-the-us-accused-of-forced-labour-to-build-temple-101620846157388.html
13-05-2021||World||World could have prevented Covid catastrophe: Pandemic panel||The catastrophic scale of the Covid-19 pandemic could have been prevented, an independent global panel concluded Wednesday, but a "toxic cocktail" of dithering and poor coordination meant the warning signs went unheeded.The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said a series of bad decisions meant Covid-19 went on to kill more than 3.3 million people so far and devastate the global economy.Institutions "failed to protect people" and science-denying leaders eroded public trust in health interventions, the IPPPR said in its long-awaited final report.Early responses to the outbreak detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 "lacked urgency", with February 2020 a costly "lost month" as countries failed to heed the alarm, said the panel.To tackle the current pandemic, it called on the richest countries to donate a billion vaccine doses to the poorest.And the panel also urged the world's wealthiest nations to fund new organisations dedicated to preparing for the next pandemic. 'Delay, hesitation and denial'Requested by World Health Organization (WHO) member states last May, the report, "Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic", argued that the global alarm system needed overhauling to prevent a similar catastrophe."We have identified failures at every stage and we do believe that it could have been possible to prevent this pandemic," panel co-chair and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said."We cannot simply point to one individual who is ultimately responsible," she said.The report said the emergence of Covid-19 was characterised by a mixture of "some early and rapid action, but also by delay, hesitation, and denial."Poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis."The threat of a pandemic had been overlooked and countries were woefully unprepared to deal with one, the report found.Sirleaf said: "The world had been warned that this would happen. This should never happen again. This must be the last pandemic to cause destruction on the scale we are witnessing today."Vaccine ultimatumThe panel said the WHO could have declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) -- its highest level of alarm -- on January 22, 2020.Instead, it waited eight more days before doing so.Nevertheless, given countries' relative inaction, "we might still have ended up in the same place", said former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, the report's other chairwoman.It was only in March after the WHO described it as a pandemic -- a term that is not part of its alert system -- that countries were jolted into action.As for the initial outbreak, "there were clearly delays in China -- but there were delays everywhere", she added.In the near term, the panel said rich, well-vaccinated countries should provide the 92 poorest territories in the Covax scheme with at least one billion vaccine doses by September 1, and more than two billion by mid-2022.G7 industrialised nations should pay 60 percent of the $19 billion ($15 billion euros) required to fund vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics via the WHO's Access to Covid Tools Accelerator programme in 2021, it added.Fellow G20 nations should provide the rest -- and while Clark said there were positive signs emanating from the whole group, she added: "The end of the pandemic sadly is not in sight".The WHO and the World Trade Organization should also get major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree voluntary licensing and technology transfers for Covid-19 vaccines, the panel said."If actions do not occur within three months, a waiver of... intellectual property rights should come into force immediately."Invest billions, save trillionsTo tackle future outbreaks and pandemics, the panel called for a Global Health Threats Council made up of world leaders, plus a pandemic convention.The G20 should also create an International Pandemic Financing Facility, able to spend $5-10 billion a year on preparedness, with $50 to $100 billion ready to roll in the event of a crisis."Ultimately, investing billions in preparedness now will save trillions in the future, as the current pandemic has so clearly illustrated," Clark told reporters."Do nations really want to go through all this again?" she asked.The panel also proposed an overhaul of the WHO to make it less cautious and give it more authority to send expert missions into countries immediately without waiting for their approval.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would work with member states "to build a stronger WHO and a healthier, safer, fairer future for all of us".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-could-have-prevented-covid-catastrophe-pandemic-panel-101620844988315.html
