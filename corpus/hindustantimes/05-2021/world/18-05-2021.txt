He used it to appeal to younger Americans to roll up their sleeves, even if they feel they're at relatively lower risk than older Americans to serious consequences from the virus.“Unfortunately, he is one of the many Americans battling long term symptoms," Slavitt said of his son. “Six months later, he still suffers from tachycardia, shortness of breath and ongoing and frequent flu-like symptoms.”“Many young people are in this situation, and many, many have it worse," Slavitt added.Not much is known about what has come to be known as long Covid.'“We're faced with a mystery,” Dr. Francis Collins, chief of the National Institutes of Health, said in March, as his agency kicked off additional studies to learn more about the condition and study potential treatments.Researchers are hoping to learn whether it is a condition unique to Covid-19, or just a variation of the syndrome that can occur after other infections. They're examining how many people are affected, and how long it lasts, and whether it's possible that the source isn't Covid-19 at all.Meanwhile, Slavitt said that the surest way for young Americans to avoid a similar fate is to get vaccinated themselves.“I know it's easy when you're young to imagine that these things don't affect you, a vaccine may feel unnecessary, you feel healthy, you know people who had Covid and they're doing alright," he said, adding. "But we are still learning about the long term effects of Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-advisor-makes-personal-appeal-to-young-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101621359282632.html

18-05-2021||World||India's halt to vaccine exports 'very problematic' for Africa||An extended halt to exports of Covid-19 vaccines from India, where authorities are battling a wave of domestic infections, risks derailing vaccination efforts already underway in Africa, one of the continent's top health officials said on Tuesday.India stopped vaccine exports a month ago and, according to a Reuters report earlier on Tuesday, is now unlikely to resume major exports before October, dealing a major setback to the global COVAX initiative on which many poor countries rely.Africa has lagged far behind other regions due to supply issues and meagre financial resources but had planned to vaccinate 30-35% of its population by the end of the year and 60% within the next two to three years."This is very problematic as it means unpredictability of our vaccination programmes and a serious risk of not achieving our stated target... on time," the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, wrote to Reuters.Those targets primarily relied on supplies from the global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, which has depended heavily on AstraZeneca shots produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII)."Given India's huge challenges, it will be impossible to expect anything soon," Nkengasong said.There have been at least 4,742,000 reported infections and 126,000 reported deaths caused by the novel coronavirus in Africa so far, according to a Reuters tally.Also Read | Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla defends vaccine export, says ‘daily cases were at an all-time low’And while the pandemic's impact has been less acute than in the United States, Europe and now India, Africa's largely unvaccinated population of over 1 billion remains vulnerable, experts say.COVAX had already begun distributing millions of doses of the two-shot AstraZeneca vaccine to countries across Africa. But those initial shipments have now been largely exhausted, with around 80% having been administered as a first dose, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Most countries using COVAX will now surpass the 12-week maximum interval recommended between the first and second dose of AstraZeneca unless 20 million doses are delivered by the end of June and another 5 million in July, the WHO said."The supply gap could be closed if countries with adequate supplies set aside a percentage of vaccines for COVAX," said Richard Mihigo, coordinator of the WHO's Immunization and Vaccines Development Programme in Africa.A deal negotiated with Johnson & Johnson by the African Union should supply Africa with 400 million vaccine doses beginning in the third quarter of this year.Several countries' health officials told Reuters they had yet to receive updated information on expected arrival dates for COVAX shots. Some are now weighing their options.Ethiopia, for example, has received just 2.2 million of the 7.6 million AstraZeneca shots it was due to get through COVAX by the end of April."We were expecting some delays, but not to this scale. As a country we must search other options," Muluken Yohannes, a senior adviser to Ethiopia's health ministry, told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-halt-to-vaccine-exports-very-problematic-for-africa-101621357572828.html

Rent for single-family homes has been accelerating as larger living spaces for the era of social-distancing and remote work became a priority.The rent hikes have boosted single-family landlords Invitation Homes Inc., American Homes 4 Rent, and Tricon Residential Inc., which have seen shares reach all-time highs in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-single-family-home-rents-hit-14-year-high-as-costs-surge-101621343360672.html
18-05-2021||World||UK judge's order brings Indian banks closer to recovering debts from Vijay Mallya||A consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday moved a step closer in their attempt to recover debt from loans paid out to Vijay Mallya’s now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines after the High Court in London upheld an application to amend their bankruptcy petition, in favour of waiving their security over the embattled businessman’s assets in India.Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs handed down his judgment in favour of the banks to declare there is no public policy that prevents a waiver of security rights, as argued by Mallya’s lawyers.At a virtual hearing, July 26 was set as the date for final arguments for and against granting a bankruptcy order against the 65-year-old Mallya after the banks accused him of trying to “kick matters into the long grass” and called on the “bankruptcy petition to be brought to its inevitable end”.“I order that permission be given to amend the petition to read as follows: ‘The Petitioners (banks) having the right to enforce any security held are willing, in the event of a bankruptcy order being made, to give up any such security for the benefit of all the bankrupt’s creditors’,” Justice Briggs’ judgment reads.“There is nothing in the statutory provisions that prevent the Petitioners from giving up security,” he notes.Mallya’s barrister, Philip Marshall, had referenced witness statements of retired Indian judges in previous hearings to reiterate that there is “public interest under Indian law” by virtue of the banks being nationalised.However, Justice Briggs found no impediment to the creditors relinquishing their security under Indian law because of the engagement of a “principle concerning public interest” and favoured the submissions made by retired Indian Supreme Court judge Gopala Gowda at a hearing in December 2020 on the matter.“In my judgment the simple stance taken by Justice Gowda that Section 47 PIA 1920 is evidence of the ability of a secured creditor to relinquish the creditor’s security is to be preferred,” the ruling notes.The Indian banks, represented by the law firm TLT LLP and barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, were also granted costs in totality for the petition hearings, as the “overall successful” party in the case.“Dr Mallya should have been extradited by now. He was refused permission to go to the Supreme Court in May last year,” Shekerdemian pointed out, in reference to one of Mallya’s defence planks that the cases against him are “politically motivated”.Mallya remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” legal matter, believed to be related to an asylum application, is resolved in connection with the unrelated extradition proceedings.Meanwhile, the SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd as well as an additional creditor, have been pursuing a bankruptcy order in the UK in relation to a judgment debt which stands at over GBP 1 billion.Mallya’s legal team contends that the debt remains disputed and that the ongoing proceedings in India inhibit a bankruptcy order being made in the UK.“The pandemic is having a much more severe impact in India than here, which has slowed things up. Dr Mallya would like things to be faster,” said his barrister Philip Marshall.The case is now scheduled for a day-long hearing on July 26 for Justice Briggs to hear arguments from both sides on whether there is any reason why it should look “behind the judgment debt” to consider all such factors and therefore not grant a bankruptcy order.Presenting a brief background to the petition, which dates back to 2018, the latest judgment describes Mallya as an “entrepreneur businessman” who had considerable financial success in India and other parts of the world as Chief Executive Officer and shareholder of Kingfisher Airways (KFA) and controlling director and main shareholder in United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL).“The cost of aviation fuel rose in 2008, and the value of the rupee declined against the dollar. Dr Mallya decided to borrow substantial sums from some of the Petitioners,” the judgment reads.“Dr Mallya provided personal guarantees for the sums borrowed from the Petitioners in 2010. UBHL also provided a guarantee,” it adds.The debt in question comprises principal and interest, plus compound interest at a rate of 11.5 per cent per annum from 25 June 2013. Mallya has made applications in India to contest the compound interest charge.

18-05-2021||World||China's rocket debris spurs calls for policies to mitigate space junk||The uncontrolled re-entry of a China Long March rocket into Earth's atmosphere has spurred the calls for new policies to help mitigate the growing problem of space junk.Early this month, the remnants of the Chinese rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives.Most of the huge Long March 5B rocket, however, burned up on reentering the atmosphere, the China Manned Space Engineering Office said in a post on WeChat, before it landed just west of the Maldives.The rocket, which was about 108 feet tall and weighs nearly 40,000 pounds, had launched a piece of a new Chinese space station into orbit on April 29.After its fuel was spent, the rocket had been left to hurtle through space uncontrolled until Earth's gravity dragged it back to the ground.Generally, most rockets used to lift satellites and other objects into space conduct more controlled reentries that aim for the ocean, or they are left in so-called "graveyard" orbits that keep them in space for decades or centuries.But the Long March rocket is designed in a way that "leaves these big stages in low orbit," said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Centre at Harvard University.NASA, the US space agency, castigated China for failing to meet "responsible standards regarding its space debris" after remnants of a Chinese rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean."Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations," CNN quoted NASA Administrator Senator Bill Nelson's statement."China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris," he added.Chinese officials downplayed the mishap, but this is not the first time that a piece of Chinese space hardware has made an uncontrolled landing, and the latest incident highlights the need to mitigate a larger space debris issue, Al Jazeera reported.However, no other launcher in the world leaves such a massive component to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled manner.This is not the first time that a piece of Chinese hardware has made an uncontrolled landing.In July 2019, China's previous space station, called Tiangong-2, began to make its descent back to Earth after being decommissioned.The Chinese government also downplayed the risk to populated areas, as it was able to target a specific landing area in the Pacific Ocean thanks to minimal onboard fuel reserves.There is no law on the books currently that forbids pieces of rockets from crashing to Earth's surface. But there are rules in place that say who is responsible when it comes to damage or injury from space junk.The issue of space debris is not new but is expected to grow as more nations build space programmes and more objects are launched into space."Space debris has been known for a while, but now you have more competition in space," Joanne Gabrynowicz, a professor at the National Center for Remote Sensing, Air, and Space Law at the Mississippi School of Law, told Al Jazeera."You do not just have two spacefaring nations - the Chinese are becoming very significant, as is the European Space Agency, among others. When you have more actors and more stuff, it gets more complicated," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-rocket-debris-spurs-calls-for-policies-to-mitigate-space-junk-101621347798854.html

We sincerely hope that will change," he added.In an apparent rebuttal, China's envoy later told the same virtual U.N. meeting that Beijing was prepared for dialogue."We stand ready to carry out positive dialogue and exchange with all parties to jointly explore effective measures to reduce nuclear risk and to contribute to global strategic security," Ji Zhaoyu said.The exchange came at a discussion on the Prevention of Nuclear War at the 65-member U.N. Conference on Disarmament based in Geneva. The body, which makes decisions by consensus, has not reached a major agreement in decades but is often the theatre for tense rhetorical exchanges between superpowers.Earlier this year, Russia and the United States agreed to extend the New START arms control treaty for five years, preserving the last treaty limiting deployments of the world's two largest strategic nuclear arsenals.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden are set to discuss arms control and security issues at a meeting and strategic nuclear stability will be on the agenda. Wood said on Tuesday he hoped that such bilateral discussions may lay the groundwork for nuclear disarmament and future arms control treaties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-resisting-bilateral-nuclear-arms-talks-us-101621346989373.html
18-05-2021||World||China hopes a ‘moderate Muslim’ leadership will run Afghanistan in the future||China says it hopes to see a “moderate Muslim” leadership in Afghanistan in the future and has assured the country of help in strengthening its anti-terrorism capacities as Kabul prepares for the departure of US troops later this year.In two phone calls to Afghanistan’s senior leadership on Monday, China’s state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi laid out what Beijing sees on the road ahead for China-Afghanistan ties.“China hopes that Afghanistan’s future leadership will pursue a moderate Muslim policy, promote a foreign policy of peace, maintain friendship with neighbouring countries, and firmly combat all forms of terrorism. China will continue to play a constructive role in advancing the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan,” Wang told Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar.China is stepping up cooperation with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries as the September 11 deadline for the complete withdrawal of US troops approaches as it prepares for any subsequent threat to its projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region.The international community, particularly countries in the region, should help the Afghan people consolidate the fruits of peace and reconstruction in the country, Wang said.Wang added that China will continue to support the Afghan government in playing a leading role in the country’s peace and reconciliation process.He called on all parties to support and implement relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions to promote a smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan, to avoid in particular a resurgence of terrorism. During a phone call on Monday with Hamdullah Mohib, national security adviser to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, Wang emphasised that China endorses the “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned” principle, adding that Beijing supports all parties in Afghanistan in finding a broad and inclusive political arrangement through peaceful means.Wang said the “unilateral withdrawal” of US troops has brought uncertainty in the country, especially at the current crucial stage of the “Afghan domestic reconciliation process”.“China is ready to facilitate internal negotiations among various parties in Afghanistan, including creating necessary conditions for negotiations in China,” Wang added.Last week, Wang was quoted by Chinese media as telling Central Asian countries that it was necessary for neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, including Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, to coordinate their positions in a timely manner, speak with one voice, and fully support the Afghan domestic peace process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hopes-a-moderate-muslim-leadership-will-run-afghanistan-in-the-future-101621347614162.html
18-05-2021||World||Won't deviate from lockdown plans: UK PM Boris Johnson on B1.617.2 variant of Covid-19||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that experts continue to monitor the data on the B1.617.2 variant of Covid-19, first identified in India, but there is nothing conclusive yet that indicates that it would force Britain to deviate from its roadmap to lift lockdown restrictions fully next month.Johnson said the government is keeping everything under “very close observation" following the emergence of the B1.617.2 variant of concern (VOC), which is feared to be on track to take over from the local B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the county of Kent, as the dominant coronavirus mutation in the country."We are looking at the epidemiology the whole time as it comes in and, at the moment, partly because we have built up such a wall of defences with the vaccination programme, I don't see anything conclusive at the moment to say that we need to deviate from the roadmap,” he said, in reference to the government's scheduled June 21 timeline for a complete lifting of lockdown restrictions."But we've got to be cautious and we are keeping everything under very close observation. We'll know a lot more in a few days' time," the prime minister said.Johnson used a visit to a vaccination centre in London to reiterate a message for the British public to continue to come forward for their vaccination when they are invited by the National Health Service (NHS) in order to protect against all variants of Covid-19 after vaccine hesitancy was flagged as one of the factors behind some of the B1.617.2 VOC hotspots in north-west England."The numbers (vaccinations) are incredibly high. And I know that... some people have been more vaccine hesitant than others, but actually, across the whole of society, the numbers continue to go up in every group. And that's very, very encouraging. And I would urge everybody – just to make the obvious point – who is eligible for a vaccine, when you get your call up, when you get the notification from the NHS, come and get your jab," he said.Johnson’s message follows a similar drive by senior ministers, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock informing Parliament on Monday that vaccines seem effective against the highly transmissible B1.617.2 VOC.“There are now 2,323 confirmed cases of B1617.2 in the UK; 483 of these cases have been seen in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, where it is now the dominant strain. Cases there have doubled in the last week and are rising in all age groups,” Hancock told the House of Commons in an update on the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.“In Blackburn, hospitalisations are stable, with eight people currently in hospital with Covid. In Bolton, 19 people are now in hospital with coronavirus, the majority of whom are eligible for a vaccine but have not yet had one. That shows that the new variant is not tending to penetrate into older vaccinated groups, and underlines again the importance of getting the jab — especially, but not only, among the vulnerable age groups,” he said.The minister also updated members of Parliament on early evidence which suggests that B1.617.2 is more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 so-called Kent variant.“We do not yet know to what extent it is more transmissible. While we do not have the complete picture of the impact of the vaccine, the early laboratory data from Oxford University corroborates the provisional evidence from the Royal Bolton Hospital and the initial observational data from India that vaccines are effective against the variant. This, of course, is reassuring, but the higher transmission poses a real risk,” he added.According to latest data, more than 36.7 million people have had their first vaccine dose in the UK and more than 20.2 million have had their second. The NHS bookings for a vaccination are now open to all those aged 36 and over.It follows Monday’s significant easing of lockdown rules, with people allowed to socialise indoors and travel around more freely after months. However, a planned review of long-term social distancing requirements for the end of this month is likely to be delayed as the spike in B1.617.2 VOC infections continues to be monitored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-deviate-from-lockdown-plans-uk-pm-boris-johnson-on-b1-617-2-variant-of-covid19-101621341963855.html

What does the law say?||The wife of Belgium’s ambassador to South Korea, who allegedly hit two staff members at a boutique store in Seoul last month, has now invoked diplomatic immunity to avoid criminal charges, police said Tuesday. According to local media reports, a store employee had mistaken Xiang Xueqiu, wife of Ambassador Peter Lescouhier, for a shoplifter and tried to look inside the jacket she was wearing.The security camera footage shared widely online showed Xiang Xueqiu, wife of Ambassador Peter Lescouhier, pushing one of the staff members before slapping her across the face. Lescouhier had previously apologised in an Instagram video, saying her wife “might have had her reasons to be angry at the way she was treated in that shop, but committing physical violence is totally unacceptable."Apologising for her wife’s action, the Belgian envoy said that “[s]he sincerely regrets it and she wants to offer her apologies in person to the shopkeeper when she gets the opportunity to do so." Xiang was hospitalised following the incident but, the ambassador said, was discharged as her “medical condition [was] stabilising”.“Out of respect for the privacy of all persons involved and in the interest of the investigation, I myself and the staff of my embassy will abstain from any further comments on this case,” he added.A post shared by Embassy of Belgium in Seoul (@belgiuminkorea)The incident sparked outrage in South Korea as thousands of people signed petitions on the presidential website calling to expel the ambassador’s wife from the country. While South Korea’s foreign ministry assured that it has been “seriously handling” unlawful behaviour by foreign diplomats, Seoul Metropolitan Police said in a statement that Xiang had exercised her diplomatic immunity and, therefore, will formally drop the case soon.What does the law say?According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, of which South Korea is a signatory, family members of diplomats living in foreign countries enjoy immunity from arrest in most of the cases. However, the immunity can be voluntarily waived by the sending state and it must always be “express”.“Waiver of immunity from jurisdiction in respect of civil or administrative proceedings shall not be held to imply the waiver of immunity in respect of the execution of the judgement, for which a separate waiver shall be necessary,” reads Article 36(4) of the Vienna Convention.The use of diplomatic immunity has come under scrutiny in other countries, especially after Anne Sacoolas, wife of an American ambassador, fled the United Kingdom using diplomatic immunity following her alleged involvement in a fatal road accident that killed a British teenager, Harry Dunn. The parents of Harry Dunn launched a court case, which they eventually lost in November 2020, to argue that Britain’s Foreign Office wrongly decided Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belgian-envoy-s-wife-slaps-shopkeeper-in-seoul-then-claims-diplomatic-immunity-101621340300835.html

Vaccination, he noted, could protect not just children but also the adults around them.But he added that the authorities have not yet decided whether to prioritise vaccinations for children, and that this decision would be made at a later date.Finance Minister Lawrence Wong noted that Singapore has multiple tracks in its vaccination programme, including one that focuses on those in the education sector - teachers, staff and students.Wong, a co-chairman of the task force, said that teachers have already been vaccinated along with students in university hostels.These students were offered the shot due to the communal setting they live in, which poses a higher risk of infection."So both MOH and MOE will be now looking at vaccination as a next step under the education track for schoolgoing children, and we will update in due course," said Wong.Addressing any potential concerns parents might have about the safety of their children, Mak said that the vaccine is not only safe for those aged 12 to 15, but it is also as effective as it would be for adults.Meanwhile, all schools will start full home-based learning (HBL) from Wednesday until May 28 when the school term ends, amid a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. This applies to all primary, secondary and junior college students, as well as those from Millennia Institute and special education schools.The Government is also ramping up its Covid-19 vaccination programme by starting registration for people aged 40 to 44, and deploying doctors and nurses to homes to help those who are homebound or not mobile to receive their jabs.From Wednesday, residents aged between 40 and 44 can register themselves to get their Covid-19 vaccine jabs, MOH said on Tuesday.As of May 17, the Government has administered more than 3.4 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.Close to two million people have received at least the first dose of the vaccine, of whom more than 1.4 million people have received their second dose and completed their vaccination."If all goes smoothly, 4.7 million individuals will be covered by at least one dose of vaccination by August (and) this will substantively cover almost all our eligible population," Ong said.Singapore's population is estimated at 5.9 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-vaccinate-children-aged-12-to-15-against-covid-19-as-cases-spike-101621342153403.html

"It's my understanding that we've received some further information through intelligence channels, and it's not something I can comment on," he said.Israel said its fighter jets struck a multi-storey building “which contained military assets belonging to the intelligence offices of the Hamas terror organization”.The Associated Press’ top editor Sally Buzbee on Sunday said they were yet to see any evidence from Israeli officials to justify the bombing and added that her organization wants an independent investigation into the incident.A call from by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday in support of a ceasefire appeared to go unheeded, although cross-border fighting between Israel and Hamas seemed to abate slightly on Tuesday.Ron Dermer, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington and now adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN that evidence has been provided to Washington."The evidence has already been provided, as I understand it, to U.S. intelligence officials. And that was a site where you had Hamas intelligence in that building, and they were engaged in activity that actually would have, as far as I understand, would have undermined our ability to actually target effectively and also undermined our ability to intercept incoming rockets."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-received-more-info-on-israel-s-destruction-of-gaza-high-rise-blinken-101621340679635.html
18-05-2021||World||More than 15,000 people from Myanmar shelter in Mizoram: Official||The number of people from Myanmar seeking shelter in India has swelled to more than 15,000, with more likely to cross over as fighting intensifies in parts Myanmar following a coup, an Indian government official said on Tuesday.The influx into the small, northeast Indian state of Mizoram, which shares a porous, mountainous border with Myanmar, began in late February as policemen fled to avoid having to take orders from a junta trying to suppress opposition to the Feb. 1 coup.By April, about 1,800 people from Myanmar - including several lawmakers - had crossed the border but the number has recently grown to more than 15,400, according to the vice chairman of Mizoram's State Planning Board, H. Rammawi."It is increasing day by day," Rammawi told Reuters by telephone, adding that many people from Myanmar were going to the homes of relatives making it difficult to track numbers.Communities in Mizoram and some parts of Myanmar have close ethnic ties, with extended families often strung across both sides of the border.About 6,000 of the people from Myanmar are in Mizoram's capital of Aizawl with others scattered in five districts, according to data shared by Rammawi.Rammawi said that residents and non-government organisations were taking care of the people but the state government had sought assistance from federal authorities."Medical aid and their rations are very important," he said, adding that some people from Myanmar had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.With fighting intensifying in northwest Myanmar's Chin State, opposite Mizoram, Rammawi said he expected the numbers seeking refuge in India to increase.The Myanmar hill town of Mindat, about 100 km (60 miles) from the border, has seen some of the most intense fighting since the coup after a militia took up arms against the junta. Thousands have since fled from the town."More people will be coming," Rammawi said.Several thousand villagers have fled from fighting in eastern Myanmar into Thailand since the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-15-000-people-from-myanmar-shelter-in-mizoram-official-101621338350119.html

Israel says it hits only legitimate military targets and that it does all it can to avoid civilian casualties.About 47,000 of the displaced people have sought shelter in 58 UN-run schools in Gaza, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Geneva, told reporters.Laerke said 132 buildings had been destroyed and 316 had been severely damaged, including six hospitals and nine primary healthcare centres as well a desalination plant, affecting access to drinking water for about 250,000 people.The UN agency welcomed the fact that Israel had opened a border crossing for humanitarian supplies but called for another crossing to also be opened.The UN and its humanitarian partners are providing food and other assistance to displaced families when the security situation allows, Laerke said.There is a severe shortage of medical supplies, a risk of water-borne diseases and the spread of Covid-19 because of displaced people crowding into schools, said Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization.London-based Amnesty International called for an investigation into air strikes on residential buildings in Gaza."Israeli forces have displayed a shocking disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians by carrying out a number of airstrikes targeting residential buildings in some cases killing entire families - including children - and causing wanton destruction to civilian property, in attacks that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity," Amnesty said.Israel says it strikes only sites it deems military targets used by militants and that it regularly issues prior warnings to evacuate buildings it sees as legitimate targets as part of wider efforts to avoid civilian casualties.Amnesty, which urged both sides last week not to violate humanitarian law, said it had documented four deadly attacks by Israel launched on residential homes without prior warning and called on the International Criminal Court to investigate.It said Israeli strikes on May 11 destroyed two residential buildings belonging to the Abu al-Ouf and al-Kolaq families, killing 30 people, 11 of them children. A mother and three children were killed on May 14 when the al-Atar family's three-storey building was hit, it said.It said the home of Nader Mahmoud Mohammed Al-Thom, where he lives with eight others, was attacked without warning on May 15.Israel did not immediately comment on the specific cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-agency-says-52-000-displaced-in-gaza-amnesty-wants-war-crimes-investigation-101621336954749.html
18-05-2021||World||Explained: Are Israel, Hamas committing war crimes in Gaza?||More than a week into their fourth war, Israel and the Hamas militant group already face allegations of possible war crimes in Gaza. Israel says Hamas is using Palestinian civilians as human shields, while critics say Israel is using disproportionate force.Who's right? It's hard to say, especially in the fog of battle.The firing of hundreds of imprecise rockets into Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian groups is fairly clear-cut. International law prohibits targeting civilians or using indiscriminate force in civilian areas. Rockets slamming into Tel Aviv apartment blocks is a clear violation.But in Gaza, where 2 million people are packed into a narrow coastal strip, the situation is far murkier. Both sides operate in dense, urban terrain because that's pretty much all there is. Because of the tight space and intense bombardments, there are few safe places for Gazans to go. A blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after Hamas seized power in 2007 makes it virtually impossible to leave.As a grassroots movement, Hamas is deeply embedded in Palestinian society, with a political operation and charities separate from its secretive armed wing. While Israel and Western countries view Hamas as a terrorist organization, it is also Gaza’s de facto government, employing tens of thousands of people as civil servants and police. So just being connected to Hamas doesn’t mean someone is a combatant, and there are many in Gaza who oppose the group — and all are equally exposed with nowhere to run.Also Read | Israel-Palestine conflict: Why images of densely-populated Gaza blurry on Google Maps?Earlier this year, the International Criminal Court launched an investigation into possible war crimes committed by Israel and Palestinian militants during the last war, in 2014. Both sides already appear to be using the same tactics in this one.Here's a look at potential violations of international law.___Urban CombatPalestinian fighters are clearly operating in built-up residential areas and have positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and command and control infrastructure in close proximity to schools, mosques and homes.A prosecutor would have to prove that the combatants deliberately placed military assets near civilians to benefit from protections afforded to noncombatants during war.“If France invades Switzerland, the Swiss are not prohibited from defending Geneva, including by putting Swiss soldiers, Swiss artillery positions and so on inside Geneva,” said Marco Sassoli, professor at the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights.Because international humanitarian law applies to all sides in any conflict, the French could fight in Geneva as well. But here the issue of proportionality applies on the big picture level: To continue the analogy, was the French assault on Geneva proportional to the provocation?___ProportionalityIsrael's critics often accuse it of the disproportionate use of force. They note that the undeclared nuclear power, with the region's most powerful military, is waging war on a militant group armed with little beyond long-range rockets, the majority of which are intercepted by Israel's anti-missile defenses. As in the past, the toll in the current conflict is dramatically lopsided, with at least 200 killed in Gaza, nearly half of them women and children, and 10 in Israel, all but one of them civilians.Israel argues it has the right to eliminate the threat from rockets, including command infrastructure connected to it. It says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians, including by warning them ahead of some strikes. But Sassoli said that in past conflicts, Israel had a “quite large concept of what is a legitimate military objective.”Proportionality in international law also applies to individual attacks, but experts say proving a specific attack is disproportionate is extremely difficult. One would need to know what was targeted, what military advantage was gained, and whether it exceeded the harm inflicted on civilians and civilian property. That means that in practice, only the most extreme cases are likely to be prosecuted.On Saturday, Israel bombed a 12-story building housing the Gaza offices of The Associated Press and the Al-Jazeera news network, as well as dozens of private apartments and small businesses, including a law firm, a lab for blood testing and a TV production company.The Israeli military warned residents to evacuate the building, and no one was hurt.The military says there was a considerable Hamas presence in the building, including a command and control center, an intelligence unit and other infrastructure used to coordinate combat operations. But it has provided no evidence.AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt has said he was “shocked and horrified” by the attack, and AP has called for an independent investigation. “We have no indication of a Hamas presence in the building, nor were we warned of any such possible presence before the airstrike. This is something we check as best we can," Pruitt said Monday.Sassoli said it would be “completely unlawful” to attack a media center, but it's impossible to know whether the bombing was justified without knowing what the military was targeting.Strikes causing civilian casualties raise strong proportionality questions.On Sunday, Israel launched heavy airstrikes along a main thoroughfare in Gaza City, saying it was targeting Hamas' “underground military infrastructure.” The bombardment toppled three buildings and killed at least 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children. A day earlier, a strike in a crowded refugee camp killed 10 women and children. Israeli media said the military was aiming for senior Hamas officials meeting in the building.Also Read | Blinken says haven't seen Israeli evidence on AP Gaza building strike___Underground ArmyMembers of Hamas’ armed wing rarely if ever wear uniforms or identify themselves in public, and they go underground as soon as hostilities begin, along with the political leadership.The vast majority of Hamas supporters are not involved in fighting, which means they aren’t supposed to be targeted. The International Committee of the Red Cross defines a combatant as someone with a “continuous combat function” or those engaged in combat at the time they are targeted, a widely adopted definition.So even if a building were filled with die-hard Hamas supporters, experts say it wouldn’t be considered a legitimate target unless they were actively involved in combat operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-are-israel-hamas-committing-war-crimes-in-gaza-101621327473606.html
18-05-2021||World||Biden, Harris incomes dropped in 2020, tax returns show||President Joe Biden’s income fell dramatically to $607,336 in 2020 as he dropped lucrative speaking engagements to campaign for the White House, but he still earned enough to pay the higher tax rates he’s proposed for wealthy people.Biden and first lady Jill Biden paid $157,414 in federal income tax, making their federal income tax rate 25.9%, according to their 2020 tax return, which was obtained by Bloomberg News ahead of its Monday release by the White House. They paid an additional $28,794 in Delaware state taxes and $433 to Virginia, where the first lady teaches.The Bidens reported holding cash and investments totaling between $1.2 million and $2.88 million in a financial disclosure filed to the Office of Government Ethics ahead of Monday’s deadline for senior executive branch officials and also obtained by Bloomberg.Biden was consistently at the bottom of net worth rankings for members of Congress during his years in the Senate, but cashed in after the vice presidency, making more $16.5 million from 2017 to 2019, according to according to tax returns previously released by his presidential campaign.Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff are also releasing their tax returns and financial disclosures on Monday. In 2020, Harris and Emhoff had a federal adjusted gross income of $1,695,225, most of which came from Emhoff’s work at law firm DLA Piper, where he was a partner. They paid $621,893 in federal income tax, a rate of 36.7%.Higher TaxesBoth Biden and Harris would end up paying higher tax rates under Biden’s American Family Plan based on their incomes this year. Harris and Emhoff would also be subject to an increase in the capital gains rates since they earned more than $1 million. Both couples would benefit from efforts among some House Democrats to repeal the $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT. The Bidens paid $90,289 in SALT while Harris and her husband paid $280,421, amounts they could fully write off if Democrats succeed in restoring the tax break that was curbed by former President Donald Trump.In all, Biden will have released tax returns from 23 years, the White House said in a statement touting his continuation of “an almost uninterrupted tradition,” a knock against former President Donald Trump, who bucked tradition -- but not law -- by declining to release his. Ahead of the documents’ release, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters their disclosure “should be expected by every president of the United States.”Trump claimed he couldn’t release his returns because he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service, but the agency said he was free to do so. During the campaign, Biden played up his voluntary disclosures, releasing his and Harris’s 2020 tax returns just before the first presidential debate in September.The OGE clashed with Trump over the former president’s labyrinthine business empire, which included a hotel just blocks from the White House in a building leased by the federal government. The OGE hasn’t identified any conflicts of interest with Biden or Harris.More than $260,000 of the Bidens’ income came from annuities and pensions, and they received a combined $45,836 in social security benefits. Much of the rest of their income came from Jill Biden’s work at Northern Virginia Community College.Giving to CharityThe Bidens gave $30,704 -- 5% of their income -- to charity. The biggest check was $10,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, named for their late son. They gave $5,000 to both the Food Bank of Delaware and the International Association of Fire Fighters Foundation. The IAFF union has been a longtime Biden ally and was first to endorse him after he entered the presidential race in 2019.The Bidens reported having as much as $1,780,000 in cash spread across four banks and two credit unions. That’s down from as much as $3.2 million reported in their disclosure filed in May 2020.They also had modest holdings in mutual funds worth between $26,000 and $215,000. They had liabilities of between $280,000 and $600,000, including a mortgage from 2013, when the Bidens refinanced a 30-year loan on their Greenville, Delaware, home at a 3.375% interest rate.There are between $53,000 and $270,000 in mutual fund holdings in the first lady’s name, including three investments in sector funds in health care, technology and utilities that she intends to divest out of an abundance of caution to avoid violating conflict of interest rules, a White House official said. An independent fund manager will put the money into diversified funds, the official said.The Bidens drew attention during the campaign for running their income from book deals and speaking engagements through their respective S-corporations. The Obama administration tried and failed to close what it saw as a loophole, which helped the Bidens avoid paying the 3.8% self-employment tax, saving them roughly $500,000 in their peak earning years of 2017 and 2018.But the president’s S-corporation, CelticCapri Corp., now holds only the intellectual property to his books and between $1,000 and $15,000. Biden pledged on his disclosure form that the business will remain dormant during his government service with one exception: if his publishers choose to reissue his books.The first lady’s S-corporation, Giacoppa Corp., had slightly more activity, paying her $200,000 in wages and $90,854 in business profits. Two publishers of her books, Simon & Schuster and Flatiron Books, both paid the S-corporation during 2020. She also reported $12,681 in W-2 wages from her job teaching English part-time at Northern Virginia Community College, down from previous years when she had a busier teaching schedule.Like the Bidens, Harris’s and Emhoff’s earnings were substantially down from 2019, when they had $3,018,127 in taxable income and paid $1,185,628 in taxes. The decrease in income is due in large part to Emhoff’s departure from DLA Piper -- he took a leave of absence in August after Harris joined the Democratic ticket and left the firm days after November’s election. On their tax return, Harris reported $293,902 in income from her 2019 book “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey” in addition to her U.S. Senate salary.The second couple’s reported assets are between $3.1 million and $7 million. Two of their largest investments are in Vanguard’s Value Index and Growth Index exchange traded funds, with between $250,000 and $500,000 in each.Emhoff has between $600,000 and $1.25 million in accounts tied to DLA Piper and an additional $250,000 to $500,000 in a capital account at Venable LLP, another law firm where he was a partner. He holds small amounts of a handful of sector funds well below the $50,000 threshold for a conflict of interest and will continue to review them, the White House official said.The couple gave $27,006 to charity, including $5,000 each to three of their alma maters, Howard University, the University of Southern California and California State University, Northridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-incomes-dropped-in-2020-tax-returns-show-101621327225567.html

Since December 2019, Yusuf had served as special assistant to the prime minister on national security and strategic policy planning. Pakistan’s cabinet division issued a formal notification regarding Yusuf’s appointment on Monday. “The Prime Minister has been pleased to approve that Dr Moeed W Yusuf, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Security and Strategic Policy Planning, shall function as National Security Adviser with the status of Federal Minister, with immediate effect,” the notification said. Before being made chairman of Pakistan’s Strategic Policy Planning Cell (SPPC), which comes under the National Security Division (NSD), Yusuf was associate vice president of the Asia Center at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). Also Read | Ahead of FATF review, Pakistan announces new measures on terror financingHe is also the author of Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments: US Crisis Management in South Asia. Yusuf is perceived as close to Khan and Pakistan’s military leadership, especially army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. Reports have said he has played a crucial role in back-channel contacts between India and Pakistan in recent years that led to the two sides recommitting themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. After the two sides announced on February 25 that they would strictly adhere to the truce on the LoC, Yusuf had said in an audio statement that the agreement on the ceasefire was the outcome of “behind the scenes” contacts and “more roads will open” in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-appoints-moeed-yusuf-as-nsa-101621332793394.html
18-05-2021||World||Pakistan denies presence of B.1.617 Covid variant, lacks specialised kits to detect||Pakistan has officially denied that the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus has entered the country, despite experts noting that it does not have specialised kits to detect the highly contagious Covid-19 mutation.Research institutions in Pakistan have detected some "unknown variant" constituting 15 per cent of the country's total infections, however, the lack of specialised testing kits has hampered the identification process, writes FM Shakil for Asia Times.The Pakistan government imposed lockdowns in major parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces last week, which constitute the majority of Covid infections and deaths. They also called in the military to help civilian agencies implement public safety measures, Asia Times reported.Last week, health authorities in Thailand claimed to have found the B.1.617 variant in a Thai woman and her four-year-old son who had been in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan.Reacting to the Thai claim, Asad Umar, chairman of the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) claimed that it was 'out of the question' that the Thai national contracted the variant as it was "not present in the country".However, Dr Muhammad Iqbal Chaudhry, director at the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, told Asia Times that the variant was not detected in Pakistan because the kits needed to detect the virus were not available.He said that the variant might already have infected the country given the close interaction of the two countries' diasporas in Gulf states.Chaudhary further informed that the number of tests did not conform with the country's population."The testing of symptomatic or asymptomatic patients brings a different ratio of positivity. If you were conducting tests on asymptomatic people like teachers or people in other essential services, the ratio would come down drastically as compared to the symptomatic population," he said, adding that government departments should increase the testing on asymptomatic patients to arrive at a factual ratio of positivity."The government's corona testing figures show a downward revision from 65,000 last month to 35,000 during the past couple of weeks. It may be a tactic to keep the pressure off the overwhelming of hospitals and minimize the oxygen requirements that was reaching the optimal level last month," Dr Muhammad Khizer Hayat, chairman of the Young Doctors Association, Punjab (YDAP), told Asia Times.Highlighting that the third wave of the pandemic had put huge pressure on oxygen supply and healthcare facilities in Pakistan, Khizer said that the government had not provided equipment at primary and secondary healthcare departments.Last week, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) last week warned that the "coronavirus was exploding in Asia and the Pacific with over 5.9 million new confirmed infections in the past two weeks, more than in all other regions combined."Pakistan is currently in the midst of a deadly third Covid-19 wave, which had witnessed a high number of deaths and increasing pressure on the healthcare infrastructure of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-denies-presence-of-b-1-617-covid-variant-lacks-specialised-kits-to-detect-101621327853967.html

The governor has denied any wrongdoing and said he was sorry if his behavior had made "people feel uncomfortable."Cuomo's book, "American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic", was published in October 2020 by The Crown Publishing Group, a subsidiary of Penguin Random House.According to the documents, the group paid him $3.12 last year, and will pay him the remainder in two installments worth around $2 million each in 2021 and 2022.The Wall Street Journal reported late in March that the New York state attorney general's office had subpoenaed dozens of officials in Cuomo's administration as part of the probe into sexual harassment accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-cuomo-s-covid-book-deal-was-worth-than-5-million-101621327268610.html

The investigation has been carried out by South China Morning Post (SCMP).It said that the facilities did not declare the outbreaks when a "low risk" worker first contracted the virus. The numnber of those infected has now reached 1,000, the SCMP report claimed.Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) and Fraser Health tried to withhold the data about the failure of its Covid-19 tackling strategy of enhanced surveillance or monitoring, the report further said. The data about the deaths and infection came out after the authorities were compelled to provide it by freedom of information requets, said SCMP.There have been 1,328,582 infections and 24,948 Covid-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began, news agency Reuters reported.In the recent weeks, the average number of cases have started falling in the country, which recorded its highest daily cases on April 17.Ontario, the country's most populous province, has extended its stay-at-home order for an additional two weeks to June 2, Premier Doug Ford announced last week.The surge is Covid-19 cases in Canada was largely driven by more easily transmitted coronavirus variants and a reopening that many health experts said happened too soon.Less than four per cent of Canada's adult population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has promised that everyone who wants to can be fully vaccinated by September, last week spoke of a "one-dose summer" and a "two-dose fall" without explaining what that might look like.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vancouver-care-homes-delayed-declaring-covid-19-outbreak-192-dead-report-101621325776140.html
18-05-2021||World||Biden pledges US support as COVAX faces shortfall of 140 million doses||The US will work with the WHO-backed COVAX facility and other partners for the equitable distribution of some 80 million Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpiles in line with scientific and public health data from around the world, President Joe Biden has said.The move comes at a time when COVAX, which signed advance agreements to procure hundreds of millions of doses for low-income countries, has been floundering because of a shortfall in supplies from the Serum Institute of India (SII) after India curtailed exports from March to cope with a devastating second wave of infections.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that COVAX’s supply shortfall will be 140 million doses by the end of May, and if supplies from SII continue to be disrupted, this figure is estimated to rise to 190 million doses by the end of June.The US administration will also mount a multilateral effort with democracies to cope with the pandemic, and Biden said he expects to announce progress in these efforts at the G7 Summit to be hosted by the UK in June.Biden announced on Monday the US will share 20 million doses from its surplus stocks of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by the end of June. This will be in addition to the earlier US commitment to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries.The announcement marked the first time the US has said it will share the three vaccines that are authorised for use in the country, and the move stems from the Biden administration’s belief that it will have enough doses to protect all Americans by June.The US is believed to currently have around 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn’t yet been approved for use in the country, and the stockpile is expected to swell to 60 million doses by the end of June. The Biden administration has said these doses will be distributed only after the vaccine clears a safety review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Explaining the procedure for the distribution of surplus vaccines, a White House fact-sheet said: “The United States will work with COVAX and other partners to ensure these vaccines are delivered in a way that is equitable and follows the science and public health data.”It added, “In the weeks ahead, working with the world’s democracies the Biden-Harris Administration will coordinate a multilateral effort to end the pandemic. We look forward to progress on this at the G7 Summit in June.”The fact-sheet said the US will send the 80 million doses to countries battling the pandemic “by the end of June”, and that donations from America’s excess supply will continue “as that supply is delivered to us”.The people cited above said greater clarity on how the US would share its surplus stocks is expected over the next few days. “We will know if the distribution will be through COVAX or the US will use the COVAX distribution model. We also have other issues to deal with, such as which countries will get the vaccines and how many doses,” said one of the people.COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. A spokesperson for Gavi said discussions were on with the Indian government and SII to find an “optimal solution” to the shortfall in vaccine supplies and to make up for lost time in administering vaccines.“We are in talks with the government of India and remain hopeful that deliveries will resume, even if in a much reduced capacity, in the third quarter,” the spokesperson said, adding these efforts are aimed at finding the best way forward for India and neighbouring countries.The “key immediate challenge” is getting adequate doses for Bangladesh, Nepal and other African countries to deliver the second dose to people who had received the first shot, the spokesperson said.Besides the US administration’s announcement, there were pledges for more than 20 million doses by other countries, including France (13 million), Spain (7.5 million), the United Arab Emirates and Sweden (one million doses each), the spokesperson said.The White House reiterated what Biden had said about the distribution of vaccines not being linked to securing favours from other countries, an apparent reference to similar efforts by China and Russia.“Just as in World War Two America was the arsenal of democracy, in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, our nation is going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world. We’ll share these vaccines in the service of ending the pandemic everywhere. And we will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries,” Biden said.The US administration recently said it is looking at the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India and ways to help Indian manufacturers such as the Serum Institute of India (SII) to ramp up production to meet vaccine needs around the globe.The US administration is working on the Indian government’s list of raw materials and other supplies urgently needed to manufacture vaccines but American officials have cautioned this won’t be an easy task because of disruptions to global supply chains.The US has also diverted enough AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies from its own pre-existing orders to produce more than 20 million doses in India.The US is working with the private sector and other partners to expand global vaccine manufacturing and distribution and production of vital raw materials. The US International Development Finance Corporation has launched a global vaccine initiative that is targeting investments in multiple regions to address short-term requirements and intermediate-term efforts to ensure better preparedness for future health emergencies.This includes the Quad Vaccine Partnership to supply a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, by the end of 2022.The Biden administration has also backed a proposal first mooted by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) last year for waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines, though officials have warned that this will involve complex negotiations that could take months, if not years. The European Union, however, has not shown an inclination to endorse this move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-work-with-covax-partners-to-distribute-80mn-covid-19-vaccines-prez-biden-101621320193171.html

Vance’s successor Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service.Iain Stewart, president of the PHAC said Brodie “played a pivotal role in the vaccine roll-out as part of the initial deployment to the agency in November”, and her presence at the helm of the programme “allows for a seamless transition as she resumes her leadership role with the PHAC”.The PHAC partnered with the armed forces on November 27 last year to enhance its “planning, operations and logistical capacities through the addition of a team of military personnel”, the agency said.Brodie joined the armed forces in 1989 and has commanded platoons, a company and a battalion, and has been deployed to Croatia, Bosnia, and Afghanistan. She is serving with both NATO and the UN.Defence minister Harjit Sajjan described her as “an expert in logistics”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/head-of-canada-s-covid-vaccine-roll-out-accused-of-misconduct-new-chief-named-101621317912926.html
18-05-2021||World||Over 2,300 people in UK infected with Covid-19 strain found in India||The highly transmissible India variant of coronavirus has now been found in 86 districts across the U.K., Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, as he urged the public to stay cautious when meeting friends indoors.Also Read | Covaxin effective against coronavirus strains found in India, UKAuthorities have identified 2,323 cases of the variant as of Monday, with cases doubling in the past week in Bolton and Blackburn in northwestern England, Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday.With 86 local authorities confirmed to have five or more cases of the India variant, Hancock said it was vital that people get vaccinated. Most people with the strain known as B.1.617.2 in areas around Bolton had not received a shot, he said, and early evidence suggests vaccines still work against this variant.“The vaccination program can give us confidence but we must be alert to new variants that can jeopardize the advances that we’ve made,” Hancock said. “We must proceed with caution and care and bear down on the virus, in whatever form it attacks us.”An England-wide ban on households mixing indoors was relaxed Monday, and bars, restaurants and cafes were allowed to open to customers inside for the first time in months. The vaccine rollout is being altered to give over-50s and the most vulnerable their second dose more quickly to ensure they are protected as soon as possible.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already warned that the final stage of lifting restrictions, due on June 21, may be delayed amid rising concerns over the new variant.Travel concernsHancock faced repeated questions in parliament over the reopening of international travel, given that many variants are brought into Britain from overseas.From Monday, Britons are able to travel to a number of countries on the so-called “green list” -- including Portugal and Israel -- with no need to quarantine on return. But there are concerns over a lack of clarity about the “amber list” of countries including France and Spain, which people are legally allowed to visit but have been told by ministers not to.Jeremy Hunt, a Conservative member of Parliament and former health secretary, called for “absolute clarity” on the rules. Hancock said the government advice was “very clear,” adding: “People should not travel to amber list countries for a holiday.”Hancock also came under fire for the timing of the U.K.’s decision to ban travel from India, amid concern from opposition MPs that a delay in April opened the doors to thousands of people who could have been infected with the variant.He insisted that the right decisions were taken at the time, saying Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the “red list” two weeks earlier because the people arriving from these countries had higher infection rates than passengers landing from India.Hancock denied claims from several MPs that the real reason was because Johnson did not want to offend Indian prime minister Narendra Modi ahead of a planned trade visit. That trip was eventually canceled on April 19, the same day that India was put on the red list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-2-300-people-in-uk-infected-with-covid-19-strain-found-in-india-101621313600873.html

Both sides should “refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in east Jerusalem and its neighbourhood,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-israel-gaza-101621304503523.html
18-05-2021||World||China to relax policy on birth but wary of risks||China will tread carefully in relaxing its birth policies for fear of harming social stability, even as the latest census highlights the urgency to address the country’s declining birth trends and ageing population, policy sources said.Expectations for birth policy reforms are rising after the 2020 census last week showed China’s population grew at its slowest in the last decade since the 1950s as births declined and ageing accelerated.A fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman in 2020, on par with ageing societies like Japan and Italy, underscores the risk for China: the world’s second-biggest economy may already be in irreversible population decline without having first accumulated the household wealth of G7 nations.Top leaders are working out a broader plan to cope with demographic challenges, the sources said, including more effective ways to encourage childbearing by easing financial burdens on couples, rather than simply removing birth curbs. Raising the retirement age, which Beijing said will be done gradually, will help slow a decline in the workforce and eventually ease pressures on the under-funded pension system, they said.China introduced a controversial “one-child policy” in the late 1970s but relaxed restrictions in 2016 to allow all couples to have two children as it tried to rebalance its rapidly-ageing population. The change, however, failed to halt declining births.The sources said they expect Beijing to encourage more childbearing under the current policy framework, before fully lifting birth restrictions over the next 3-5 years.Removing birth restrictions could have unintended consequences: a limited impact on city dwellers, who are reluctant to have more children due to high costs, while rural families could expand faster, adding to poverty and employment pressures, the sources, who are involved in policy discussions but not the final decision-making process, said.China aims to create at least 10 million new urban jobs a year, even as the working age population shrinks.Liu Huan, an adviser to the Chinese cabinet, said China’s main population challenge is not size but ageing, which will put heavy pressure on government finances. “It’s hard to resolve the birth problem given high housing, medical and education costs,” he said. “So we should have comprehensive policies.”Calls for changeIn April, The People’s Bank of China said in a working paper that China should “fully liberalise and vigorously encourage childbirth” to offset the economic impact, saying China should draw lessons from Japan’s “lost 20 years”.The proportion of people aged 65 and above hit 13.5% in 2020, up from 8.87% in 2010.But changes to the present policy will likely be gradual.Talent dividedDeepening rivalry with the US has raised the urgency for China to build a more innovation-driven economy. Under President Xi Jinping’s “dual circulation” strategy, China aims to ease dependence on overseas markets and technology.“We should make a transition from population dividend to talent dividend,” the first policy source said.The census showed improved education over the last decade. The proportion of people with university education rose to 15.5% from 8.9%, and average years of schooling for people aged 15 or above edged up to 9.9 years from 9.1 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-relax-policy-on-birth-but-wary-of-risks-101621304171978.html

That represents 13 per cent of the vaccines produced by the US by the end of June. This will be more vaccine doses than any country has actually shared to date, five times more than any other country. More than Russia and China, which have donated 15 million doses," Biden told reporters at a news conference here."There's a lot of talk about Russia and China influencing the world with vaccines. We want to lead the world with this demonstration of our innovation, ingenuity, and the fundamental decency of the American people. Just as in World War II, America was the arsenal of democracy, in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, our nation is going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world. We'll share these vaccines in the service of ending the pandemic everywhere," he said."We will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries," Biden said as he announced that in addition to the 60 million AstraZeneca vaccines, the US will give another 20 million Covid-19 approved vaccines."In March, we shared over four million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine with Canada and Mexico. At the end of April, we announced that we would provide another 60 million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine overseas," he said.AstraZeneca vaccine has not been authorized for use in the US yet, and it is awaiting safely clearance by the US Food and Drug Administration. "And today, I'm announcing that we'll also share US-authorized vaccines doses of Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as they become available, with the rest of the world as well. These are vaccines that are authorized to be put in the arms of Americans," he said."And by the end of June, when we'll have taken delivery of enough of such vaccines to protect everyone in the United States. The US will share at least 20 million doses of those doses -- that extra supply -- with other countries," Biden said.Biden's announcement was welcomed by US lawmakers and Indian-American community leaders."While I'm glad to see the White House committing to sharing an additional 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses with the world by the end of next month, this is only one step of the many more we need to take to reduce the threat of new mutant strains emerging from outbreaks abroad and causing another deadly surge here at home," said Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi."The outbreaks we're seeing in India and many other nations are a tragedy for all those facing them, and they're a threat to those in other countries who've already been vaccinated because of the risk they pose of producing vaccine-resistant mutations," he said."We need to further expand our support to the nations battling these outbreaks in order to save the millions of lives in danger today, and the millions more across the world, and in the United States, who could be endangered by new forms of the virus if these surges are allowed to fester," Krishnamoorthi said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that a decision on which countries would receive these vaccine doses would be taken in due course.Indian-American community leader Ajay Bhutoria also welcomed Biden's announcement."The President is restoring America's leadership in the world by stepping by being a Leader in fight against Covid-19 and sharing vaccine doses with people around the world," he said. In a statement, he urged the President that the vaccines be sent to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil and other countries heavily impacted by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-share-20-million-more-covid-vaccine-doses-with-world-101621302684318.html

18-05-2021||World||Former Trump aide Rudy Giuliani treated like 'drug kingpin', 'terrorist': Lawyers||Attorneys for Rudy Giuliani say a covert warrant that prosecutors obtained for his Apple iCloud account in November 2019 and a raid last month by agents who seized his electronic devices show they are treating him more like a drug kingpin or terrorist than a personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump.In a letter to a federal judge in Manhattan, the lawyers said that by secretly seizing Giuliani's cloud data files in 2019, investigators had improperly intruded on private communications with the president.The seized files, they wrote, likely included “material relating to the impending impeachment, the welfare of the country, and to national security.”They asked the judge to unseal affidavits in support of the Nov. 4, 2019, search warrant. Reviewing the affidavits, the lawyers said, will help them expand their argument “that this unilateral, secret review was illegal" and that any evidence gathered from it should be suppressed.The letter was sent to a Manhattan federal judge who is considering whether to appoint a “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege during a review of evidence gathered from raids on Giuliani’s residence and office in April.It was initially sent last week. A redacted version was made public Monday.A spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment.Federal prosecutors in New York are examining Giuliani’s interactions with Ukrainian figures and whether he violated a federal law that governs lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities without registering with the U.S. government.Any warrant issued in 2019 as part of that inquiry, or any other investigation, would have been approved by a neutral judge.Giuliani, a Republican and former New York City mayor who represented Trump in the special counsel's Russia investigation, has not been charged with a crime.He has said his activities in Ukraine were conducted on behalf of Trump. At the time, Giuliani was leading a campaign to press Ukraine for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter before the Democrat was elected president.Some Ukrainians who dealt with Giuliani as he campaigned against the Bidens were also looking for his help with matters of their own, including arranging meetings with U.S. officials or pressuring the Trump administration to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.Giuliani’s lawyers have argued that the early morning April raids on his home and office were not necessary because he had made clear in 2019 that he would answer any questions without restrictions, except for privileged matters, as long as his lawyers knew what subjects would be discussed.They said prosecutors instead “simply chose to treat a distinguished lawyer as if he was the head of a drug cartel or a terrorist, in order to create maximum prejudicial coverage of both Giuliani, and his most well known client – the former President of the United States.”In addition, the lawyers wrote, the original warrant for Giuliani's iCloud account contained a non-disclosure order based on an allegation made to a judge that Giuliani might destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses if he knew the warrant existed.“Such an allegation, on its face, strains credulity. It is not only false, but extremely damaging to Giuliani’s reputation. It is not supported by any credible facts and is contradicted by Giuliani’s efforts to provide information to the Government. We should be allowed to question the Government as to what basis it had, if any, to make that assertion,” they said.Giuliani attorney Robert Costello said prosecutors have another week to respond to the letter.In a separate letter dated last week but filed publicly Monday, lawyers for Victoria Toensing — a Washington lawyer whose phone was seized last month as part of the same investigation — asked a judge to order the Justice Department to return her cell phone as well as information collected from her iCloud and Google accounts from what they described as “covert warrants” in 2019.Given the breadth of the warrants, the lawyers wrote, “it is virtually certain that the materials the Government received included substantial privileged and confidential information concerning clients and criminal matters that have nothing to do with this investigation, privileged and confidential information concerning unrelated other matters that are actively before the DOJ, and privileged and confidential information that is the subject of the warrants.”The defense lawyers said the government has so far declined to reveal what materials a specialized filter team has acquired, reviewed or turned over to the investigative team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-trump-aide-rudy-giuliani-treated-like-drug-kingpin-terrorist-lawyers-101621299623851.html

18-05-2021||World||Covid-19: In California, people required to wear masks till June 15||California won’t lift its mask requirement until June 15 to give the public and businesses time to prepare and ensure cases stay low, the state health director said Monday, a decision that runs counter to many other states including Oregon and Washington that quickly aligned with last week's new federal guidelines.“This four-week period will give Californians time to prepare for this change, while we continue the relentless focus on delivering vaccines particularly to underserved communities and those that were hard hit throughout this pandemic,” Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said.The timing aligns with California Gov. Gavin Newsom's earlier announcement that if cases remain low, the state will drop nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on June 15.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention altered its mask guidelines last week, saying it’s safe for fully vaccinated people to skip face coverings and social distancing in virtually all situations. The CDC guidelines say all people should still wear masks in crowded indoor locations such as airplanes, buses, hospitals and prisons.On May 3, California adopted the CDC’s earlier recommendation that people who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear a mask outdoors unless they are attending crowded gatherings. But the state says those people must wear masks indoors unless they are meeting with other vaccinated people.For unvaccinated people, face coverings are required outdoors any time physical distancing cant be maintained, including at such at things as parades, fairs, sports events and concerts.Businesses are expected to adhere to the state’s guidelines, Ghaly said. Both the CDC and state plan to keep the mask requirement in place for students for the rest of the calendar year.California business leaders including state Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Allan Zaremberg feared the differing federal and state mask requirements will sow confusion. He urged regulators to follow state health officials' lead, while his counterpart at the California Restaurant Association, Jot Condie, had hoped the state would follow the new CDC guidelines.Regardless, "Californians need to be aware that restaurants and other businesses must follow state and local guidelines, and we ask for the patience of our guests,” Condie said.It is difficult already for business owners to play “mask cop,” said John Kabateck, director of the California chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses: “We hope that they will not be vulnerable to penalties and scrutiny by state regulators or plaintiffs' attorneys because they’re trying to make sense of this labyrinth.”Still, Kabateck he was generally supportive of the state's decision.“If wearing masks for a little bit longer is an ounce of prevention that’s going to let mom-and-pops reopen their doors and get people back to work, that’s a step in the right direction,” he said.Major retailers including Walmart, Costco and Trader Joe’s sayi they won’t require vaccinated shoppers to wear a mask unless state or local laws say otherwise.San Diego retiree Rafael Sanchez, 64, called it “a scrambled egg message” and blamed his fellow Democrat Newsom for sending conflicting signals involving state rules and the governor's own behavior, an allusion to Newsom attending a fancy dinner party with lobbyists last fall while telling residents to avoid such gatherings.San Diego hair stylist Emily Follweiler, 27, was relieved masks will still be required indoors.“I think people should still keep wearing it and not have to rely on an honor system,” she said, a reference to customers only needing to say they have been fully vaccinated and not provide documentation.Los Angeles County was among those quickly saying they would follow the state lead. Supervisor Hilda Solis said the county will use the extra month to increase vaccination rates.So far 43% of residents 16 and over are fully vaccinated in the state's most populous county. “That means more than half of our adult population remains vulnerable,” Solis said.Wearing masks and social distancing remain “critically important strategies,” said Los Angeles County health director Barbara Ferrer.After becoming the epicenter for the virus in the U.S. at the start of the year, California has seen a precipitous decline. The state positivity rate among those tested has fallen below 1%, officials said Monday, and more than 34.5 million doses of vaccine have been administered as the state approaches the full reopening of its economy.Newsom, like the Biden administration, has been under pressure to ease mask restrictions as coronavirus cases ease nationwide. But the governor is facing a recall election this fall driven largely by frustration with his handling of the pandemic.Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, businessman John Cox and reality TV personality and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, all Republicans seeking to replace Newsom, criticized the delay in removing mask requirements.Cox, who lost in a landslide to Newsom in 2018, said it was notable that the governor had Ghaly deliver the news about the mask mandate but last week the Democratic governor traveled the state to announce a litany of initiatives to spend an unprecedented budget surplus.“He wants to take credit for spending billions of dollars, but then goes into hiding when he has something unpopular to announce,” Cox said. "There’s a reason he’s hiding: he’s wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-california-people-required-to-wear-masks-till-june-15-101621296832762.html

"I’m particularly disturbed by the disproportionate bombing of the Gaza Strip, including the deaths of at least 92 women and children and the targeting of the Associated Press building."Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that he had spoken to United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan about the urgent need to halt the violence in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza."The loss of life from this crisis is deeply saddening, and it is imperative to restore calm and end this conflict," he said.The Biden administration has privately blamed the administration of Republican former President Donald Trump for breaking off communications with the Palestinian Authority in its zeal for a pro-Israel policy, believing that has contributed to instability.While Trump helped negotiate four normalization deals between Israel and Arab countries, he cut assistance to the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-pressure-biden-works-for-ceasefire-in-israel-gaza-violence-101621294290177.html

The American Press reported that some isolated areas could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain.Parts of southeastern Texas and western Louisiana were under flash flood warnings on Monday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service's Lake Charles office. Several inches (centimeters) of rain also feel on parts of Arkansas.The sheriff's office for Calcasieu parish was asking residents to stay off the roads and said they had already deployed high water vehicles and boats to assist residents, KPLC reported.Photos on local media showed water up to the doorsteps in one subdivision of Lake Charles while vehicles sought to navigate flooded streets in another part of town.The rainy weather is expected to continue in southern Louisiana through the middle of the week.Western Louisiana is still recovering from back-to-back hurricanes Laura and then Delta last year.

They’re beating up women!” Aya Khalaf, a Palestinian social media influencer, screamed in the background as she caught the May 9 incident on a live stream to her 187,000 Instagram followers.The scene is one of several shared on social media from the near-nightly confrontations between Israeli police and protesters against the expulsion of eight Palestinian families from the neighbourhood, which is claimed by Jewish settlers.The hashtag “#SaveSheikhJarrah” has gained momentum overseas, with British singer Dua Lipa among those expressing solidarity.In October last year, an Israeli court ruled in favour of settlers who say the Palestinian families are living on land that used to belong to Jews. Palestinians are appealing the decision at Israel’s Supreme Court.Anger over the proposed evictions was a key factor behind tensions in Jerusalem over the Muslim holy month of Ramzan, which last week escalated far beyond the holy city into the worst hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians for years.Islamist group Hamas launched a rocket assault on Israel, which hit back with multiple air and artillery strikes on Gaza. A week later, nearly 200 people have been killed in Gaza, including 58 children, and 10 people have been killed in Israel, two of them children.The settlers who filed the lawsuit for Sheikh Jarrah say they bought the land from two Jewish associations that purchased it at the end of the 19th century. Palestinians, who question the legitimacy of the settlers’ documents, have lived there since the 1950s.Israel captured East Jerusalem in a 1967 war, later annexing it in a move not recognised by most of the international community who regard settlements there as illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-jerusalem-s-sheikh-jarrah-became-a-global-flashpoint-101621286545001.html
