The complex has played a major role in sparking hostilities with the Hamas in Gaza and violence across Israel.Al Jazeera reported that dozens of Jewish, backed by heavily armed Israeli special forces, stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem in the early morning, hours after Palestinian worshippers were beaten and assaulted by Israeli police, according to the Islamic authority overseeing the site.Citing witnesses, Palestinian news agency WAFA said Israeli police had earlier on Sunday assaulted Palestinian worshippers who were performing dawn prayers at the mosque and assaulting them.WAFA added that at least six Palestinians had been arrested.The Temple Mount is the holiest place in Judaism, as the site of the biblical Temples. It is also a site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.Jews have been barred from visiting the Temple Mount since May 3, when authorities made the decision to shutter the compound to non-Muslims amid spiraling tensions in the city, reported Israel Times.The fighting between Israel and Hamas began on May 10, after Gaza militants fired barrages of rockets at Israel in protest to the Israeli measures in East Jerusalem.A tit-for-tat trade of fire broke out, where Israeli fighter jets carried out hundreds of airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel said that it targeted the infrastructure of Hamas and other militant groups in the enclave.On Friday, an Egypt-brokered ceasefire was reached between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jerusalems-temple-mount-complex-opened-for-jews-for-first-time-in-20-days-101621791322591.html
23-05-2021||World||Indian peacekeepers help civilians evacuate after volcano erupts in Congo||The Indian Army played a crucial role in the evacuation of civilians and United Nations personnel from North Kivu’s capital Goma after a volcano erupted in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. The Indian Army’s brigade involved in peacekeeping operations in the African country is headquartered in Goma, and it accounts for the largest deployment of Indian forces on foreign soil alongside South Sudan. “The Indian brigade HQs held its ground and in a calculated and calm manner, thinned out 70% of the strength of the camp and sent them to the Himbi company operating base (COB) for safety. A minimum strength continued to hold onto the camp ensuring no threat to UN and national assets as also providing security to empty aviation base and aviation fuel stored there,” said one of the officials cited above. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat commanded the Indian brigade in 2008-09 when he was a brigadier. There are more than 2,300 Indian troops with the UN’s costliest peacekeeping mission in the Congo, a sprawling (the size of western Europe), dangerous and notoriously unstable country formerly known as Zaire. It was here that heavyweight boxing champion Muhammed Ali knocked out George Foreman 46 years ago in a world-famous bout called “Rumble in the Jungle”. Sandwiched between Nyiragongo volcano and the exploding Lake Kivu, Indian soldiers are operating in the Congo under a 15-minute evacuation plan. The Indian brigade is located next to the Goma airfield, which plays an important role in providing logistics support to UN peacekeepers deployed in eastern Congo. Mount Nyiragongo, located near Goma, erupted on Saturday night causing panic among the local communities. “Most of the lava, however, has flowed towards Rwanda and only a small stream is trickling towards Goma. As a precautionary measure, various country contingents were told to be on alert by the UN’s internal security system that calculated that evacuation will not be required. However, a majority of the country contingents including aviation contingents evacuated immediately,” the official said. The army also established an observation point that gave real-time updates of the lava flow to the brigade HQs, enabling it to relay correct information to the UN and creating a semblance of orderliness in the civilian evacuation, he added. Lava flow has slowed down considerably. “Lava flow at this stage is unlikely to reach Goma town unless there is fresh eruption through fissures. Intermittent earthquakes of very low intensity are being currently experienced.” India has a long history of deploying troops in the Congo: the first Indian blue berets (the colour used on UN duty) served from 1960 to 1965. It is the only UN mission where an Indian soldier — Captain G.S. Salaria — was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. He died in 1961, trying to save the Katanga province from falling to rebels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-peacekeepers-help-civilians-evacuate-after-volcano-erupts-in-congo-101621788604126.html
23-05-2021||World||Belarus opposition figure detained after Ryanair flight diverted to Minsk||A prominent opponent of Belarus' authoritarian president was arrested Sunday after the airliner in which he was traveling was diverted to the country after a bomb threat, in what the opposition is calling a hijacking operation by the government.The presidential press service said President Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered that a MiG-29 fighter jet accompany the Ryanair plane — traveling from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania — to the airport in the capital Minsk.Deputy air force commander Andrei Gurtsevich said the plane's crew made the decision to land in Minsk, but Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda claimed the plane was forced to land there.Belarus' “regime is behind this,” Nauseda said on Twitter.The Belarusian Interior Ministry said Raman Pratasevich was arrested at the airport. Pratasevich is a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which Belarus last year declared as extremist after it was used to help organize major protests against Lukashenko.Pratasevich, who had fled the country for Poland, faces charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.The presidential press service said the bomb threat was received while the plane was over Belarusian territory. Officials later said no explosives were found on board. Flight-tracker sites indicate the plane was about 10 kilometers (six) miles from the Lithuanian border when it changed course.There was no immediate comment from Ryanair.Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to begin an investigation.“It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation by the special services to hijack an aircraft in order to detain activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich,” she said in a statement. “Not a single person who flies over Belarus can be sure of his safety.”Months of protests arose after last August's presidential election that official results say gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office.Police cracked down on the protests harshly, detaining around 30,000 people and beating many of them.Although protests died down during the winter, Belarus has continued to take actions against the opposition and independent news media. Last week, 11 staff members of the TUT.by news website were detained by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-opposition-figure-detained-after-ryanair-flight-diverted-to-minsk-101621787796482.html
23-05-2021||World||France concerned about 'risk of apartheid' in Israel||French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned on Sunday of the risk of "long-lasting apartheid" in Israel in the event the Palestinians fail to obtain their own state.Le Drian is one of the first senior French officials to use the term "apartheid" in reference to Israel, which has angrily denied any policy of racial discrimination.The veteran politician made the remarks in an interview with RTL radio and Le Figaro newspaper in reference to the clashes between Jews and Arabs that erupted in several Israeli cities during the latest conflict.The violence, which revealed simmering anger among Israeli Arabs over the crackdown on Palestinians in Jerusalem, shattered years of peaceful coexistence within Israel."It's the first time and it clearly shows that if in the future we had a solution other than the two-state solution, we would have the ingredients of long-lasting apartheid," Le Drian said, using the word for the white supremacist oppression of blacks in South Africa from 1948 to 1991.Le Drian said the "risk of apartheid is high" if Israel continued to act "according to a single-state logic" but also if it maintained the status quo."Even the status quo produces that," he said.He added that the 11-day conflict between Hamas and Israel had shown the need to revive the moribund Middle East peace process."We have take one step at a time," he said, expressing satisfaction that US President Joe Biden had reiterated support for creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel.Israel's latest offensive against Hamas killed 248 people in the Gaza Strip, including 66 children, and wounded over 1,900, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Meanwhile, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups into Israel killed 12 and wounded around 357 others, Israeli police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-concerned-about-risk-of-apartheid-in-israel-101621786065488.html
23-05-2021||World||Gaza bookshop owner's dreams buried under the rubble||For decades, it was the place to go for books in the blockaded Gaza Strip, from school texts to the Koran to Arabic translations of European literary classics.But last Tuesday, owner Samir al-Mansour watched in disbelief as the bookshop and publishing house he had poured his life into went up in smoke."Forty years of my life were obliterated in less than a second," said the man in his 50s, a cigarette between his fingers, staring at a mound of concrete, paper and squashed plastic chairs."There are 100,000 books under this rubble," he said.At around 5:00 am on Tuesday, Mansour was at home watching television when the channel reported the Israeli air force was about to hit the building housing his bookshop.Mansour rushed over, but came to a dead stop some 200 metres (220 yards) away from the building, just in time to see a missile obliterate his life's work.The latest deadly clashes lasted 11 days and saw Israel launch air strikes in response to a rocket barrage by Hamas, which rules Gaza, and other Islamist groups."I have nothing to do with an armed group, a political faction," Mansour told AFP."It's an attack on culture."- 'Never happened before' -Mansour started working in his father's bookshop in the 1980s, when he was just 14 years old, then took over in 2000 and soon branched out into publishing.As rescue workers continue to look for bodies and survivors in the rubble after the military conflict, Mansour was mourning all that he has lost.Buried in the rubble were copies of Islamic religious texts, children's picture books and a copy of Fyodor Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov".Israeli strikes on Gaza since May 10 have killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and have wounded over 1,900 people, the Gaza health ministry says.Rockets and other fire from Gaza have claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, an Israeli soldier, one Indian, and two Thai nationals, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel have been wounded.There is controversy about how many of those killed in Gaza were combatants, and how many were civilians.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's bombing campaign had killed "more than 200 terrorists" in Gaza.Mansour said he had lived through two Palestinian uprisings and three Gaza wars."But this had never happened, my bookshop was never destroyed," he said.His son-in-law Montasser Saleh had arrived in Gaza from Norway to visit the family just before the conflict started, and was with him when his life was turned upside down."We were at home, watching television," Saleh said.- 'More than a bookshop' -He recounted how on the TV channel Al Jazeera "they said there had been a warning shot on the building containing the bookshop".He too said they immediately rushed over to the building."Samir wanted to go and grab some papers, his computer, but he was too scared to go in and be hit by a missile, so we stayed outside," he said.Mosaab Abu Toha, a poet and the founder of the Edward Said library started after the Gaza war in 2014, said the Gaza Strip had lost "one of its main cultural resources"."Mansour was more than a bookshop," he said. "It was a publishing house publishing Gaza writers."The books were printed in Egypt -- some to come back to Gaza, but others to stay there and be circulated around the Arab world."It was a way to lift the siege on Gaza through literature," he said of the blockade on the Palestinian territory in place since 2007.For Gaza readers, the publishing house had printed around 1,000 copies of the works of local authors such as Ghareeb Askalani or Yusri al-Ghoul.Mansour is not the only book or stationery shop destroyed in the latest Israeli bombing campaign.Nearby Iqraa was also levelled, and the Al-Nahda stationery and bookshop was reduced to a pile of pulverised cinderblocks.In front of what remains of Al-Nahda, a poster assured loyal customers it would re-open soon."Ideas do not die," it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-bookshop-owner-s-dreams-buried-under-the-rubble-101621783127556.html

23-05-2021||World||USCIS should approve H-1B visas for 6 years, suggests Cato Institute's David Bier||The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently revoked a memo, issued during the Donald Trump administration, to ensure smoother H-1B visa extension. The Trump-era memo required immigration officers to treat each visa extension request as a new application. This caused an increase in additional documentation which subsequently increased administrative burden and costs for sponsoring employers.The latest policy guidance instructs officers to defer to previous approvals while extending work visas such as H-1B. However, the officers may not defer to a prior approval when there is a material error, material change, or new material facts that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, applicant’s, or beneficiary’s eligibility. While the new memo came as a huge relief for foreign workers with temporary work visas, David J. Bier, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., believes much more can be done to further improve the US immigration system.Even though the Immigration Act of 1990 has authorised H-1B visa holders to receive status for up to six years, the department of labor (DOL) and the USCIS regulations limit labor condition applications (LCAs) and petition approvals to no more than 3 years. Last year, H-1B workers and employers had to file more than 320,000 extension requests.Also Read | Biden administration removes Trump-era H-1B rule vacated by courtIn response to invitations to the public for comments on improvements to the legal immigration system, Bier said that filing for an extension after 3 years is an “unnecessary and expensive burden.” Bier argued that employers and workers suffer unjust costs and potential delays in the visa extension process and the agencies are burdened with additional reviews of materials that they have already reviewed and approved.“USCIS should replace the 3-year limit on initial H-1B petition approvals with a 6-year limit, and DOL should revert to its earlier regulation allowing a 6-year approval of LCAs,” he wrote.Due to the recent policy guidance update, Bier suggests that there is no longer any basis for defining “coming temporarily” to mean less than six years now that Congress has explicitly stated otherwise. In the fiscal year ending September 2020, more than 3.19 lakh H1-B visas were issued to those born in India, according to an annual report on characteristics of H-1B speciality occupation workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-should-approve-h-1b-visas-for-6-years-cato-institute-s-david-bier-101621775067154.html
23-05-2021||World||IAEA may no longer get nuclear sites images: Iran||Iran’s parliament speaker said Sunday that international inspectors may no longer access surveillance images of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear sites, escalating tensions amid diplomatic efforts in Vienna to save Tehran's atomic accord with world powers.The comments by Iran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, aired by state TV, further underscored the narrowing window for the U.S. and others to reach terms with Iran. The Islamic Republic is already enriching and stockpiling uranium at levels far beyond those allowed by its 2015 nuclear deal.“Regarding this, and based on the expiration of the three-month deadline, definitely the International Atomic Energy Agency will not have the right to access images from May 22,” Qalibaf said. May 22 was Saturday.Hours later, however, a website called Nournews that's believed to be close to Iran's Supreme National Security Council quoted an anonymous official suggesting Tehran's deal with the IAEA could be extended “another month.”The International Atomic Energy Agency had said its director-general would brief reporters later Sunday in Vienna. The United Nations agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under what is called an “Additional Protocol” with Iran, the IAEA “collects and analyzes hundreds of thousands of images captured daily by its sophisticated surveillance cameras,” the agency said in 2017. The agency also said then that it had placed “2,000 tamper-proof seals on nuclear material and equipment.”Iran’s hard-line parliament in December approved a bill that would suspend part of U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities if European signatories did not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions by February. The IAEA struck a three-month deal with Iran to have it hold the surveillance images, with Tehran threatening to delete them afterward if no deal had been reached.It wasn't immediately clear if the images from February had been deleted. Before Qalibaf’s remarks, lawmaker Ali Reza Salimi urged an open session of parliament to ensure Iran’s civilian nuclear arm “erased” the images. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran did not immediately comment on the decision.“Order the head of the Atomic Energy Organization to avoid delay," said Salimi, a cleric from Iran's central city of Delijan. The “recorded images in the cameras should be eliminated."It also wasn't clear what this meant for in-person inspections by the IAEA. There are 18 nuclear facilities and nine other locations in Iran under IAEA safeguards.Qalibaf said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, supported the decision.In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. An escalating series of incidents since Trump’s withdrawal has threatened the wider Mideast.Over a year ago, a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian general, causing Tehran to later launch ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American troops in Iraq.A mysterious explosion also struck Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, which Iran has described as sabotage. In November, Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who founded the country’s military nuclear program some two decades earlier, was killed in an attack Tehran blames on Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inspectors-may-no-longer-get-nuclear-sites-images-iran-101621768667404.html
23-05-2021||World||Congo's Mount Nyiragongo volcano's lava flows short of regional capital Goma||Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo unleashed lava that destroyed homes on the outskirts of Goma, but witnesses said Sunday that the city of 2 million had been mostly spared after the volcano erupted at night and sent thousands fleeing in panic.Residents said there was little warning before the dark sky turned a fiery red, leading to fears that the eruption could cause the same kind of devastation as the last time in 2002 when hundreds died. There was no official word on how many may have been killed amid the scramble to flee the city late Saturday.The UN peacekeeping mission had said that it didn't appear the lava was flowing toward Goma based on reconnaissance flights, but untold thousands still set off in search of safety. Some boarded boats onto Lake Kivu while others attempted to reach Mount Goma, the highest elevation point. At least 3,000 fled across the nearby border into Rwanda.On Sunday, residents ventured out to assess the damage after a night of panic. Smoke rose from smoldering heaps of lava in the Buhene area near the city.“We have seen the loss of almost an entire neighborhood," said Innocent Bahala Shamavu. “All the houses in Buhene neighborhood were burned and that’s why we are asking all the provincial authorities and authorities at the national level as well as all the partners, all the people of good faith in the world, to come to the aid of this population.”Elsewhere witnesses said lava had engulfed one highway connecting Goma with the city of Beni. However, the airport appeared to be spared the same fate as 2002 when lava flowed onto the runways.Goma is a regional hub for many humanitarian agencies in the region, as well as the UN peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO. While Goma is home to many UN peacekeepers and aid workers, much of surrounding eastern Congo is under threat from a myriad of armed groups vying for control of the region’s mineral resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congo-nyiragongo-volcano-s-lava-flows-short-of-regional-capital-goma-101621768761625.html

Reports from other media said up to 15 members of the security forces had been killed.Mobye is around 100 km (60 miles) east of the capital Naypyidaw, but lies near territory held by some of the ethnic armed groups that have fought for greater autonomy for decades.An alliance of four ethnic groups opposing the coup battled early on Sunday with security forces in Muse, one of the main border crossings to China, Myanmar media said.Since the army took power, local People's Defence Forces have also sprung up to oppose the junta - often armed with shotguns and homemade weapons. The video from Mobye showed at least one fighter firing an assault rifle.While the junta is struggling with renewed conflict on several fronts, it also faces daily protests and strikes that have paralysed hospitals, schools and much private business.TEACHERS SUSPENDEDMore than 125,000 school teachers - nearly a third of the total - have been suspended for joining a civil disobedience movement to oppose the coup, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation said.At least 815 people have been killed by security forces since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.The junta disputes that figure. Its leader, Min Aung Hlaing, said in comments broadcast on Saturday that 300 people had been killed in addition to 47 police.Protesters also demand the release of nearly 4,300 people who have been arrested since the coup, including Suu Kyi, 75.Min Aung Hlaing said Suu Kyi was healthy and would soon appear in court. Her next hearing is on Monday on some of the many charges brought against her, which range from illegal possession of walkie-talkie radios to breaching a state secrets law.The army seized power claiming fraud in a general election won by Suu Kyi's party in November. Its accusations had been dismissed by the former electoral commission, dozens of whose officials are now locked up.In further comments from an interview released by Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television on Sunday, Min Aung Hlaing sought to reassure Chinese businesses after some factories were set ablaze recently in the commercial capital Yangon."Our citizens are not being anti-China but it's the politics that cause the hatred," he said.Some opponents of the coup have accused China of supporting the junta, which has been condemned by Western countries that have introduced limited sanctions. China has been milder in its approach and has said it seeks stability in its neighbour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prodemocracy-protesters-seize-police-post-kill-security-forces-in-myanmar-101621767466478.html

When the cold snap struck, the race, comprising 172 participants, was halted. Soon after, several runners were reported to have gone missing, and a rescue operation was launched.By Sunday noon, the remains of the 21 victims had been recovered at the site of the tragedy, the rescue headquarters was quoted as saying by the news agency Xinhua.The other 151 participants were all confirmed safe, of whom eight suffered minor injuries and were treated in hospital, the media report said.“According to the rescue headquarters, at about 1pm on Saturday, hail, freezing rain and gales hit the area of the race’s high-altitude stage, between 20-31km. Participants suffered from physical discomfort due to the sudden drop in air temperature,” the report said.Rescue work was challenging due to the harsh, mountainous terrain, a further drop in the night-time temperature and poor communications signals. More than 1,200 rescuers were deployed, assisted by thermal-imaging drones and radar detectors, according to state media.National broadcaster CCTV quoted rescuers as saying the low temperature was the biggest threat faced by participants as they wore thin clothes.One runner, Mao Shuzhi, told Reuters news agency that she turned back midway into the race when the weather abruptly changed.“The rain was getting heavier and heavier,” said Mao, who was about 24km into the race at the time and hadn’t yet reached the mountains.She decided to head back to her hotel, having had previous bad experiences with hypothermia, but others carried on or were already in the worst-hit areas.Baiyin’s mayor Zhang Xuchen said, “As the organiser of the event, we are full of guilt and remorse. We express deep condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-cold-snap-strikes-marathon-race-in-china-leaves-21-runners-dead-101621767723171.html
23-05-2021||World||Moderna CEO advocates booster Covid-19 vaccine jab to protect people at risk||Vaccination with a booster shot among as many people as possible is a good way to protect those most at risk against ever-emerging new coronavirus variants, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said on Sunday."We believe that our vaccine will be effective for a comparable period, except that the arrival of variants increases the threat level. This is why we must anticipate and vaccinate all people at risk with a third dose by the end of the summer, in particular the residents of nursing homes who received their first dose at the beginning of the year," Bancel told French newspaper Journal Du Dimanche.The CEO of the US drugmaker further suggested that in order to protect the "fragile unvaccinated people," all adults and adolescents must also receive a booster jab.Bancel warned that three or even two months of delay in vaccinations could lead to an increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths, which could, in turn, lead to a fourth Covid-19 wave in France.Moderna is now testing three different booster strategies, he said. The first is against the original Wuhan strain, the second is against the South Africa strain and the third is a combination of both. The effectiveness of these three boosters is later on measured on the four variants deemed to be the most dangerous by the World Health Organization.The company is planning to launch a study on people near early June and aims to get approval from regulatory agencies by September.Starting May 28, the Moderna vaccine will be joining AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson in French pharmacies and general practitioners offices. Around 300,000 doses of the vaccine will be available in pharmacies weekly. The arrival of Moderna in French pharmacies is expected to make the vaccine more accessible to isolated elderly people or overlooked workers and will help with a speedier vaccination progress in the country as the vaccine itself can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.So far, about 90 million people have been inoculated with Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine globally. Around 14 per cent of France's total population has been fully vaccinated and 31.5 million people have received at least one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-ceo-advocates-booster-covid-19-vaccine-jab-to-protect-people-at-risk-101621765585199.html

Speaking at BBC Breakfast, Adam Finn, member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, stressed that the ongoing pandemic is a global crisis and the government needs to “think globally and not just domestically.”“It may well be better for children in this country if vaccines are used to stop outbreaks like the massive outbreak in India which then get imported into this country and provide a threat to them and their schooling,” he said.The United Kingdom has administered at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine to more than 55 per cent of the country’s population and on Saturday, the National Health Service (NHS) opened bookings for people aged 32 and 33 to get their first Covid shot. The latest expansion of vaccination eligibility would cover about 1.1 million people, according to the NHS. Finn said that it remains unclear whether children will need vaccination.“I think we need to wait and see on that. It is not clear at this point whether we will actually need to vaccinate children in order to get that population immunity that we have to get,” he added.Also Read | Children can get and spread Covid infection': Centre clarifies 3 points amid 3rd wave concernsOn the other hand, the United States has already started inoculating 12- to 15-year-old children after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the age group. The decision, however, drew criticism since vaccine supply in lower- and lower-middle-income countries has not been enough to vaccinate even health care workers.“In January, I spoke about the potential unfolding of a moral catastrophe. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing this play out,” the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moving-covid-shots-to-india-could-benefit-uk-children-suggests-vaccine-advisor-101621764947448.html
23-05-2021||World||UK home secretary Priti Patel to unveil US-style digital visas to 'count' migrants||UK Home Secretary Priti Patel is set to unveil a new US-style digital visa regime at the country’s borders in order to measure immigration levels in and out of the country, according to UK media reports on Sunday.The senior Indian-origin Cabinet minister is to confirm the so-called "sweeping changes" to the UK's immigration policy to "streamline" the way in which people come into the country on Monday.The post-Brexit changes will include the border being managed digitally, which the government says will be easier to navigate for businesses and allow for the first time to accurately count people in and out of the UK.“Our new fully digital border will provide the ability to count people in and out of the country, giving us control over who comes to the UK,” Patel was quoted as saying in the ‘Observer’."Our new approach will make it easier to identify potential threats before they reach the border. The British people will have confidence that the strongest controls are in place to keep them safe," she said.The UK Home Office hopes to make entry to the UK fully digital by the end of 2025.It means people wanting to come into the UK without a visa or immigration status will have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), similar to the US system, with 30 million applications expected to be processed every year.As well as launching her latest immigration plans, Patel will also focus on failings in the asylum system and the need to crack down on people smugglers. Earlier in the week, she was filmed accompanying police as they arrested suspected ringleaders of a people smuggling gang that used minicab and lorry drivers to move migrants in and out of the UK.The British government has said that in the past 10 days, more than 140 foreign criminals have been removed from the UK, totalling more than 700 so far this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-to-unveil-digital-visas-to-count-migrants-101621763778042.html

Two public housing blocks will have all residents screened after several cases were found in each of them, the government said Sunday.Two shopping centers on the western part of the island will be closed for two weeks starting Sunday after 10 Covid-19 infections were recently linked to the properties, authorities said. Four were detected from testing operations that were offered to those who were at the mall earlier this month, according to a statement on Saturday.“Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who visited these malls,” the health ministry said. “To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, JEM and Westgate shopping malls will be closed to all members of the public.”Ong also addressed concerns that cases of vaccinated people getting infected means there’s little benefit in getting inoculated against Covid-19. In the current outbreak, 78 vaccinated individuals had been infected, many of whom are frontline workers, he said. That compares with 300 unvaccinated infections, Ong said.“International studies continue to show that vaccinations are very effective in preventing infections, and severe illnesses,” he said.Singapore preliminarily confirmed 22 new cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 infection as of 12 p.m. on Sunday, three of which are untraceable, according to a statement from the health ministry. There were three imported cases, according to the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-govt-to-conduct-more-tests-surveillance-to-curb-covid-19-outbreak-101621763377644.html

He was also the architect of Britain's campaign to leave the European Union.Johnson, who has imposed three lockdowns during the pandemic, has hailed Britain's vaccination programme as a success, but the United Kingdom has one of the highest COVID-19 death tolls and it has suffered a deep economic slump."If we'd had the right preparations competent people in charge, we wd probably have avoided lockdown1, *definitely* no need for lockdowns 2&3," Cummings wrote on Twitter on Saturday."Given the plan was AWOL/disaster awful decisions delayed everything, lockdown1 became necessary."The government has said there are lessons to be learned from the pandemic since facing accusations of being slow to impose lockdowns.Cummings is due to appear on Wednesday before a joint inquiry of the lower house of parliament's Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee.On herd immunity, where the virus spreads through the population to increase overall resistance, Cummings wrote on Twitter: "Our original plan was wrong & we changed when we realised."Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement that "herd immunity has never been a policy aim or part of our coronavirus strategy.""Our response has at all times been focused on saving lives and ensuring the NHS (National Health Service) was not overwhelmed. We continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disaster-uk-pm-johnson-s-ex-top-aide-recalls-early-covid-19-plan-101621761929944.html

23-05-2021||World||Opposition alliance to move court against dissolution of Nepal parliament||Nepal's President dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November, rejecting both embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a government, a "regressive" move that will be legally challenged yet again.President Bidya Devi Bhandari announced in an early morning statement that the House of Representatives has been dissolved in accordance with Article 76(7) of the Constitution, ending a day of high-voltage political drama in the Himalayan nation, amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic.As per the Article, a date to conduct another election within six months must also be fixed. The President has called early elections pursuant to the Article, the dates being set for November 12 and November 19.The announcement came after Prime Minister Oli in his last deal-sealing move on Friday midnight recommended the Office of the President to dissolve the 275-member House and announce dates for early elections.Earlier, Oli and Opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba had staked separate claims to premiership, both of which were rejected by the president, citing that none had adequate grounds for winning a vote of confidence."It has been noted that Prime Minister Oli counted those lawmakers as his supporters who extended support to the Opposition alliance, whereas the UML and JSP-N have forwarded letters stating action would be taken against those who had gone against the party to endorse the Opposition's claim," Bhandari said in a statement late on Friday.According to the statement from the President's Office, 26 lawmakers of the CPN-UML and 12 lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi Party had supported both Oli and Deuba.The president’s announcement plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli’s recommendation, a move that swayed the course of Nepali politics towards uncertainty.The Supreme Court had annulled the duo's move in February.Alarmed by the duo's move yet again, the leaders of Nepal's Opposition alliance on Saturday decided to take all legal and political means to counter Prime Minister Oli and President Bhandari's "unconstitutional and undemocratic" move of dissolving the House.In a joint statement issued at the end of a meeting called to discuss their future strategy, the Opposition leaders termed the President’s move unconstitutional, undemocratic, autocratic and regressive.The President did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new prime minister on the basis of the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers, the joint press statement said. by the parties after a meeting on Saturday to chart out their future strategy.“Instead she sided with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved Parliament in an attack on the constitution and democracy. This regressive move has pushed the country towards new political polarisation and complexity."The statement was signed by Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-Maoist Centre Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, Chairperson of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal Upendra Yadav and Vice-Chair of the Rastriya Janamorcha Durga Paudel.The Opposition alliance is devising a strategy to approach the Supreme Court with all its lawmakers on Sunday demanding to scrap the president's decision.The parties blamed the president for making an assault on the Constitution and democracy in partnership with the prime minister, who had lost a trust vote in the House.The parties claimed that the government is hell-bent on its attempt to prolong the autocratic rule despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.The Nepali Congress also accused President Bhandari and Prime Minister Oli of misusing the Constitution for their own benefit as their personal property."Prime Minister Oli recommending forming a new government, President Bhandari announcing to stake a claim to form new government giving less than 24 hours, not appointing prime minister as per the provision of the Constitution and dissolving HoR and holding a Cabinet meeting in the middle of the night are unconstitutional and anti-democratic," the party said in a statement."NC strongly objects to these kinds of activities,” it said. Deuba, urging all the democratic forces to unite and act together for the protection of the Constitution and democracy, vowed to take political and legal action against the House dissolution.Speaker of the House of Representatives Agni Prasad Sapkota also said President Bhandari's decision to dissolve the House is against the spirit of the Constitution of Nepal."The unprecedented move is against the political struggle and verdict of the apex court which had annulled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli's earlier move of dismantling the parliament on December 20, 2020," Sapkota said in a statement.Nepal’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president.Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment pursuant to Article 76(5) of the Constitution.Nepali Congress President Deuba claimed to have garnered the support of 149 lawmakers. However, a dispute emerged after a few lawmakers from the Madhav Nepal faction put out statements claiming that their signatures were misused and that they did not sign any paper to install Opposition leader Deuba as the prime minister against their own party chief.Earlier on Thursday, the president's office stated that the government had forwarded a request to invoke Article 76 (5) as Prime Minister Oli, it has been learnt, is in no mood to undergo another parliamentary floor test as there is no prospect of an otherwise result given the complex internal dynamics within parties represented in the federal parliament.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'. In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-alliance-to-move-court-against-dissolution-of-nepal-parliament-101621761008617.html

The government's Dubai Media Office did not acknowledge the release of the images.The photos' pedestrian captions belie the fact that United Nations experts and human rights activists had called on Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to provide information on his daughter.Sheikha Latifa, 35, had tried to flee the country in 2018 only to be detained by commandos in a boat off India.Videos released in February by the BBC had Sheikha Latifa describing herself as being in a villa that “has been converted into a jail.”“I don’t know when I’ll be released and what the conditions will be like when I’m released,” she says in one of the videos. “Every day I am worried about my safety and my life.”The dramatic would-be sea escape and its aftermath intruded into the carefully controlled image maintained by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, who is believed to have several dozen children from multiple wives. Some of his sons and daughters figure prominently in local media and online, but others are rarely seen. Sheikha Latifa was widely known for her love of skydiving prior to 2018.Sheikh Mohammed’s family life again became a public matter in 2020. Then, a British judge ruled the sheikh had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, one of them Sheikha Latifa. The ruling came in a custody battle between Sheikh Mohammed and his estranged wife Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan.Sheikh Mohammed also serves as the vice president and prime minister of the hereditarily ruled United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-show-dubai-princess-latifa-focus-of-un-concern-at-malls-101621760650824.html
23-05-2021||World||Bangladesh appeals to world community for Covid-19 vaccine doses||Bangladesh has mounted a diplomatic campaign as part of its desperate efforts to get the coronavirus vaccine amid fears that the B1.617.2 variant of COVID-19 that first emerged in India could rapidly spread in the neighbouring country.Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen has described the vaccine situation in the country a "crisis" and said that Bangladesh is "desperate" to get the vaccines from the US, China, Canada, Russia and the UK apart from India.On Saturday, he made the appeal on British TV channel ITV News, a day after he appeared on the CNN network with an identical appeal.Momen said Bangladesh tried to close its porous borders with India but could not prevent the influx of people and around 3,350 Bangladeshis returned from India through Benapole land port alone from April 26 till date.They feared many more could have carried the virus through the borders beyond detection though the detection rate still remained low."You know that Bangladesh and India have a very good relationship -- we tried to close the border so that people from India don't come, but a lot of people came and many Bangladeshis went there and they're coming back," Momen told the CNN.He told newsmen in Dhaka that Bangladesh has so far officially sought vaccines from the US, the UK alongside China, Russia and of late Canada.Health officials said Bangladesh currently has a stock of one million doses of AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine and Chinese Sinopharm jabs and is expecting 100,000 Pfizer shots but they feared all would be exhausted within few days. After its request to the US, Bangladesh has urged the UK to provide 1.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to meet its emergency needs."I'm not asking for too much, I'm only asking for 1.6 million AstraZeneca doses that they have . . . (UK) they should immediately disburse those to Bangladesh so that people can have their second dose," Momen told the ITV News.Bangladesh earlier entered into a deal with India's Serum Institute (SII) to procure 30 million doses of vaccines. But it received seven million doses in two consignments until February while the third consignment, which was expected in March, is yet to reach the country. India had provided 3.2 million doses as gifts to Bangladesh."India is facing a very critical situation, very alarming… They're finding it difficult, we can understand it," Momen told the British TV channel.In his interview with CNN, Momen said the big problem is that a large number of people in Bangladesh who took the first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca could not take the second dose and so "we need it desperately".Bangladesh also contacted China and Russia to get their vaccines while Beijing said it was set to provide six lakh more COVID-19 vaccine doses as second batch of gift nine days after sending first batch of five lakh doses as the donation.Dhaka earlier this week signed a non-disclosure agreement with China on purchasing Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine and co-produce the vaccines in Bangladesh, a month after reaching a nearly identical deal with Russia for the production of Sputnik V vaccine.The coronavirus has so far claimed 12,348 lives in Bangladesh with 38 deaths in the past 24 hours while the tally of infections surged to 7,87,726, with health officials reporting 1,028 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-appeals-to-world-community-for-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101621760060352.html

"We are working to further expand production capacity with a growing network of partners."The Nasdaq-listed firm, which is backed by investor Dietmar Hopp, GlaxoSmithKline as well as the German government, has said it aims to produce up to 300 million doses of the vaccine in 2021 and up to 1 billion in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-curevac-working-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-production-capacity-101621759762879.html
23-05-2021||World||China invading Bhutan in a gradually, stealthily: Report||China has been gradually and stealthily invading its tiny neighbour Bhutan for years now, reveals new research findings.A paper published by journal Foreign Policy stated that China has built an entire town, replete with roads, a power plant, two CPC buildings, a communications base, military and police outposts and a warehouse, almost 8 kilometres into Bhutan, reported the Australian news, site news.com.au.In early April, the Chinese welcomed a delegation of international visitors to the city of Kunming in Yunnan province, which discussed China's mountainous southern border, which lies uninhabited and sports wild terrain.With a population of just 800,000 compared to China's 1.4 billion, "there is little Bhutan can do" but watch as Beijing takes large gulps of its territory, the research paper states."This involves a strategy that is more provocative than anything China has done on its land borders in the past," wrote Robert Barnett in Foreign Policy earlier this month.The largely Buddhist Bhutanese have much in common with the people of Tibet which now lies within China. But diplomatically and economically, the government in Thimphu has closer links to India and Beijing doesn't even have an embassy in Bhutan.That Bhutan and China can't agree where their 470 km common border lies is nothing new. By some accounts Beijing claims 12 per cent of the territory governed by Thimphu. The recent meeting in Kunming was the 25th the two nations have held concerning the frontier.China has long built roads into these disputed territories. But building a whole town within the internationally recognised territory of another nation, even if that territory is disputed, is striking, reported news.com.au.Called Gyalaphug, or Jieluobu in Chinese, an administration block at its centre features a hammer and sickle. A nearby banner proclaims "Resolutely uphold the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping!"It's estimated several hundred people, and even more yaks, could now live in Gyalaphug. That number is boosted by a rotation of construction workers, party cadres, police and soldiers."There is little that Bhutan can do," said Barnett, given China would know it's clearly violating a 1998 agreement to leave the disputed areas be, reported news.com.au.To the frustration of Bhutan, China's territorial claims keep growing. Gyalaphug, for instance, is well within Bhutan according to some official Chinese maps from the 1980s.Also, Bhutan is adamant that the dispute in the country's east, where Beijing now claims land in the Sakteng wildlife reserve, is a new one. It's never been raised by China before. Sakteng does not even border China, reported news.com.au.It does, however, border the India' north eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing also claims as its own. Observers say that's another sign it's not really about Bhutan at all. China's real target appears to be India.Stealthily but steadily, Beijing is reportedly building whole towns across internationally recognised borders in a new and dangerous global power play.What Beijing has already done in the South China Sea - building outposts and claiming dubious sovereignty - is now also being done in the Himalayas, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-invading-bhutan-in-a-gradually-stealthily-report-101621759471821.html

23-05-2021||World||Greta Thunberg aims to change how food is produced||Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has set her sights on changing how the world produces and consumes food in order to counteract a trio of threats: carbon emissions, disease outbreaks and animal suffering.In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Thunberg said the environmental impact of farming as well as disease outbreaks such as Covid-19, which is believed to have originated from animals, would be reduced by changing how food was produced."Our relationship with nature is broken. But relationships can change," Thunberg said in the video marking the International Day of Biological Diversity.Also Read | ‘Heartbreaking’: Greta Thunberg urges global help for India amid Covid-19 crisisA focus on agriculture and linking the climate crisis to health pandemics is a new angle for Thunberg who has typically focused her ire on policy-makers and carbon emissions from fossil fuels."The climate crisis, ecological crisis and health crisis, they are all interlinked," she said.Thunberg said the spillover of diseases from animals to humans was caused by farming methods, adding that a move to a plant-based diet could save up to 8 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, while scientists say 60% of the infectious human diseases that emerged from 1990 to 2004 came from animals.Meanwhile, demand for alternatives to regular meat is surging worldwide due to concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.More than two dozen firms are testing lab-grown fish, beef and chicken, hoping to break into an unproven segment of the alternative meat market, which Barclays estimates could be worth $140 billion by 2029.The Global Center on Adaptation, which works to accelerate climate resilience, said in January climate change could depress global food production by up to 30%, while rising seas and more intense storms could force hundreds of millions of people in coastal cities out of their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-aims-to-change-how-food-is-produced-101621753234773.html
23-05-2021||World||First ever chair of Tamil studies to be established at a Canadian university||The Canadian city of Toronto will be the venue for the first ever chair in Tamil studies to be established at a university in the country.The project, launched by University of Toronto along with Canada-based Tamil groups in 2018, is now a reality with sufficient funds having been raised to endow the position that will be located at the university’s Scarborough campus. Canada has the largest Tamil population outside the Indian subcontinent, numbering over 300,000 and with roots in India, Sri Lanka, and other nations such as Singapore and Malaysia. The chair will foster scholarship and research into the language and as well as its cultural aspects.The groups that participated in the initiative included Canadian Tamil Congress and Tamil Chair Inc, and among its supporters was the government of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A total of $3 million has been raised for the endowment to begin the process of formalising the programme.Wisdom J Tettey, principal of University of Toronto’s Scarborough campus (UTSC) told HT that the university will now embark on a global search to appoint the chair. He said they will seek an “outstanding reputation and who can undertake research and connect with the community in ways that ensure co-learning and reciprocal interaction”.Among those who welcomed the move was accountant Sivan Ilangko, also president of Canadian Tamil Congress. “The worldwide Tamil community is interested in both ancient and modern Tamil literature. There are also expectations that the Tamil chair will include interdisciplinary studies, cultural studies, classics, sociology, political science, anthropology, geography, linguistics, literature and fine arts. We expect there will be teaching and research in these areas,” he said.Ilangko pointed out that Tamil is among the oldest surviving classical languages with a tradition that is more than 2,000 years old. It is also a modern language spoken by over 80 million people in numerous countries.UTSC principal Tettey felt that institutionalising Tamil studies will attract those even beyond the Tamil community. “Tamil studies have different components - from language studies, to history and culture. As an institution with a global remit and perspective, the interest will be from a wide range of people around the world with different motivations,” said Tettey.“The chair’s work in the context of Toronto, which has a huge community of Tamil origin with global connections, will support our vision of inspiring inclusive academic excellence and enriching our multicultural society by studying, promoting, and sustaining Tamil culture and heritage around the world,” the UTSC principal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-ever-chair-of-tamil-studies-to-be-established-at-a-canadian-university-101621748826445.html

He said the gallery is “extremely sorry” to lose Hall but that "we entirely understand and respect his decision.”The 126-page report by retired Judge John Dyson, published Thursday, found the internal BBC investigation had covered up “deceitful behavior” by Bashir, who was little-known as a journalist when he interviewed Diana.The BBC also has faced questions about why Bashir was rehired in 2016 as the broadcaster's religious affairs correspondent.Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, have excoriated the BBC since the report’s publication, saying there was a direct link between the 1995 interview and their mother’s death in a traffic accident two years later as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi.The BBC commissioned the report after Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, complained that Bashir used false documents and other dishonest tactics to persuade Diana to grant the interview.In the interview, Diana said her marriage to Prince Charles had failed because he was still in love with former lover Camilla Parker Bowles, whom Charles would go on to marry a decade later.Also Read: Princes William, Harry hit out at BBC for ‘deceit’ in obtaining Diana interviewDiana, then 34, said she was devastated when she found out in 1986 — five years after her marriage — that Charles had renewed his relationship with Camilla. Diana said she was so depressed that she deliberately hurt herself in a desperate bid for help.“There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,″ Diana famously remarked.The fallout from the report has raised serious doubts about the BBC’s integrity, while the British government has said it would review the rules governing the oversight of the editorially independent national broadcaster.The BBC, which was founded in 1922, is funded by a license fee payable by everyone. The rules governing its operations are set out in a royal charter that requires the corporation to be impartial, act in the public interest and be open, transparent and accountable. A mid-term review of the BBC’s governance is scheduled to begin next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exbbc-head-quits-gallery-job-amid-diana-interview-fallout-101621740934032.html
23-05-2021||World||'Never wanted to harm Diana': Journalist at centre of controversial interview denies link to her death||A former BBC journalist found to have deceived Princess Diana in order to secure an explosive interview with her in 1995 has denied he was responsible for a chain of events that led to her death, a newspaper reported.Martin Bashir told The Sunday Times he believed his actions did not harm Diana.An independent investigation published on Thursday found that Bashir lied and deceived Diana that she was being spied upon to persuade her to agree to the interview in which she disclosed details of her failed marriage to Prince Charles."I never wanted to harm Diana in any way and I don’t believe we did," Bashir told The Sunday Times.Diana's eldest son William has said the way the interview was secured was "deceitful" and the BBC's failures contributed significantly to Diana's "fear, paranoia and isolation."His younger brother Prince Harry and Diana's brother Charles Spencer have said the interview was part of a series of unethical practices that ultimately cost Diana her life in a car crash in Paris in 1997."I don’t feel I can be held responsible for many of the other things that were going on in her life, and the complex issues surrounding those decisions," Bashir told The Sunday Times in an interview."I can understand the motivation... but to channel the tragedy, the difficult relationship between the royal family and the media purely on to my shoulders feels a little unreasonable ... The suggestion I am singularly responsible I think is unreasonable and unfair."The Sunday Times quoted Bashir as admitting that he used forged bank statements which the inquiry said was part of the deception of Diana . "Obviously I regret it, it was wrong,” he told the newspaper. “But it had no bearing on anything. It had no bearing on (Diana), it had no bearing on the interview.”Britain's government said on Friday it would examine how the BBC was run after the inquiry criticised the broadcaster for its "woefully ineffective" investigation into Bashir's actions.London's police force has said officers will assess the contents of the report to see if there was any significant new evidence, having previously ruled out a criminal investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/never-wanted-to-harm-diana-journalist-at-centre-of-controversial-interview-denies-link-to-her-death-101621741524113.html

He made the statement during an interview with Hong Kong's Phoenix Television on Thursday, only excerpts of which have been published till now."Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is in good health. She is at her home and healthy. She is going to face trial at the court in a few days," Min Aung Hlaing said, reiterating unverified claims of voter fraud in Myanmar's election in November 2020, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won. This alleged voter fraud, which has been rejected by the election commission, is the military's justification for the coup.Also Read: Suu Kyi ordered to show up in court on May 24On being asked what he felt about Aung San Suu Kyi's performance as a leader, the military head said, "She tried all she could." Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, is widely popular in her country for striving to bring about democratic reforms non-violently.The deposed leader has been under house arrest and has made no physical public appearances since the military took control of the country on February 1 this year.In the days following the coup, which resulted in widespread protests and a turmoil as military clashed with civilians, over 4,000 people were detained and more than 800 killed. On Sunday, more than 125,000 school teachers in the country were suspended by the military for joining a civil disobedience movement to oppose the coup, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation said, according to Reuters.Suu Kyi's next virtual court appearance, for which she will appear by video link, is due on Monday. She has been charged with flouting coronavirus restrictions during 2020's election campaign and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies and is yet to be allowed to speak directly to her lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-junta-leader-says-aung-san-suu-kyi-in-good-health-101621741492294.html
23-05-2021||World||Tiny Lithuania stands up to China as Europe freezes investment pact with Beijing||Lithuania, a tiny nation of less than 2.8 million people, said on Saturday it was quitting the China-led "17+1" grouping with central and eastern European states and asked other countries to walk out of the forum set up by China in 2012 to forge ties and expand its influence."Lithuania no longer considers itself a 17+1 format member and does not participate in this initiative," foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told news agency AFP on Saturday. He also described the platform as "divisive" from the European Union’s perspective, urged EU members to pursue "a much more effective 27+1 approach and communication with China and stressed that "Europe's strength and impact is in its unity".The announcement had been in the works for some time. Lithuania, like some other countries in the region, has been increasingly suspicious of China for some time. It was in 2019 that the Baltic state first identified Chinese espionage as a threat to its national security."As Chinese economic and political ambitions grow in Lithuania and other NATO and EU countries, activities of the Chinese intelligence and security services become increasingly aggressive," the State Security Department and the Second Investigation Department under the Defense Ministry said in their National Threat Assessment 2019 report, according to The Baltic Times.Its latest threat assessment report released in February this year was equally scathing, accusing Beijing of trying to exploit the Covid pandemic to discredit perceived adversaries and improve its image. A few weeks before releasing its security assessment, Vilnius had already signalled her country’s disappointment when Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė deputed her transport minister to sit in front of the camera for the China-CEEC Summit held via video link. President Xi Jinping, for the first time, addressed the summit.To be sure, Lithuania isn’t the only one within the “17+1” grouping to have tempered its expectations from the grouping that was once expected to lead to a rush of Chinese investment and infrastructure. Five other countries, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Slovenia, also indicated their diminished interest in the grouping and were represented by ministers at Xi Jinping’s high-profile February summit.China watchers in Delhi say Lithuania’s moves - it has announced its decision to open a trade office in Taiwan, spoken out against human rights violations by Beijing and blocked Chinese X-ray inspection equipment at airports - is an indicator of the deteriorating relationship between China and European Union.The EU-China investment pact, sealed in December 2020 after being negotiated for nearly seven years, was the latest casualty when European Parliament on Thursday halted ratification of the agreement which was then seen as a geopolitical win for China. It was proof of Europe’s independence from the US and Beijing’s ability to collaborate with US’ allies who adopted a moderate approach.On Thursday, the European Parliament refused to consider the investment deal as long as its “baseless and arbitrary” penalties were in place.According to the resolution, the parliament, which must ratify the investment deal, "demands that China lift the sanctions before Parliament can deal with the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment".In a vote passed with 599 votes in favour, 30 against and 58 abstentions, the lawmakers also warned that lifting the sanctions would not in itself ensure the deal's ratification. The legislators said they will take into account the human rights situation in China when deciding to greenlight the multi-billion deal.The decision to freeze the investment pact had been expected by some analysts after China retaliated against the US, UK and EU over sanctions related to allegations of human rights abuses in the western region of Xinjiang by announcing measures against 10 European politicians, scholars and research groups.China has been criticised for its treatment of Muslim Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. A panel of UN experts in 2019 said an estimated 1 million people have been sent to counter-terrorism internment facilities in the region, part of a set of policies the U.S. has said amount to genocide.Angela Merkel’s Germany was one of the few voices that continue to speak in favour of the EU-China pact. According to AFP, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said China "is the European Union's largest trading partner and the United States' largest trading partner, and thus plays an important role in the global economy," Altmaier said, adding: “We want to reach results with China that are in the interest of both sides".Chancellor Merkel, who has adopted a China-friendly course, is due to step down in September this year. Annalena Baerbock, the chancellor candidate for Germany’s Greens, has condemned human rights violations in China and said that, as chancellor, she would block imports of Chinese goods produced with forced labour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiny-lithuania-stands-up-to-china-as-europe-freezes-investment-pact-with-beijing-101621718303245.html

I didn't do like a welcome home when we got out of the hospital unfortunately because of the pandemic," she told AFP."And so this is my first celebration for her and I really wanted to do it with my family and friends and you know, I know she might not remember it but I want her to know that this did happen," she said.While her guests seemed delighted to be together, many pointed out that they did not want to invite people to their homes yet -- except for very close friends who they would be sure have been vaccinated."I don't know if we'll ever go back to complete comfort with that... not in the immediate future," said Merry Mathes, 58.Farther into the park, Marcus, a 25-year-old vaccinated paralegal, was partying alongside a dozen friends, with a synth and a hired DJ.He has only been to two parties since March 2020, both of them outdoors: one, which was limited to 10 people, was for his best friend's wedding, and the other was in Central Park in early May."I am not ready for parties inside, but maybe in the fall," he said.What if it came back? "Business is picking up, it started last week," said Lemuel Rodrigues, a party store manager in Manhattan."Most people are having it at home, or in parks, with other family members that they know," he said.Even though his business is still idling, he praised the continued caution of his customers: Despite 60 percent of the city's adult population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, many New Yorkers continue to wear masks on the streets, even though that regulation was lifted at the end of April.Also Read: US is investigating heart problem in few young vaccine recipients"A lot of people just want to go back to normal real fast. And we are more reluctant here.

"It was the first event I have been to where I didn't know the majority of the people," he said.The gathering was so close to the old "normal" that "a week later we still talked about it, and how different it felt to be at a normal party."Bars and restaurants have been allowed to open at full capacity since Wednesday.But when will the big gala evenings that make New York a hot spot for the jet set be back?According to Marcy Blum, who organizes parties and weddings for a wealthy clientele, even if the large reception venues do not reopen before September, her books are already full until April 2022.The phone started ringing a month ago, "when it was clear we were all going to have access to vaccines," she said."Everything comes out of the woodwork at once," she added, noting that people who had postponed their weddings are now scheduling them, but "people are still cautious... everybody still wants an outdoor venue or a tented venue."The Met Gala, one of the most popular social events in the world, is likely to symbolize this recovery: Traditionally held in May and canceled in 2020, it is scheduled to take place on September 13, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-yorkers-ready-to-party-again-just-not-indoors-101621735303885.html

Mountaineering was closed last year due to the pandemic.Nepalese officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday. Other climbing teams have not announced any Covid-19 infections among their members or staff. Several climbers have reported testing positive after they were brought down from the Everest base camp.Furtenbach said most teams on the mountain were not carrying virus testing kits, and that before his team pulled out, they had helped conduct tests and had confirmed two cases.Most teams are still at base camp, hoping for clear weather next week so they can make a final push to the summit before the climbing season closes at the end of the month, Furtenbach said.In late April, a Norwegian climber became the first to test positive at the Everest base camp. He was flown by helicopter to Kathmandu, where he was treated and later returned home.Nepal is experiencing a virus surge, with record numbers of new infections and deaths. China last week canceled climbing from its side of Mount Everest due to fears the virus could be spread from the Nepalese side.Nepal reported 8,607 new infections and 177 deaths on Friday, bringing the nation’s totals since the pandemic began to more than 497,000 infections and 6,024 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-covid-19-cases-on-everest-despite-nepal-s-denial-says-expert-guide-101621734589258.html
23-05-2021||World||More than 125,000 teachers in Myanmar suspended for opposing coup||More than 125,000 school teachers in Myanmar have been suspended by the military authorities for joining a civil disobedience movement to oppose the military coup in February, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation said.The suspensions have come days before the start of a new school year, which some teachers and parents are boycotting as part of the campaign that has paralysed the country since the coup cut short a decade of democratic reforms.A total of 125,900 school teachers had been suspended as of Saturday, said the official of the teachers' federation, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals. He is already on the junta's wanted list on charges of inciting disaffection.Myanmar had 430,000 school teachers according to the most recent data, from two years ago."These are just statements to threaten people to come back to work. If they actually fire this many people, the whole system will stop," said the official, who is also a teacher. He said he had been told that the charges he faces would be dropped if he returns.Reuters was unable to reach a junta spokesman or the education ministry for comment. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper has called on teachers and students to return to schools to get the education system started again.The disruption at schools echoes that in the health sector and across government and private business since the Southeast Asian country was plunged into chaos by the coup and the arrest of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Around 19,500 university staff have also been suspended, according to the teachers' group.Parents keep children homeRegistrations begin next week for the school term that starts in June, but some parents said they also plan to keep their children out of school."I am not going to enrol my daughter because I don't want to give her education from military dictatorship. I also worry about her safety," said 42-year-old Myint, whose daughter is 14.Students, who have been at the forefront of daily protests at which hundreds of people have been killed by security forces, also said they planned to boycott classes."I will only go back to school if we get back democracy," said Lwin, 18.Myanmar's education system was already one of the poorest in the region - and ranked 92 of 93 countries in a global survey last year.Even under the leadership of Suu Kyi, who had championed education, spending was below 2% of gross domestic product. That was one of the lowest rates in the world, according to World Bank figures.A National Unity Government, set up underground by opponents of the junta, said it would do all it could to support the teachers and students itself - calling on foreign donors to stop funding the junta-controlled education ministry."We will work with Myanmar's educators who are refusing to support the cruel military," Sasa, who goes by one name and is a spokesman for the national unity government, said in an email to Reuters. "These great teachers and brave teachers will never be left behind."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-125-000-teachers-in-myanmar-suspended-for-opposing-coup-101621730438756.html

23-05-2021||World||New Covid-19 cases in US plummet to lowest levels since last June||New coronavirus cases across the United States have tumbled to rates not seen in more than 11 months, sparking optimism that vaccination campaigns are stemming both severe Covid-19 cases and the spread of the virus.As cases, hospitalizations and deaths steadily dropped this week, pre-pandemic life in America has largely resumed. Hugs and unmasked crowds returned to the White House, a Mardi Gras-style parade marched through Alabama's port city of Mobile, and even states that have stuck to pandemic-related restrictions readied to drop them. However, health experts also cautioned that not enough Americans have been vaccinated to completely extinguish the virus, leaving the potential for new variants that could extend the pandemic.As the seven-day average for new cases dropped below 30,000 per day this week, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out cases have not been this low since June 18, 2020. The average number of deaths over the last seven days also dropped to 552 — a rate not seen since July last year. It's a dramatic drop since the pandemic hit a devastating crescendo in January.“As each week passes and as we continue to see progress, these data give me hope,” Walensky said Friday at a news conference.Health experts credit an efficient rollout of vaccines for the turnaround. More than 60% of people over 18 have received at least one shot, and almost half are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. But demand for vaccines has dropped across much of the country. President Joe Biden's administration is trying to convince other Americans to sign up for shots, using an upbeat message that vaccines offer a return to normal life.White House health officials on Friday even waded into offering dating advice. They are teaming up with dating apps to offer a new reason to “swipe right” by featuring vaccination badges on profiles and in-app bonuses for people who have gotten their shots.Ohio, New York, Oregon and other states are enticing people to get vaccinated through lottery prizes of up to $5 million.Across the country, venues and events reopened after shuttering for much of the last year.On Saturday, Karen Stetz readied to welcome what she hoped would be a good crowd to the Grosse Pointe Art Fair on Michigan’s Lake St. Clair.With natural ventilation from the lake and mask and capacity restrictions easing, Stetz was optimistic that artists who make their living traveling a show circuit that ground to a halt last year would begin to bounce back. The event usually draws from 5,000 to 10,000 people.“I feel like most people are ready to get out,” Stetz said by phone shortly before opening the fair. “It seems like people are eager, but it’s hard to know still. I’m sure there’s a percentage of people that are going to wait until they’re comfortable.”In Mobile, thousands of joyful revelers, many without masks, competed for plastic beads and trinkets tossed from floats Friday night as Alabama’s port city threw a Mardi Gras-style parade. But only about a quarter of the county's population is fully vaccinated. Many went without masks, though health officials had urged personal responsibility.Alabama's vaccination rate — 34% of people have received at least one dose — is one of the lowest in the country. It's part of a swath of Southern states where vaccine uptake has been slow. Health experts worry that areas with low vaccination rates could give rise to new virus variants that are more resistant to vaccinations.“My biggest concern is new strains of the virus and the need to remain vigilant in the months ahead,” said Boston College public health expert Dr. Philip J. Landrigan.A medical center in Louisiana reported Friday it has identified the state’s first two cases of a Covid-19 variant that has spread widely since being identified in India. The Covid-19 variant has been classified as a “variant of concern” by Britain and the World Health Organization, meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people, causes more severe disease, or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines. The variant has also been reported in several other states, including Tennessee, Nebraska and Nevada.Though Landrigan said the big drop in cases nationwide was “the best news we've had on the pandemic” and showed that vaccines are working, he warned that people should remain vigilant for local flare-ups of new cases.Many states have largely dropped orders to wear masks and stay distanced from other people. Meanwhile, even places such as California — the first state to issue a statewide shutdown as the virus emerged in March 2020 — prepared to remove restrictions on social distancing and business capacity next month.State health director Dr. Mark Ghaly said Friday the decision was based on dramatically lower virus cases and increased vaccinations.But in Vermont — the state with the highest percentage of people who have received one shot — Gov. Phil Scott has tied the lifting of restrictions to the vaccination rate. He offered to lift all remaining restrictions before a July 4 deadline if 80% of those eligible get vaccinated.Landrigan figured it will take a nationwide vaccination rate of at least 85% to snuff out the virus. But for now, the steep drop in cases gave him hope that pandemic-level infection rates will soon be a thing of the past.“It is getting to the point to where by the Fourth of July we might be able to declare this thing over," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-in-us-plummet-to-lowest-levels-since-last-june-101621727716954.html

We have many officers on the fence about whether to stay with this department," Papathanasiou was cited as saying by the Politico.On Thursday, the US lawmakers passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill aimed to enhance the security of the Capitol. It provides for overtime pay, hazard pay and retention bonuses, in addition to more equipment and better training for the police officers. However, this measure may not be enough to solve the issue amid the surge in violence, the union chair was quoted as saying by the Politico.In early April, an unknown person approached the territory of the Capitol by car, shot down two police officers and then crashed into a fence. After that, he got out of the car and, allegedly, rushed at the police brandishing a knife. In response, the officers opened fire. The attacker and one of the wounded police officers died in the hospital.On January 6, a crowd of supporters of then President Donald Trump ransacked the US Capitol and disrupted the work of Congress counting electoral votes to formalize Joe Biden's victory. More than 140 people were reportedly injured in the storming, five people died of various causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-70-police-officers-have-quit-since-storming-of-us-capitol-in-january-101621723701073.html
