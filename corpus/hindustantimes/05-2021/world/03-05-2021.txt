The subway move will provide an essential service to restaurant and hospital staff and others who commute outside the traditional workday. It will also help transport more people as the MTA anticipates ridership will increase alongside an uptick in business activity and cultural events.“Workers are going to need to get back and forth,” Cuomo said. “Now you’ll have people working until 4 o’clock in the morning again.”New York, the most visited city in the U.S., was the early center of the nation’s Covid-19 outbreak. Cuomo shut down the city as the virus spread, and its restaurants, bars, stores and theaters have struggled to stay in business under capacity restrictions and curfews. The subways are the lifeblood of the city, providing more than 5 million rides a day in pre-pandemic times.Cleaning TimeIn May 2020, Cuomo ordered the state’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the largest mass-transit network in the U.S., to stop its subways for four overnight hours every day to clean and disinfect trains and stations. It cut that time to two hours in February.Elected officials and transportation advocacy groups had urged the MTA in recent days to return to the normal subway schedule.The pandemic decimated MTA’s ridership. Subway usage is still down 65% from pre-outbreak levels as people work from home. The agency will receive a combined $14.5 billion of federal aid to cover lost revenue.Even with the overnight subway shutdowns, there has been an increase in crime on the system. The MTA plans to install cameras at every station and platform, and will add a record number this year. While the city has sent more police officers to monitor the subway system, the MTA has asked for additional officers. Riders and MTA workers have experienced more harassment.According to a recent MTA survey, 72% of active customers are very concerned with crime and harassment on the system, surpassing worries about health and safety. And 36% who stopped riding on the public-transit system said they did so because of such concerns.“The city has to add more mental-health services, homeless outreach, and uniformed police officers to the system,” Transport Workers Union Local 100 President Tony Utano said in a statement following Cuomo’s announcement. “Too many transit workers and riders are being harassed and assaulted right now with the current hours of operation.”Repopulation DriveAbout 80,000 New York City workers returned to their offices Monday, and de Blasio said he hopes the private sector follows suit.The city Sunday posted a seven-day daily average of 1,370 confirmed and probable cases, down from a 28-day daily average of 2,361. Hospitalizations and deaths have also decreased, while nearly a third of city residents are fully vaccinated, data show.Across New York state, the positive-test rate has dropped by 50% in the past month, Cuomo said.In addition to ending the capacity limits, Cuomo said the outdoor food and beverage curfew will be lifted May 17, and the indoor curfew will be lifted May 31. The outdoor large stadium capacity will go to 33% in New York state on May 19.The state will keep the six-foot social distancing requirement for gatherings, pursuant to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, Cuomo said. Events that can show proof that attendees have been fully vaccinated or have recent negative test results don’t have to follow that requirement, Cuomo said.Just as New York coordinated its shutdown with its neighbors, it is doing the same for its reopening, Cuomo said. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has scheduled a “major announcement on easing restrictions” for Monday afternoon, according to a Twitter post.“If you’re not coordinated, you’ll drive people from New Jersey to come to New York, or Connecticut to New York,” Cuomo said. “The coordination is important because you’re a mobile population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-to-end-capacity-restrictions-all-day-subway-services-return-101620060955293.html
03-05-2021||World||Biden promotes $4 trillion plans in visit to Virginia schools||President Joe Biden traveled to coastal Virginia on Monday to promote how his proposals to spend $4 trillion for infrastructure and families will help the U.S. education system.Biden, joined by his wife, Jill Biden, a community college professor, bantered with a class of 5th-grade students at an elementary school in Yorktown. The students had shields in front of their desks as a guard against the virus.The president asked them what they wanted to do when they grow up and was given an array of examples, including a fashion designer, a chef and a hairstylist."You're very impressive," Biden told them.Later, he was to deliver remarks at Tidewater Community College in Norfolk, Virginia.The travel is part of Biden's "Getting America Back on Track" tour to promote his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and his $1.8 trillion "American Families Plan."Biden’s plan includes $1 trillion in spending on education and childcare over 10 years and $800 billion in tax credits aimed at middle- and low-income families.It also includes $200 billion for free, universal preschool and $109 billion for free community college regardless of income for two years, the White House said.Biden will travel to Lake Charles and New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris heads to Milwaukee on Tuesday.Biden has vowed to work with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a search for a bipartisan agreement. However, whether he will be able to persuade the opposition party to join in a plan that will raise taxes on the wealthy is far from clear.He is to meet with top Democratic and Republican lawmakers at the White House on May 12 to try to find common ground.Congress is polarized and Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.Biden had promised throughout the 2020 presidential campaign to work with Republicans, but his major legislative achievement, a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief plan, passed without a Republican vote.Republicans in Congress already have their eyes on making gains in the midterm congressional elections in 2022, and are aligning a divided party around opposing Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-promotes-4-trillion-plans-in-visit-to-virginia-schools-101620057070137.html

The trials are to be completed in July and the first results published in August, according Cuban to state media."We will be starting a clinical study with this vaccine, but simultaneously, adapting our national vaccine laboratory to produce, if all goes well as we hope, doses for 4 million people," Alvarado told Venezuelan state television.Alvarado spoke at Venezuela's main airport, where he announced that the country had received another 50,000 Russian Sputnik V vaccines.Venezuela has now received a total of 1.48 million doses coronavirus vaccine doses, he said.The government of President Nicolas Maduro expects to begin receiving vaccines from the global COVAX vaccine program by July, he added, without saying which vaccines would be arriving.Venezuela in March said it would not allow the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of blood clotting.COVAX said in February that it had set aside up to 2.4 million AstraZeneca doses for Venezuela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-to-begin-clinical-trials-of-cuba-s-abdala-vaccine-candidate-101620055989094.html
03-05-2021||World||Singapore defers non-urgent surgeries amid worst Covid-19 flareup in months||Singapore’s Ministry of Health said it has asked hospitals to defer non-urgent surgeries and admissions until further notice, in a bid to increase potential capacity for handling Covid-19 patients.The capacity measures, which also include limiting emergency room visits only for life-threatening or other emergency conditions, and encouraging teleconsultations instead of in-person medical visits where possible, come amid a flareup of cases in a country that’s been one of the world’s most successful in containing the virus.The city-state saw its first fatality due to complications from Covid-19 in nearly two months over the weekend. An 88-year-old Singaporean woman with a history of cancer and cardiac failure passed away on Saturday after she was treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where a cluster of more than three dozen cases has been identified since last week.The cluster is Singapore’s first in a hospital and raises concern that the city’s hard-won success is slipping, potentially threatening efforts to open up a long-awaited travel bubble with Hong Kong and host major upcoming summits including the World Economic Forum and Shangri-la Dialogue.“There will be many more” cases in the hospital as patients there are more susceptible given many hadn’t been vaccinated and were already sick with other illnesses, said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease physician at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital. “Unfortunately, they are easy targets for a Covid-19 super spreader, and in turn patients who have been infected can be new super spreaders,” he said, adding that he has no doubt the government will contain the cluster.‘Precautionary’ MovesSingapore’s Health ministry said no hospital is denying medical care to patients who need it, and described some of the measures it was taking as “precautionary.”Singapore is one of the more successful spots in the world in curbing the virus, similar to others in Asia that have largely halted the spread but where virtual elimination is being challenged by sporadic flareups. In a bid to stay at zero local cases, these places -- including New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong and China -- react aggressively to small numbers of infections.Already, fewer people have been allowed at malls and large stores since Saturday and campsites were closed for two weeks. Singapore will also reduce the operating capacity of attractions to 50% from 65% for a week from May 7, and urged people to limit social gatherings to two per day and stay home where possible.While Singapore is also one the fastest in Asia on vaccination, it trails far behind leading countries globally including Israel, U.S. and U.K. -- which have administered 10.5 million (57.7%), 246 million (38.2%) and 49.8 million (37.3%) -- doses respectively, according to Bloomberg’s vaccination tracker. At 2.21 million doses given as of April 18, Singapore has inoculated just 19.4% of its population, with less than half having received both jabs.Shares of flag carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd. dropped as much as 3.2% on Monday, the most in about two weeks, with stock broker UOB Kay Hian Pte. saying the increase in cases threatened the reopening of the economy. The decline came even as the airline said it had raised about S$2 billion ($1.5 billion) to boost funds as it’s hit by pandemic-related restrictions.Hospital ClusterSingapore has had more than 61,200 total Covid-19 cases, more than 54,500 of them in people living in migrant worker dorms.The country registered 16 new cases of coronavirus in the local community on Thursday, its highest daily number since July 11, and 10 more infections on Monday, according to Ministry of Health data.Prior the latest spate of infections, Singapore had several months of low single-digit or no new cases thanks to strict measures that include mandatory mask-wearing, restricted travel and high testing and overall treatment capacity.All of the cases found on Monday were either patients or staff at Tan Tock Seng Hospital or close contacts who had already been placed on quarantine, according to the government. Prior to the new infections, several patients in the cluster have been linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse at the hospital, who was deployed at a general ward and had gotten her second vaccination dose on Feb. 18, authorities said.Tan Tock Seng Hospital has ceased admissions of new inpatient cases until further notice, the Health ministry said in a statement late Monday, and ambulance cases will be diverted to other public and private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-defers-non-urgent-surgeries-on-worst-covid-19-flareup-in-months-101620043714683.html
03-05-2021||World||Russia turns to China to make Sputnik shots to meet demand||Russia is turning to multiple Chinese firms to manufacture the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in an effort to speed up production as demand soars for its shot.Russia has announced three deals totaling 260 million doses with Chinese vaccine companies in recent weeks. It's a decision that could mean quicker access to a shot for countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa that have ordered Russia's vaccine, as the U.S. and the European Union focus mainly on domestic vaccination needs.Earlier criticism about Russia's vaccine have been largely quieted by data published in the British medical journal The Lancet that said large-scale testing showed it to be safe, with an efficacy rate of 91%.Yet, experts have questioned whether Russia can fulfill its pledge to countries across the world. While pledging hundreds of millions of doses, it has only delivered a fraction.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said demand for Sputnik V significantly exceeds Russia’s domestic production capacity.To boost production, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled Sputnik V, has signed agreements with multiple drug makers in other countries, such as India, South Korea, Brazil, Serbia, Turkey, Italy and others. There are few indications, however, that manufacturers abroad, except for those in Belarus and Kazakhstan, have made any large amounts of the vaccine so far.Airfinity, a London-based science analytics company, estimates Russia agreed to supply some 630 million doses of Sputnik V to over 100 countries, with only 11.5 million doses exported so far.RDIF declined to disclose how many doses are going to other countries. Through April 27, less than 27 million two-dose sets of Sputnik V have been reportedly produced in Russia.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which has been in charge of international cooperation for Sputnik V, said in April it would produce 100 million doses in collaboration with Hualan Biological Bacterin Inc., in addition to an earlier deal announced in March for 60 million doses with Shenzhen Yuanxin Gene tech Co.The two deals are in addition to a deal announced last November with Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding Co, which had paid $9 million to manufacture and sell the Sputnik V vaccine in China. RDIF said in April the terms of the deal were for 100 million doses with a subsidiary company belonging to Tibet Rhodiola.Russia is “very ambitious and unlikely to meet their full targets,” said Rasmus Bech Hansen, founder and CEO of Airfinity. Working with China to produce Sputnik V could be a win-win situation for both Russia and China, he added.In recent years, Chinese vaccine companies have turned from largely making products for use domestically to supplying the global market, with individual firms gaining WHO preapproval for specific vaccines — seen as a seal of quality. With the pandemic, Chinese vaccine companies have exported hundreds of millions of doses abroad.Chinese vaccine makers have been quick to expand capacity and say they can meet China’s domestic need by the end of the year.“This is an acknowledgment of the Chinese vaccine manufacturers who can produce at volume,” said Helen Chen, head of pharmaceuticals LEK Consulting, strategy consultancy firm in Shanghai, in an email.However, none of the three Chinese companies have yet to start manufacturing Sputnik V.Tibet Rhodiola started constructing a factory in Shanghai at the end of last year and expects production to start in September, the company said at an annual meeting for investors last month. Tibet Rhodiola’s chairman Chen Dalin also said that after the successful technology transfer, they will start with an order of 80 million doses to sell back to Russia. An employee at the company declined to transfer a phone call request to the company's media department for comment.The timeline for the newest deals are also unclear. Hualan Bio was among the 10 largest vaccines manufacturers in China in 2019. Phone calls to Hualan Bio went unanswered.A spokeswoman for Shenzhen Yuanxing declined to say when the company will start production but said their order would not be for sale within China. RDIF had said the production will start this month.In spite of the delays, Russia’s vaccine diplomacy has made gains.From the outset, Russia, the first country to approve a coronavirus vaccine, aimed to distribute it globally. Within weeks of giving Sputnik V regulatory approval, RDIF started actively marketing it abroad, announcing multiple deals to supply the shot to other countries. It is so far winning the “public relations” battle, analysts said in a new report examining Russia and China's vaccine diplomacy from the Economist Intelligence Unit.“Russia has been able to build stronger diplomatic ties and in areas where it hasn’t been able to,” before, said Imogen Page-Jarrett, an analyst at EIU. “They have this window of opportunity while the US, E.U. and India are focusing on domestic and the rest of the world is crying out for a vaccine supply."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-turns-to-china-to-make-sputnik-shots-to-meet-demand-101620047984850.html
03-05-2021||World||US lawmakers applaud Prez Joe Biden for helping India to combat Covid-19 crisis||US lawmakers, including those from the opposition Republican party, on Monday praised President Joe Biden for his assistance to India to combat the coronavirus crisis.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.Biden over the past one week has galvanised his entire administration to help India, which is experiencing the worst outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Glad to see the US providing lifesaving support to our friends and partners in India,” Congressman Michael McCaul said.“India stood by the US in our time of need, and can depend on us to do the same. Once we beat this virus, our two democracies will be even stronger partners,” the top Republican lawmaker said in a tweet.The first of several emergency Covid-19 relief shipments from the US arrived in India on Saturday.“Building on over 70 years of cooperation, the United States stands with India as we fight the Covid-19 pandemic together,” the US Embassy in India said.Since then the Department of Defence has sent several flights on a daily basis with live savings medical supplies, including oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders, M-95 masks, filters used in the manufacturing of vaccines and Remdesivir drug, which is used to treat people with coronavirus disease.American corporate sector has also come forward in an unprecedented way, so has the Indian American community. Both of them have raised and donated millions of dollars towards helping India and sending the assistance through available commercial lights or through organisations like FedEx.“My heart aches over the raging surge of Covid-19 cases in India. Deeply saddened by the loss of life and praying for all who are impacted. Critical for the US to provide needed assistance to our friend and ally,” Democratic Congresswoman Grace Meng said.According to Indian health ministry data, single day rise of 3,68,147 Covid-19 infections and 3,417 fatalities pushed the country's tally of cases to 1,99,25,604 and death toll to 2,18,959 on Monday.“It only takes one Covid-19 variant from India to reach US shores to disrupt our entire vaccine rollout process. It just takes one. So, I’m thankful that the White House heeded my request to supply aid to India,” Indian American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-applaud-prez-joe-biden-for-helping-india-to-combat-covid-19-crisis-101620057570511.html

03-05-2021||World||Iran set to feature in meeting of US's Blinken and UK's Raab||Issues related to Iran are set to feature in talks later Monday between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his host in London, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.The bilateral talks come a day ahead of the first face-to-face discussions in two years of foreign and development ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and other invited representatives. The U.K. holds this year's presidency of the G-7.Blinken's visit to London, his first since being appointed by President Joe Biden, comes amid mounting speculation of a prisoner exchange deal with Iran. Prisoner exchanges are not uncommon and were a feature of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and leading powers. Biden has indicated that he is looking to restart nuclear talks with Tehran after his predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the U.S. out of the agreement.In Britain, there's particular interest in the wellbeing of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was last week sentenced to an additional year in prison on charges of spreading “propaganda against the system.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government is doing what it can amid reports in Iran that Britain would pay a 400 million-pound ($550 million) debt to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release.“We of course make sure that we do everything we can to look after the interests of Nazanin and all the very difficult dual national cases we have in Tehran," he said.Earlier Monday, Blinken held bilateral talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on an array of subjects including the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, as well as raising concerns over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.On Tuesday, the full G-7 — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. — will meet along with others, including representatives from other countries, including Australia, India and South Africa.Ahead of the gathering, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned that “authoritarian states” around the world are “trying to play us against each other” and that breaches of international law have become commonplace.“It is important that we hold our values of democracy, state of law, human rights and a global order based on rules against them, united and credibly,” he said.Before the meeting, Britain's Foreign Office said the G-7 ministers will invest $15 billion in development finance over the next two years to help women in developing countries access jobs, build resilient businesses and recover from the coronavirus pandemic.They are also expected to sign up to new targets to get 40 million more girls into school, and 20 million more girls reading by the age of 10 in poorer nations by 2026.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-set-to-feature-in-meeting-of-us-s-blinken-and-uk-s-raab-101620048480965.html

Do not go on holiday in your hometown. Be patient," Doni Monardo, the chief of Indonesia's Covid-19 task force, told the same news conference.Indonesia has reported more than 1.67 million virus infections and 45,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic, though cases have been declining since peaking in January.Nonetheless, the positivity rate, or the percentage of people tested who are found to have the disease, was still hovering at more than 12% on average last month. The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-finds-2-cases-of-indian-covid-19-variant-in-jakarta-101620032559409.html
03-05-2021||World||Germany cancels Oktoberfest for 2nd consecutive year due to Covid-19||Bavarian officials on Monday canceled Oktoberfest festivities for a second year in a row due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus, saying that there are too many risks in hosting the celebrations, which traditionally bring in visitors from around the world, during a global pandemic.Bavarian Governor Markus Soeder said it was with “heavy hearts” that they decided to call off the festival for which the state is known globally, but that with coronavirus numbers still stubbornly high and hospitals already struggling, it had to be done.“Oktoberfest will be held again, and will be big again,” he pledged.Germany is currently in the middle of a lockdown that includes a ban on large gatherings, with an infection rate of 146.9 new weekly infections per 100,000 residents.Bavaria is slightly below the national average with 145.4 new weekly infections per 100,000, according to the country's disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute.Oktoberfest typically attracts about 6 million visitors from around the world and had been scheduled from Sept. 18 to Oct. 3.The combination of large tents full of people and the consumption of large quantities of alcohol, as well as the possibility for mutated varieties of the virus to be brought in from abroad, would have made it particularly hazardous to go ahead with the festival, Soeder said.After Oktoberfest was canceled last year, some 50 of the southern German city’s beer halls and other establishments hosted smaller parties under strict guidelines, and Mayor Dieter Reiter said the hope was that it again would be possible to have open-air beer gardens and patios open with certain restrictions.However difficult the decision to cancel Oktoberfest, it would have been worse if the city waited too long and had to call it off after preparations were already underway, he said.“For me, personally, it was no easy decision because it is a huge date in the calendar for the mayor,” he said. “Much more importantly, it's a huge shame for the millions of fans worldwide.”Under national “emergency brake” legislation passed last month, measures limiting personal contacts, closing leisure and sports facilities and shutting or restricting access to many stores kick in for areas where there are more than 100 weekly new cases per 100,000 residents for three consecutive days.Restrictions also include a 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-cancels-oktoberfest-for-2nd-consecutive-year-due-to-covid19-101620055103998.html
03-05-2021||World||US sets pandemic-era high for air travel, over 1.6 million||The United States set another record for the number of air travelers since the pandemic set in, although passenger numbers remain far below 2019 levels.Nearly 1.67 million people were screened at U.S. airport checkpoints on Sunday, according to the Transportation Security Administration. That was the highest number screened since March 12 of last year when air travel began to plummet.However, it was still 35% below the number of airport travelers reported on the comparable Sunday in 2019, according to TSA figures.Airlines started to see an increase in bookings around mid-February, and the TSA has screened at least 1 million people every day since March 11. Vacation destinations have been most popular — business travel, which is more profitable for airlines, remains drastically diminished.Airline executives are cautiously optimistic about summer travel as more Americans get vaccinated against Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is safe for vaccinated people to travel within the United States, although it continues to warn against travel to most foreign countries.Last week, the TSA extended its requirement that airline passengers wear face masks. That rule was set to expire May 11, but TSA extended it through mid-September.Travelers should expect planes to be more full. Over the weekend, Delta Air Lines stopped blocking off middle seats. It was the last U.S. airline to limit seating as a safety precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-pandemic-era-high-for-air-travel-over-1-6-million-101620054341711.html

The decision to drop the company from its inoculation program means the Danish government is unlikely to reach its target of immunizing the country’s adult population by early August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-reportedly-removes-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-from-its-inoculation-program-101620049075777.html

The Taliban rejected this figure.Data collected by TOLOnews shows that 438 members of Afghan forces and civilians were killed and more than 500 others were wounded in the last 30 days. The data shows that 190 bombings, targeted attacks and offensives happened in the last month.The attacks have intensified as the May 1 deadline for the United States to withdraw troops from Afghanistan has passed."Attacks have been intensified in Uruzgan over the last few days. There are clashes every day," said Amanullah Hotaki, head of the Uruzgan provincial council. "We witness blasts in Kunar every day. The government should prevent such attacks," said Nasir Kamawal, a member of the Kunar provincial council."Over the last 24 hours, attacks were carried out in Panjwai, Arghistan, Maiwand, Shah Wali Kot, Nesh, Mianshin and Takhta Pul districts and other outposts," said Jamal Barikzai, spokesman for the Kandahar police.The government forces said that all Taliban attacks were pushed back and they suffered heavy casualties.US President Joe Biden announced last month the decision to withdraw troops from the country starting on that May 1 deadline, with the aim of completely withdrawing from Afghanistan by September 11, which would mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that sparked the war in Afghanistan, the longest conflict in American history.On Thursday, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the US has begun pulling out its forces from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-carries-out-141-attacks-in-last-24-hours-across-afghanistan-says-report-101620046915498.html
03-05-2021||World||Bangladesh extends nationwide Covid-19 lockdown till May 16||Bangladesh on Monday extended ongoing nationwide lockdown till May 16 to contain the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Bangladesh clamped a week-long nationwide lockdown on April 5, suspending public transport and shutting markets to combat the surge in coronavirus cases in the country. The restrictions were later extended till April 28, then till May 5."The Cabinet has decided to further extend the lockdown till May 16," Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam told a media briefing here.Islam said inter-district bus, train and ferry services would remain suspended until that timeline but public transports would be allowed to operate within cities maintaining health guidelines after May 5, when the latest round of the lockdown was scheduled to end.At the same time, the government will also monitor shopping centres and malls for strict compliance to health safety guidelines, put in place to contain COVID-19 spread, he said.If a shopping place is found to be failing to strictly enforce the safety rules, it will be shut down if needed, Islam said.In face of growing demands, the government had granted permission for reopening shops and malls across the country from April 25, amid lockdown.On April 26, Bangladesh closed its border with India for two weeks in view of the sharp increase in the coronavirus cases in the neighbouring country.On Monday, Health Minister Zahid Maleque said that the borders would remain closed until further order.Health officials on Monday reported 65 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the country’s toll to 11,644. At least 1,739 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of people infected with the virus to 7,63,682.A health ministry spokesman said that both the statistics suggested the infection rate to have come down slightly in the past few days but "we fear the situation could be worse again if the health guidelines are not strictly maintained ahead and during the Eid festival".Last week, Bangladesh recorded the lowest single-day death toll since April 6."There is no room for complacency...the bad situation can return anytime coinciding with the Eid festival later this month," Directorate of Health Services (DGHS) spokesman Dr Nazmul Islam told the media.According to the latest count, the COVID-19 infection rate stood at 8.95 per cent on Monday while the figure shot up to 23.40 per cent on April 5.The health minister said Bangladesh was expecting the arrival of 0.5 million doses of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines by May 10.DGHS officials said pharmaceutical company Renata Bangladesh Limited has sought government permission to bring US Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine to the country."Renata has submitted application seeking permission to bring Moderna vaccine while our Drug Administration is assessing if the company is capable of bringing it," DGHS Director General Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam said.But experts said the Moderna vaccines needed minus temperature storage facility while only in Dhaka such facilities could be provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-extends-nationwide-covid-19-lockdown-till-may-16-101620046226316.html

They are groundless.” He said that “this all shows that Russia is determined to continue the hostile track of confrontation.”Russia’s foreign ministry has accused the EU of wanting to punish Moscow for its “independent foreign and domestic policies” and of trying to limit its development with “unlawful restrictions.”EU foreign ministers will discuss tensions with Russia when they meet on May 10. The 27-nation bloc’s heads of state and government will also take up the issue at their summit on May 25.The EU in March imposed sanctions on six Russian officials involved in the imprisonment of Navalny, who is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most vociferous opponent.Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject. European labs have confirmed that Navalny was poisoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-summons-russia-s-envoy-for-blacklisting-its-officials-over-alexei-navalny-sanctions-101620042323391.html

The vaccine last week was cleared for emergency use by the World Health Organization, making it eligible for Covax, according to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the partners in the initiative.Covax has encountered funding challenges, delivery delays and other hurdles in a high-stakes campaign to narrow the vaccine-access gap. As India confronts a devastating resurgence of the illness, concerns are rising for many countries around the world that have been left behind their wealthier counterparts.Rich countries last year snapped up doses of vaccines from Moderna and other drugmakers, and the U.S. alone has already administered more than 240 million doses. Covax meanwhile has shipped about 50 million doses to more than 120 countries and territories, based on data through late April.Supplies of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine to Covax are set to begin in the fourth quarter, with 34 million doses available in 2021, Gavi said Monday. The U.S. company will supply as many as 466 million doses in 2022 and potentially provide access to shots that are adapted to fight variants of the coronavirus in the future. The terms of the agreement with Gavi weren’t disclosed.Variant RisksThe doses will help broaden Covax’s portfolio at a crucial time. The program is heavily reliant on the shot from AstraZeneca, which is cheaper and easier to deploy but has faced worries about rare blood clots that have complicated immunization campaigns. Covax is also leaning on the Serum Institute of India Ltd. as a key supplier, but the country said in March it would slow down exports to focus on its own needs.“Having a diverse portfolio has always been a core goal for Covax, and to remain adaptable in the face of this continually evolving pandemic -- including the rising threat posed by new variants,” Gavi Chief Executive Officer Seth Berkley said in the statement.Gavi has said it’s seeking to raise $2 billion by June to secure additional doses to cover as much as 30% of the populations in 92 lower-income economies. Covax is led by Gavi, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and works with organizations including UNICEF as well.Pfizer and BioNTech SE in January agreed to supply as many as 40 million doses to Covax, which is also due to receive up to 500 million doses of J&J’s single-shot vaccine.Moderna said last week it would produce as many as 3 billion doses of its vaccine next year as it makes new investments to bolster output, and CEO Stephane Bancel said he was deeply worried about variant-driven epidemics in places like South America and India.While AstraZeneca has pledged not to profit from its Covid shot during the pandemic and recorded $275 million in sales from the shot in the first quarter, Moderna has said it expects to bring in more than $18 billion in Covid vaccine sales this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-supply-500-million-vaccine-doses-to-covax-effort-101620037008492.html
03-05-2021||World||US' Blinken presents new North Korea approach as G7 meets in person||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday opened the Group of Seven's first in-person talks in two years by presenting the new administration's fresh approach on North Korea, which has already denounced it.With Covid raging in India but increasingly coming under control in the West, Britain welcomed foreign ministers of the club of wealthy democracies to London discuss a post-pandemic agenda and prepare for a G7 summit in southwest England next month.India, South Korea, South Africa and ASEAN bloc chair Brunei were invited as guests to the three days of talks, which will also address rising tensions with Russia and China as well as diplomacy to revive a nuclear accord with Iran.Amid stringent anti-Covid measures including restrictions on movements, Blinken met separately at his hotel with the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea days after President Joe Biden completed a review on North Korea policy."We are grateful to have this opportunity to have in-depth discussions with the US after the conclusion of your policy review," South Korean Chung Eui-yong said, as he welcomed the "very positive and open message" by Biden in his address to Congress last week.The State Department said that Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi "shared their concerns about North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes" in their meeting.They agreed to work together along with Japan's sometime rival South Korea "towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula," a statement said.- Middle path on North Korea -Biden ordered an assessment of North Korea policy after his predecessor Donald Trump's unusual, highly personalised diplomacy that featured three made-for-television meetings with the totalitarian state's young leader Kim Jong Un.The review proposed a middle ground by moving away from Trump's ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful bid to reach a far-reaching agreement that, after seven decades, could finally bring an official end to the Korean War.But the White House also said it would engage with North Korea, a shift from former president Barack Obama's policy of "strategic patience" -- or, keeping Pyongyang at arm's length until its behaviour changes."Our policy will not focus on achieving a grand bargain, nor will it rely on strategic patience," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday, while acknowledging that successive administrations have failed to achieve the goal of ending North Korea's nuclear programme.North Korea on Sunday denounced the Biden approach, saying he was keeping a "hostile policy" in place for more than half a century."The US-claimed 'diplomacy' is a spurious signboard for covering up its hostile acts, and 'deterrence' touted by it is just a means for posing nuclear threats to the DPRK," foreign ministry official Kwon Jong Gun said through state media, using the official name of North Korea.US officials largely expected a strident reaction from North Korea, which is known for its colourful statements, including in 2019 describing Biden as a "rabid dog" who "must be beaten to death with a stick".A welcoming dinner for the Group of Seven foreign ministers will address both North Korea and Iran.Both the United States and Britain have played down reports that Iran will release their respective nationals from captivity as diplomacy steps up.Britain said that talks were still continuing and denounced the "torture" of dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after Iranian state television said that she could be released from years of detention after London settles an old debt.After the G7, Blinken will head Wednesday to Ukraine in a show of support after Russia last month deployed but then pulled back some 100,000 troops along its border and in annexed Crimea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blinken-presents-new-north-korea-approach-as-g7-meets-in-person-101620041840706.html
03-05-2021||World||Taiwan bars arrivals from India as Indonesia reports cases of Covid variant||Taiwan became the latest place to ban arrivals from coronavirus-stricken India on Monday, as it moves to prevent new infections, with more nations reporting cases of a variant first identified in the subcontinent.The variant, B.1.617, has reached at least 17 countries, from Britain and Iran to Switzerland, sparking global concern and spurring several to close their borders to people travelling from India.Scientists are studying whether the variant, resulting from two key mutations to the outer "spike" portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, is driving an unexpected explosion in cases in India.The south Asian nation's tally of infections was just shy of 20 million on Monday, after it reported more than 300,000 new coronavirus cases for a 12th straight day.Last month, Indonesia, which has been battling one of Asia's worst COVID-19 outbreaks, stopped issuing visas for foreigners who had been in India in the previous 14 days."We need to contain these cases, while there are still only a few of them," said Indonesian health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, after the first two cases of the variant reported in the southeast Asian nation on Monday.Neighbouring Malaysia said on Sunday it had detected its first case of the Indian variant, days after imposing a ban on flights from the country.On Monday, Taiwan said that except for its citizens, all those who had been in India in the 14 days prior would be barred from entering its territory, while returning Taiwanese face 14 days in centralised quarantine facilities. The move comes after Australia took a more drastic measure last week, banning the entry of residents and citizens who have been in India in the previous two weeks, threatening fines and jail for any who disobey.It was the first time Australia has branded citizens' return home a criminal offence.Australia defended the ban, which took effect on Monday, saying it had a "strong, clear and absolute" belief that the move was legal."It's a high-risk situation in India," Health Minister Greg Hunt told a televised news briefing."The strong, clear view is that there has been no doubt in any of the Commonwealth advice about this."Philippine officials warned that they could not rule out the possibility of an India-like COVID-19 crisis, saying last week's decision to ban entry of arrivals from India aimed to keep it from becoming a reality."It is possible for it to happen here if we don’t intensify responses," Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire said."When we look at what is happening in India, it is happening across the globe... What’s different is the intensity of it."The World Health Organisation designates the variant as being "of interest", suggesting it may have mutations that would make the virus more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade vaccine immunity.Other strains with known risks, such as those first detected in the Brazil, Britain and South Africa, have been categorised as "variants of concern," a higher threat level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-bars-arrivals-from-india-as-indonesia-reports-cases-of-covid-variant-101620042150744.html

Tables are set a certain distance apart to maintain social distancing, while standing customers and music aren't allowed.The reopening comes on a national holiday, the day after Orthodox Easter, and many people took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather to head to sidewalk cafes.A maximum of six customers are allowed per table, while staff must carry out compulsory coronavirus home self-tests. A nightly curfew that was in force from 9 p.m. is being pushed back to 11 p.m. as of Monday, with bars, restaurants and cafes allowed to remain open until 15 minutes before curfew.In recent weeks, the curfew had been largely ignored, with bars and cafes serving drinks for takeout, and crowds of customers forming outside, standing on sidewalks and in nearby apartment entrances.Greece has been gradually easing restrictions despite stubbornly high infection rates and hospitalizations that have strained its health system. The country of about 11 million people has seen nearly 10,500 deaths and 346,500 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest figures available from Saturday.Tourism is a vital industry for the country, and tourism-related businesses and services are scheduled to reopen on May 15.Greece’s vaccination drive has been picking up pace, with the vaccine appointment booking system now open to all those ages 30 and over. So far, the country has administered just over 3 million vaccines, with just over 2 million of those being first doses and more than 944,000 people being fully vaccinated with both doses. As of Wednesday, Greece will also start administering the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-cafes-restaurants-reopen-for-outdoor-service-in-nearly-6-months-101620039777326.html

We discussed India-EU Leaders’ Meeting on 8 May. I am confident that the Meeting will provide a new momentum to our Strategic Partnership.According to diplomatic sources in EU, the connectivity agreement will link India and EU in transport, energy, digital world and people to people contacts by creating assets and capacities in not only India and EU but also joint investment in third countries. The connectivity agreement will not only based on rules based order but also involve private sector to create assets in the Indo-Pacific region without burdening the third country with debt.“It is an India-EU answer to China’s Belt Road Initiative as the connectivity partnership will take to account environment and sustainable development and totally transparent processes…..it is akin to India-Japan bidding in Sri Lankan port project,” said an EU diplomat.The President of the European Union Commission, Ursula von der Leyen later wrote on Twitter, "There is clear momentum to strengthen our strategic relations on trade, digital, climate change & multilateralism. I'm encouraged by the prospect of intensifying our trade & investment relations. This would tap into a huge potential to the benefit of our businesses & citizens."There is clear momentum to strengthen our strategic relations on trade, digital, climate change & multilateralism.

03-05-2021||World||Syria's top court accepts three candidates to run for president||Syria’s supreme constitutional court has accepted three applications out of 51 for candidacy for this month’s presidential elections in the war-torn country, state media reported Monday.The largely symbolic election is certain to be won by President Bashar Assad, who was chosen along with two other men, Abdullah Salloum Abdullah and Mahmoud Ahmad Marie, to run. Some 51 candidates, including seven women, had applied to be candidates. The Parliament later referred the names to the constitutional court.The presidential vote, Syria's second since civil war broke out in 2011, is scheduled to be held on May 26. Syrians abroad will vote on May 20.Mohamad Jihad Lahham, the president of the Supreme Constitutional Court, said the court accepted the three candidates and rejected the rest because they did not meet the constitutional and legal requirements.Lahham said that those whose candidacies have been rejected have the right to appeal before the court within three days.Assad won nearly 90% of the votes in the 2014 elections and is widely expected to win a fourth seven-year term. He has held power since 2000 when he took over after the death of his father, who ran the country for 30 years.Syria began allowing multi-candidate voting in the 2014 elections. Competition with Assad was symbolic and seen by opposition and Western countries as a sham designed to give the incumbent president the veneer of legitimacy.The international community is unlikely to recognize the legitimacy of the upcoming elections. According to the UN resolution for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, a new constitution is supposed to be drafted and approved in a public referendum before UN-monitored presidential elections are to take place. But little progress has been made on the drafting committee and Assad continues to have the backing of Russia and Iran.In March, the Biden administration said it will not recognize the result of Syria’s presidential election unless the voting is free, fair, supervised by the United Nations, and represents all of Syrian society.Syria has been in the throes of civil war since 2011 when Arab Spring-inspired protests against the Assad family rule turned into an armed insurgence in response to a brutal military crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrias-top-court-accepts-three-candidates-to-run-for-president-101620033872923.html
03-05-2021||World||Biden to start reunifying migrant families separated by Trump-era border policy||The United States this week will reunite four migrant families separated at the US-Mexico border during the Trump administration, US officials said, a small step toward fulfilling a campaign promise by President Joe Biden.The families will be allowed to enter the United States through an emergency process known as "humanitarian parole," Michelle Brane, who heads a Biden-created task force that aims to reunite separated families, told a call with reporters on Sunday."In these cases that we're talking about this week, the children are in the United States and the parents are coming to join them," Brane said.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is considering whether they could be granted longer-term immigration status, she said.Lee Gelernt, lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued former President Donald Trump's administration over the separations policy, said his organization did not know how many children remain separated from parents but that the number was likely more than 1,000.The Biden administration has been grappling in recent months with a sharp rise in migrant crossings at the border, including unaccompanied minors and families with young children, mostly from Central America.The Trump administration, known for its hardline stance on immigration, adopted a blanket "zero-tolerance" policy of prosecuting all unauthorized border crossers in spring 2018, resulting in the mass separation of parents from their children.Trump reversed the policy that summer amid an international outcry, but advocates and government watchdogs found separations began before the policy and continued after it. In some cases, parents were deported and children remained in the United States with other relatives or sponsors.Biden has called family separations under Trump a "human tragedy."DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who also participated in the call with reporters, declined to provide details about the families, citing privacy concerns, but noted that one is Honduran and another Mexican.Both have been separated since 2017, he said, adding that the reunifications this week would be "the first of many."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-start-reunifying-migrant-families-separated-by-trump-era-border-policy-101620032611349.html
03-05-2021||World||Singapore sees first death due to Covid-19 in nearly 2 months amid rise in cases||Singapore saw its first fatality due to complications from Covid-19 in nearly two months over the weekend, amid a flareup of cases in a country that’s been one of the world’s most successful in containing the virus.An 88-year-old Singaporean woman with a history of cancer and cardiac failure passed away on Saturday after she was treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where a cluster of 37 cases has been identified since last week.The cluster is Singapore’s first in a hospital and raises concern that the city’s hard-won success is slipping, potentially threatening efforts to open up a long-awaited travel bubble with Hong Kong and host major upcoming summits including the World Economic Forum and Shangri-la Dialogue.“There will be many more” cases in the hospital as patients there are more susceptible given many hadn’t been vaccinated and were already sick with other illnesses, said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease physician at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital. “Unfortunately, they are easy targets for a Covid-19 super spreader, and in turn patients who have been infected can be new super spreaders,” he said, adding that he has no doubt the government will contain the cluster.Singapore is one of the more successful spots in the world in curbing the virus, similar to others in Asia that have largely halted the spread but where virtual elimination is being challenged by sporadic flareups. In a bid to stay at zero local cases, these places -- including New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong and China -- react aggressively to small numbers of infections.Already, fewer people have been allowed at malls and large stores since Saturday and campsites were closed for two weeks. Singapore will also reduce the operating capacity of attractions to 50% from 65% for a week from May 7, and urged people to limit social gatherings to two per day and stay home where possible.While Singapore is also one the fastest in Asia on vaccination, it trails far behind leading countries globally including Israel, US and UK -- which have administered 10.5 million (57.7%), 246 million (38.2%) and 49.8 million (37.3%) -- doses respectively, according to Bloomberg’s vaccination tracker. At 2.21 million doses given as of April 18, Singapore has inoculated just 19.4% of its population, with less than half having received both jabs.Shares of flag carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd. dropped as much as 3.2% on Monday, the most in about two weeks, with stock broker UOB Kay Hian Pte. saying the increase in cases threatened the reopening of the economy. The decline came even as the airline said it had raised about S$2 billion ($1.5 billion) to boost funds as it’s hit by pandemic-related restrictions.Hospital clusterSingapore has had more than 61,200 total Covid-19 cases, more than 54,500 of them in people living in migrant worker dorms.The country registered 16 new cases of coronavirus in the local community on Thursday, its highest daily number since July 11, and 10 more infections on Monday, according to Ministry of Health data.Prior the latest spate of infections, Singapore had several months of low single-digit or no new cases thanks to strict measures that include mandatory mask-wearing, restricted travel and high testing and overall treatment capacity.All of the cases found on Monday were either patients or staff at Tan Tock Seng Hospital or close contacts who had already been placed on quarantine, according to the government. Prior to the new infections, several patients in the cluster have been linked to a 46-year-old Filipino nurse at the hospital, who was deployed at a general ward and had gotten her second vaccination dose on Feb. 18, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-sees-first-death-due-to-covid-19-in-nearly-2-months-amid-rise-in-cases-101620031371295.html
03-05-2021||World||Democrats seek narrow path to rein in cost of medicines||US president Joe Biden's call for authorising Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices has energized Democrats on a politically popular idea they've been pushing for nearly 20 years only to encounter frustration.But they still lack a clear path to enact legislation. That's because a small number of Democrats remain uneasy over government price curbs on pharmaceutical companies.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will need every Democratic vote in a narrowly divided Congress.Otherwise Democrats may have to settle for a compromise that stops short of their goal.Or they could take the issue into the 2022 midterm elections.“There is a path,” said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., one of Pelosi's lieutenants. “But there's also a challenge, and the challenge is we've got razor-thin margins.”“This is not a done deal,” continued Welch. “We've got a president and a speaker, but pharma' is very powerful.”Pharma is a nickname for the industry and for its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research, and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA.The industry thwarted President Donald Trump's multi-pronged efforts to constrain its pricing power.Even though Trump came into office accusing drugmakers of “getting away with murder" and vowing he'd put a stop to it, the companies emerged from his term with just a few nicks and cuts.The industry lobbying group PhRMA is considered one of the most skilled operators in Washington. Its mission: to preserve a clause in the 2003 law that created Medicare's pharmacy benefit barring the government from interfering in price negotiations among drugmakers and insurers. That was enacted before $1,000 pills became old hat.PhRMA CEO Stephen Ubl served notice after Biden's speech to Congress last week that the industry stands ready to defend its prerogative.“Giving the government the power to arbitrarily determine the price of medicines is not the right approach,” he said in a statement arguing that it would stifle innovation. Such measured language belies the group's clout. It's usually among the top five spenders on Washington lobbying and networks with allied groups in the states.“I don't think anybody is fully prepared for the onslaught we expect from PhRMA,” said Margarida Jorge, campaign director for Lower Drug Prices Now, a coalition backing Medicare negotiations. “We are going to see a much bigger stepped-up game.”Pelosi put Medicare negotiations back in play with the reintroduction of an ambitious bill she powered through the House in 2019.Medicare would use an average of lower prices in other economically advanced countries to negotiate on top drugs. Companies that refused to deal would be hit with a steep tax. Drugmakers who hike prices above the rate of inflation would owe rebates to Medicare.Hundreds of billions of dollars potentially saved through the legislation would be plowed back into other health care programs. Private insurers covering working-age people would be able to secure Medicare's lower prices.In his speech to a joint session of Congress, Biden invited lawmakers to imagine the possibilities.“The money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthening the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny,” the president said. “It is within our power to do it. Let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough.”But Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is urging Biden to lower his sights a bit.Grassley opposes negotiating authority for Medicare but supports requiring drugmakers to pay rebates for price hikes above the inflation rate — a potential compromise.“I hope the president reconsiders the liberal pipe dream in favour of the big bipartisan win,” said Grassley.Polls have consistently shown strong public support for authorizing Medicare to negotiate.“This is very high among the concerns of voters, and also heavily promised by Biden in the campaign,” said policy expert John Rother, a longtime advocate of drug price curbs. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Tuesday on the issue.One option for Pelosi and Schumer would be to splice the Medicare legislation into a mammoth bill delivering Biden's “American Jobs Plan” promises on social programs and infrastructure.Such a vehicle would seem to offer the greatest chance to pass drug pricing curbs. But the political dynamics are different in each chamber. What might work in the House may get nowhere in the Senate.With its 50-50 split, the Senate is looking like the choke point. The overwhelming majority of Democrats are in favour of Medicare negotiations, but a few are undeclared.Among them is Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, whose office says he believes "any drug pricing bill must deliver real savings for consumers at the pharmacy counter, not just achieve savings to the government or overall system.”“It's going to be a heavy lift,” said policy expert Rother. “But I don't think you know for sure until you try it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-seek-narrow-path-to-rein-in-cost-of-medicines-101620027632014.html
03-05-2021||World||Russia lags behind other nations in Covid-19 vaccination drive||While at the Park House shopping mall in northern Moscow, Vladimir Makarov saw it was offering the coronavirus vaccine to customers, so he asked how long it would take.“It turned out it's simple here — 10 minutes,” he said of his experience last month.But Makarov, like many Muscovites, still decided to put off getting the Sputnik V shot.Russia boasted last year of being the first in the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, but it now finds itself lagging in getting its population immunized.That has cast doubt on whether authorities will reach their ambitious goal of vaccinating more than 30 million of the country's 146 million people by mid-June and nearly 69 million by August.The vaccine reluctance comes as shots are readily available in the capital to anyone 18 or older at more than 200 state and private clinics, shopping malls, food courts, hospitals — even a theater.As of mid-April, over 1 million of Moscow's 12.7 million residents, or about 8%, have received at least one shot, even though the campaign began in December.That percentage is similar for Russia as a whole. Through April 27, only 12.1 million people have gotten at least one shot, and only 7.7 million, or 5%, have been fully vaccinated. That puts Russia far behind the US, where 43% have gotten at least one shot and the European Union with nearly 27%.Data analyst Alexander Dragan, who tracks vaccinations across Russia, said last week the country was giving shots to 200,000-205,000 people a day. In order to hit the mid-June target, it needs to be nearly double that.“We need to start vaccinating 370,000 people a day, like, beginning tomorrow,” Dragan told The Associated Press.To boost demand, Moscow officials began offering coupons worth 1,000 rubles (USD 13) to those over 60 who get vaccinated — not a small sum for those receiving monthly pensions of about 20,000 rubles (USD 260).Still, it hasn't generated much enthusiasm. Some elderly Muscovites told AP it was difficult to register online for the coupons or find grocery stores that accepted them.Other regions also are offering incentives. Authorities in Chukotka, across the Bering Strait from Alaska, promised seniors 2,000 rubles for getting vaccinated, while the neighboring Magadan region offered 1,000 rubles. A theater in St. Petersburg offered discounted tickets for those presenting a vaccination certificate.Russia's lagging vaccination rates hinge on several factors, including supply. Russian drug makers have been slow to ramp up mass production, and there were shortages in March in many regions.So far, only 28 million two-dose sets of all three vaccines available in Russia have been produced, with Sputnik V accounting for most of them, and only 17.4 million have been released into circulation after undergoing quality control.Waiting lists for the shot remain long in places. In the Sverdlovsk region, the fifth most populous in Russia, 178,000 people were on a waitlist by mid-April, regional deputy health minister Yekaterina Yutyaeva told AP.On April 28, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there are enough vaccines available in Russia, adding that demand was the defining factor in the country's vaccination rate.Another factor in Russians' reluctance over Sputnik V was the fact that it was rolled out even as large-scale testing to ensure its safety and efficacy was still ongoing. But a study published in February in the British medical journal The Lancet said the vaccine appeared safe and highly effective against Covid-19, according to a trial involving about 20,000 people in Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-lags-behind-other-nations-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101620027153383.html
03-05-2021||World||Apple faces grave legal threat, goes on trial over 'walled garden' app store||On Monday, Apple faces one of its most serious legal threats in recent years: A trial that threatens to upend its iron control over its app store, which brings in billions of dollars each year while feeding more than 1.6 billion iPhones, iPads, and other devices.The federal court case is being brought by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite.Epic wants to topple the so-called “walled garden” of the app store, which Apple started building 13 years ago as part of a strategy masterminded by co-founder Steve Jobs.Epic charges that Apple has transformed a once-tiny digital storefront into an illegal monopoly that squeezes mobile apps for a significant slice of their earnings.Apple takes a commission of 15% to 30% on purchases made within apps, including everything from digital items in games to subscriptions. Apple denies Epic's claims.Apple's highly successful formula has helped turn the iPhone maker into one of the world's most profitable companies, one with a market value that now tops USD 2.2 trillion.Privately held Epic is puny by comparison, with an estimated market value of USD 30 billion. Its aspirations to get bigger hinge in part on its plan to offer an alternative app store on the iPhone.The North Carolina company also wants to break free of Apple's commissions. Epic says it forked over hundreds of millions of dollars to Apple before it expelled Fortnite from its app store last August after Epic added a payment system that bypassed Apple.Epic then sued Apple, prompting a courtroom drama that could shed new light on Apple's management of its app store. Both Apple CEO Tim Cook and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney will testify in an Oakland, California federal courtroom that will be set up to allow for social distancing and will require masks at all times.Neither side wanted a jury trial, leaving the decision to US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who already seems to know her ruling will probably be appealed, given the stakes in the case.Much of the evidence will revolve around arcane but crucial arguments about market definitions.Epic contends the iPhone has become so ingrained in society that the device and its ecosystem have turned into a monopoly Apple can exploit to unfairly enrich itself and thwart competition.Apple claims it faces significant competition from various alternatives to video games on iPhones. For instance, it points out that about 2 billion other smartphones don't run iPhone software or work with its app store — primarily those relying on Google's Android system. Epic has filed a separate case against Google, accusing it of illegally gouging apps through its own app store for Android devices.Apple will also depict Epic as a desperate company hungry for sources of revenue beyond the aging Fortnite. It claims Epic merely wants to freeload off an iPhone ecosystem in which Apple has invested more than USD 100 billion over the past 15 years.Estimates of Apple's app store revenue range from USD 15 billion to USD 18 billion annually. Apple disputes those estimates, although it hasn't publicly disclosed its own figures. Instead, it has emphasized that it doesn't collect a cent from 85% of the apps in its store.The commissions it pockets, Apple says, are a reasonable way for the company to recoup its investment while financing an app review process it calls essential to preserving the security of apps and their users.About 40% of the roughly 100,000 apps submitted for review each week are rejected for some sort of problem, according to Kyle Andeer, Apple's chief compliance officer.Epic will try to prove that Apple uses the security issue to disguise its true motivation — maintaining a monopoly that wrings more profits from app makers who can't afford to be available on the iPhone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-faces-grave-legal-threat-goes-on-trial-over-walled-garden-app-store-101620025489977.html
03-05-2021||World||New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern takes tougher stance on China||New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern took a tougher stance on China's human rights record Monday by saying it was getting harder to reconcile differences as China's role in the world grows.While Ardern's language remained moderate when compared with that of many other leaders, it still marked a significant shift for a country that relies on China as its largest trading partner. Ardern in past speeches has often avoided direct criticism of China.New Zealand has been trying to strike the right tone on China in recent weeks after finding itself on the defensive with its Five Eyes security allies by resisting speaking out in unison with them against China on certain human rights issues.New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta caused a diplomatic stir last month when she discussed her reluctance to expand the role of the Five Eyes to include joint positions on human rights. The alliance among New Zealand, the US, the UK, Australia, and Canada has its origins in World War II cooperation.In her speech to the China Business Summit in Auckland on Monday, Ardern said New Zealand has raised “grave” concerns with China on human rights issues, including the situation of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and people who live in Hong Kong.“And it will not have escaped the attention of anyone here that as China’s role in the world grows and changes, the differences between our systems – and the interests and values that shape those systems – are becoming harder to reconcile,” Ardern told the audience.Stephen Noakes, the director of the China Studies Centre at the University of Auckland, said he wouldn't have expected to hear such language from New Zealand even a couple of years ago. He said some of it sounded like a wink to the Five Eyes to let them know that although New Zealand might have economic dependencies on China, it wasn't being soft.Noakes said that because China's relationships with both Australia and Canada have deteriorated so rapidly in the last few years, it has made New Zealand's rosier relationship stick out like a sore thumb.Still, Noakes said, he didn't expect the change in New Zealand's rhetoric to have any negative impact on its trade with China. And he said New Zealand's relatively moderate stance could make it a useful go-between in the future between China and other Five Eyes members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-takes-tougher-stance-on-china-101620017818814.html
03-05-2021||World||World Press Freedom Day: US slams internet shutdowns, seeks accountability for crimes against journalists||Ahead of the World Press Freedom Day, the United States condemned the use of government-imposed internet shutdowns to prevent the exercise of freedom of expression online and urged governments to investigate and seek accountability for all crimes against journalists and media workers.In a press statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: "Tomorrow, the United States joins the international community in celebrating World Press Freedom Day. Information and knowledge are powerful tools, and a free and independent press is the core institution connecting publics to the information they need to advocate for themselves, make informed decisions, and hold government officials accountable."Stressing that the US advocates for press freedom online and offline and for the safety of journalists and media workers worldwide, Blinken also mentioned the implementation of the 'Khashoggi Ban' - in wake of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi - to help deter threatening behaviour against media.Citing the Committee to Protect Journalists report in 2020, the top US diplomat further said that Mexico and Afghanistan had seen the largest number of journalists killed in retaliation for their reporting, while China, Turkey, and Egypt imprisoned the most reporters last year."Unfortunately, the pandemic has provided a pretext for repressive governments to intensify pressure on independent media. It is exactly in that kind of hostile environment that the exercise of freedom of expression, especially by members of the press, becomes even more crucial in alerting the public to abuses and corruption and in countering dangerous misinformation and disinformation. We call on all governments to ensure media safety and protect journalists' ability to do their jobs without fear of violence, threats, or unjust detention," he said.Blinken further expressed concern with the governments' increased efforts to deprive the public of information and knowledge by controlling Internet access and censoring content, including through the widespread use of network restrictions - some as long as 18 months - that makes it impossible for journalists to conduct independent reporting.He noted that the governments must not shut down, block, throttle, censor, or filter services, as these actions undermine and unduly restrict the rights of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression, disrupt access to essential services, and negatively impact the economy."The United States condemns the use of partial or complete government-imposed Internet shutdowns, among other tactics, to prevent the exercise of freedom of expression online and restrict the ability of independent journalists to serve the public. We urge governments to investigate and seek accountability for all crimes against journalists and media workers," he remarked."The United States is committed to working in partnership with members of the media, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and other concerned governments to support access to information and defend freedom of expression and the brave journalists who face intimidation, harassment, arrest, and violence in exercising their rights," Blinken added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-press-freedom-day-us-slams-internet-shutdowns-asks-for-accountability-101620012121389.html

This translated to 1.6 billion adults globally, it said."Worldwide, these percentages ranged from a high of 76% in Thailand to a low of 10% in Switzerland," said researchers in a statement.In Bolivia, Myanmar, Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Honduras and Ecuador, more than 70% people polled said they took home less than before global health crisis. In the United States, this figure dropped to 34%.The Covid-19 crisis has hit workers across the world, particularly women, who are over-represented in low-paid precarious sectors such as retail, tourism and food services.A study by the international charity Oxfam on Thursday said the pandemic had cost women around the world $800 billion in lost income.The Gallup poll found that more than half of those surveyed said they temporarily stopped working at their job or business - translating to about 1.7 billion adults globally.In 57 countries including India, Zimbabwe, the Philippines, Kenya, Bangladesh, El Salvador, more than 65% of respondents said they stopped working for a time.Countries where people were least likely to say they stopped working were predominantly developed, high-income countries.Fewer than one in 10 of those who had jobs in Austria, Switzerland and Germany said they had stopped working temporarily. In the US, the figure was 39%, research showed.The poll also showed that one in three people surveyed lost their job or business due to the pandemic - translating into just over one billion people globally.These figures also varied across nations with lower income countries such as the Philippines, Kenya and Zimbabwe showing more than 60% of respondents lost their jobs or businesses, compared to 3% in Switzerland and 13% in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-two-people-globally-lost-income-due-to-the-pandemic-report-101620015316511.html
03-05-2021||World||'Harder to reconcile': Jacinda Ardern on New Zealand's differences with China||New Zealand's differences with China on human rights are becoming "harder to reconcile", Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday, after Wellington faced criticism for failing to challenge its largest trading partner.Ardern's government has taken flak over its meek criticisms of China's rights record, leading to accusations New Zealand is a weak link in the US-led Five Eyes intelligence network.In a speech at a China Business Summit in Auckland, Ardern said New Zealand had already raised "grave concerns" with China about the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province and spoken out about the erosion of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.But the centre-left leader said Wellington had an independent foreign policy and was free to choose whether it flagged such issues publicly or during private discussions with Chinese officials.Regardless of how the human rights concerns were dealt with, Ardern admitted there were some issues upon which China and New Zealand would never agree."It will not have escaped the attention of anyone here that as China's role in the world grows and changes, the differences between our systems -- and the interests and values that shape those systems -- are becoming harder to reconcile," she said."This is a challenge that we, and many other countries across the Indo-Pacific region, but also in Europe and other regions, are also grappling with."Ardern said pointing out areas of difference with Beijing was "part and parcel of New Zealand staying true to who we are as a nation"."We need to acknowledge that there are some things on which China and New Zealand do not, cannot, and will not agree," she said."This need not derail our relationship, it is simply a reality."- 'Swimming in New Zealand's lane' -New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta expressed unease last month about the decades-old Five Eyes alliance -- comprised of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand -- for moving beyond its remit of intelligence-sharing between member nations.It came just months after Trade Minister Damien O'Connor urged Australia to show more "respect" to Beijing in the wake of New Zealand signing an upgraded free trade deal with China.New Zealand officials have also been careful not to directly criticise China's expanding influence in the Pacific, unlike their US and Australian counterparts.In contrast, Canberra's robust criticism of Beijing on issues such as Hong Kong and the need to investigate the origins of Covid-19 has spurred punitive levies on more than a dozen Australian imports, including wine and barley.Ardern said it was in China's own interests to act in a way that was consistent with its international responsibilities."As a significant power, the way that China treats its partners is important for us," she added.While Ardern's remarks may reassure other Five Eyes nations that New Zealand shares their concerns on China, she made it clear Wellington would continue to chart its own course and not feel obliged to make joint statements."I'm often asked which lane are we swimming in -- we swim in New Zealand's lane," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harder-to-reconcile-jacinda-ardern-on-new-zealand-s-differences-with-china-101620005951192.html

The roadmap will focus on enhancing cooperation in five areas – trade and prosperity, defence and security, climate action, healthcare and people-to-people relations, the external affairs ministry said on Sunday. “The summit will be an important opportunity to elevate our multi-faceted strategic ties and enhance cooperation on regional and global issues of mutual interest. Both leaders will also discuss Covid-19 cooperation and the global efforts to fight the pandemic,” the ministry said. The British foreign office also said in a statement on Sunday that the UK will send 1,000 more ventilators from its surplus stocks to support India’s Covid-19 response in the face of a second wave of infections.The statement added that Johnson and Modi will agree on a “huge range of commitments” to deepen cooperation, including in fighting the pandemic, during their summit. “The terrible images we have seen in India in recent weeks are all the more powerful because of the close and enduring connection between the people of the UK and India,” Johnson said. “I am deeply moved by the surge of support the British people have provided to the people of India and am pleased the UK government has been able to play our part in providing life-saving assistance. The UK will always be there for India in its time of need.” Johnson has twice called off a planned visit to India this year because of the Covid-19 situation. Last month, he cancelled a trip that was to begin on April 25 following a surge in Coronavirus infections in India. Johnson cancelled a visit in January to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in order to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly. The fresh assistance from Britain will be in addition to 200 ventilators, 495 oxygen concentrators and three large oxygen generation units the UK announced it would be sending to India last week. UK’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance have spoken to their Indian counterparts to provide advice and expertise for the Indian healthcare system. The UK National Health Service is establishing a clinical advisory group led by Chief People Officer Prerana Isaar to support India’s Covid-19 response. The group will work with Indian institutions such as the All India Institute of Medical Services to share experience in managing Covid-19 outbreaks. The group will include researchers in public and global health, and nursing and other health professionals who have experience of the Indian healthcare system. Over the past week, British citizens, businesses and civil society have also responded to appeals for help and launched funding drives. This includes the British Asian Trust’s “Oxygen for India” emergency appeal, which is raising funds for oxygen concentrators to be rapidly deployed to Indian hospitals. The appeal, personally backed by the Prince of Wales, has raised more than £1.5 million. Virgin Atlantic flew 200 boxes of oxygen concentrators to New Delhi on Saturday after partnering with Khalsa Aid. More cargo space will be given free of charge on six flights to India in the next week, in association with The Red Cross.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-boris-johnson-to-hold-virtual-summit-uk-to-ship-1000-more-ventilators-to-india-101619982178571.html
