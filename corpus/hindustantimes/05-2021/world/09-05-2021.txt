Ainscough, who predicted World War III may be fought with bioweapons.The paper also includes musing that SARS —which hit China in 2003 — could have been a man-made bioweapon deliberately unleashed by "terrorists".They reportedly boasted the viruses could be “artificially manipulated into an emerging human disease virus, then weaponised and unleashed in a way never seen before”.The document lists some of China's top public health figures among the authors and has been revealed in an upcoming book on the origins of COVID, titled ‘What Really Happened In Wuhan’.China reported the first Covid-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic, affecting more than 157,789,300 people and over 3,285,200 deaths worldwide.Tom Tugendhat MP and Australian politician James Paterson said the document raises major concerns about China's transparency on the origins of Covid-19.Tugendhat, chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, was quoted in ‘The Sun’ as saying: "China’s evident interest in bioweapons is extremely concerning. Even under the tightest controls these weapons are dangerous."This document raises major concerns about the ambitions of some of those who advise the top party leadership.”Peter Jennings, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), told news.com.au that the document is as close to a “smoking gun” as we’ve got.“I think this is significant because it clearly shows that Chinese scientists were thinking about military application for different strains of the coronavirus and thinking about how it could be deployed,” said Jennings.“It begins to firm up the possibility that what we have here is the accidental release of a pathogen for military use,” added Mr Jennings.He also said that the document may explain why China has been so reluctant for outside investigations into the origins of Covid-19.“If this was a case of transmission from a wet market it would be in China’s interest to co-operate … we’ve had the opposite of that.”Questions remain over the origins of the deadly virus after a much derided World Health Organisation (WHO) probe earlier this year, with the organisation ordering a further investigation which factors in the possibly of a lab leak.Most scientists have said there is no evidence that Covid-19 is manmade — but questions remain whether it may have escaped from a biolab in Wuhan — the Chinese region where the pandemic originated.China is known to have been carrying out high risk "gain of function" research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) — which is near the outbreak's ground zero at the Huanan Seafood Market.There is no evidence so far to suggest it was intentionally released by China.Meanwhile, in Beijing, the state-run Global Times newspaper slammed The Australian for publishing the article to smear China.An academic book that explores bioterrorism and possibilities of viruses being used in warfare was interpreted as a conspiracy theory by The Australian, which deliberately and malignantly intends to invent pretexts to smear China, Chen Hong, a professor and director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the newspaper."It is a shame for anti-China forces in Australia to back their own ideology against China at the expense of basic professional journalistic ethics, conspiring to twist the real meaning of the book," Chen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-probed-weaponising-coronaviruses-in-2015-reports-101620579770648.html
09-05-2021||World||Queen's cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, offers to sell access to Putin: Report||An investigative report by British media said Sunday that Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, was willing to use his royal status for personal profit and to seek favors from Russian President Vladimir Putin.The undercover investigation by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 saw reporters posing as investors of a fake South Korean gold company seeking contacts in the Kremlin to further its business in Russia.Prince Michael, 78, allegedly told the reporters by Zoom that he would give their company his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a $200,000-fee. He added that he was happy to use his home in Kensington Palace as a backdrop for the endorsement.The royal’s business partner, Simon Reading, also reportedly told the fake investors that Michael could be hired for 10,000 pounds ($14,000) a day to make “confidential” representations on behalf of the fictitious gold firm, House of Haedong, to Putin.“If he (Prince Michael) is representing the House of Haedong, he could mention that to Putin and Putin would find the right person who is interested in South Korea or interested in gold,” Reading reportedly said. “It just opens the door, you know, which is so helpful.”He went on to describe Michael as “Her Majesty’s unofficial ambassador to Russia”, and that tension between the U.K. and Russia has not affected his relationship with Putin.Responding to the report, Michael’s office said he “has no special relationship with President Putin” and that the two men last met in 2003. The royal “earns his own living through a consultancy company that he has run for over 40 years.”“Lord Reading is a good friend, who in trying to help, made suggestions which Prince Michael would not have wanted, or been able, to fulfill,” his office said.Prince Michael and his wife, Princess Michael of Kent, aren't working royals and receive no public funds, but they are involved in some public duties including representing the queen at some engagements. Michael has represented the queen at state funerals in India, Cyprus and Swaziland in the past, according to the monarchy’s website.His biography said Michael is connected to Russia through his maternal grandmother, and is the first member of Britain’s royal family to learn Russian. He is involved in charity work in Russia and is patron of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce.Reading said he regretted his “over-promise” in trying to facilitate an introduction to Michael.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queens-cousin-prince-michael-of-kent-offers-to-sell-access-to-putin-report-101620578340073.html

Murakhovsky was subsequently promoted to the post of regional health minister.After tense negotiations with the authorities, Navalny was airlifted to Germany from Omsk for further treatment.Laboratory tests in three European countries, confirmed by the global chemical weapons watchdog, established that Navalny had been poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent.The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that Russian authorities tried to kill Navalny. He was jailed in February on what he said were trumped up charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/siberian-doctor-who-treated-kremlin-critic-navalny-goes-missing-police-say-101620577900666.html

Ambassador Sun Weidong said in a string of tweets that the Red Cross Society of China had provided 100 oxygen concentrators, 40 ventilators, other supplies and the cash assistance to the Indian Red Cross Society through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. India has so far rebuffed offers of Covid-19-related assistance from only two countries – Pakistan and China – and the people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the government has no role in transfers of equipment and aid between the Indian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross in another country. “The government has no say in equipment or aid provided by the Chinese Red Cross to the Indian Red Cross. As things stand, there has been no formal response to China’s offer of assistance,” one of the people cited above said. Sun tweeted: “The first batch of 100 oxygen concentrators, 40 ventilators & other anti-epidemic supplies donated by the Red Cross Society of China (#RCSC) arrived in India today by Chinese cargo flight from Chengdu, China.” He added, “RCSC also decided to provide $1 million in cash assistance to the Indian Red Cross Society through International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to help India fight against #Covid-19.” Sun said in another tweet: “Nothing in the world is more precious than people’s lives. The rights to subsistence & development are the basic human rights of paramount importance. Actions of RCSC shine the humanitarian spirit and highlight the purpose of dedication and protection of human life & health.” In recent days, Chinese officials and diplomats have used social media to play up the supply of thousands of oxygen concentrators and other oxygen-related equipment to India by Chinese firms. They have also highlighted that Chinese companies had stepped up the production of such equipment to meet India’s needs. The people pointed out that this equipment was being supplied by Chinese companies under commercial contracts with Indian firms. During a phone conversation with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on April 30, external affairs minister S Jaishankar emphasised the importance of China’s transport corridors and cargo flights remaining open to facilitate the movement of materials needed for India’s Covid-19 response. Even before the devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections hit India, officials had insisted that ending the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector is a prerequisite for restoring normal bilateral ties in all other spheres. The officials had also made it clear that relations could move forward in other spheres only after disengagement and de-escalation on the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-envoy-announces-rollout-of-covid-19-support-for-india-through-red-cross-101620577574501.html

The task now is to continue building confidence in vaccines and get enough Americans vaccinated to mitigate the spread of the virus and its variants, he said.U.S. health officials are aiming to meet President Joe Biden's goal of 70% of American adults having at least one shot by the July 4 U.S. Independence Day.Zients said reaching that goal could help the country reach a sustainable low level of infections.About 46% of all Americans have received at least one coronavirus vaccine shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Graphic on global vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/3tUM8taDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said another surge in coronavirus infections would be unlikely if the Biden goal is met or exceeded."The larger proportion of the population that's vaccinated, the less likelihood that in a season like the coming fall or winter you're going to see a significant surge," Fauci said on NBC' "Meet the Press.""That's the reason why vaccinations are so important. That's the wild card that we have now that we didn't have last fall or the last winter."Zients defended the latest masking guidelines from the CDC, which recommends that fully vaccinated people should still wear masks at crowded outdoor events or when they go indoors in public settings with other people who may not be vaccinated.Some health experts have questioned whether the CDC guidelines are too strict, and that removing the indoor mask mandate for fully vaccinated people could encourage confidence in the vaccines. That move would not, however, protect unvaccinated people from contracting the virus from a carrier who has been vaccinated.The CDC guidelines will over time allow more people to take off their masks, Zients said, while acknowledging Americans' mask fatigue."We're getting there," Zients said. "And the light at the end of the tunnel is brighter and brighter. Let's keep up our guard."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-turning-corner-on-pandemic-says-white-house-covid-19-coordinator-101620576349515.html
09-05-2021||World||Facebook rules are ‘shambles,’ oversight board co-chairman says||Facebook Inc.’s internal rules for banning content are a “shambles,” and the company needs to fix the process to have credibility in enforcing them, a member of the social media giant’s independent content oversight board said.The comments by Michael McConnell, the panel’s co-chairman, follow its decision last week to leave in place a ban on former President Donald Trump for his posts surrounding the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters on Jan. 6.“Their rules are a shambles,” McConnell said on “Fox News Sunday.” “They are not transparent. They are unclear. They are internally inconsistent.”“We gave them a series of recommendations about how to make their rules clearer and more consistent,” McConnell said. “The hope is that they will use the next few months to do that and then, when they come back and look at this, they will be able to apply those rules in a straightforward way.”Facebook upheld its ban on Trump for six months. The company suspended his account after Trump encouraged his supporters to storm the Capitol in what became a deadly attempt to stop the counting of Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden. The ban was originally temporary, but was changed to an indefinite suspension the following day.‘Egging On’McConnell also said Trump’s posts were a “plain violation of Facebook’s rules” against praising dangerous individuals and organizations during a time of violence.During the Jan. 6 riot, Trump “issued these statements which were just egging on -- with perfunctory asking for peace, but mostly, he was just egging them on to continue,” McConnell said.Members of both parties in Congress have called for breaking up large tech companies, arguing that they exert monopolistic power on the marketplace, censor certain voices, and hold back innovation. Conservatives, including Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, have called for breaking up Facebook over Trump’s ban.Private CompanyMcConnell, a constitutional law professor at Stanford University and former federal judge, dismissed concerns that Facebook was violating Trump’s First Amendment rights by leaving the ban in place, saying the social media giant is a private company.“He’s a customer,” McConnell said. “Facebook is not a government and he is not a citizen of Facebook.”A lack of consistency and transparency around Facebook’s content rules do, though, contribute to questions about bias and unfairness, he said.“Fairness and consistency are absolute bedrocks of freedom of expression rules,” McConnell said. “If Facebook simply let Mr. Trump off the hook completely, it would not be equal treatment of everyone because all users of the platform are subject to the same set of rules, and that includes Mr. Trump.”McConnell dismissed concerns from Hawley and others that he and other members of the oversight board are “toadies” for Facebook because the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg appointed them.“I’ve gotten to know these 20 people around the world and the danger that they are toadies for Facebook is just about zero,” McConnell said, referring to the other members of the board. “Many of them have spent their careers criticizing Facebook. We are not beholden to Facebook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-rules-are-shambles-oversight-board-co-chairman-says-101620576002835.html
09-05-2021||World||Palestinians fear loss of family homes as evictions loom||When Samira Dajani's family moved into their first real home in 1956 after years as refugees, her father planted trees in the garden, naming them for each of his six children.Today, two towering pines named for Mousa and Daoud stand watch over the entrance to the garden where they all played as children. Pink bougainvillea climbs an iron archway on a path leading past almond, orange and lemon trees to their modest stone house.“The Samira tree has no leaves,” she says, pointing to the cypress that bears her name. “But the roots are strong.”She and her husband, empty nesters with grown children of their own, may have to leave it all behind on Aug. 1. That's when Israel is set to forcibly evict them following a decades-long legal battle waged by ideological Jewish settlers against them and their neighbors.The Dajanis are one of several Palestinian families facing imminent eviction in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of east Jerusalem. The families' plight has ignited weeks of demonstrations and clashes in recent days between protesters and Israeli police.It also highlights an array of discriminatory polices that rights groups say are aimed at pushing Palestinians out of Jerusalem to preserve its Jewish majority. The Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the New York-based Human Rights Watch both pointed to such policies as an example of what they say has become an apartheid regime.Israel rejects those accusations and says the situation in Sheikh Jarrah is a private real-estate dispute that the Palestinians have seized upon to incite violence. The Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions submitted by The Associated Press. A top municipal official and a settler group marketing “residential plots” in Sheikh Jarrah did not respond to requests for comment.Settler groups say the land was owned by Jews prior to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israeli law allows Jews to reclaim such lands but bars Palestinians from recovering property they lost in the same war, even if they still reside in areas controlled by Israel.Samira Dajani's parents fled in 1948 from their home in Baka — now an upscale neighborhood in mostly Jewish west Jerusalem. After several years spent as refugees in Jordan, Syria and east Jerusalem, which was then controlled by Jordan, Jordanian authorities offered them one of several newly built homes in Sheikh Jarrah in exchange for giving up their refugee status.“I have beautiful memories from this house," says Dajani, now 70, recalling how she played with the other children in the close-knit neighborhood, where several other Palestinian refugee families had also been resettled. “It was like heaven after our exodus."Things changed after Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Mideast war, and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view east Jerusalem as their capital.In 1972, settler groups told the families that they were trespassing on Jewish-owned land. That was the start of a long legal battle that in recent months has culminated with eviction orders against 36 families in Sheikh Jarrah and two other east Jerusalem neighborhoods. Israeli rights groups say other families are also vulnerable, estimating that more than 1,000 Palestinians are at risk of being evicted.The Dajanis and other families have been ordered to leave by Aug. 1. A Supreme Court hearing in the case of another four families that was to be held on Monday was postponed for at least a month. If they lose the appeal, they could be forcibly evicted within days or weeks.A woman from another family in Sheikh Jarrah said it was “an inhumane act” to take away someone's home. She invited her parents to move in with her and her husband if they are evicted from the home where she was born and raised, but her father refused.“He said there is no way I’m leaving this neighborhood unless I’m dead," she said, requesting anonymity for fear of retribution by Israeli authorities. "It’s been 65 years that he’s lived in this neighborhood.”Israel views all of Jerusalem as its unified capital and says residents are treated equally. But east Jerusalem residents have different rights depending on whether they are Jewish or Palestinian.Jews born in east Jerusalem are automatically granted Israeli citizenship, and Jews from anywhere else in the world are eligible to become Israeli citizens.Palestinians born in east Jerusalem are granted a form of permanent residency that can be revoked if they spend too much time living outside the city. They can apply for Israeli citizenship but must go through a difficult and uncertain bureaucratic process that can take months or years. Most refuse, because they do not recognize Israel's annexation.Palestinians are also treated differently when it comes to housing, which will make it difficult for the Sheikh Jarrah families to remain in Jerusalem if they are evicted.After 1967, Israel expanded the city’s municipal boundaries to take in large areas of open land where it has since built Jewish settlements that are home to tens of thousands of people. At the same time, it set the boundaries of Palestinian neighborhoods, restricting their growth.Today, more than 220,000 Jews live in east Jerusalem, mostly in built-up areas that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Most of east Jerusalem’s 350,000 Palestinian residents are crammed into overcrowded neighborhoods where there is little room to build.Palestinians say the expense and difficulty of obtaining permits forces them to build illegally or move to the occupied West Bank, where they risk losing their Jerusalem residency. Israeli rights groups estimate that of the 40,000 homes in Palestinian neighborhoods, half have been built without permits and are at risk of demolition.In part due to the protests, Israel has come under international pressure over Sheikh Jarrah, with both the United States and the European Union expressing concern. Rights groups say the government can halt or postpone the evictions if it wants to.In the meantime, Samira Dajani has planted her spring flowers in small pots that she'll be able to take with her if she is forced from her home in August. The trees named for her and her siblings will have to stay. She says she tries not to think about it.“I don’t feel sad or scared, I feel angry," she said. “God willing, these will not be our last days here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-fear-loss-of-family-homes-as-evictions-loom-101620575720940.html

Biden and the first lady also recorded remarks for the event, as did Pope Francis.The wider use of walk-in clinics or pharmacies is another major strategy to “get that last group of people who seem to be recalcitrant,” Fauci said, by making the process easier.Looking ahead, if the U.S. reaches Biden’s current goal of 70% or more people having at least one shot by July 4, “you may see blips, but if we handle them well, it is unlikely that you’ll see the kind of surge that we saw in the late fall and the early winter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-doubt-us-has-undercounted-its-covid-19-deaths-anthony-fauci-101620572340044.html

Here’s the list||The British government on Friday released new guidance on travel restrictions as the country approaches the third phase of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown. The United Kingdom announced a new “green list” of countries and territories where people will be allowed to travel from May 17 without having to quarantine on their return.Britain has classified countries in three categories - green, amber and red. The classification is partly based on the Covid-19 situation in those countries and the success of their vaccine rollout. India continues to be on the UK’s red list as it is witnessing a deadly second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Individuals who have been in a country or territory placed on the red list in the last 10 days will be allowed to enter Britain only if they have British or Irish nationality, or have residence rights in the UK but only on the condition of mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Others will be refused entry to the UK.Also Read | Covid-19: Canada closely looking at UK move to place India on ‘red list’People arriving from amber list countries or territories will have to quarantine at home or at the place of their stay for 10 days.

"We need to deploy stronger measures to curb the outbreak."If the outbreak spread nationwide, it would affect political stability, people's health and the National Assembly and People's Council elections, and the consequence would be unpredictable."Chinh said coronavirus infections in neighbouring countries has put pressure on Vietnam, adding that illegal immigrants were among the prime sources of the virus.Of the 102 new cases, 92 were transmitted locally, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-says-new-covid-19-outbreak-threatens-stability-101620570659487.html

We'll see what will happen next,” Thierry Breton told French radio France Inter.The announcement comes one day after the European Union cemented its support for Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine by agreeing to a massive contract extension for a potential 1.8 billion doses through 2023.Two weeks ago, the EU launched legal proceedings against AstraZeneca for allegedly failing to respect the terms of its contract with the 27-nation bloc.The AstraZeneca vaccine had been central to Europe's immunization campaign and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries since it is cheaper and easier to use than the Pfizer vaccine. But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and they have held the company responsible for partly delaying their vaccine rollout.Across the Channel, Britain has made the AstraZeneca vaccine the centerpiece of its successful vaccination campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-doesn-t-renew-order-for-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101620567333394.html

As per the doctors, she has now tested negative for the infection and is recovering at a hospital here."There is no judicial provision that permits a jailed convict to go abroad for treatment," Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told a news briefing on Sunday, hours after the Law Ministry turned down a petition on her behalf seeking permission to fly abroad for further treatment.Officials said the Law Ministry reviewed the legal scope and barriers for Zia's visit abroad and sent its opinion to the minister.The government officially turned down the application after Zia's doctors said she had tested negative for the virus."The third phase test has found her COVID-19 negative but she is now in hospital for post COVID-19 treatments," said Zia's doctor and BNP vice chairman AZM Zahid Hossain.Doctors close to the family said uncontrolled diabetes and arthritis had complicated the former prime minister's treatment."It is a matter of hope that she is showing a sign of progress, though her health condition requires her to stay in CCU (critical care unit) of the hospital," said BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir."You know she is suffering from different ailments many of which aggravated due to her imprisonment and age," he added.Zia tested positive for coronavirus on April 11 and was admitted to a private hospital on April 27 after she had trouble breathing. She was shifted to the hospital's critical care unit on May 3.On May 6, Zia's younger brother Shamim Eskandar met the home minister seeking permission for Zia's treatment abroad. The application was forwarded to the Law Ministry.Zia is serving a 17-year prison term in two graft cases since February 8, 2018.She was sent to jail by a local court on charges of embezzling foreign donations meant for an orphanage, named after her slain husband and president Ziaur Rehman, during her premiership between 2001 and 2006.Rehman, a military ruler-turned-politician, was the founder of the BNP.She was convicted in another corruption case later the same year, though her party claims both cases are politically motivated.In March 2020, Zia was released from jail for six months on condition that she would stay at home, amid the coronavirus outbreak. In March, the Bangladesh government extended the suspension of the sentence for a second time by six months.Zia has served thrice as the premier of Bangladesh since 1991. Her party suffered a miserable defeat in the 2018 elections bagging only six seats in the 300-seat parliament.Her conviction on "moral turpitude" charges de-barred her from contesting the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-turns-down-jailed-former-pm-khaleda-zia-s-request-to-fly-abroad-101620566495339.html
09-05-2021||World||Saudi Arabia backs India-Pakistan dialogue to resolve issues such as Kashmir||Saudi Arabia has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to observe a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and backed a dialogue between the South Asian rivals to address all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir dispute. The kingdom’s position was articulated in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia late on Saturday after a meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. It came against the backdrop of speculation about the role being played by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to foster dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad. Khan was on an official visit to Saudi Arabia during May 7-9. Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa too visited Saudi Arabia last week. Both Bajwa and Khan held meetings with the Saudi crown prince and the talks were seen as part of Pakistan’s efforts to normalise strained relations with Saudi Arabia. The joint statement said the Saudi crown prince “welcomed the recent understanding reached between the military authorities of Pakistan and India regarding ceasefire at the Line of Control (LoC), which is based on a 2003 understanding between Pakistan and India”. It added that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan “emphasised the importance of dialogue between Pakistan and India to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries, especially Jammu and Kashmir dispute, to ensure peace and stability in the region”. However, a readout issued by the Saudi side on the meeting between Khan and the crown prince made no mention of India or the Kashmir issue. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the joint statement. There has been speculation about the role played by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan since the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing, which triggered a tense military standoff. The UAE envoy to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, confirmed last month that his country played a role in bringing together India and Pakistan for talks aimed at calming tensions over the Kashmir issue and getting bilateral ties “back to a healthy level”. It is understood that senior Indian and Pakistani security officials have met in London and Dubai for secret talks in recent months. The surprise decision by the Indian and Pakistani armies to recommit themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC from February 25 is seen as the outcome of these contacts. During the Pakistani prime minister’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the two sides reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation and discussed regional and international issues. They agreed to intensify contacts and cooperation between government officials and the private sector, and the crown prince assured Khan of Saudi Arabia’s continued support for his vision to transform Pakistan into a modern welfare state. Both sides also expressed satisfaction at cooperation in military and security ties, and agreed to augment collaboration to achieve mutually agreed goals, the joint statement said. The two sides said an “inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement” is the only way forward in Afghanistan. They also signed several agreements on establishing a Saudi-Pakistan Supreme Coordination Council, combating illicit trafficking in narcotics and drugs and financing projects in energy, hydropower, infrastructure and transport and communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-backs-india-pakistan-dialogue-to-resolve-issues-such-as-kashmir-101620569834268.html

The Nepalese government, starved of tourism revenue, has yet to cancel the spring climbing season, usually from April to early June before the monsoon rains.It was not immediately clear how the line would be enforced on the summit, a tiny, perilous and inhospitable area the size of a dining table.A small team of Tibetan climbing guides will ascend Everest and set up the "line of separation" at the summit to stop any contact between mountaineers from both sides of the peak, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the head of Tibet's sports bureau.A group of 21 Chinese nationals are en route to the summit on the Tibetan side, Xinhua reported.The Tibetan guides will set up the separation line ahead of their arrival, the state-run news agency said, without describing what the line would look like.It was also unclear whether the Tibetan guides would be the ones enforcing the "separation", or whether they would remain in the so-called death zone, where many lives have been lost due to a dearth of oxygen, to hold the line.The top of the 8,848-metre peak is a small mound of snow with barely enough space for half a dozen climbers and guides at any one time.China has not allowed any foreign climbers to ascend from the Tibetan side since the outbreak of the new coronavirus last year due to infection concerns.Tourists in the Everest scenic area in Tibet are also banned from visiting the base camp on the Tibetan side.Mainland China on Sunday reported 12 new Covid-19 cases on May 8 - all of which involved travellers arriving from overseas - up from seven a day earlier. Nepal reported 9,023 new cases on Friday, the country's biggest one-day increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-create-line-of-separation-at-mount-everest-summit-on-covid-19-fears-101620566113157.html
09-05-2021||World||Florida weighs allowing limited harvest of goliath grouper||Florida may lift its three-decade ban on catching and killing goliath grouper. Wildlife officials say the coastal fish's numbers have recovered sufficiently from near-extinction to allow a limited harvest, but the proposal is strongly opposed by environmentalists who say it is still at risk.On Wednesday, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will consider a staff proposal to allow 100 goliaths to be caught and kept annually during a four-year period. Supported by fishing groups, the proposal calls for a lottery to issue $300-per-week licenses that allow each recipient to catch and kill one goliath, with proceeds funding research of the species.The goliath almost died off in the 1980s from overfishing and pollution and is not allowed to be caught in any other state or federal waters.The fish is a favorite of underwater photographers for its docile demeanor and mammoth size — adults typically weigh 400 pounds (180 kilograms) but can exceed 800 (360 kilograms). While the species' population is unknown, state officials believe it has grown enough to allow the limited catch.“Goliath is a recovering stock, becoming more abundant in parts of Florida, especially on artificial reefs,” the commission staff wrote in its recommendation.That's a contention disputed by those who oppose lifting the fishing ban. They point to major die-offs over the past decade from cold weather and other causes.“The (wildlife commission) claims the population is growing, but that is just not possible,” said Christopher Koenig, who along with his wife, Felicia Coleman, has studied goliaths for almost 30 years. Koenig and Coleman are both retired marine biologists with Florida State University.Coleman also points out that the goliath contains high levels of the neurotoxin methylmercury, making it dangerous to eat, particularly for children and pregnant women.“Why would you open? You are endangering people,” she said.The goliath once ranged over a wide swath of ocean territory, from the Carolinas to the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, but its numbers dropped sharply starting in the 1960s. By 1990, when Florida banned its catch, it was almost gone.First, it was overfished — the goliath is easy to catch, living in known locations and spawning at specific spots. Florida’s proposal would prohibit catching the fish at spawning sites and during spawning season, which lasts from July to September.Also, the goliath's first six years are spent hiding among mangroves, trees that grow in shallow coastal waters. Many mangroves have been lost to development and pollution, limiting where juveniles can grow.Today, the goliath is found mainly off South Florida. Adults live in reefs and shipwrecks, digging holes that provide hiding spaces for other fish.A limited harvest “would provide a unique recreational fishing opportunity in Florida,” the wildlife commission staff wrote. In 2018, the commission, which then had five of its current members, pushed aside a similar proposal.The proposal limits the size of goliaths that could be killed to a range of 4 to 6.5 feet (1.2 to 2 meters) and 70 to 200 pounds (32 to 90 kilograms) — that’s a young adult of 7 to 10 years. Outside that range they would be released, just like all goliaths caught now are supposed to be, though poaching is a problem. Goliaths have a lifespan of 35 years or more.Coastal Conservation Association Florida, a recreational fishing group, believes the goliath's numbers can handle the limited catch, said Trip Aukeman, its advocacy director.“The fishery looks healthy and there should be some kind of harvest open to recreational fishermen,” Aukeman said. A limited catch would provide scientists with samples to ascertain the species' health, he said.Some fishermen also argue a large goliath population depletes snappers and other game fish, but Koenig and Coleman disagree, saying goliaths primarily eat crabs and less-prized fish.Aukeman agrees methylmercury is an issue, saying his group advocates lowering the minimum and maximum size at which the goliath can be kept. Those younger fish would be less likely to be toxic and could be eaten.“I don’t believe they should be caught just to get a picture — they need to be used,” Aukeman said.But Koenig and Coleman say the goliath's future is too precarious to allow any harvest.They argue that the fish's numbers remain below historic levels and appear to be plateauing or decreasing, and that it is susceptible to mass die-offs. One danger is that juveniles under 6 years are vulnerable to frigid weather — Koenig and Coleman say a prolonged cold snap that hit South Florida in 2010 killed 95% of that age group.All ages are susceptible to red tide, a toxic algae bloom that spreads over massive areas. Outbreaks occur naturally but are also spurred by fertilizer runoff and sewage.Harvest opponents say instead of catching goliaths, Florida should use the fish to lure scuba divers to the state. A 2016 University of Miami survey of out-of-state divers showed they would pay more than $300 for an outing to a goliath congregation site, not including what they would spend for hotels, restaurants and other area establishments.Gerald Carroll, who owns a Palm Beach County dive center, said trips to see goliaths account for 25% of his revenue. They are popular with divers because they don't flee, and with guides because they stay at the same reefs and wrecks.“It is very easy for us to arrange trips to go see them, and when we jump in the water, even if there are 10 or 15 divers, they don't get scared away,” Carroll said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-weighs-allowing-limited-harvest-of-goliath-grouper-101620564468077.html

But this YouTube prankster got nearly 50,000 votes just for ‘vibes’||Labour Party candidate Sadiq Khan was re-elected as Mayor of London on Saturday after beating Conservative rival Shaun Bailey in a close contest. Khan, son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, won 55.2% of the popular vote but only after entering a run-off with Bailey as neither of them managed to get a majority in the first round of voting.While Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of England’s capital, was seen as the favourite throughout the campaign, the highlight of the day was a British YouTube prankster who received nearly 50,000 votes. Niko Omilana, best known for comedy videos and pranks on YouTube, secured 2% of the total votes polled, pushing actor Laurence Fox to sixth place.Omilana, a self-proclaimed Supreme Leader of the Niko Defence League (NDL), had released a manifesto in which he promised that the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be “forced to shush”. The manifesto included pledges to employ more policemen for parliament “where all the real criminals are” and ban Prince Andrew, who came under scrutiny for his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, from going “within 4 mile radius of any school”.“Anyone who clapped for the NHS but still voted Conservative will be forced to participate in an annual purge,” the manifesto posted on Omilana’s Twitter account reads.

The SCA also offered payment terms to owners of the Ever Given container ship but they have yet to respond, he said.An Egyptian court granted the Suez Canal Authority’s request for the seizure of the vessel in mid-April as compensation talks dragged on. The blockage roiled shipping markets because hundreds of vessels had to wait for the canal -- which can shave two weeks off a journey between Asia and Europe -- to reopen.The canal authority has said compensation is needed to cover losses of transit fees, damage to the waterway during the dredging and salvage efforts, and for the cost of equipment and labor.The 400-meter-long Ever Given is owned by Japan’s Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and was being chartered by Taiwan’s Evergreen Line when it got stuck in the southern end of the canal for six days.Egypt Suez Canal revenue increased by 2.8% in the first four months of 2021 to $1.96 billion compared with with $1.9 billion a year earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-offers-to-cut-compensation-claim-for-blocking-of-suez-canal-101620558641129.html
09-05-2021||World||Putin reviews Russian military might as tensions with West soar||President Vladimir Putin reviewed Russia's traditional World War Two victory parade on Sunday, a patriotic display of raw military power that this year coincides with soaring tensions with the West.The parade on Moscow's Red Square commemorating the 76th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two featured over 12,000 troops and more than 190 pieces of military hardware, including intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, and a fly-past by nearly 80 military aircraft under cloudy skies.Putin, who has been in power as either president or prime minister since 1999, stood beside Soviet war veterans on a review platform set up on Red Square."Unfortunately there are once again attempts to deploy many things from the ideology of the Nazis, those who were obsessed with a delusional theory on their exclusiveness. And not only (by) all sorts of radicals and international terrorist groups," Putin said in what appeared to be a common denunciation of the West but what the Kremlin said was aimed at the rise of neo-Nazism in Europe."Russia will again and again uphold international law, but at the same time we will firmly protect national interests (and) ensure the security of our people."This year's parade precedes parliamentary elections in September and comes at a time when Moscow's relations with the West are acutely strained over issues ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to the fate of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.The United States and Russia have expelled each other's diplomats in recent months in a series of retaliatory moves and Moscow and EU member states have been involved in a similar tit-for-tat diplomatic dispute.Sunday's parade follows a massive show of Russian military force near the borders of Ukraine and in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Kyiv in 2014, and an uptick in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces.Moscow said the build-up, which alarmed the West, was a training exercise in response to activity by the NATO military alliance and Ukraine. It has since ordered a withdrawal of some troops.Smaller military parades took place on Sunday in cities across Russia and in annexed Crimea, and at Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-reviews-russian-military-might-as-tensions-with-west-soar-101620562245644.html

09-05-2021||World||Chinese rocket debris falls into Indian Ocean||The remains of a Chinese rocket crashed into the Indian Ocean on Sunday with much of the debris burning up during the re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere, China’s space agency said.The coordinates, cited by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and shared by official news agency, Xinhua, pointed to the location of the impact near the Maldives islands.“The debris of the last stage of the Long March-5B Y2 carrier rocket re-entered the atmosphere at 10.24 a.m. on Sunday (Beijing Time),” Xinhua reported, adding: “The vast majority of the device burned up during the re-entry, and the rest of the debris fell into a sea area with the centre at 2.65 degrees north latitude and 72.47 degrees east longitude.”The Long March-5B Y2 rocket, carrying the Tianhe module, the first and core module for the construction of China’s space station, launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the coast of the southern island province of Hainan on April 29.The re-entry of the debris of the Chinese rocket into the earth’s atmosphere drew strong criticism from Nasa, which said China was failing to “meet responsible standards”.“Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximise transparency regarding those operations,” Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement released on the space agency’s website on Sunday.“China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris,” he added.Chinese state media dismissed the criticism, saying the so-called “uncontrolled re-entry” of China’s rocket debris a groundless, false accusation.Quoting observers, the Global Times said it is “completely normal for rocket debris to return to Earth and has been a common practice carried out by global participants in the aerospace field, including China and the US”.“It is common practice across the world for upper stages of rockets to burn up while reentering the atmosphere,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told a regular media briefing on May 7.“To my knowledge, the upper stage of this rocket has been deactivated, which means most of its parts will burn up upon re-entry, making the likelihood of damage to aviation or ground facilities and activities extremely low,” Wang said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-rocket-debris-falls-into-indian-ocean-101620560773461.html
09-05-2021||World||CDC limits reviews of vaccinated individuals infected with Covid-19, spurring concerns||Federal health officials this month decided to limit how they monitor vaccinated people who have been infected with Covid-19, drawing concern from some scientists who say that may mean missing needed data showing why and how it happens.At the end of April, more than 9,000 Americans were reported to be infected after being vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While that’s a tiny percentage of the 95 million people fully inoculated at the time, researchers still want to find out what specific mechanisms may be spurring the infections.Rare breakthrough cases are expected since no vaccines are 100% effective. But tracking and sequencing the cases helps in figuring out who may be more at risk, whether new variants evade the vaccines and when protection from the shots begins to wane. At the same time, those infected -- some of whom are suffering widespread medical issues, even if they’re not hospitalized -- say they feel lost as a result of the lack of information.“We shouldn’t be narrowing the focus, we should be broadening and develop a systematic plan,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla.At the start of May, the CDC shifted from monitoring all reported breakthroughs to only those that result in hospitalization or death, Tom Clark, head of the vaccine evaluation unit for the CDC’s vaccine task force, said in an interview. The goal of the new strategy, according to the agency: maximize the quality of data collected on cases.The CDC made the shift because the data collected so far on breakthroughs don’t show worrying patterns, suggesting the focus should be on the most severe cases, Clark said. He added that the agency has planned other vaccine studies, including one with a network of health centers, to compare disease severity and frequency of variant infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.“I don’t think we’re missing out on this data,” Clark said. “It’s just sort of a package of how we’re looking at these questions.”Michael Kinch, a former drug developer who’s now associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis, says as much information as possible should be recorded on breakthroughs. Cases that don’t rise to hospitalization are still important to track, he said, since symptoms that aren’t as severe for someone could eventually lead to hospitalizations. Non-life-threatening symptoms can impact someone’s life greatly, and evolve over time, Kinch said.“It’s essential that we stay on top of this,” he added. “If we let our guard our down, we will pay the price.”Huge PriceIn late March, several days after she began feeling headaches and light-headedness, Melissa Muldoon, a 35-year-old resident of Buffalo, New York, went on a run and lost consciousness.Muldoon was taken to an emergency room, where she took a Covid-19 test, she said in an interview. The next day, it came back positive more than a month after she had been fully vaccinated. A week later, she began developing new symptoms, she said, including a loss of smell for certain foods, a racing heart and muscle twitches.She said some health professionals questioned how much of a role Covid played, given she was inoculated. But Muldoon wonders how it could be anything else given the quick onset and combination of symptoms.“I’m anxious about what happens if there’s no answer,” she said, “and it just keeps up with random problems or strange things happening with my body that I haven’t experienced before.”What’s KnownWhat’s known so far about breakthroughs is encouraging for the vaccination effort, scientists say, with current research indicating that people in breakthrough cases tend to be either asymptomatic or to have only mild symptoms. Scientists have also detected infectees that don’t spread Covid to others. But little else is known. Clinical trials weren’t designed to study how the vaccines perform in specific subgroups and people with certain medical conditions weren’t included, said Lee Harrison, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh.At a more granular level, the specific mechanisms that explain how breakthroughs occur should be further investigated, said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. The conventional thinking is that those who mount less of a response to vaccines would be more susceptible to getting breakthroughs infections, he said. But Greninger said he’s seen a few cases where people developed strong immune responses to the vaccines, yet still got infected.Link to VariantsScientists are also trying to figure out whether a disproportionate number of breakthroughs are linked to variants. However, studying all this is difficult given that number of cases is small and some may not be detected at all since many are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, said Stefan Green, co-principal investigator at the Regional Innovative Public Health Laboratory at Rush University.Green said he’s also seen in a few cases that viral loads are too low to conduct whole genome sequencing on, similar to what some other researchers have found.Breana Landon, a 23-year-old Utah resident, has also been experiencing ongoing symptoms.Landon tested positive for Covid in late March after being fully vaccinated, she said. It was her second time testing positive. In the first time she was infected last fall, before getting vaccinated, she had respiratory problems that developed into pneumonia. This time, she experienced a whole new set of symptoms, including persisting heart palpitations and pain.‘Dead End’“I feel a little lost, almost, kind of at a dead end,” Landon said in an interview. She recognized it’s possible she never fully recovered from the first round of Covid, but she had gotten multiple negative tests before she tested positive again.When she called with her local health department, they told her she probably got infected with a variant but didn’t ask further, she said. “They didn’t want to do a PCR test, do any sequencing on it or research it further, which made me feel even more at a dead end,” Landon said. “I mean, isn’t this something we want to look into? We’re in the middle of a pandemic, and don’t we want to research this and find out what’s going on?”Jenny Johnson, a public information officer at the Utah Department of Health, said the agency encourages people to get the appropriate PCR testing within 48 hours of a positive rapid test. Tracking down samples for sequencing is challenging since they’re taken from PCR tests, which is up to the individual to take, she said.Treading CarefullyThose who experience breakthroughs also feel like they must tread carefully even when talking about their experiences.Muldoon posted about her situation on Facebook because she wanted to hear from others with similar symptoms. But she said, “I felt conflicted talking about it because I don’t want it to seem like I’m encouraging people not to get vaccinated.”Peyton Azar felt similarly about her breakthrough experience. The 21-year-old is on immunosuppressants for a kidney transplant and has had to go to the emergency room for the common cold before, she said. Yet when she got Covid after vaccination in early April, she felt only mild cold-like symptoms.She’s always appreciated vaccines in general, she said. “I think getting Covid with the vaccine and seeing how mild it was, I appreciate it even more.”Even then, “I’ve been scared that someone will take this information and be like, ‘oh well I heard of a girl who got Covid even after she got vaccinated, so the vaccines don’t work.’ ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-limits-reviews-of-vaccinated-individuals-infected-with-covid-19-spurring-concerns-101620558894009.html
09-05-2021||World||Death toll soars to 50 in school bombing in Afghanistan's capital Kabul||Grieving families buried their dead Sunday following a horrific bombing at a girls’ school in the Afghan capital that killed 50 people, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old.The number of wounded in Saturday's attack climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian. In the western neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, families buried their dead amid angry recriminations at a government they said has failed to protect them amid repeated attacks in the mostly Shiite Muslim neighborhood.“The government reacts after the incident, it doesn’t do anything before the incident,” said Mohammad Baqir, Alizada, 41, who had gathered to bury his niece, Latifa, a Grade 11 student the Syed Al-Shahda school.Three explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, said Arian. The blasts targeted Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack and the many deaths.The first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise.In the capital rattled by relentless bombings, Saturday's attack was among the worst. Criticism has mounted over lack of security and growing fears of even more violence as the U.S. and NATO complete their final military withdrawal from Afghanistan.The Dasht-e-Barchi area has been hit by several incidents of violence targeting minority Shiites and most often claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in the country. No one has yet claimed Saturday’s bombings.In this same neighborhood in 2018, a school bombing killed 34 people, mostly students. In September 2018 a wrestling club was attacked killing 24 people and in May 2020 a maternity hospital was brutally attacked killing 24 people, including pregnant women and infants. And in October 2020, the Kawsar-e-Danish tutoring center was attacked, killing 30 people.Most of the attacks were claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in Afghanistan.The radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan’s Shiites. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.Soon after the bombing, angry crowds attacked ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He had implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.Arian, the Interior Ministry spokesman, blamed the attack on the Taliban despite their denials.Bloodied backpacks and schools books lay strewn outside the Syed Al-Shahda school. In the morning, boys attend classes in the sprawling school compound and in the afternoon, it's girls' turn.On Sunday, Hazara leaders from Dasht-e- Barchi met to express their frustration with the government failure to protect ethnic Hazaras, deciding to cobble together a protection force of their own from among the Hazara community.The force would be deployed outside schools, mosques and public facilities and would cooperate with government security forces. The intention is to supplement the local forces, said Parliamentarian Ghulam Hussein Naseri.The meeting participants decided that “there is not any other way, except for people themselves to provide their own security alongside of the security forces,” said Naseri, who added that the government should provide local Hazaras with weapons.Naseri said Hazaras have been attacked in their schools, in their mosques and “it is their right to be upset. How many more families lose their loved ones? How many more attacks against this minority has to occur in this part of the city before something is done?"One of the students fleeing the school recalled the attack, the girls' screams of the girls, the blood.“I was with my classmate, we were leaving the school, when suddenly an explosion happened, “ said 15-year-old Zahra, whose arm had been broken by a piece of shrapnel.“Ten minutes later there was another explosion and just a couple of minutes later another explosion,” she said. “Everyone was yelling and there was blood everywhere, and I couldn’t see anything clearly.” Her friend died.Most of the dozens of injured brought to the EMERGENCY Hospital for war wounded in the Afghan capital, “almost all girls and young women between 12 and 20 years old,” said Marco Puntin, the hospital's programme coordinator in Afghanistan.In a statement following the attack, the hospital, which has operated in Kabul since 2000 said the first three months of this year has seen a 21 per cent increase in war-wounded.Even as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.The attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.The top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some “bad possible outcomes” against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-soars-to-50-in-school-bombing-in-afghan-capital-101620559367195.html

Although it fell one seat short of securing an overall majority, the parliament still had a pro-independence majority with the help of eight members of the Scottish Greens.Sturgeon said her immediate priority would be steering Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic. But she said an independence referendum was “now a matter of fundamental democratic principle.”Johnson has the ultimate authority whether or not to permit another referendum on Scotland gaining independence. He wrote in Saturday’s Daily Telegraph that another referendum on Scotland would be “irresponsible and reckless” as Britain emerges from the pandemic. He has consistently argued that the issue was settled in a 2014 referendum where 55% of Scottish voters favored remaining part of the U.K.Proponents of another vote say the situation has changed fundamentally because of the U.K's Brexit divorce from the European Union, with Scotland taken out of the EU against its will. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 52% of U.K. voters backed leaving the EU but 62% of Scots voted to remain.When asked about the prospect of Johnson agreeing to a second Scottish referendum, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Sunday “it’s not an issue for the moment” and that the national priority is on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.“If we get sucked into a conversation about referenda and constitutions then we are diverting attention from the issues that are most important to the people in Scotland and across the United Kingdom,” Gove told Sky News.“Instead of concentrating on the things that divide, let’s concentrate on the things that unite," he added.The Scotland results have been the main focus of Thursday's array of local elections across Britain. In Wales, the opposition Labour Party did better than expected, extending its 22 years at the helm of the Welsh government despite falling one seat short of a majority.Labour's support also held up in some big cities. In London, Mayor Sadiq Khan handily won a second term. Other winning Labour mayoral candidates included Steve Rotherham in the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Dan Norris in the West of England region, which includes Bristol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-calls-for-uk-talks-after-scottish-nationalists-win-101620555391268.html

Thursday's blast targeted Mohamed Nasheed, currently the speaker of Parliament, who is recovering in a hospital after multiple surgeries.Police did not give details on the latest suspect or his background, but in a text message confirmed that they believe he is the person whose pictures were released Saturday as authorities sought public assistance identifying him. The fourth suspect remains at large.Officials blamed Islamic extremists for the attack, although investigators still don’t know which group was responsible. Two of Nasheed’s bodyguards and two apparent bystanders, including a British citizen, were also wounded.Nasheed has been an outspoken critic of religious extremism in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, where preaching and practicing other faiths are banned by law. He has been criticized by religious hard-liners for his closeness to the West and liberal policies.Hospital officials said Nasheed, 53, remains in an intensive care unit after initial life-saving surgeries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs. A relative tweeted early Sunday that Nasheed had been able to have long conversations with some family members.Shrapnel from the blast damaged Nasheed's intestines and liver, and a piece of shrapnel broke his rib and had been less than a centimeter (0.4 inches) from his heart, hospital officials said.Officers from the Australian Federal Police were assisting with the investigation, following a request from the Maldives. A British investigator was also set to arrive in the Indian Ocean archipelago on Sunday.Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Maldives, serving from 2008 to 2012, when he resigned amid protests. He was defeated in the subsequent presidential election, and was ineligible for the 2018 race due to a prison sentence, but has remained an influential political figure.He has championed global efforts to fight climate change, particularly warning that rising seas caused by global warming threaten the archipelago nation’s low-lying islands.The Maldives is known for its luxury resorts but has experienced occasional violent attacks. In 2007, a blast in a park in the capital wounded 12 foreign tourists, and was also blamed on religious extremists.The Maldives has one of the highest per capita numbers of militants who fought in Syria and Iraq alongside the Islamic State group.Authorities announced in January that eight people arrested in November were found to have been planning to attack a school and were in the process of building bombs in a boat at sea. Police said the suspects conducted military training on uninhabited islands and recruited children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-police-say-key-suspect-in-nasheed-attack-arrested-101620553858827.html
09-05-2021||World||British novelist Paul Pickering evokes India in new book 'Elephant'||The elephant culturally symbolises India more than any other country and British novelist Paul Pickering says the pachyderm in his new novel has her roots in India.According to the author, his book "Elephant" is an affirmation of "I am my voice"."And my voice is as big as an elephant, which in turn is as big as creation. In the love story between Natasha and the man in Paris, the novel explores the interface between fact and fiction; the man in Paris uses the story of the elephant to get Natasha to go back to her first love, her voice, poetry," he says.In a country house in England, a precocious teenage exile from revolutionary Russia sets down his adventures on paper, beginning with his first ball in St Petersburg and how he frees a huge African elephant from a cruel circus.But a hundred years later, an American academic feels the boy may have invented the elephant as the only kind and uplifting being in dark times."This fast moving story is on the side of the individual and against nationalism, authoritarianism, scapegoating, fake news and the cancel culture that seeks to obliterate the boy at the heart of the story from history and that is why he commits it to paper," Pickering told PTI.Enfolding the love story and the journey is the "Elephant", which Natasha realises is the raw power of the universe; yet always looking for a good outcome in line with the survival of the planet.The book, published by Salt Publishing, spans two historical periods which correspond to the end of the rational modern (with the mass use of the machine gun) and the end of the postmodern and poststructuralist (with the rise of the internet), to a new metamodernism, a new, again individual-based, existentialism.Pickering says an Indian elephant being tormented by a trainer saves the boy's life and after the African elephant's calf is taken from her for a warlord's banquet, an Indian elephant kills her trainer by tearing him in two."… In a philosophical sense, in the way that she is on a higher plane and towers over everything, the elephant of my story has her roots in India," he says.Pickering, who authored the highly-acclaimed novel "Over the Rainbow", says that book is about the stories "we tell ourselves and others, and how the Afghans have always told better stories to defeat the British".He also says he wants to come to India to "write a novel based on the story of my wife's great aunt, a post-colonial story".According to Pickering, not only do Indian writers often have a far better command of the language, but, "looking from outside, also possibly understand the English character better, especially in its slightly chaotic and hopelessly diminished post-imperial role".His favourite is Vikram Seth, whose prose, he says, is the "envy of anyone writing in English". He also likes the "complex simplicity of Arundhati Roy in 'The God of Small Things', which stands up for the individual against scapegoating cancel culture"."If Salman Rushdie can be classed as an Indian writer I admire the Shakespearean sweep of his novels and an ability to mix genres, to combine comedy, love stories and tragedy in the same book," he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-novelist-paul-pickering-evokes-india-in-new-book-elephant-101620550421925.html
09-05-2021||World||EU suspension of CAI is a setback to Merkel’s pro-China policies||In European Union Parliament, there is a saying that their human rights policies are so tight that they can fit into bonnet of a BMW car. The EU’s suspension of ratification of Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China has not only sounded a death knell of the agreement but is a strong rebuff to German Chancellor Angela Merkel pro-China polices of the past 15 years.“The investment agreement is as good as dead despite the EU officially stating that it is suspended for now. Many EU diplomats including some from Germany were sceptical from the beginning but the last straw was the Chinese sanctioning of European Parliament members, including the entire human rights committee,” said a senior diplomat in EU. The sanctions were imposed in retaliation to the EU sanctioning four Chinese officials and the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau for their alleged involvement in operating so-called education camps in Muslim-dominated Xinjiang province. It is the European Parliament that must approve the CAI and with its members sanctioned, such a decision becomes untenable.While Germany, and to some extent France, were behind the CAI’s conclusion in December last year, the fact that it set a low ambition bar on Chinese aggression against Taiwan, Hong Kong and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, had led to strong opposition from the Greens and Liberal members of European Parliament. The EU media and other pressure groups had also highlighted similar concerns. Many hinted that the CAI was moving till now mainly as it was a personal project of the German Chancellor and would lose steam eventually once see demits office in September this year. Chancellor Angela Merkel, with an eye on German auto business, not only pushed the agreement during its EU presidency in 2020 but is also now seen as someone who is staunchly opposing TRIPS waiver on vaccines as she wants US-European companies to export these vaccines on commercial basis rather than give up on IPR even in the time of biggest health crisis in 100 years.The suspension of CAI comes at a time when the EU has decided to reopen trade and investment negotiations with India after a long hiatus of eight years, primarily because a high ambition bar was maintained for New Delhi. This was done despite India being a democracy with strong laws on human rights, labour and strong commitment to rules based international system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-suspension-of-cai-is-a-setback-to-merkel-s-pro-china-policies-101620550857183.html

According to a report in The Express Tribune, Chinese authorities are wary of Pakistan's ability to service its debt."Beijing conveyed its concerns during a meeting held on March 30 to discuss financing modalities of the project," the Pakistan government officials said as per the report."The Chinese side have sought clarification regarding the possibility of raising further debt by Pakistan during currency of the IMF program. The Pakistani side clarified that debt situation is being monitored and there is no restriction under the programme to raise debt for viable projects," Deputy Chairman Planning Commission of Pakistan Dr Jehanzeb Khan told the Pakistan daily.Amid lack of progress on several CPEC projects, subtle signs of unease have emerged between the two countries over the future direction and funding of mega projects, under increasing scrutiny of media and the public.According to a report published in Modern Diplomacy, the outcome of recent meetings between the two countries reveals significant scaling down of Pakistan's expectations regarding the inclusion of more projects under CPEC phase II.Fabien Baussart in an opinion piece for Modern Diplomacy last month had said, "While the country has for long portrayed USD 6.8 billion Main Line-I project to be the main artery of the Pakistan Railways and tried to convince China for financing the project, the Chinese side has tried to avoid any commitment for funding."Pakistan has been unable to secure any favourable consideration including the concessionary loan at an interest rate of one per cent, said Baussart while adding that China is only willing to offer a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project backed by suitable guarantees by Pakistan.In 2015, China announced an economic project in Pakistan worth USD 46 billion. With the CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India.The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometres west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail, and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reluctant-to-clear-6-billion-loan-for-cpec-project-over-debt-concern-101620551689005.html

To anyone I've offended I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars in a rocket ship," he said. "Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?"Musk has previously drawn criticism for moves like publicly mocking the US Securities and Exchange Commission and calling a cave diver who rescued boys trapped in Thailand a "pedo guy".But on SNL, the billionaire took swipes at his own expense. He joked about his tweets, his son's unusual name -- X Æ A-12 -- and that time he smoked weed on Joe Rogan's podcast.And of course, as a big booster of cryptocurrencies, he once again enumerated the benefits of dogecoin.Pressed on what exactly dogecoin is, Musk called the cryptocurrency -- which now has a market value of around $72 billion -- "an unstoppable vehicle that's going to take over the world".But then he agreed that actually "it's a hustle".For the second time in a week, the world's second-richest person seemed to drive the value of the digital asset. Not long after its recent surge after Musk's Twitter endorsement, it was sent on a brief tailspin during his SNL performance.It dropped to as low as 49 cents during the broadcast after a pre-show high of about 74 cents, according to CoinDesk.During the show, cast members wondered aloud why exactly the tech billionaire would want to join their set.With a segment of a Chinese rocket re-entering Earth's atmosphere around the time of the live broadcast, they concluded that the spaceman "needed an alibi."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-he-is-first-snl-host-with-asperger-s-syndrome-101620551921756.html

The TV named the cause of the fire as crude oil leakage from one of the pumping stations at the Homs Oil Refinery in the central province of Homs.The fire came amid a series of mysterious attacks on vessels and oil facilities in Syria over the past months. The war-torn country has been suffering from fuel shortage in recent months.Head of Homs Oil Refinery Suleiman Mohammed told state TV that the distillation unit that caught fire is one of four at the refinery.In addition to the refinery in Homs, Syria has another one near the coastal town of Banias. Both are government-run and operating.Syria’s oil resources are mostly outside of government controlled areas.Syria controls some small oil and gas fields in the country’s center but most of the country’s large fields in the east are controlled by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters. This has made Damascus reliant on Iran for fuel.The U.S. Treasury sanctions have targeted a network that spanned Syria, Iran and Russia responsible for shipping oil to the Syrian government.In late April, Syria’s oil ministry said a fire erupted in an oil tanker on its coast after what it said was a suspected drone attack.In January, an explosion in an oil tanker outside a state fuel distribution company in Homs caused massive fire. The minister of oil told Syrian state TV at the time that seven tankers caught fire but there were no civilian casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-at-syrian-oil-refinery-extinguished-after-leakage-101620549686662.html

The first vaccine that comes along that has authorization, I will take it.”While wealthier nations have stockpiled vaccines for their citizens, many poorer countries are still scrambling to secure doses. A few, like Chad, have yet to receive any.The World Health Organization says nearly a dozen countries — many of them in Africa — are still waiting to get vaccines. Those last in line on the continent along with Chad are Burkina Faso, Burundi, Eritrea and Tanzania.“Delays and shortages of vaccine supplies are driving African countries to slip further behind the rest of the world in the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the continent now accounts for only 1% of the vaccines administered worldwide,” WHO warned Thursday.And in places where there are no vaccines, there's also the chance that new and concerning variants could emerge, said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for Supply Division.“So we should all be concerned about any lack of coverage anywhere in the world,” Gandhi said, urging higher-income countries to donate doses to the nations that are still waiting.While the total of confirmed Covid-19 cases among them is relatively low compared with the world's hot spots, health officials say that figure is likely a vast undercount: The countries in Africa still waiting for vaccines are among those least equipped to track infections because of their fragile health care systems.Chad has confirmed only 170 deaths since the pandemic began, but efforts to stop the virus entirely here have been elusive. Although the capital's international airport was closed briefly last year, its first case came via someone who crossed one of Chad's porous land borders illegally.Regular flights from Paris and elsewhere have resumed, heightening the chance of increasing the 4,835 already confirmed cases.The Farcha provincial hospital in N’Djamena is a gleaming new campus in an outlying neighborhood, where camels nibble from acacia trees nearby. Doctors Without Borders has helped supply oxygen for Covid-19 patients, and the hospital has 13 ventilators. The physicians also have plenty of Chinese-made KN95 masks and hand sanitizer. Still, not a single employee has been vaccinated and none has been told when that might be possible.That was easier to accept at the beginning of the pandemic, Djarma said, because doctors all around the world lacked vaccines. That has changed dramatically after the development of shots in the West and by China and Russia that have gone to other poor African countries.“When I hear, for example, in some countries that they've finished with medical staff and the elderly and are now moving on to other categories, honestly, it saddens me,” Djarma said. “I ask them if they can provide us with these vaccines to at least protect the health workers.“Everyone dies from this disease, rich or poor,” she says. “Everyone must have the opportunity, the chance to be vaccinated, especially those who are most exposed."COVAX, the U.N.-backed program to ship Covid-19 vaccines worldwide, is aimed at helping low- and middle-income countries get access. A few of the countries, though, including Chad, have expressed concerns about receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine through COVAX for fear it might not protect as well against a variant first seen in South Africa.Chad is expected to get some Pfizer doses next month if it can put in place the cold storage facilities needed to keep that vaccine safe in a country where temperatures soar each day to 43.5 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit).Some of the last countries also took more time to meet the requirements for receiving doses, including signing indemnity waivers with manufacturers and having distribution plans in place.Those delays, though, now mean an even longer wait for places like Burkina Faso, since a key vaccine manufacturer in India scaled back its global supply because of the catastrophic virus surge there."Now with global vaccine supply shortages, stemming in particular from the surge of cases in India and subsequently the Indian government’s sequestration of doses from manufacturers there, Burkina Faso risks even longer delays in receiving the doses it was slated to get,” said Donald Brooks, CEO of a U.S. aid group engaged in the Covid-19 response there known as Initiative: Eau.Front-line health workers in Burkina Faso say they’re not sure why the government hasn’t secured vaccines.“We would have liked to have had it like other colleagues around the world,” says Chivanot Afavi, a supervising nurse who worked on the front lines of the response until recently. “No one really knows what this disease will do to us in the future.”In Haiti, not a single vaccine has been administered to the more than 11 million people who live in the most impoverished country of the Western hemisphere.Haiti was slated to receive 756,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via COVAX, but government officials said they didn’t have the infrastructure needed to conserve them and worried about having to throw them away. Haitian officials also expressed concerns over potential side effects and said they preferred a single-dose vaccine.Several small island nations in the Pacific also have yet to receive any vaccine, although the lack of outbreaks in some of those places has meant there is less urgency with inoculation campaigns. Vanuatu, with a population of 300,000, is waiting to receive its first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine later this month, but it has recorded only three cases of coronavirus, all of them in quarantine.At the Farcha hospital in Chad, nine health care workers have gotten the virus, including Dr. Mahamat Yaya Kichine, a cardiologist. The hospital now has set up pods of health care worker teams to minimize the risk of exposure for the entire staff.“It took almost 14 days for me to be cured,” Kichine says. “There were a lot of caregivers that were infected, so I think that if there is a possibility to make a vaccine available, it will really ease us in our work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-deserts-some-countries-have-no-covid-19-jabs-at-all-101620550405438.html

The government will expand testing to all workers at two of the airport’s terminals and its Jewel shopping mall, and all students, staff and visitors at the junior college.Singapore has seen 10 cases per week of unlinked cases in the community in the past two weeks, the government said Saturday. On Sunday, it reported an additional 10 new infections, five of whom are unlinked to previous cases.The Ministry of Education said about 2,200 people associated with Victoria Junior College will undergo swab tests by Monday, while just over 100 people who are close contacts will be quarantined.The health ministry didn’t provide the number of people who will be tested at Changi Airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, and Jewel. There was no immediate reply to emails to the ministry outside of business hours seeking those figures.The threat had been easing for Singapore until a few weeks ago when new clusters started to emerge including cases with the variant of Covid-19 first detected in India. Tighter social-distancing measures kicked in for the country on Saturday with officials saying they were necessary to prevent a harsher lockdown similar to one last year.A rise in unlinked cases in Singapore could jeopardize a planned travel bubble with Hong Kong, scheduled to begin on May 26. According to the terms of the agreement, the air-travel corridor will be closed for two weeks if the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local cases is more than five in either city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tests-thousands-as-unlinked-covid-19-cases-persist-101620549885570.html

At the same time, we will firmly defend our national interests to ensure the safety of our people," Putin said.The Russian leader also denounced what he called a creeping return of ideologies of the time, when "slogans of racial and national superiority, of anti-semitism and Russophobia, became ever more cynical".The state-run RIA Novosti agency reported that more than 12,000 military personnel would take part in Sunday's parade in the Russian capital, as well as some 190 pieces of military equipment and 76 fighter jets and helicopters.Victory Day parades, which only became an annual event after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, also took place Sunday in dozens of cities across the nation.During Putin's two decades in power, the public holiday has taken on increasing importance in projecting Russia's renewed military might.A survey this week by state-run pollster VTsIOM showing that 69 percent of Russians view it as the most important holiday on the calendar.A third of respondents told VTsIOM they would take part in the celebrations, while a fifth said they would watch on television.- Tensions with the West -The commemorations of the 76th anniversary of the 1945 victory come as tensions with the West have reached near Cold War times in recent weeks.Russia has seen its diplomats expelled from a clutch of European countries over espionage scandals, as the United States and the European Union levied new sanctions on Moscow over the treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and allegations of hacking and cyber attacks.Moscow has stepped up military activity abroad, intervening on behalf of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria's civil war. It is also widely seen as backing pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Tensions in the conflict, which erupted after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, have also soared in recent weeks.Clashes between the government and separatists have been intensifying since January in a conflict which has claimed more than 13,000 lives.Russia last month amassed 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and in Crimea, its biggest buildup since 2014, though it quickly announced a drawdown in what many saw as a test for new US President Joe Biden.Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Kiev in a show of support for Ukraine against Russia, and before an expected summit between Putin and Biden next month.On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky travelled with European diplomats to the pro-Russian breakaway eastern region of Lugansk to commemorate the end of WWII.emg/bp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-76th-wwii-victory-day-putin-vows-to-firmly-defend-russian-interests-101620549681968.html

09-05-2021||World||Third arrest in manhunt after Maldives bomb attack||A third man has been arrested following the attempted assassination of Maldives' former president Mohamed Nasheed, police said Sunday, as they renewed an appeal for more information about another suspect.The democracy pioneer and climate activist was seriously hurt after a bomb attack in the capital Male on Thursday night that also injured a British national and two others, which police have blamed on "religious extremists"."We can confirm that a third individual has been arrested in connection with the May 6 attack early today," police said in a statement.No further details about the man were released.Police also appealed for more information about another man seen in the area where a motorcycle that the bomb had been rigged to was parked.The owner of the motorcycle as well as another man were arrested on Saturday.The bomb detonated as Nasheed walked to his car.Family members tweeted that the 53-year-old ex-president, now the parliament's speaker, remained in the intensive care unit of a hospital.But he was able to speak to close relatives on Saturday after no longer needing life support, they added. There was no immediate update on his condition from the hospital.Nasheed underwent 16 hours of surgery to remove shrapnel from his body and doctors said one shard narrowly missed his heart.There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, but officials from Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) have alleged that religious extremists and political interests could be involved.The Indian Ocean archipelago of 340,000 people is Muslim majority and in October 2019 police arrested a suspected Islamic State recruiter accused of sending dozens of Maldivians to Syria.The same man was accused of setting off a homemade bomb that wounded 12 Chinese tourists in Male in September 2007.Nasheed ended decades of one-party rule in the Maldives and became its first democratically-elected president in 2008, only to be toppled in a military-backed coup in 2012.He is known internationally as a champion in the fight against climate change and rising sea levels that he says threaten to submerge the nation of 1,192 coral islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-arrest-in-manhunt-after-maldives-bomb-attack-101620546267180.html

They are also about preparing his possible campaign for a second term.A year before the next presidential election, Macron is focusing on saving jobs and reviving the pandemic-battered French economy as his country inches out of its third partial lockdown.The centrist president's ability to meet the challenge will be significant for his political future and for France — which is among the world's worst-hit nations with the fourth-highest number of reported Covid-19 cases and the eighth-highest death toll at more than 106,000.While he has not officially declared his candidacy, Macron has made comments suggesting he intends to seek reelection. And he has pushed recent legislation on issues that potential rivals on the right and the left hold dear, from security to climate change.Pollsters suggest Macron, who four years ago became the youngest president in French history, has a good chance of winning the presidency again in 2022 despite his government’s oft-criticized management of the pandemic and earlier challenges to his policies, from activists protesting what they see as social and economic injustice to unions angry over retirement reforms.The coronavirus reopening strategy Macron unveiled this month calls for most restrictions on public life to be lifted June 30, when half of France's population is expected to have received at least one vaccine shot. With up to 3 million people in France getting vaccinated each week, the government plans to allow outdoor areas of restaurants and cafes, as well as museums and nonessential shops, to resume operating on May 19.In an interview with French media, Macron said he would visit France’s regions over the summer “to feel the pulse of the country" and to engage with people in a mass consultation aimed at “turning the page of that moment in the nation’s life.”“No individual destiny is worthwhile without a collective project,” he said, giving the latest hint about a potential reelection bid.At the moment, all opinion polls show Macron and Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader he beat in a presidential runoff election in 2017, again reaching the runoff next year. The polls also forecast that Macron would defeat National Rally leader Le Pen again, though by a smaller margin.Macron, 43, a former economy minister under his predecessor, Socialist President Francois Hollande, has characterized his policies as transcending traditional left-right divides. He was elected on a promise to make the French economy more competitive while preserving the country's welfare system.Macron’s government includes major figures previously belonging to the conservative party The Republicans, including his prime minister and the finance and interior ministers.French politics expert Luc Rouban, a senior researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research. said the president's immediate goal “is to show he is still able to continue implementing his project, which has more or less been stopped by the health crisis.”Macron's recent priorities demonstrate he also is trying to attract voters from the moderate right and the moderate left, the same ones who helped him win the first time, Rouban said.Macron is “undermining the field of The Republicans by strengthening security laws, taking measures to protect the French against terrorism, reinforcing security also in urban areas, increasing police and justice staff,” he said.At the same time, Macron needs to show he is addressing inequality, economic mobility, and other social justice issues that are important to France's left-wing, Rouban said.Last month, the president decided to do away with France’s elite graduate school for future leaders, the Ecole Nationale d’Administration. He said his alma mater would be replaced with a more egalitarian institution.In the French newspaper's interview, Macron also praised the country's benefits for low-income workers, who since 2019 have received up to 100 additional euros ($120) per month.Macron’s public image appears to have partially recovered from the drubbing it took at the height of the “yellow vest" movement, which started in late 2018 to oppose a fuel tax and grew into a weekly anti-government protest targeting alleged social and economic injustice. At the time, critics angry over Macron eliminating a wealth tax labeled him the “president of the rich.”But Macron’s popularity in recent months has remained relatively stable, with an approval rating between 30% and 46%, higher than his predecessors Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy had after four years in office.Frédéric Dabi, deputy director-general of the polling organization IFOP, said Macron’s support appears “very solid.” Polls show his policies are satisfying most of his 2017 supporters, and 30% to 50% of voters from the traditional right- and left-wing parties.During the virus crisis, Macron applied a “whatever it takes” strategy based on state intervention to save jobs and businesses, including a massive partial unemployment program and subsidized child care leave. The government also approved a two-year 100 billion-euro ($120 billion) rescue plan to revive the economy.Macron promised there would be no tax increases to repay the debt, which soared last year to 115.7% of gross domestic product.Despite strong opposition from unions about planned changes to the pension system and unemployment benefits, he has pledged to keep reforming “until the last quarter of an hour” of his five-year term, which runs out in May 2022.Recent polls show no strong rival emerging so far from mainstream French parties amid divisions on both the right and the left. But at this stage, the field remains wide open.As Macron himself proved in 2017, when he shot from a wild-card candidate to the presidency in less than four months, anything could happen in the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-vows-to-revive-covid-hit-french-economy-with-an-eye-on-re-election-bid-101620543246361.html
09-05-2021||World||Indo-Canadian documentary filmmaker wins lifetime achievement award at Hot Docs||Filmmaker Lalita Krishna, who has been making documentaries for over 20 years, has become the first person from the Indian-Canadian community to win a prestigious lifetime achievement award at Hot Docs, North America’s biggest documentary film festival.Toronto-based Krishna, who grew up in Kolkata and worked in Delhi’s advertising sector before moving to Canada, has been named winner of the Don Haig Award.The 28th edition of the popular film festival, an 11-day-long affair, is taking place virtually this year due to Covid-19 protocols. It concludes on Sunday.Krishna told HT the award was particularly meaningful as it’s “given to the body of work over a period of time and so it recognises a producer who’s contributed over a span of time”. Just as Don Haig, an Oscar-winning Canadian filmmaker was known for mentorship, the award involves naming an emerging female filmmaker who would receive a cash prize courtesy the Don Haig Foundation. The recognition is special for Krishna because she said it meant “paying it forward” and her choice for the cash prize is Bangladeshi director Elizabeth D Costa. D Costa was assistant director of the documentary film Bangla Surf Girls, produced and directed by Krishna, which premiered at Hot Docs this year. The film is about three young girls from Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, who find escape from social restrictions in surfing the waves of the Bay of Bengal. Recalling the making of Bangla Surf Girls, Krishna said, “She (D Costa) happened to mention this and I said, ‘You know, you should do it and I’ll help you with it,’ and then she was hesitant because she’s never done a film on her own before. So I said, ‘We will make it happen,’ and that’s how we kind of stayed with it. It’s been a four-year journey and we are here today.”Hot Docs programmer Mariam Zaidi described the film as a “touching coming-of-age story of resistance” that will have the viewer “cheering for every wave and hurdle these young women overcome”. In the citation for the lifetime achievement award recipient, Hot Docs noted, “Passionate about diversity and inclusion, Lalita’s films reflect her strong belief in empowering underrepresented voices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-documentary-filmmaker-wins-lifetime-achievement-award-at-hot-docs-101620543192749.html
09-05-2021||World||Nasa slams China over irresponsible standards regarding space debris||Hours after China confirmed on Sunday that debris from its largest rocket Long March 5B had disintegrated over the Indian Ocean and landed near Maldives, American space agency Nasa slammed the Chinese administration for failing to meet 'responsible standards' regarding space debris. "It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris," Nasa administrator Bill Nelson, a former senator and astronaut who was picked for the role in March, said in a statement after the re-entry.Remnants of China's largest rocket, the Long March, which was launched last week, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on Sunday morning and disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, the country's state-sponsored media network, the China Central Television (CCTV), reported, citing the China Manned Space Engineering Office.Also Read: China's rocket debris disintegrates over Indian Ocean, lands near MaldivesAccording to the coordinates provided by Chinese officials of the rocket's point of impact, the debris now lies west of the Maldives archipelago. The US Space Command had confirmed the re-entry of the rocket over the Arabian Peninsula but said the current location of the debris was unknown.Earlier, the news had sparked fears over where the large 18-tonne segment of the Chinese rocket was going to come down, leading to a renewed panic over possible damage and casualties amid the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Uncertainty over the rocket's orbital decay and China's failure to issue stronger reassurances in the run-up to the re-entry fuelled anxiety."Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations," the Nasa administrator said, adding that all spacefaring nations must act responsibly to ensure the long-term sustainability of such outer-space activities.Notably, the Long March was the second deployment of the 5B variant since its maiden flight in May 2020. Last year, pieces from the first Long March 5B fell on Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings. No injuries were reported.“Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations. It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities,” the statement issued by Nasa read.China's state-sponsored media, including the tabloid 'The Global Times', had however dismissed concerns about the rocket debris being potentially dangerous and "out of control" as "Western hype".Organisations have become more careful about their spacecraft design ever since the Nasa space station 'Skylab' fell from orbit in July 1979 and landed in Australia, leading to most countries seeking to avoid such uncontrolled re-entries ever again.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-slams-china-over-irresponsible-standards-regarding-space-debris-101620537862631.html
09-05-2021||World||Colonial hackers stole data Thursday ahead of shutdown||The hackers who caused Colonial Pipeline to shut down the biggest U.S. gasoline pipeline on Friday began their blitz against the company a day earlier, stealing a large amount of data before locking computers with ransomware and demanding payment, according to people familiar with the matter.The intruders, who are part of a cybercrime gang called DarkSide, took nearly 100 gigabytes of data out of the Alpharetta, Georgia-based company’s network in just two hours on Thursday, two people involved in Colonial’s investigation said.The move was part of a double-extortion scheme that is one of the group’s hallmarks. Colonial was threatened that the stolen data would be leaked to the internet while the information that was encrypted by the hackers on computers inside the network would remain locked unless it paid a ransom, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.The company didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment on the investigation. It said earlier that it “proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat, which has temporarily halted all pipeline operations, and affected some of our IT systems.”Colonial’s decision late Friday to shut down a pipeline that is the main source of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for the East Coast, without saying when it would reopen, represents a dangerous new escalation in the fight against ransomware, which President Joe Biden’s administration has identified as a priority.It’s not clear how much money the attackers demanded or whether Colonial has paid. Ransomware demands can range from several hundred dollars to millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Many companies pay, often facilitated by their insurers.AXA SA, one of Europe’s top insurance companies, said this week that it would break with that trend and stop offering policies in France that reimburse customers for payments made to ransomware hackers, which could be the first in the industry, the Associated Press reported.Cyber-attacks have disrupted the operations of other energy assets in the U.S. in recent years. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that an attack brought down an unnamed natural gas compressor facility for two days. In April 2018, several natural gas pipeline operators had service interruptions because of the hack of a third-party provider whose technology enables electronic communications between the entities.The theft of Colonial’s data, coupled with the detonation of ransomware on the company’s computers, highlights the leverage that hackers often have over their victims in these kinds of cases. The company said FireEye Inc.’s Mandiant digital forensics division is assisting with the investigation.The White House said that Biden was briefed on the incident Saturday morning.A series of major cyber-attacks in recent weeks also underscored the brazenness of the attackers and the challenges of tackling the problem of ransomware.In a matter of days, attacks were revealed against the police department in Washington, D.C. , where the hackers threatened to release information about police informants to criminal gangs; the Illinois Attorney General’s office, which had been warned about weak cybersecurity practices in a recent state audit; and San Diego-based Scripps Health, where medical procedures were canceled and emergency patients diverted to other hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colonial-hackers-stole-data-thursday-ahead-of-shutdown-101620534913925.html

We offer our condolences to the victims, many of whom were children, and their families. We call for an immediate end to violence and the senseless targeting of innocent civilians," said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price."We will continue to support and partner with the people of Afghanistan, who are determined to see to it that the gains of the past two decades are not erased," he added.The death toll from a series of blasts at a school in Kabul rose to 53 on Saturday, a source in the Ministry of Public Health told Sputnik.At least three blasts happened near Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in west of Kabul on Saturday afternoon, TOLO News reported citing the Interior Ministry.The attack started with a car bomb explosion and was followed by two rocket attacks, sources said. No group or individual has so far claimed responsibility for the blasts. Moreover, the Taliban denied involvement in the attack.This comes after US President Joe Biden had said that the United States will withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan before the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.Meanwhile, as the United States' "war on terror" enters a new phase as President Joe Biden has begun withdrawing all US forces from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda has claimed that its war with America is far from over.In an exclusive interview with CNN conducted through intermediaries, an al-Qaeda official said that "war against the US will be continuing on all other fronts unless they are expelled from the rest of the Islamic world".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-for-immediate-end-to-violence-in-afghanistan-condemns-school-attack-101620525880660.html
09-05-2021||World||Iraq's heritage battered by desert sun, rain and state apathy||One of the world's oldest churches is crumbling deep in Iraq's desert, another victim of years of conflict, government negligence and climate change in a country with a rich heritage.After Pope Francis made a historic visit to Iraq in March, many Iraqis hoped that busloads of tourists would flock to Al Aqiser church southwest of the capital Baghdad.But in a country that has been battered by consecutive conflicts and economic crises, the church -- like Iraq's numerous Christian, Islamic and Mesopotamian relics -- has been left to weather away.All that remains of Al Aqiser, which has stood in Ain Tamr for more than 1,500 years, are crumbling brick and red earthen walls.Archaeologist Zahd Muhammad blamed this on "climate conditions, the fact that under Saddam Hussein the area was transformed into a military firing range and the lack of regular conservation".Ain Tamr mayor Raed Fadhel said upkeep is a question of budget."Such maintenance requires an enormous amount of money, but we only get meagre funds" from the federal government, he said.Some 60 kilometres (38 miles) further east, Shiite shrines in Karbala attract millions of pilgrims each year.But these potential visitors fail to stop by Iraq's numerous ancient churches, its Mesopotamian cities and the fabled "ziggurat" pyramid-like structures of Babylon, a UNESCO World Heritage site, residents and officials say.Missed opportunitiesAbdullah al-Jlihawi, who lives in Diwaniya province bordering Karbala, told AFP he believes that "foreigners care more about our heritage than we do"."Until the 1980s, an American university led excavations here, there were plenty of job opportunities," he said."Our parents and grandparents worked on those sites, but all that stopped in the 1990s" with the international embargo against Saddam's regime.Diwaniya's governor, Zuhair al-Shaalan, boasts of the province's more than 2,000 historic sites and sees in each a potential economic windfall.But almost 20 years since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam's dictatorship, promising democracy and prosperity, Iraqis are still waiting to for an economic upturn.Diwaniya is home to Nippur, the ancient Sumerian city and jewel of Iraq's glorious Mesopotamian past with its temples, libraries and palaces.Seven thousand years ago Nippur, now in southern Iraq, was one of the main religious centres of the Akkadians and later the Babylonians.Much of that site was looted after Saddam's fall from power by armed bandits and many others destroyed by jihadists who seized swathes of Iraq in 2014 until their defeat three years later."Investing in these sites would create jobs in our province, which is poor and has few investment opportunities," Shaalan said.But there is another problem beyond renovation and preservation, Jlihawi said. If they came, "where would the tourists go?" he asked."There's nothing for them -- the roads haven't been paved since the 1980s, the electricity poles are from the 1970s," in a country with chronic shortages of electricity and water.Energy-rich Iraq suffered due to a decline in world oil prices and has been struggling with rising prices, high unemployment and poverty, which doubled last year to 40 percent amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Returned to dust Historical sites in the central province of Kirkuk are also in a sad state of disrepair and "neither authorities nor private organisations are doing anything for heritage", said resident Muhammad Taha.He pointed to the 3,000-year-old citadel and the "qishla", an Ottoman-era garrison, where chunks of mosaics have crumbled while sections of wall threaten to crash down.Like Nippur, the citadel's deterioration could mean it might not be promoted from UNESCO's Tentative List of heritage sites to the coveted World Heritage List.Local authorities said frequent heavy rains that batter the mountainous region are to blame.Iraq is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the United Nations.Galloping desertification in a country where desert already covers 50 percent of the territory is threatening human and animal life, and has sounded death knells for Mesopotamian sites as well as recent constructions.Abdullah al-Jlihawi from Diwaniya recalled that between the 1960s and the 1980s archeological ruins "were protected by the green belt".But trees that had blocked the wind were burned, blasted apart by shelling during successive Iraqi wars or felled to make way for new towns.Scorching summer temperates above 50 degrees (122 Fahrenheit), dust storms and heavy winter rains have also dealt blows to Iraqi heritage.And many fear that sites built with bricks made thousands of years ago by Mesopotamian labourers will one day soon turn back into dust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqs-heritage-battered-by-desert-sun-rain-and-state-apathy-101620525564352.html

Law enforcement vehicles could be seen converging outside the complex and blocking roads.Aventura Police said two groups of people had begun fighting, sparking the shooting.One individual in one of the groups produced a gun, and an individual in the other group also drew a gun and fired the weapon, said an Aventura police spokesman, Michael Bentolila, in briefing reporters on live television.Police said the three people injured were being treated at hospitals and their injuries were not life-threatening.Aventura Police later tweeted that authorities had “several suspects" in custody who were being questioned by detectives. Police had no immediate report on what touched off the incident and did not immediately release the identities of those in custody or injured.After the shooting, all patrons and employees were escorted from the shopping complex and officials were restricting access to the mall until further notice, police said.Aventura City Manager Ron Wasson told The Miami Herald that authorities were sweeping the area in case someone dropped a firearm.“They just want to make sure if someone might have dumped a weapon, we don’t miss it,” he told the newspaper.Videos shared on social media community forums show officers who appeared to be taking a man in custody outside the mall. Other footage showed shoppers running out of the stores or seeking cover.Luke Lockart, 22, said he was in Armani Exchange, checking out, when he heard screaming and things falling over because people were running into the store and knocking over mannequins.“They were trying to hide anywhere they could because no one knew what was going on,” said Lockart, who works in real estate.The staff at the store eventually locked the doors and asked people to go into a back room, he said. Police and first responders were running through a nearby hallway within minutes. “They were on top of it,” Lockart said.He followed updates on social media, saying “it was a very uneasy feeling” as he spent more than an hour in the store before police escorted everyone out.Aventura Mall bills itself on its online site as a premier shopping destination in the Miami area and South Florida.In May 2020, two people were wounded and taken to a hospital after an argument led to a shooting inside the same mall. Aventura police said that shooting also followed an argument in a department store in the complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-hurt-in-shooting-in-florida-s-aventura-mall-police-101620521730267.html
09-05-2021||World||Scottish National Party to 'push' for referendum on independence from UK||The Scottish National Party won its fourth straight parliamentary election on Saturday and insisted it will push on with another referendum on Scotland's independence from the U.K. even though it failed by one seat to secure a majority.Final results of Thursday's election showed the SNP winning 64 of the 129 seats in the Edinburgh-based Scottish Parliament. The result extends the party's dominance of Scottish politics since it first won power in 2007.Other results from Super Thursday's array of elections across Britain emerged Saturday, including the Labour Party's victory in the Welsh parliamentary election. Labour's Sadiq Khan was also reelected mayor of London.The election with the biggest implications was the Scottish election, as it could pave the way to the break-up of the United Kingdom. The devolved government has an array of powers but many economic and security matters remain within the orbit of the British government in London.Though the SNP won the vast majority of constituencies, it failed to get the 65 seats it would need to have a majority as Scotland allocates some by a form of proportional representation. Though falling short, the SNP will be easily able to govern for the five-year parliamentary term with the eight members of the Scottish Greens, who also back Scottish independence.SNP leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her immediate priority would be steering Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic and that the legitimacy of an independence referendum remains, SNP majority or not.“This is now a matter of fundamental democratic principle,” Sturgeon said. “It is the will of the country.”U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the leader of the Conservative Party, would have the ultimate authority whether or not to permit another referendum on Scotland gaining independence. Johnson appears intent on resisting another vote, setting up the possibility of renewed tensions between his government and Sturgeon’s devolved administration.The prime minister wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper published Saturday that another referendum would be “irresponsible and reckless” in the “current context” as Britain emerges from the pandemic.He has consistently argued that the issue was settled in a September 2014 referendum, when 55% of Scottish voters favored remaining part of the U.K. Proponents of another vote say the situation has changed fundamentally because of Brexit, with Scotland taken out of the European Union against its will. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 52% of the U.K. voted to leave the EU while 62% of Scots voted to remain.Sturgeon said it would be wrong for Johnson to stand in the way of a referendum and that the timing is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.There's been growing talk that the whole issue may end up going to court, but Sturgeon said the “outrageous nature” of any attempt by the British government to thwart the democratic will of Scotland would only fuel the desire for independence.“I couldn't think of a more powerful argument for independence than that,” she said.The Scotland results have been the main focus since an array of local and regional elections took place Thursday across Britain, in which around 50 million voters were eligible to vote.In Wales, the concluded vote count showed Labour doing better than expected as it extended its 22 years in control of the Welsh government despite also falling one seat short of a majority. Mark Drakeford, who will remain first minister, said the party will be “radical” and “ambitious.”Ballots continue to be counted from local elections in England, which already have been particularly good for Johnson’s Conservative Party, notably its victory in a special election in the post-industrial town of Hartlepool for a parliamentary seat that Labour had held since 1974.That win extended the party’s grip on parts of England that had been Labour strongholds for decades, if not a century. Many seats that have flipped from red to blue voted heavily for Brexit. The speedy rollout of coronavirus vaccines also appears to have given the Conservatives a boost even though the U.K. has recorded Europe's highest COVID-related death toll at 127,500.For Labour's new leader, Keir Starmer, the Hartlepool result was a huge disappointment and has led to another bout of soul-searching in a party that in 2019 suffered its worst general election performance since 1935.Starmer said he would soon set out a strategy of how it can reconnect with traditional voters. He hasn’t given details though is thought to be considering a rejig of his top team, starting off with removing his deputy, Angela Rayner, from her roles of party chair and campaign coordinator.Though Labour is clearly losing ground in its traditional heartlands, its support held up in other parts of England, such as the big cities.In London, Sadiq Khan won a second term in elections delayed by a year because of the pandemic. He secured 55.2% of the vote once second preference votes were counted, beating his Conservative rival Shaun Bailey got 44.8%. Khan's winning margin was down slightly on last time.The party also won other mayoral races, including Steve Rotherham in the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Dan Norris in the West of England region, which includes the city of Bristol.The Conservatives' Andy Street, meanwhile, was reelected as mayor of the West Midlands, which includes the city of Birmingham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-national-party-to-push-for-referendum-on-independence-from-uk-101620520594255.html

One officer received a head injury, said police.On Friday, riot police stormed Al-Aqsa mosque compound, after they said Palestinians threw rocks and fireworks at officers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the police actions."Israel is acting responsibly to ensure respect for law and order in Jerusalem while allowing freedom of worship," he said in a meeting of security officials.The violence was the worst in years at Al-Aqsa, Islam's third-holiest site after Mecca and Medina, located on the site Jews revere as the Temple Mount.A focal pointPalestinians have held nightly protests in Sheikh Jarrah against an attempt by Israeli settlers to take over Arab homes.On Saturday, protesters chanted, waved Palestinian flags and threw stones before police moved in.Dozens of Arab Israeli protesters also gathered across Israel in solidarity with Sheikh Jarrah residents, holding up signs that read "the occupation is terrorism".A reporter for Israeli public TV tweeted footage of a Jewish driver whose car was attacked with stones and windows shattered at the entrance to Sheikh Jarrah Saturday.Police blocked buses filled with Arabs headed for Jerusalem from northern Israel, saying they would not be allowed "to participate in violent riots".Instead, hundreds marched on highways leading to the city.Thousands of worshippers stayed on at Al-Aqsa on Saturday for Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Destiny), a peak of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The Islamist movement Hamas, which rules Gaza, urged Palestinians to remain at Al-Aqsa until Ramadan ends, warning that "the resistance is ready to defend Al-Aqsa at any cost".Outside the Damascus Gate entrance to Jerusalem's Old City, Palestinians set fire to a barricade before police on horseback dispersed the protesters.'Extreme concern'The Quartet of envoys from the European Union, Russia, US and the United Nations expressed "deep concnern" over the violence. "We call upon Israeli authorities to exercise restraint," they wrote.The United States -- an Israeli ally whose tone has toughened under US President Joe Biden -- said it was "extremely concerned" and urged both sides to "avoid steps that exacerbate tensions or take us farther away from peace"."This includes evictions in east Jerusalem, settlement activity, home demolitions and acts of terrorism," the State Department said.The European Union called on the authorities "to act urgently to de-escalate the current tensions," saying "violence and incitement are unacceptable and the perpetrators on all sides must be held accountable".Russia voiced "deep concern", calling the expropriation of land and property in the occupied Palestinian territories including east Jerusalem "a violation of international law".Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said he held the Israeli government responsible for the unrest and voiced "full support for our heroes in Al-Aqsa".Yair Lapid, an Israeli politician attempting to form a coalition government to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, backed the police."The state of Israel will not let violence run loose and definitely will not allow terror groups to threaten it," he tweeted.'Barbaric attack'The Al-Aqsa clashes drew sharp rebukes across the Arab and Muslim world.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel as a "cruel terrorist state" in a speech in Ankara Saturday, calling on the United Nations to intervene to "stop the persecution".Jordan condemned Israel's "barbaric attack" and Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, Pakistan and Qatar were among Muslim countries that blasted Israeli forces for the confrontation.Israel also drew criticism from Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that signed normalisation accords with the Jewish state last year.Iran called on the United Nations to condemn the Israeli police actions, arguing that "this war crime once again proved to the world the criminal nature of the illegitimate Zionist regime".Tensions are expected to remain high in Jerusalem.Israel's supreme court is to hold a new hearing in the Sheikh Jarrah case on Monday, when Israelis mark Jerusalem Day to celebrate the "liberation" of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-injured-in-fresh-round-of-clashes-in-jerusalem-101620519088111.html
09-05-2021||World||Sadiq Khan wins second term as London mayor after close contest||Sadiq Khan was re-elected as Mayor of London but only after an unexpected surge in support for his main rival threatened to give Boris Johnson’s Conservatives their biggest prize of this week’s British elections.As the incumbent Labour Party candidate, Khan was the runaway favorite to win the contest and keep his job but Shaun Bailey ran a closer-than-expected second, narrowing the gap in the polls in the final days of the contest.As the results came in during the day on Saturday, Khan held on to a lead that was at times as slim as 2 points. In the end, he won by 55.2% to 44.8%.“I’m proud to have won an overwhelming mandate today,” Khan said after the result was announced. But London is “deeply divided,” he said, with the scars of Brexit “yet to heal” and “economic inequality” getting worse.The result will be a relief rather than a source of jubilation for the U.K.’s main opposition party after a set of results across the country that its own leader described as bitterly disappointing.Khan won his first term in 2016, becoming the capital’s first Muslim mayor. His predecessor, Johnson himself, had stepped down to focus on a political career that eventually saw him become prime minister.As mayor, Khan has power over transport policy including fares on London’s bus and subway system, local taxes, and policing. He will set targets for housing and building projects and acts as a corporate hub. In the run-up to the vote, Khan promised to be the most pro-business mayor the city has ever seen. That is the kind of messaging to appeal traditional Tory voters.London Mayor Candidates Pitch Business Credentials Ahead of PollKhan, 50, is one of eight children born to Pakistani immigrants and lived in a deprived neighborhood of south London. Since becoming mayor he has been a vocal critic of Johnson’s government, notably over Brexit, and has clashed repeatedly over how to pay for the subway service that has been struggling financially.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sadiq-khan-wins-second-term-as-london-mayor-after-close-contest-101620519217303.html

09-05-2021||World||At least 30 killed in Afghan terror attack||A bomb exploded near a girls’ school in a majority Shia district of west Kabul on Saturday, killing more than 30 people, many of them young pupils between 11 and 15 years old.“More than 30 students and other countrymen have been killed, and over 50 more were wounded. The toll is rising.” interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian told reporters.The bombing, apparently aimed to cause maximum civilian carnage, adds to fears that violence in the war-wrecked country could escalate as the US and NATO end nearly 20 years of military engagement.Residents in the area said the explosion was deafening. One, Naser Rahimi, told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, although there was no official confirmation of multiple blasts.Rahimi said the explosion went off as the girls were streaming out of the school at around 4.30pm local time.In Dasht-e-Barchi, angry crowds attacked the ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, health ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said.Also read | Taliban terrorists capture key dam in AfghanistanHe implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site. Images circulating on social media purportedly showed bloodied school backpacks and books strewn across the street in front if the school, and smoke rising above the neighbourhood.At one nearby hospital, Associated Press journalists saw at least 20 dead bodies lined up in hallways and rooms, with dozens of wounded people and families of victims pressing through the facility.Both Arian and Nazari said that at least 50 people were also wounded, and that the casualty toll could rise. The attack occurred just as the fasting day came to an end.Authorities were investigating the attack but have yet to confirm any details. While no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, the Afghan Islamic State affiliate has targeted the Shia neighbourhood before. The radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan’s minority Shia Muslims.Meanwhile, the Taliban denied any responsibility, while condemning the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime.Mujahid also accused Afghanistan’s intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani blamed the Taliban.“The Taliban, by escalating their illegitimate war and violence, have once again shown that they are not only reluctant to resolve the current crisis peacefully and fundamentally, but by complicating the situation,” Ghani said.The top US diplomat in Kabul, Ross Wilson, called the blast “abhorrent”, tweeting: “With scores murdered, this unforgivable attack on children is an assault on Afghanistan’s future, which cannot stand.”The European Union delegation in Afghanistan condemned what it said was a “despicable act of terrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-30-killed-in-afghan-terror-attack-101620512754357.html
09-05-2021||World||Nasa captures sound of chopper blades on Mars||First came the amazing pictures, then the video. Now Nasa is sharing sounds of its little helicopter humming through the thin Martian air.Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California released this first-ever audio on Friday, just before Ingenuity made its fifth test flight, a short one-way trip to a new airfield.During the fourth flight a week earlier, the low hum from the helicopter blades spinning at more than 2,500 revolutions per minute is barely audible. It almost sounds like a low-pitched, faraway mosquito or other flying insect.That’s because the 1.8-kg helicopter was more than 80 metres from the microphone on the Perseverance rover. The rumbling wind gusts also obscured the chopper’s sound. Scientists isolated the sound of the whirring blades and magnified it, making it easier to hear.“This is a very good surprise,” said David Mimoun, a professor of planetary science at Institut Superieur de l’Aeronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France, and science lead for the SuperCam Mars microphone on board Perseverance. “We had carried out tests that told us the microphone would barely pick up the sounds,” he added.Ingenuity, the first powered aircraft to fly at another planet, arrived at Mars on February 18, clinging to Perseverance’s belly. Its first flight was April 19. After proving itself more robust, it will now embark on a new mission: to scout ahead of Perseverance to assist in its hunt for ancient life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-captures-sound-of-chopper-blades-on-mars-101620505144644.html
09-05-2021||World||Scotland's nationalist government set to be shy of majority||Scotland's governing Scottish National Party was poised Saturday to win its fourth straight parliamentary election, but the party's anticipated inability to secure a majority could complicate its ambition to hold another referendum on the country's independence from the UK.With 68 constituencies counted, the SNP had won 57 of the 129 seats in the Edinburgh-based Scottish Parliament and was on clear course to extend its dominance of Scottish politics.However, because Scotland allocates some seats by a form of proportional representation, the party looks set to fall just short of the 65 seats it would need to have a majority. Based on the latest results, the BBC forecast that the SNP would end up with 63 seats.The party's leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, conceded as much late Saturday afternoon, saying it wasn't a big surprise given the electoral system in place in Scotland."I've always said a majority is a long-shot,” Sturgeon said.Sturgeon said the immediate priority on her return to power would be steering Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic but that the legitimacy of an independence referendum remains, SNP majority or not. The Scottish Greens, who also back a referendum, were set to pick up parliament seats.“It looks as if it is beyond any doubt that there will be a pro-independence majority in that Scottish Parliament, and by any normal standard of democracy that majority should have the commitments it made to the people of Scotland honored,” Sturgeon said.In a September 2014 referendum, 55% of Scottish voters favored remaining part of the United Kingdom.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the leader of the Conservative Party, would have the ultimate authority whether or not to permit another referendum on Scotland gaining independence. So far, Johnson has refused to countenance another vote, setting up the possibility of renewed tensions between his government and Sturgeon’s devolved administration.The prime minister wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper published Saturday that another referendum would be “irresponsible and reckless” in the “current context” as Britain emerges from the pandemic.Sturgeon said it would be wrong for Johnson to stand in the way of a referendum and that the timing is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.“I would say two things: Firstly you’re not picking a fight with the SNP, you’re picking a fight with the democratic wishes of the Scottish people,” she said. “And secondly, you will not succeed.”There's been growing talk that the whole issue may end up going to court, but Sturgeon said the “outrageous nature” of any attempt by the British government to thwart the democratic will of Scotland would only fuel the desire for independence.“I couldn't think of a more powerful argument for independence than that one,” she said.The Scotland results have been the main focus since an array of local and regional elections took place Thursday across Britain, where around 50 million voters were eligible to vote.In Wales, the concluded vote count showed the Labour Party doing better than expected in the parliamentary election as it extended its 22 years in control of the Welsh government. The party retaining its grip on power after winning half of the seats, just one short of a majority. Mark Drakeford, who will remain as first minister, said the party will be “radical” and “ambitious” in government.Ballots continue to be counted from local elections in England, which already have been particularly good for Johnson’s Conservative Party, notably its victory in a special election in the post-industrial town of Hartlepool for a parliamentary seat that the main opposition Labour Party had held since 1974.The win extended the party’s grip on parts of England that had been Labour strongholds for decades, if not a century.

And Dan Norris was elected as the mayor of the West of England region, which includes the city of Bristol.London Mayor Sadiq Khan, also a Labour member, is expected to win a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotlands-nationalist-government-set-to-be-shy-of-majority-101620498441058.html
