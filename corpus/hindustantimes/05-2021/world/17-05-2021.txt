17-05-2021||World||White House defends diplomacy over Israel-Gaza crisis||The Biden administration says it wants to deescalate or tamp down violence between Israel and Gaza to save lives, but the White House is resisting calls to demand a ceasefire in a conflict that has cost at least 200 lives.Pressed on why President Joe Biden and other top officials aren’t publicly calling for a ceasefire, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that “every statement we make is with the objective of reducing the violence and bringing an end to the conflict on the ground.”“There are times in diplomacy where we’ll need to keep those conversations quieter, where we won’t read out every component of it,” Psaki told reporters. “But that is our objective and that is the prism through which every action and every comment is being made.”Psaki said she wasn’t sure if Biden had seen the latest statement by a group of Senate Democrats calling on him to seek a ceasefire. She emphasized dozens of calls made by the president and top officials seeking to resolve the crisis, and said Biden was aware of the views held by members of Congress.A statement signed by 29 Senate Democrats on Sunday said they want Biden to do more.“To prevent any further loss of civilian life and to prevent further escalation of conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories, we urge an immediate ceasefire,” according to the statement, signed by senators including Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia.That followed demands from a dozen Jewish Democrats in the House on Friday asking the administration to address Israel’s “deepening occupation” in Jerusalem. There have been other, more widespread calls for action from the left flank of the party, which increasingly links Israeli policies toward the Palestinians to calls for racial justice at home.“If the Biden admin can’t stand up to an ally, who can it stand up to?,” tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.Psaki wouldn’t say whether Biden feels that Israel’s actions in the conflict have gone too far.“It’s been seven days” since the latest flare-up started, Psaki said, adding that previous conflicts have lasted longer and that the US wants to see the violence wind down as fast as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-defends-diplomacy-over-israel-gaza-crisis-101621274097864.html

The designation freezes any assets they have within a US jurisdiction and bars anyone within a US jurisdiction from conducting any financial transactions with them.Thirteen of the people are senior members of Myanmar's military, which seized control of the country in February and has killed hundreds of people, including children, to suppress opposition.The other three are adult children of three senior military officials who were previously designated for US sanctions.Treasury said in a statement announcing the new sanctions that the Myanmar military is responsible for deadly attacks on civilians and the State Administration Council was created by the armed forces “to support the unlawful overthrow of the democratically elected civilian government.”It designated four members of the council as well as senior members of the military junta, including the governor of the central bank, the minister of international cooperation and the commerce minister.The military on Feb. 1 arrested Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory in the Nov. 8 polls and should have secured a second five-year term in office. The US has imposed several rounds of sanctions in response.The military, which ran the country also known as Burma for more than 50 years until 2015, then prevented elected lawmakers from convening a new session of Parliament and declared a state of emergency and and said it would run the country until new elections were held. Security forces have killed hundreds of people, including bystanders, as it attempts to suppress protests and opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-myanmar-military-and-junta-leaders-for-attacks-against-civilians-101621273437627.html
17-05-2021||World||US blocks third draft UN statement on Israel-Gaza violence, diplomats say||The United States on Monday blocked -- for the third time in a week -- the adoption of a joint UN Security Council statement calling for a halt to Israeli-Palestinian violence and the protection of civilians, diplomats said.The text drafted by China, Tunisia and Norway was submitted late Sunday for approval Monday by the Council's 15 members, as Israeli jets continued to pound the Gaza Strip and the death toll from a week of violence passed 200.The United States indicated that they "could not currently support an expression" by the Security Council, one diplomat told AFP.The text, obtained by AFP, called for "de-escalation of the situation, cessation of violence and respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, especially children."It voiced the Council's "grave concern" at the Gaza crisis and its "serious concern" regarding the possible eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem, opposing "unilateral actions" likely to further escalate tensions.The draft also welcomed international efforts to de-escalate the situation, without reference to the United States, and reiterated the Council's support for a negotiated two-state solution allowing Israelis and Palestinians to "live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders."- 'Protect civilians, especially children' -UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric underlined the importance of taking a consolidated position on the conflict."I would really restate the need for a very strong and unified voice from the Security Council, which we think will carry weight," he told a press conference.The UN General Assembly will hold an in-person debate on the Israeli-Palestinian clashes at 1400 GMT on Thursday, assembly spokesman Brenden Varma said.The Security Council has held three emergency meetings on the escalating violence in the past week, the latest on Sunday, without reaching a common position -- with Israel's main ally the United States accused of obstructionism.President Joe Biden's administration has insisted that it is working behind the scenes, including through a visit to the region by an envoy, and that a UN statement could backfire, according to diplomats.At a news conference in Copenhagen on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Palestinians to "protect civilians, especially children" -- and defended Washington's move to block a UN Security Council statement calling for an end to the hostilities."We're not standing in the way of diplomacy," Blinken stressed.The US refusal to endorse a joint Security Council statement has been met with disbelief by its allies."We are just asking the US to support a statement by the Security Council that would pretty much say similar things which are being saying bilaterally from Washington," one diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blocks-third-draft-un-statement-on-mideast-violence-diplomats-say-101621272920804.html
17-05-2021||World||Russia extends Twitter slowdown, warns Facebook, YouTube||Russia said Monday it would continue slowing down Twitter's operations over illegal content and threatened Facebook and YouTube with similar measures.State telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor imposed slowdowns on Twitter's services in mid-March, accusing it of failing to remove content related to child pornography, drug use and calls for minors to commit suicide.The watchdog gave Twitter a month to remove the content or face a complete blockage in Russia. Last month it extended the deadline to mid-May.In a statement Monday, it said it had decided against blocking the service after conducting an audit that showed Twitter had removed more than 90 percent of the "prohibited information", but would continue slowing its operations.Twitter had "expressed its readiness and interest in building a constructive dialogue with Roskomnadzor", the watchdog added.It "appreciates the efforts of Twitter to comply with the requirements of Russian legislation", it said.But for all the restrictions to be removed it would have to remove "all identified prohibited materials". It would keep slowing Twitter on mobile devices, it added.Roskomnadzor did not say if it would stop slowing Twitter's services if the company deleted the rest of the content and did not give a deadline for doing so.- Facebook, YouTube warned -Roskomnadzor also said that it had identified cases of illegal content "on other internet sites, including Facebook and YouTube.""In the event that these platforms do not take appropriate measures, similar sanctions may be applied to them," the watchdog said.The measures against Twitter and other social media have raised concerns among Kremlin critics, who fear the clampdown is aimed at silencing opposition voices.Last month a Moscow court imposed on Twitter three fines totalling 8.9 million rubles ($120,000) for failing to delete posts calling for minors to join unsanctioned protests in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.A Moscow court that month also hit TikTok with a fine of more than $30,000 for the same violation.In January, the authorities accused foreign social media platforms of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs by not deleting calls to rallies in support of Navalny.President Vladimir Putin that month complained about the growing influence of large technology companies, which he said were competing with states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-extends-twitter-slowdown-warns-facebook-youtube-101621269424569.html
17-05-2021||World||US Supreme Court agrees to hear bid to slash abortion rights||The U.S. Supreme Court will consider gutting the constitutional right to abortion, agreeing Monday to hear Mississippi’s bid to ban the procedure in almost all cases after 15 weeks of pregnancy.The move suggests the court’s strengthened conservative wing may be ready to roll back the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide. The clash, which the court will hear in the nine-month term that starts in October, will be its first abortion case since Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed. The decision to take the case required the votes of four justices.Mississippi’s appeal seeks to let states outlaw abortion even before a fetus becomes viable, or capable of living outside the womb. That would eviscerate the core holding of the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling, which said states can’t impose significant restrictions before viability. The court in Casey didn’t pinpoint when viability occurs but suggested it was around 23 or 24 weeks at the time of the ruling.In its appeal, Mississippi argued that viability is “not an appropriate standard for assessing the constitutionality of a law regulating abortion.” The state says its ban was designed to protect maternal health as well as the life of the fetus.“America cannot be a humane, civilized society if its courts preclude lawmakers from imposing reasonable limits on the taking of innocent life,” Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch argued.Abortion opponents are seeking to take advantage of a court reshaped by three Donald Trump appointees. The last two of those, Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, replaced justices who backed the core abortion right. Kavanaugh replaced the retired Justice Anthony Kennedy while Barrett succeeded Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died less than two months before last November’s election.Energized by the prospect of a more receptive court, conservative states have been moving to sharply restrict abortion rights. So far in 2021 alone, states have enacted more than 60 new abortion restrictions, including near-total bans in Arkansas and Oklahoma, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that backs reproductive rights.Overturning RoeThe 2018 law was challenged by the state’s only abortion facility, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization.“In an unbroken line of decisions over the last 50 years, this court has held that the Constitution guarantees each person the right to decide whether to continue a pre-viability pregnancy,” the clinic argued in a brief that urged rejection of the appeal.Abortion-rights advocates said the court’s eventual ruling could be a watershed moment.“Alarm bells are ringing loudly about the threat to reproductive rights,” Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the clinic. “The Supreme Court just agreed to review an abortion ban that unquestionably violates nearly 50 years of Supreme Court precedent and is a test case to overturn Roe v. Wade.”The appeal doesn’t directly call on the court to overturn Roe and Casey. But in a footnote, Mississippi held open the possibility the court could take that step anyway.“If the court determines that it cannot reconcile Roe and Casey with other precedents or scientific advancements showing a compelling state interest in fetal life far earlier in pregnancy than those cases contemplate, the court should not retain erroneous precedent,” Fitch argued.‘Landmark Opportunity’Abortion opponents hailed the court’s decision to take the case.“This is a landmark opportunity for the Supreme Court to recognize the right of states to protect unborn children from the horrors of painful late-term abortions,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. “It is time for the Supreme Court to catch up to scientific reality and the resulting consensus of the American people as expressed in elections and policy.”The Mississippi ban makes exceptions only in cases of severe fetal abnormality or major health risk to the woman. A federal district judge and then a federal appeals court said the ban was unconstitutional.Mississippi has a separate law that bans abortion after 20 weeks and isn’t at issue in the Supreme Court appeal. The Jackson clinic provides abortions only through the 16th week of pregnancy.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to comment on the court’s decision to take the case but said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “are devoted to ensuring that every American has access to health care, including reproductive health care.”The high court had deferred acting in the case since late September. The justices gave no explanation for the unusually long delay, though they ultimately said they would take only one aspect of Mississippi’s appeal, its attack on the viability issue.Mississippi also argued that clinics lacked the legal right to sue on behalf of their patients in the case, but the court on Monday declined to take up that issue.The case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 19-1392.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-bid-to-slash-abortion-rights-101621269953593.html
17-05-2021||World||US to send FDA-authorised Covid-19 vaccines abroad for first time||President Joe Biden plans to send an additional 20 million doses of U.S. coronavirus vaccines abroad by the end of June -- including, for the first time, shots authorized for domestic use, where supply is beginning to outstrip demand.Biden will announce Monday that he’ll export 20 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. or Johnson & Johnson, on top of 60 million AstraZeneca Plc doses he had already planned to give to other countries, according to a senior administration official familiar with the plan.The official, who asked not to be identified ahead of planned remarks from the president, stressed that the measures are only a first step as the U.S. pivots its attention to quelling the pandemic abroad. Biden has previously pledged that the U.S. would soon become an “arsenal” of global vaccine supply.Biden will also announce that he is putting Jeff Zients, who has served as the White House coronavirus response coordinator, in charge of his effort to beat back the pandemic globally, the official said. Zients will work with the National Security Council and other agencies to steer doses abroad.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the announcement, saying that the doses would go “to help countries battling the pandemic,” without specifying which ones. The 60 million AstraZeneca doses are subject to a safety review before they’ll be shipped.“We are waiting for, of course, AstraZeneca, as you know, to go through the approval process of the FDA, but this will put 80 million doses out into the world by the end of June,” Psaki said.The announcement is a watershed moment in the pandemic and a pivot for Biden’s administration. The U.S. government, under two presidents, claimed nearly all of the first several hundred million doses of vaccines produced on its soil. That approach allowed Biden to advance what has been one of the most successful domestic vaccination efforts in the world, but fueled inequities between nations that can produce their own shots and those that can’t.The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are authorized for use in the U.S., but AstraZeneca’s shot is not. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries would receive U.S. shipments.Mexico and Canada have already received doses of the U.S. AstraZeneca stockpile, and Pfizer has begun shipping doses of its U.S.-produced vaccine to countries including Mexico, Canada and Uruguay, apart from the Biden administration’s plans to share doses.The U.S. domestic vaccination campaign is beginning to run out of willing arms. The country is set to cross a threshold of 60% of adults who’ve received at least one shot on Monday.Also Read | India and US hold talks on increasing Covid vaccine availability, TRIPS waiverIn Need of ShotsMeanwhile, scores of low-income nations and even some developed countries are struggling to secure supplies of vaccines.Covax, a global program aimed at easing vaccine procurement and access for lower-income countries, is facing a supply shortage and expects the shortfall to reach about 190 million doses next month, UNICEF, one of its partners, said on Monday. Biden has previously announced a pledge of up to $4 billion for Covax.Biden has said he would only share U.S.-purchased doses once there was enough supply to meet U.S. demand. Manufacturing errors at a Baltimore plant resulted in a contaminated batch of Johnson & Johnson’s shot and greatly slowed production of the vaccine, once envisioned as a pillar of U.S. supply. Instead, the U.S. has relied almost entirely on the Pfizer and Moderna shots.Biden has faced pressure to do more to help the world, as the U.S. winds down nearly all mitigation measures such as masking and other countries try to quell fresh outbreaks and new variants with limited vaccine supply. Biden has launched what he calls a “new phase” of his pandemic effort, turning to the painstaking work of persuading more hesitant Americans to get shots as demand dries up among people eager for vaccination.U.S. caseloads continue to fall, with 16,857 new cases recorded Sunday, the lowest daily total since March of 2020 -- though Sundays are typically the lowest daily total of any week. The pace of vaccinations has fallen by over a third from a month ago, and is hovering now at about 2 million doses a day.Vaccine exports have been a thorny issue for Biden, who has tried to reclaim a mantle of U.S. leadership abroad while also borrowing many of the America-first tendencies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, in his pandemic response. While the European Union and India mixed vaccine exports with domestic allocation, the U.S. has for months cornered the market on its supply, effectively preventing early exports.Trump and Biden used wartime powers to prioritize their orders from U.S. plants, effectively placing the government at the front of the line. U.S. orders also include contractual clauses limiting the government’s ability to share doses abroad.The administration sought to skirt those restrictions by framing the 4.2 million AstraZeneca doses already shipped to Mexico and Canada as a “loan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-send-fda-authorised-covid-19-vaccines-abroad-for-first-time-101621269486992.html
17-05-2021||World||US Supreme Court limits police power to enter homes with no warrant||The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to make it easier for police to enter a home without a warrant for reasons of health or public safety, throwing out a lower court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a Rhode Island man after officers entered his home and confiscated his guns.The 9-0 ruling directed the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider Edward Caniglia's lawsuit accusing police of violating his constitutional rights by bringing him to a hospital for a mental health evaluation and taking away his guns without a warrant after a 2015 argument with his wife.Lower courts had ruled that police in the Rhode Island city of Cranston did not violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.The case centered on a legal doctrine that gives officers leeway to engage in "community caretaking" to ensure public safety. In its ruling, the Supreme Court, which has previously applied this doctrine to vehicles, said it does not apply to the home as well."What is reasonable for vehicles is different from what is reasonable for homes," Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court.In ruling against Caniglia, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that even if his case did not involve an emergency, the police conduct was justified under the community caretaking doctrine.There has been heightened concern over police conduct, including how authorities deal with mentally ill people, in the wake of protests in many cities last year against racism and police brutality.President Joe Biden's administration backed police in the case. A Justice Department lawyer told the justices that officers should not be required to obtain warrants in situations in which people could be seriously harmed.The Rhode Island case arose from a domestic dispute. An argument between Caniglia and his wife Kim that began over a Walt Disney World coffee mug escalated into a disagreement about her extended family, according to court papers. At one point, Caniglia retrieved a gun and asked his wife to shoot him to "get me out of my misery," according to court papers.She decided to spend the night at a hotel, then called police because she feared her husband could be suicidal.Caniglia, 70, said in court papers he had no criminal history and no record of violence or misuse of guns. Police returned his guns only after he sued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-limits-police-power-to-enter-homes-with-no-warrant-101621266149555.html
17-05-2021||World||Israel-Palestine conflict: Why images of densely-populated Gaza blurry on Google Maps?||Amid the worst Israeli-Palestinian violence in years, researchers observing the conflict through public domain information have raised concern about the blurry satellite images of the region on Google Maps. The low-resolution satellite images of Gaza, one of the most densely populated places on Earth, on Google Maps makes it difficult to even identify the buildings in some cases. The satellite images of Pyongyang, North Korea's secretive capital, are of far better quality on Google Maps.Google relies on a range of third parties that own satellites to supply imagery, and the mapping team stitches those images to “create a seamless map.” However, when higher quality satellite images are available from satellite companies like Maxar and Planet Labs, two of the largest, researchers find it “absurd” that Google is still providing blurry images.Google claims that the company aims to update satellite imagery of the places “that are changing the most.” “Overall, our goal is to keep densely populated places refreshed on a regular basis and to keep up with a changing world, so we will refresh areas more frequently when we think there’s lots of building or road construction going on,” Matt Manolides, Google’s Geo Data Strategist, said in a blog post.With over 13,000 people per square mile, Gaza City is more densely populated than major world cities like London and Shanghai. But Google Maps shows clearer images of far less densely populated areas than Gaza. “The most recent Google Earth image is from 2016 and looks like trash. I zoomed in on some random rural area of Syria and it has had 20+ images taken since that time, in very high resolution,” tweeted Aric Toler, a journalist for Bellingcat.I know this is the least of the issues going on in Gaza now, but it's absurd that Google (and Bing, and even Yandex) refuse to provide non-potato satellite imagery for some of the most densely populated places on earth, and are regularly hit by Israeli airstrikes. pic.twitter.com/c6DtcYXYvrAlso Read | India condemns all violence in Israel, Gaza; supports 'just Palestinian cause'What does the US law say on image availability?Until last year, the American providers were barred from selling clearer satellite images of Israel and the Palestinian territories. In 1997, the Kyl-Bingaman Amendment (KBA) was introduced to address the security concerns of Israel, under which satellite images of the region used in mapping services like Google Earth could not show items smaller than 2 metres across.While it is not uncommon for companies to blur out sensitive areas like military bases, KBA was an exception with such a wide area getting impacted. But the regulation was dropped in July last year after the US Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office argued that “a number of foreign sources” were already producing and disseminating sub-2 metre imagery of Israel, reported Reuters. Why are Gaza images still blurry?Google is still using blurry images from 2016 to show areas of Gaza. According to a BBC report, Google said that it considers "opportunities to refresh [its] satellite imagery as higher-resolution imagery becomes available", however, added that it had "no plans to share at this time". Apple Inc., which also shows satellite imagery through its mapping apps, said it was working to update its maps to a higher resolution, per BBC.Satellite imagery plays an increasingly important role in investigating human rights abuses across the world. In 2017, Human Rights Watch partnered with satellite-imaging and data company Planet Labs to document rights violations, especially in countries where investigators face restrictions, like Myanmar or Syria. The satellite images provided by Planet Labs showed the widespread burning of ethnic Rohingya villages in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-conflict-why-densely-populated-gaza-blurry-on-google-maps-101621263791928.html
17-05-2021||World||Singapore’s unlinked Covid-19 cases tied to Indian variant||The highly transmissible strain of Covid-19 that surfaced in India has become more prominent among Singapore’s growing number of unlinked cases, in a sign that hidden chains of transmission of the variant have existed for some time.Of the 17 unlinked cases identified on Sunday, six patients whose ages range from 29 to 57 years old preliminarily tested positive for the strain known as B.1.617, according to updated Ministry of Health data published overnight. Among them is a driver who was tested for the virus after developing a runny nose, an auxiliary police officer who had body aches, and an unemployed Malaysian national who saw a doctor after experiencing fever and cough. Among them, two had gotten their first vaccine dose already.There have also been cases tied to the India variant in the infection clusters seen at the country’s airport and a large public hospital.All in, Singapore reported 38 new cases of Covid-19 infection in the community on Sunday, the highest number in more than a year. The spike in unlinked local cases -- which increased to 32 cases in the past week from six cases the week before -- comes as Singapore returns to the lockdown-like conditions it last imposed a year ago, banning dining-in and limiting gatherings to two people. While the outbreak is smaller than the one last year centered on migrant workers, it is being driven by new variants, which are causing fierce new waves and outpacing vaccination progress in many places around the world.On Sunday, Singapore further announced it will stop most in-person school classes this week, with its education minister saying some of the variants appear to attack younger children.Countries like the U.K. have said the strain could lead to a major surge in cases and is accelerating its vaccine rollout. Meanwhile, Singapore’s inoculation pace has been limited by supplies. The city-state is now studying holding off the second vaccine shot so that more people can get at least the first dose.“If supply is limited, then giving more people a single dose while waiting for more supplies is a good strategy because the protection from the mRNA vaccines after one dose is quite high, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.Vaccination PaceShe co-authored a study last month looking at requirements for herd immunity in Australia’s New South Wales, which has a population size comparable to Singapore’s. If using a vaccine of 90% efficacy against all infections, it finds you need 66% of the population to be fully vaccinated. So far, Singapore has vaccinated 1.9 million people, or a third of the population, with the first dose. About 1.3 million have received both doses.“All precautions must continue while the vaccination program continues,” she said. MacIntyre said that if the Indian variant, that is more transmissible, is dominant, “achieving herd immunity will require higher vaccination rates - maybe 75-80% vaccinated.”Singapore’s virus situation could be more dangerous than it was just before a similar lockdown last year, warned David Lye, an associate professor at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, according to the Straits Times. The many cases with no linkage suggest that the spread to the community from the outbreak at Changi Airport may be “wide and far,” he said, according to the paper.Singapore has reacted aggressively to the flareup linked to the variant by barring visitors from India last month and extending quarantines at government-designated facilities to three weeks.“New strains of the Covid-19 virus seem to have slightly different characteristics from the previous strains,” Chan Chun Sing, the new education minister said at a briefing on Sunday announcing the new school measures. “But one of the things that we have seen seems to be -- at least from our numbers -- there are more children who seem to have contracted this virus, so of course that is an area of great concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapores-unlinked-covid-19-cases-tied-to-indian-variant-101621264616160.html

This will be in the tens of millions in terms of impact on our systems, there's no doubt about it," HSE Chief Executive Paul Reid told national broadcaster RTE."Even as we get those systems back up there is a period of time where it is impossible to say what will stay stable so we are in for a period well beyond this week of monitoring the impact of this."Cancellations in parts of the country included radiotherapy appointments, cardiac checks, x-rays, CT scans and the processing of non-emergency blood tests as some hospitals were hit harder than others.There was widespread cancellation of radiology services across the country due to its reliance on the IT system, the HSE said.Some hospitals' information had been compromised, Reid said, adding that officials did not yet know the extent of the breach.Ireland's minister responsible for e-government Ossian Smyth said as most of HSE's data is administrative, clinical data was unlikely to be breached. He said he understood that the health services' backup files were unaffected so there is no data loss.Ransomware attacks typically involve the infection of computers with malicious software. Users are left locked out of their systems, with the demand that a ransom be paid to restore computer functions.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin has said the government will not pay any ransom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-ransomware-attack-to-cost-health-service-millions-of-euros-for-rebuilding-it-systems-101621255992531.html

Several Democratic U.S. senators of color, including Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, are also expected to appear.The event is part of a broader effort to ensure that AAPI voters, long overlooked, are recognized as an increasingly crucial political force. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States and served as a key piece of President Joe Biden's winning coalition in November's election."The AAPI community does now have the loudest voice we've ever had," said Varun Nikore, the executive director of the AAPI Victory Fund. "One of the reasons the voice is so loud is because we're asking – and in certain cases demanding – much more from our government."Amid a wave of anti-Asian hate crimes, AAPI voter turnout surged more than 45% from 2016's presidential election to 2020, according to the voting analytics firm TargetSmart – nearly four times the increase among all other voters.

17-05-2021||World||Blinken says haven't seen Israeli evidence on AP Gaza building strike||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he has not seen any Israeli evidence of Hamas operating in the Gaza office building hit by airstrike over the weekend. Blinken says he has asked Israel for justification for the strike.Blinken spoke at a news conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, as pressure is increasing on the Biden administration to ask for a ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israel destroyed a building housing The Associated Press and other media, and claimed that Hamas used the building for a military intelligence office.“Shortly after the strike we did request additional details regarding the justification for it,” Blinken said. He declined to discuss specific intelligence, saying he “will leave it to others to characterize if any information has been shared and our assessment that information.”But he said, “I have not seen any information provided.”UN Security Council diplomats and Muslim foreign ministers convened emergency weekend meetings to demand a stop to civilian bloodshed as Israeli warplanes carried out the deadliest single attacks in nearly a week of Hamas rocket barrages and Israeli airstrikes.President Joe Biden gave no signs of stepping up public pressure on Israel to agree to an immediate cease-fire despite calls from some Democrats for the Biden administration to get more involved.His ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told an emergency high-level meeting of the Security Council that the United States was “working tirelessly through diplomatic channels" to stop the fighting.But as battles between Israel and Gaza's militant Hamas rulers surged to their worst levels since 2014 and the international outcry grew, the Biden administration — determined to wrench US foreign policy focus away from the Middle East and Afghanistan — has declined so far to criticize Israel's part in the fighting or send a top-level envoy to the region. Appeals by other countries showed no sign of progress.Thomas-Greenfield warned that the return to armed conflict would only put a negotiated two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict even further out of reach. However, the United States, Israel's closest ally, has so far blocked days of efforts by China, Norway and Tunisia to get the Security Council to issue a statement, including a call for the cessation of hostilities.In Israel, Hady Amr, a deputy assistant dispatched by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to try to de-escalate the crisis, met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who thanked the US for its support.Blinken himself headed out on an unrelated tour of Nordic countries, with no announced plans to stop in the Middle East in response to the crisis. He made calls from the plane to Egypt and other nations working to broker a cease-fire, telling Egypt that all parties “should de-escalate tensions and bring a halt to the violence.”Rep. Adam Schiff, Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, urged Biden on Sunday to step up pressure on both sides to end current fighting and revive talks to resolve Israel's conflicts and flashpoints with the Palestinians.“I think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence, bring about a cease-fire, end these hostilities, and get back to a process of trying to resolve this long-standing conflict,” Schiff, a California Democrat, told CBS's “Face the Nation.”And Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, the senior Republican on the foreign relations subcommittee for the region, joined Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the subcommittee chairman, in asking both sides to cease fire. “As a result of Hamas' rocket attacks and Israel's response, both sides must recognize that too many lives have been lost and must not escalate the conflict further,” the two said.Biden focused on civilian deaths from Hamas rockets in a call with Netanyahu on Saturday, and a White House readout of the call made no mention of the US urging Israel to join in a cease-fire that regional countries were pushing. Thomas-Greenfield said US diplomats were engaging with Israel, Egypt and Qatar, along with the UN.Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, medics said, bringing the toll since Hamas and Israel opened their air and artillery battles to at least 188 killed in Gaza and eight in Israel. Some 55 children in Gaza and a 5-year-old boy in Israel were among the dead.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israelis in a televised address Sunday that Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” on Hamas. That will “take time,” Netanyahu said, signaling the war would rage on for now.Representatives of Muslim nations met Sunday to demand Israel halt attacks that are killing Palestinian civilians in the crowded Gaza strip. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called on “the international community to take urgent action to immediately stop military operations.”The meeting of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation also saw Turkey and some others criticize a US-backed push under which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other Islamic nations signed bilateral deals with Israel to normalize their relations, stepping over the wreckage of collapsed international efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians long-term.“The massacre of Palestinian children today follows the purported normalization,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. tAt the virtual meeting of the Security Council, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was actively engaging all parties for an immediate cease-fire.Returning to the scenes of Palestinian militant rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes in the fourth such war between Israel and Hamas, “only perpetuates the cycles of death, destruction and despair, and pushes farther to the horizon any hopes of coexistence and peace,” Guterres said.Eight foreign ministers spoke at the Security Council session, reflecting the seriousness of the conflict, with almost all urging an end to the fighting.Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, had thrown US support solidly behind Israel, embracing Netanyahu as an ally in Trump's focus on confronting Iran. Trump gave little time to efforts by past US administrations to push peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, instead encouraging and rewarding Arab nations that signed two-country normalization deals with Israel.Biden, instead, calls Middle East and Central Asia conflicts a distraction from US foreign policy priorities, including competition with China.He's sought to calm some conflicts and extricate the US from others, including ending US military support for a Saudi-led war in Yemen, planning to pull US troops from Afghanistan, and trying to return to a nuclear deal with Iran that Israel opposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-says-haven-t-seen-israeli-evidence-on-ap-gaza-building-strike-101621253975688.html
17-05-2021||World||CDC chief wants unvaccinated people to be ‘honest with themselves’. Here’s why||The latest guidelines from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on face masks drew mixed reactions as critics found it inconsistent with what the agency had recently recommended. The CDC on Thursday announced that fully vaccinated individuals don’t need to wear masks indoors or outdoors, “except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.” The announcement came days after CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky told a Senate hearing that Americans should continue wearing masks.While some states have decided to keep the mask mandates, for now, in place, several states rushed to update their rules to match with federal guidelines even as just over 37% of the total US population has been fully vaccinated. According to the CDC, around 40% of the adult population is yet to receive at least one dose of vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Also Read | CDC’s new mask change as a surprise, creates confusion for businessesAfter the mask mandate was lifted for fully vaccinated people, critics questioned how the authorities were supposed to enforce masking for unvaccinated individuals. When Walensky was asked at CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ whether she trusted people would wear a mask if they were unvaccinated, the CDC chief replied, "I think that people who were not inclined to wear a mask, were not inclined to wear a mask before Thursday.”"What we're really asking in those settings, is to say, in terms of the honour system, people have to be honest with themselves," Walensky said. "You're protected if you're vaccinated, you're not if you're not vaccinated."In another TV appearance, Walensky stressed the health agency is asking people to take their health into their own hands by getting vaccinated. In an interview on ABC's 'This Week', the CDC director said that the "foundational step" of lifting the mask mandate for fully vaccinated people was completely based on science. “For the unvaccinated, our policy has not changed,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-wants-unvaccinated-people-to-be-honest-with-themselves-here-s-why-101621249661484.html
17-05-2021||World||Israel kills Islamic Jihad commander, Palestinians renew rocket barrage||Israel killed a senior Palestinian militant commander in Gaza on Monday in air strikes which it said also targeted underground tunnels used by Hamas, and Islamist groups renewed rocket attacks on Israeli cities.The violence entered a second week with no sign of an end to the fiercest hostilities in the region in years, despite growing international concern and mounting calls for a ceasefire.The death of Hussam Abu Harbeed, Islamic Jihad's armed commander for north Gaza, was likely to draw a fierce response from the militant group that is fighting alongside Hamas, the Islamist movement that governs the coastal enclave.The Israeli military said in a statement that Harbeed had been "behind several anti-tank missile terror attacks against Israeli civilians," and an Israel general said separately that his country could carry on the fight "forever".At least three Palestinians were also killed by an Israeli air strike on a car in Gaza City on Monday, medics said, after a night of heavy Israeli air strikes. Israel's military said Gaza militants had fired about 60 rockets towards Israeli cities overnight, down from 120 and 200 the two previous nights.Another Palestinian was killed in an aerial attack on the town of Jabalya, medics aid, and Gaza health officials put the death toll since the hostilities flared last week at 201, including 58 children and 34 women. Ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children, Israeli authorities say.After rockets were fired from Gaza at the Israeli cities of Beersheba and Ashkelon, Israeli jets bombed what the military said were 15 km (nine miles) of underground tunnels used by Hamas. It also struck nine residences belonging to high-ranking Hamas commanders, it said.With the sounds of Israeli bombardment continuing throughout the morning, some Gaza residents rushed to bakeries and drugstores to stock up on bread and other essentials."My children couldn't sleep all night even after the wave of intensive bombing stopped," said Umm Naeem, 50, a mother of five, as she shopped for bread in Gaza City. "What is happening to us is too much, but Jerusalem deserves all the sacrifices."A number of people were lightly injured after a rocket hit a building in the Israeli coastal city of Ashdod, police said.After a rocket hit a synagogue in the coastal city of Ashkelon, one resident, Osher Bugam, said: "We have to continue the war until there is long-term ceasefire - (one) that is not temporary."'WAR OF ATTRITION'Hamas began its rocket assault last Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city's al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.World concern had already deepened after an Israeli air strike in Gaza that destroyed several homes on Sunday and which Palestinian health officials said killed 42 people, including 10 children, and persistent rocket attacks on Israeli towns.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, whose country is a strong ally of Israel, called for tensions to deescalate after speaking to Egypt's foreign minister on Sunday. U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration was working with all parties towards achieving sustained calm.Brigadier General Yaron Rosen, a former Israeli air division commander, gave no indication on Monday there would be a let-up in attacks in what he called a "war of attrition"."The IDF (Israeli military) can go with this forever. And they (Hamas) can go on with their rockets, sadly, also for a very long time. But the price they are paying is rising higher and higher," he told reporters.The Israeli military said at least 130 Palestinian combatants had been killed since fighting began. Harbeed had been a commander with Islamic Jihad for 15 years and was behind an attack on the first day of hostilities last week, it said.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the weekend the United Nations was "actively engaging all sides toward an immediate ceasefire".The United States said on Sunday it had made clear to Israel, the Palestinians and others that it was ready to offer support "should the parties seek a ceasefire".Jordan's King Abdullah said his kingdom was involved in intensive diplomacy to halt the bloodshed, but gave no details.The Israeli military said Hamas, a group regarded by Israel, the United States and the European Union as a terrorist movement, and other armed factions had fired about 3,150 rockets from Gaza over the past week. Israel's missile defence system intercepted most of them, it said.Hamas said its attacks were in retaliation for Israel's "ongoing aggression against civilians".The Israeli military said civilian casualties were unintentional and that its jets attacked a tunnel system used by militants, which collapsed, bringing the homes down. Hamas called it "pre-meditated killing".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-kills-islamic-jihad-commander-palestinians-renew-rocket-barrage-101621250143520.html
17-05-2021||World||How East Jerusalem flashpoint Sheikh Jarrah got its own hashtag||Israeli police in riot gear pushed a Palestinian protester to the ground in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, a moment captured on the smartphones of people looking on."See what they're doing! They're beating up women!" Aya Khalaf, a Palestinian social media influencer, screamed in the background as she caught the May 9 incident on a live stream to her 187,000 Instagram followers.The scene is one of several shared on social media from the near-nightly confrontations between Israeli police and protesters against the expulsion of eight Palestinian families from the neighbourhood, which is claimed by Jewish settlers.The hashtag "#SaveSheikhJarrah" has gained momentum overseas, with British singer Dua Lipa and Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis among those expressing solidarity.In October last year, an Israeli court ruled in favour of settlers who say the Palestinian families are living on land that used to belong to Jews.Palestinians are appealing the decision at Israel's Supreme Court.But a court hearing was delayed earlier this month amid rising tensions at Sheikh Jarrah - which lies just a few minutes' walk from the Old City's Damascus Gate, another recent flashpoint.Anger over the proposed evictions was a key factor behind tensions in Jerusalem over the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which last week escalated far beyond the holy city into the worst hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians for years.Portraying itself as the defender of Palestinians in Jerusalem, the militant Islamist group Hamas launched a rocket assault on Israel, which hit back with multiple air and artillery strikes on Gaza.A week later, nearly 200 people have been killed in Gaza, including 58 children, Gaza's health ministry said, and 10 people have been killed in Israel, two of them children, according to authorities.On Sunday in Sheikh Jarrah, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian driver who had crashed his car into a police roadblock, injuring six officers.Area Coveted By Both SidesA tree-lined area of sandstone homes, Sheikh Jarrah is named after a personal physician to Saladin, the Muslim conqueror who seized Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187.It also houses a site revered by religious Jews as the tomb of an ancient high priest.The settlers who filed the lawsuit say they bought the land from two Jewish associations that purchased it at the end of the 19th century. Palestinians, who question the legitimacy of the settlers' documents, have lived there since the 1950s.Standing outside a settler house that sits beside Palestinian neighbours, Yaakov, a religious Jew who gave only his first name, said: "This is traditionally a Jewish neighbourhood ... the Jordanians and the UN settled Arab refugees in these houses, so if there are any settlers here it's the Arabs who are living here."Pessimistic about the chances of winning their eviction case in Israeli courts, Palestinian residents have turned to social media."I now have around a quarter of a million followers," said Mohammed El-Kurd, 23. "I believe that these people are an electronic army."In one scene that went viral, his twin sister, Muna, was filmed shouting "You are stealing my house!" at an Israeli. "If I don't steal it, someone else is going to steal it," he shouted back.Instagram and Twitter were criticised by some social media users earlier this month after they noticed that posts documenting events in East Jerusalem were being deleted. The social media platforms issued an apology, blaming technical errors.Israel captured East Jerusalem in a 1967 war, later annexing it in a move not recognised by most of the international community who regard settlements there as illegal.Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, citing historical and religious ties to the land. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-east-jerusalem-flashpoint-sheikh-jarrah-got-its-own-hashtag-101621250155567.html

It was also still targeting for tourism to account for 10% of GDP, up from 3%, by 2030, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-reopen-to-foreign-tourists-soon-says-official-101621246719522.html
17-05-2021||World||'Area of concern': Singapore warns new virus strains infecting more children||Singapore will close schools from Wednesday as authorities warned new coronavirus strains like the one first detected in India were affecting more children in the city-state.The government has been tightening restrictions following a recent rise in local transmissions after months of near-zero cases.At a virtual news conference late Sunday, authorities announced that primary and secondary schools as well as junior colleges would shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday until the end of the school term on May 28.Hours before Sunday's news conference, Singapore confirmed 38 locally transmitted coronavirus cases, the highest daily count in eight months. Some of the cases involved children linked to a cluster at a tuition centre.Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, citing a conversation he had with the ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak, told a news conference Sunday that the B.1.617 strain "appears to affect children more".The strain was first detected in India."Some of these mutations are much more virulent and they seem to attack the younger children," Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said at the news conference."This is an area of concern for all of us," he said, adding however that none of the children who had been infected were seriously ill.The government is "working out the plans" to vaccinate students under the age of 16, Chan said in a Facebook post.The financial hub joins Taiwan in shutting down schools to stem the surge in infections.Taiwan's capital Taipei and adjacent New Taipei City announced Monday that schools would suspend classes from Tuesday until May 28.Taiwan, which emerged relatively unscathed last year, announced a further 333 local cases Monday, bringing the total to just over 2,000.The rise in local transmissions in Singapore will probably scupper a quarantine-free travel bubble with Hong Kong, due to begin on May 26 after an earlier failed attempt.Singapore has limited public gatherings to two, banned restaurant dine-ins and closed gyms in an attempt to stop the surge in infections.Authorities have also banned non-passengers from entering the airport terminal and closed an adjacent mall as around 9,000 workers undergo testing.Singapore had to fight serious coronavirus outbreaks last year when the illness surged through crowded dormitories housing low-paid foreign workers, infecting tens of thousands.But by global standards, its outbreak has been mild -- officials in the city of 5.7 million have reported more than 61,000 cases so far and 31 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/area-of-concern-singapore-warns-new-virus-strains-infecting-more-children-101621241839474.html

He added, "They will be using this income for killing people of Myanmar."He called for support for the national unity government, which was set up by those opposed to military rule. He also asked countries in the region to give refuge to people forced to leave their homes due to the military's actions, such as airstrikes, reported NHK World.Kyaw also talked about the reported move by some anti-coup protesters to take up arms to confront the military.He said that when people's patience reaches a limit, it is difficult to convince them to keep protesting peacefully. He added, "Now we are taking all measures to protect people of Myanmar by ourselves."Kyaw then made the three-finger salute, a sign of resistance against the military, and said, "The military coup must fail, democracy must prevail in Myanmar."He has been staying on as UN Ambassador despite being removed by the military as the country's envoy after condemning the junta at the UN General Assembly. He is currently facing an arrest warrant after being charged with high treason.On February 1, the Myanmar military overthrew the civilian government and declared a year-long state of emergency.

17-05-2021||World||Sanofi-GSK reports success in virus vaccine, after setback||Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline’s potential Covid-19 vaccine triggered strong immune responses in all adult age groups in preliminary trials, boosting optimism the shot may join the fight against the pandemic this year.After two doses of the vaccine candidate, participants showed neutralizing antibodies in line with those found in people who had recovered from the disease, according to results of the Phase 2 trial released Monday. The drugmakers said they plan to begin late-stage trials and production in the coming weeks and hope to win regulatory approval for the vaccine before the end of 2021.Regulators have already authorized a number of Covid-19 vaccines, though experts say more are needed as public health authorities around the world race to vaccinate their residents amid a pandemic that has already killed more than 3.3 million people and caused economic havoc.The Sanofi-GSK vaccine was an important part of the European Union's vaccination strategy, and had notably been championed by French President Emmanuel Macron's government. But researchers had to reformulate it after early testing produced an inadequate immune response in older people.The Sanofi-GSK candidate joins about a dozen vaccines now undergoing late-stage trials. The companies plan to produce up to 1 billion doses annually, and they have signed agreements to supply the U.S., Canada and developing countries, too. Public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people.“We know multiple vaccines will be needed, especially as variants continue to emerge and the need for effective and booster vaccines, which can be stored at normal temperatures increases,” said Thomas Triomphe, head of Sanofi’s vaccines unit.The results released Monday were from a Phase 2 trial involving 722 volunteers aged 18 to 95 who were recruited in the U.S. and Honduras.The late-stage trial will involve about 37,000 participants from countries around the world, the companies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofigsk-reports-success-in-virus-vaccine-after-setback-101621232515960.html
17-05-2021||World||PLA modernises Xinjiang's military units in 'reaction' to India-China LAC row||There is abundant evidence, from online social media releases of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and state-controlled media, that the Chinese military has intensified efforts to modernize ground units in the Xinjiang Military District.The Xinjiang Military District is one part of the Western Theater Command. The latter boasts some 90,000-120,000 ground troops, principally divided into the 76th and 77th Group Armies (headquartered in the interior cities of Chongqing and Baoji respectively), according to research by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University in the USA.However, the Western Theater Command does not possess direct ground operational authority in the restive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. Instead, both these high-altitude regions have their very own army-directed military districts to control the security situation.The Xinjiang Military District itself contains some 50,000-60,000 army troops, according to Dennis Blasko, a former US Army attache to Beijing and Hong Kong. Other analysis, such as that by the Belfer Center, believes the PLA has 70,000 ground troops in the district. Whichever figure is true, the fact is that Xinjiang Military District owns more troops than Tibet does, which controls an estimated 40,000 soldiers.Interestingly, the Xinjiang Military District in the far west of China has perpetually been something of a pauper when it comes to receiving the newest military equipment. This is probably because of a number of different reasons, chief amongst them being that the PLA is geared primarily for a conflict with Taiwan, and so units near that island nation are prioritized for the most modern combat gear. Additionally, Xinjiang's borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan are relatively secure, with no direct threat of cross-border intrusions.An order of battle compiled from several sources comes up with the following units in Xinjiang Military District: three motorized infantry divisions (the 4th, 8th and 11th Motorized Infantry Divisions); the 6th Mechanized Infantry Division; a special operations brigade; the 2nd Artillery Brigade; a "high-powered artillery brigade; two infantry regiments (the 1st and 2nd Independent Regiments); the 13th Air Defense Brigade; an engineer regiment; the 3rd Aviation Brigade; an intelligence/reconnaissancebrigade; and additional logistics units.There are also two border defense regiments (12th and 13th Border Defense Regiments). The PLARF has 646 Brigade near Korla. The brigade was known to have DF-21C medium-range ballistic missiles, but it seems likely the brigade has been re-equipped with the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile. PLA units are dispersed widely around Xinjiang, China's largest province that spans a staggering 1.6 million square kilometers.Right up till last year, these units were predominantly equipped with older equipment such as Type 88 main battle tanks, Type 63 armored personnel carriers and elderly towed artillery pieces. These are in no way cutting edge, especially compared to some of the flashy new gear appearing in other combined arms brigades in more favored PLA units and theaters.However, 2021 has been an exciting one for PLA soldiers in the Xinjiang Military District! Waves of new combat systems are rolling in to help modernize key units in the province. Of course, Chinese state media likes to herald such new arrivals, since it contributes to state propaganda efforts. However, it is useful to note in detail what new systems have already been inducted before the first half of 2021 has even concluded.Most recently, in May, delivery of new PHL-03 multiple rocket launchers was reported. It is likely that these 8x8 truck-based rocket launchers were delivered to the "high-powered" artillery brigade, since the PHL-03 is a key artillery system in the PLA. Video footage revealed ten such PHL-03 MRLs arrayed at a commissioning ceremony, along with four trans-loader vehicles and four support trucks.Also new in May for Xinjiang appears to be the PCL-161 self-propelled howitzer. The PCL-161 is a 122mm-caliber howitzer installed on a 4x4 lightly armored truck chassis. These have probably been rolled out to one or more of the district's motorized infantry divisions. The advantages of the PCL-161 are enormous compared to existing lumbering towed howitzers that take time to set up and depart from a firing position.Just three months earlier, the PCL-181 self-propelled howitzer arrived in Xinjiang. An even more sophisticated artillery piece for the PLA, the PCL-181 is mounted on a 6x6 truck chassis and it boasts a 155mm-caliber gun. This type of mobile, wheeled system would be distributed to artillery brigades to again replace obsolete towed howitzers.Artillery systems like the PHL-03, PCL-161 and PCL-181 enjoy greater digitization than their predecessors. They are typically accompanied by command-and-control and reconnaissance vehicles, as well as medium-altitude drones in the air. This networked capability results in targeting and fire missions that are far more precise. Taken together, then, these new artillery assets are critical to beefing up the PLA in China's far west.What about armored vehicles? Significantly, Chinese Type 15 light tanks - the term "light tank" is relative, for the vehicle still weighs 35 tons - were first observed in Xinjiang in February. Photos showed that at least ten of these ZTQ-15 tanks had been delivered, with the likely recipient being the 6th Armor Regiment of the 6th Mechanized Infantry Division. These tanks are more maneuverable in mountainous terrain thanks to their nimbleness and weight compared to a heavier and larger main battle tank.Instead of older vehicles like the tracked Type 63 armored personnel carrier, footage of the much more modern ZBL-09 8x8 infantry fighting vehicle with 30mm cannon was finally released in May. A CCTV article said the ZBL-09 type had been issued to a combined arms brigade in Xinjiang, with live-firing practice taking place near the Karakorum mountain range. This Type 09 family of combat vehicles is diverse, with all kinds of variants in service, but the 8x8 wheeled vehicle allows units to move quickly by road.With Chinese media having announced that a Type 09-based ambulance was already serving in Xinjiang, it was only a matter of time before news of main combat vehicles of the family (like the ZBL-09) be released as well. It is still unclear which unit(s) has received the ZBL-09, but it will presumably be one of the motorized infantry divisions.Meanwhile, the PLA's 84th Army Aviation Brigade based in Wujiaqu also has the very latest helicopter types in service. CCTV footage from February showed Z-20 and Z-8G helicopters performing a mission with several Z-10 attack helicopters.The Z-20, a blatant copy of the American Black Hawk platform, is the newest addition to the PLA helicopter fleet. It was designed for optimal performance at high altitudes, making it well suited to flying in Xinjiang and Tibet. The Z-8G, meanwhile, represents the latest generation of the long-serving Z-8 helicopter family.When we put all these revelations together, we can sense huge impetus to PLA efforts to beef up its fighting capability in Xinjiang. But why?It is obviously a reaction to last year's tensions with India along the Line of Actual Control. Whereas Tibet had been prioritized for new equipment long before Xinjiang was, "ugly stepsister" Xinjiang was finally thrust into the limelight after India refused to back down against Chinese territorial aggression in the areas of Galwan and Lake Pangong in 2020. Instead of forcing the Xinjiang Military District to respond with elderly, and probably dilapidated in some cases, equipment, the PLA has urgently funneled equipment such as artillery, armored vehicles and helicopters into Xinjiang.One could argue that this equipment was going to trickle down to Xinjiang in any case, but last year's border confrontation definitely seems to have sped up the process and given it greater urgency. Indeed, it is rather impressive, and scary for China's neighbors, to see how rapidly the PLA can manufacture and distribute new systems.Of course, it is possible that China is waging a carefully calculated propaganda campaign to intimidate neighbors like India. It may be that the new equipment is not reaching Xinjiang in large numbers, and that its arrival in small batches of equipment is simply being milked to maximum effect.Nonetheless, it does not change the fact that the PLA has been rapid in its development, manufacture and distribution of new equipment. While Indian Ministry of Defence procurements remain mired in red tape and bureaucratic inertia, the PLA is forging ahead. Chairman Xi Jinping has prioritized the modernization and mechanization of the PLA, and that this is happening is undeniable even in former forgotten backwaters like Xinjiang.General Zhao Zongqi, former head of the Western Theater Command, stepped down in December 2020, after nearly five years in the job. He was replaced by General Zhang Xudong, who prior to that had been commander of Central Theater Command ground forces.Intriguing is the role of Lieutenant General Xu Qiling, who Chinese media reported on 1 June 2020 had taken up the post of commander of Western Theater Command ground forces. Xu, formerly serving in the Eastern Theater Command, essentially swapped posts with incumbent He Weidong. This lateral exchange is a most unusual occurrence, and the fact that it was reported during a time of tensions suggests he may have been called in as a firm hand to oversee PLA activities. Blasko described it as "a strange move in the middle of a crisis".Speaking of the border tensions with India, the Belfer Center noted: "This means that China is regularly operating with a permanent Indian conventional force advantage along its border areas. In the event of a major standoff or conflict with India, it would have to rely upon mobilization primarily from Xinjiang and secondarily from the Western Theater Command forces deeper in China's interior. By contrast, Indian forces are already largely in position."Of course, one way of overcoming this numerical disadvantage along the Indian border is to beef up the equipment issued to Xinjiang Military District with more modern replacements, as we indeed see occurring.The Nanjiang (Southern Xinjiang) Military District is responsible for the Aksai Chin area along the Indian border. The 6th Mechanized Infantry Division with 10,000-13,000 personnel is important since it is the closest to Aksai Chin, the location where last year's Galwan Valley bloodbath occurred. Notably, only one Chinese highway (called G219) leads into the area.Once border defense and other services like the PLA Air Force and PLA Rocket Force are included, the Western Theater Command possesses some 235,000 personnel.According to Blasko, however, only a "small fraction is deployed near the Indian border, primarily because the restrictive mountainous terrain and high altitude limit the effectiveness, and increase the vulnerability, of large mechanized formations. This terrain favors the defense over mechanized attack confined to valley floors, especially if the defense is from fortified emplacements on the high ground."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-modernises-xinjiang-s-military-units-in-reaction-to-india-china-lac-row-101621231048385.html
17-05-2021||World||China’s rise pushes US toward action on Competitiveness Bill||Bipartisan concern about China’s rising influence is driving the Senate toward passage of legislation aimed at bolstering US competitiveness in technology and manufacturing and delivering money to spur the domestic semiconductor industry.The Senate is poised to begin action this week on the package of bills based on a proposal from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young with the goal of finishing by the end of the month.The main part of the bill would authorize more than $100 billion over five years to boost research and development of innovative technology and manufacturing at colleges, universities and other institutions and create a new entity within the National Science Foundation to focus on technology.It’s also expected to include a $50 billion emergency appropriation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as funding for a communications security initiative designed to counter China’s dominance of 5G networks, according to a person familiar with the matter.The package is being pushed toward passage on an aggressive timetable by Schumer. The fervour among Democrats and Republicans to counter about China’s challenge to US economic primacy has made the legislation, known as the Endless Frontiers Act, one of the few bills to draw broad support at time when partisan divisions are running deep. Its fate also may serve as an indicator for other proposals, such as infrastructure, that have nominal bipartisan support.“Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our country slip, exposing critical weak spots in our economy,” Schumer last week, setting up the first vote on the legislation. “If we don’t fix them, we will no longer be the number one economic leader in the world.”Related to that goal is a separate proposal expected to be included that would provide $50 billion for a program aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the US that was passed as part of the 2021 defense bill but never funded. The proposal has gained urgency as a global shortage of semiconductors causes economic pain in the US, shutting down auto plants because of a lack of chips for cars and trucks.Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas has been working on the proposal with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona along with others and said he expects it will supported by the White House as well as Senate Republicans. President Joe Biden in his broader infrastructure proposal has called for as much as $50 billion to expand US chipmaking.“If China decided to cut off our supply of semiconductors it would be like the Strait of Hormuz is to oil,” Cornyn said. “It would be a disaster economically.”Despite generally broad support, the Endless Frontier Act was the subject of a sometimes contentious markup session in the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday.Scores of amendments were proposed and some were adopted, sometimes over the protest of co-sponsor Young. In particular, he called an amendment proposed by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a “poison pill” because it would divert some of the funding to the Department of Energy for its network of national laboratories. Among those is the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Funding Shift“I am disappointed that an amendment was adopted to divert significant funding away from the NSF Tech Directorate in favor of a program outside of the Committee’s jurisdiction,” Young said in a statement after the bill was approved by the committee.“I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure the final product lives up to its billing – a bold investment in research, education, technology transfer, and the core strengths of the US innovation ecosystem,” he said.The legislation has been carved up into separate tranches, with about half of the money going to the core functions of the National Science Foundation and another almost $30 billion going to help stand up a new tech directorate within the agency.Lujan’s amendment sends about $17 billion to the national labs. His co-sponsors included GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, all of whom represent states where the national labs have a presence. Lujan’s amendment passed 23 to 5 and the overall bill passed the Commerce Committee by 24-4.Such political horse-trading -- along with a bipartisan desire to confront China -- may be key to passage in the Senate.The Endless Frontier Act, which is supported by numerous industry and trade groups, will be combined with a bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year and with proposals from other Senate committees, including Banking and the HELP committee. Senators will also be able to offer amendments on the floor. The process for passing the overall package is estimated to take two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-rise-pushes-us-toward-action-on-competitiveness-bill-101621229649908.html
17-05-2021||World||China suggests ‘two-state solution’ to stop Israel-Palestine conflict||China has suggested a “two-state solution” and urged the US to shoulder its responsibilities in stopping the escalating Israel-Palestine tension at the UN Security Council meeting (UNSC) held on Sunday.Putting forward a four-point proposal in context of the ongoing tension, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi said a “a two-state” solution was the “…fundamental way out”.China, he said, would again push the council to try and agree to a statement.The UN meet was held in the backdrop of violence in the region in which nearly 200 people, majority of them Palestinians including dozens of children, have been killed so far.“China supports the two sides resuming peace talks based on a “two-state solution” as soon as possible, to establish an independent State of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty with East Jerusalem as its capital and based on the 1967 border, and fundamentally realise the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel, realise the harmonious coexistence of the Arab and Jewish nations, and realise lasting peace in the Middle East,” Wang was quoted as saying by Chinese official media at the virtual UNSC debate on Palestine.Wang said because of the obstruction of the US, the UNSC has not been able to speak with one voice on Palestine.The Chinese diplomat was referring to Washington’s efforts to block the UNSC from issuing a joint statement on Israeli violence in Palestine. “We call upon the US to shoulder its responsibilities, adjust position,” Wang added.Besides the two-state solution, Wang’s four-point proposition included the immediate ceasefire and cessation of violence, humanitarian assistance including lifting the blockade and siege of Gaza at the earliest and ensuring international support in reducing the tension.“…international support is an obligation. The UNSC must take vigorous action on the Palestine-Israel conflict, reiterate its firm support for a “two-state solution”, and push the situation to cool down at an early date,” Wang said.In a separate phone call with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi during the weekend, Wang said China, as the president of the Security Council for May, has pushed the council to hold two emergency consultations on the Palestine-Israel conflict, and has drafted a press statement, in a bid to guide the council to take actions, he added.“But regrettably, the council has so far failed to reach an agreement, with the United States standing on the opposite side of international justice, Wang said, urging all members of the council to shoulder their due responsibilities and make effective efforts to maintain regional peace and security.”China will continue to firmly support the just cause of the Palestinian people to strive for the restoration of their legitimate national rights, support a just solution to the current issue through political dialogue, and support the UN, the League of Arab States, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in playing a constructive role in this regard, Wang said.“The death toll in Gaza jumped to 188 overnight, including 55 children, amid an intensive Israeli air and artillery barrage since the fighting erupted last Monday. Ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children, in thousands of rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups,” Reuters said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suggests-two-state-solution-to-stop-israel-palestine-conflict-101621228811753.html
17-05-2021||World||Beware of ‘misinformation’ virus in India’s Covid battle, warns US surgeon gen||US surgeon general Vivek Murthy has some advice for Indian-Americans and Indians as they deal with the unfolding devastating second wave of Covid-19 cases and wait for that dreaded phone call: watch out for misinformation in what you read, say or forward on social media platforms.“Misinformation is a virus itself, and it harms people, and it sometimes compels them to take actions that puts put them and other people at risk,” Murthy said in a virtual outreach to Indian-Americans on dangers of misinformation as India battles its worst public health crisis in a century.“In a pandemic when you’re responding, information is power and if you can get the right information to people they can take steps to protect themselves,” Murthy said further, adding that the government and the private sector can make all the vaccine and masks they want, but “they will be of no value if people don’t want to use them because of misinformation about them”.The United States and India are two countries hit the hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, with cases and fatalities highest and second highest in the world respectively. They have also been hit hard by misinformation - and sometimes wilful disinformation - that has made some people underestimate Covid-19, suspicious of vaccines and dismissive of masks.Murthy’s remarks were first by a top US health official to address the potential damage inflicted by misinformation on the global response - especially Americans - to the tragedy unfolding in India. The US has sent $100 million worth of government assistance and $400 million from the private sector.If some Americans obsessed once about the magical powers of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, and briefly toyed with injecting household cleaning agents to flush the body of the deadly virus, Indians felt assured in their naturally-built immunity to fight off the virus or consider cow urine.America’s top doctor spoke in personal terms to underscore the ubiquity of the problem, bringing up his parents, who are from Karnataka and came to the United States via the United Kingdom, where Murthy was born. “My parents like many other Indian immigrants of their generation are part of WhatsApp groups,” Murthy said, adding, “they serve a wonderful purpose of keeping them connected to friends and family, but they can also become platforms to which misinformation rapidly spreads and that has been the case”.Social media platforms are facing questions around the world about their content and their culpability. They have begun flagging dodgy content and blocking serially egregious posters such as former president Donald Trump in the US and Bollywood star Kangana Ranaut in India.Murthy’s way forward was couched in terms easily relatable for most Indians and Indian-descent Americans. “Remind yourself that the source matters, right, and the source is not your uncle or aunt or sister or brother who sent it to you on WhatsApp. The source is a person who created that content, who made that video put out that post, right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beware-of-misinformation-virus-in-india-s-covid-battle-warns-us-surgeon-gen-101621227489583.html
17-05-2021||World||UK Covid-19 restrictions eased despite variant concerns||Most of the UK takes a major step towards normality on Monday as coronavirus restrictions are eased, despite concerns over the spread of a more transmissible variant of the disease.Across England, Wales and most of Scotland, indoor hospitality in pubs, restaurants and cafés returns and cinemas, museums and sports venues are to open their doors for the first time in months.But easing will not come until May 24 for Northern Ireland.People and families will also be able to meet with some restrictions inside private houses and international travel will resume to selected nations including Portugal."Together we have reached another milestone in our roadmap out of lockdown, but we must take this next step with a heavy dose of caution," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday."We are keeping the spread of the variant first identified in India under close observation and taking swift action where infection rates are rising," he added.While leaving Monday's easing in place, Johnson last week warned the complete lifting of Covid-19 measures on June 21 could be put in jeopardy by a more transmissible variant that was first detected in India.- Accelerated vaccinations -On Sunday, Johnson said government data did not show the public National Health Service (NHS) under too much pressure.He added that second vaccine doses would be brought forward to protect the over-50s and clinically vulnerable people as measures are lifted and a new variant spreads.Britain, one of the worst-hit countries in the world with over 127,000 deaths, has also seen a rapid deployment of vaccines with over 20 million people now fully vaccinated.According to government data, the variant that first emerged in India is spreading in Britain with cases of the strain rising from 520 to 1,313 last week, centred around the northern towns of Bolton and Blackburn.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government could "stay on course" thanks to a "high degree of confidence" that vaccines would stand up to the strain.He also said the "vast majority" of people in hospital in Bolton with the new variant had been eligible for vaccination but had not come forward.-'Spread like wildfire'-Hancock warned the new strain could "spread like wildfire amongst the unvaccinated groups" and did not rule out localised restrictions.Scotland's western city of Glasgow and northeastern Moray area are upholding existing restrictions due to a surge in cases.Last week, Johnson committed to a full, independent public inquiry into his government's handling of the coronavirus.He has been accused of dithering over a third national lockdown in early January, as surging Covid-19 infections lifted hospital admissions and death rates.Experts and opposition politicians have also blamed Johnson for not restricting travel from India sooner as Covid-19 cases mounted there.But the Conservative government's popularity has enjoyed a "vaccine bounce" from the jabs rollout, with a strong showing in local elections in England.Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said Sunday that "one of the highest vaccine uptake rates in the world" had been crucial to the speedy progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-restrictions-eased-despite-variant-concerns-101621225582177.html

It says over 5,000 people have been arrested, with some 4,000 still detained - including several celebrities.Thuzar Wint Lwin did not make it to the last round of the Miss Universe competition, but she won the award for Best National Costume, which was based on the ethnic costume of her Chin people from northwestern Myanmar, where fighting has raged in recent days between the army and anti-junta militia fighters.As she paraded with her national costume, she held up a placard that said "Pray for Myanmar".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-miss-universe-pageant-myanmar-s-contestant-pleads-our-people-are-dying-101621223464453.html

Apart from this, the premier will also issue guidelines related to the government's strategy to deal with the opposition, reported The News International.Moreover, the ongoing Israeli atrocities in Palestine and Pakistan's role in voicing its support and concerns for Gazans on an international level will also be discussed, Geo News reported.Commenting on the matter, Minister for Interior Shaikh Rashid said that Shahbaz Sharif's name has been placed on the Provisional National Identification List and he is not on a blacklist, as is the common misconception. He said Shahbaz's name has not been placed on the ECL yet."The cabinet has approved the inclusion of Shahbaz Sharif on the ECL as he's trying to flee the country," Shaikh Rashid said.He said that the government will challenge the Lahore High Court (LHC) decision to allow Shahbaz to go abroad for treatment, in the Supreme Court, today.Earlier on May 8, the PML-N leader was barred from flying from the Lahore airport to the UK via Qatar in the early hours of the day by the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA), hours after the LHC granted him permission to travel abroad once for medical treatment.On April 22, a referee bench of the LHC ruled in favour of granting bail to the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly in an asset beyond means and money laundering case, disagreeing with Justice Asjad Javed Ghural's dissenting note to the decision of Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-to-discuss-pml-n-leader-shahbaz-sharif-s-name-for-exit-control-list-101621222807152.html
17-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Schools in US 'under pressure' to reopen for in-person learning||Schools in United States are under pressure to open in-person learning given the authorization of a vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 and new federal guidance that vaccinated people do not need to wear face masks indoors or outdoors.Education Secretary Miguel Cardona in an interview with The Hill reiterated that he expects all schools to fully reopen in the fall and said the vaccine and mask guidance updates this week will likely adjust how schools plan for the next school year."I'm hopeful that with another month under our belt and continued lowered transmission rates, whatever fears some may have about fall are going to dissipate, and we're going to be able to return to school every day, all day for all children," Cardona said.The Education Department has not issued new guidance to schools at this point, but on Saturday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the continued use of masks and social distancing in schools.The Pfizer-BioNTech authorization was granted for most high school-aged students after the administration said it achieved getting a majority of K-8 schools fully reopened by Biden's 100th day in office. Cardona said the administration needs to "aim higher" beyond the original goal and give high schoolers the same opportunity to return.More officials have joined in the appeals to reopen for the upcoming school year in recent days, including Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, who said Thursday that school should be open "full blast" by the fall, as reported by the Hill.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) -- the second-largest teachers union in the U.S. -- announced her support Thursday as well as a USD 5 million campaign to get educators to meet with parents about returning strategies and safety precautions.She told The Hill that vaccines became the "real game-changer" in the effort to get children back in schools, saying it's ramped up in the last few weeks amid a downturn in cases and emerging data on the vaccines' effectiveness."As a result, we felt that it was time to be unequivocal and unambiguous about reopening schools full time, and having the resources to recover and to reimagine," she said.Most parents have expressed support for their children to return to school in recent weeks, with a Hart Research study finding almost three in four parents backed a fully in-person school year starting in the fall, putting additional pressure on schools.The pandemic and the related school closures have pushed millions of women out of the workforce, as many had to end their employment in order to take care of their children as schools operated remotely, as reported by The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-schools-in-us-under-pressure-to-reopen-for-in-person-learning-101621217822209.html
17-05-2021||World||Israel kills 42 in Gaza as Netanyahu warns war will go on||Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, Palestinian medics said — the deadliest single attack in the latest round of violence. Despite the toll and international efforts to broker a cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war with Gaza’s Hamas rulers would rage on.In a televised address, Netanyahu said the attacks were continuing at “full-force” and would “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” on the Hamas militant group, he said, flanked by his defense minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, in a show of unity.Hamas also pressed on, launching rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward civilian areas in Israel. One slammed into a synagogue in the southern city of Ashkelon hours before evening services for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Israeli emergency services said. No injuries were reported.In the Israeli air assault, families were buried under piles of cement rubble and twisted rebar. A yellow canary lay crushed on the ground. Shards of glass and debris covered streets blocks away from the major downtown thoroughfare where the three buildings were hit over the course of five minutes around 1 a.m.The hostilities have repeatedly escalated over the past week, marking the worst fighting in the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians since Israel and Hamas' devastating 2014 war.“I have not seen this level of destruction through my 14 years of work,” said Samir al-Khatib, an emergency rescue official in Gaza. “Not even in the 2014 war."Rescuers furiously dug through the rubble using excavators and bulldozers amid clouds of heavy dust. One shouted, “Can you hear me?” into a hole. Minutes later, first responders pulled a survivor out. The Gaza Health Ministry said 16 women and 10 children were among those killed, with more than 50 people wounded.Haya Abdelal, 21, who lives in a building next to one that was destroyed, said she was sleeping when the airstrikes sent her fleeing into the street. She accused Israel of not giving its usual warning to residents to leave before launching such an attack.“We are tired,” she said, “We need a truce. We can’t bear it anymore.”The Israeli army spokesperson’s office said the strike targeted Hamas “underground military infrastructure."As a result of the strike, “the underground facility collapsed, causing the civilian houses' foundations above them to collapse as well, leading to unintended casualties,” it said.Among those reported killed was Dr. Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, the head of the internal medicine department at Shifa Hospital and a senior member of the hospital's coronavirus management committee. Two of Abu Al-Ouf’s teenage children and two other family members were also buried under the rubble.The death of the 51-year-old physician “was a huge loss at a very sensitive time,” said Mohammed Abu Selmia, the director of Shifa.Gaza’s health care system, already gutted by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed in 2007 after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces, had been struggling with a surge in coronavirus infections even before the latest conflict.Israel's airstrikes have leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest buildings, which Israel alleges contained Hamas military infrastructure. Among them was the building housing The Associated Press Gaza office and those of other media outlets.Sally Buzbee, the AP's executive editor, called for an independent investigation into the airstrike that destroyed the AP office on Saturday.Netanyahu alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating inside the building and said Sunday any evidence would be shared through intelligence channels. Neither the White House nor the State Department would say if any had been seen.“It’s a perfectly legitimate target,” Netanyahu told CBS’s “Face the Nation."Asked if he had provided any evidence of Hamas’ presence in the building in a call Saturday with U.S. President Joe Biden, Netanyahu said: “We pass it through our intelligence people.”Buzbee called for any such evidence to be laid out. “We are in a conflict situation,” Buzbee said. “We do not take sides in that conflict. We heard Israelis say they have evidence; we don’t know what that evidence is.”Meanwhile, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders asked the International Criminal Court on Sunday to investigate Israel’s bombing of the AP building and others housing media organizations as a possible war crime.The Paris-based group said in a letter to the court’s chief prosecutor that the offices of 23 international and local media organizations have been destroyed over the past six days. It said the attacks serve “to reduce, if not neutralize, the media’s capacity to inform the public.”The AP had operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas. The news agency’s cameras, operating from its top floor office and roof terrace, offered 24-hour live shots as militant rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surroundings.“We think it’s appropriate at this point for there to be an independent look at what happened yesterday — an independent investigation,” Buzbee said.The latest outbreak of violence began in east Jerusalem last month, when Palestinians clashed with police in response to Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. A focus of the clashes was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a hilltop compound revered by both Muslims and Jews.Hamas began firing rockets toward Jerusalem on Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza.At least 188 Palestinians have been killed in hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, including 55 children and 33 women, with 1,230 people wounded. Eight people in Israel have been killed in some of the 3,100 rocket attacks launched from Gaza, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group have acknowledged 20 fighters killed in the fighting. Israel says the real number is far higher and has released the names and photos of two dozen alleged operatives it says were “eliminated.”The assault has displaced some 34,000 Palestinians from their homes, U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, where eight foreign ministers spoke about the conflict.Efforts by China, Norway and Tunisia to get the U.N. body to issue a statement, including a call for the cessation of hostilities, have been blocked by the United States, which, according to diplomats, is concerned it could interfere with diplomatic efforts to stop the violence.Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Al-Malki urged the Security Council to take action to end Israeli attacks. Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, urged the council to condemn Hamas' “indiscriminate and unprovoked attacks.”The turmoil has also fueled protests in the occupied West Bank and stoked violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property.On Sunday, a driver rammed into an Israeli checkpoint in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families have been threatened with eviction , injuring six officers before police shot and killed the attacker, Israeli police said.The violence also sparked pro-Palestinian protests in cities across Europe and the United States.Israel appears to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators work to end the fighting and stave off an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza.The Israeli military said it destroyed the home Sunday of Gaza’s top Hamas leader, Yahiyeh Sinwar, in the southern town of Khan Younis.

17-05-2021||World||Long working hours are a killer, WHO study shows||Working long hours is killing hundreds of thousands of people a year in a worsening trend that may accelerate further due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Monday.In the first global study of the loss of life associated with longer working hours, the paper in the journal Environment International showed that 745,000 people died from stroke and heart disease associated with long working hours in 2016.That was an increase of nearly 30% from 2000."Working 55 hours or more per week is a serious health hazard," said Maria Neira, director of the WHO's Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health."What we want to do with this information is promote more action, more protection of workers," she said.The joint study, produced by the WHO and the International Labour Organization, showed that most victims (72%) were men and were middle-aged or older. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the shifts worked.It also showed that people living in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region -- a WHO-defined region which includes China, Japan and Australia -- were the most affected.Overall, the study - drawing on data from 194 countries - said that working 55 hours or more a week is associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease compared with a 35-40 hour working week.The study covered the period 2000-2016, and so did not include the COVID-19 pandemic, but WHO officials said the surge in remote working and the global economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus emergency may have increased the risks."The pandemic is accelerating developments that could feed the trend towards increased working time," the WHO said, estimating that at least 9% of people work long hours.WHO staff, including its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, say they have been working long hours during the pandemic and Neira said the U.N. agency would seek to improve its policy in light of the study.Capping hours would be beneficial for employers since that has been shown to increase worker productivity, WHO technical officer Frank Pega said."It's really a smart choice not to increase long working hours in an economic crisis."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-working-hours-are-a-killer-who-study-shows-101621215824064.html

The spokesperson told The Journal that “his decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter.""When he left Microsoft's board last year, Gates said he was stepping down to focus on philanthropy.Microsoft couldn't be immediately reached for comment.Earlier this month, Bill and Melinda Gates announced that they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage but would keep working together at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest charitable foundations in the world. Gates was formerly the world’s richest person and his fortune is estimated at well over $100 billion.Earlier Sunday, The New York Times reported that Gates had developed “a reputation for questionable conduct in work-related settings."The Times reported that on at least a few occasions, Gates made overtures to women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Times cited people with direct knowledge of his behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-investigated-gates-over-relationship-with-employee-report-101621211906144.html

He also said they are more likely to become infected if exposed because of medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes or obesity.“Now, very few of these comorbidities have racial determinants,” Fauci said. “Almost all relate to the social determinants of health dating back to disadvantageous conditions that some people of color find themselves in from birth regarding the availability of an adequate diet, access to health care and the undeniable effects of racism in our society.”Fauci said correcting societal wrongs will take a commitment of decades, and he urged the graduates to be part of the solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-covid-19-pandemic-highlights-racism-s-impact-101621212163149.html
17-05-2021||World||Covid-19: South Africa to vaccinate 5 million citizens at highest risk of dying||South Africa has announced an ambitious plan to vaccinate by the end of June its five million citizens at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19 in the second phase of its programme to combat the pandemic.Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a national television broadcast on Sunday evening that the first phase had ended on Friday with 478,000 of the planned 500,000 healthcare workers receiving the jab."These (remaining) doses will not be used for Phase 2 or Phase 3, but they will be used by the Medical Research Council to conduct some important studies and programmes that will help us to understand how vaccines work for population groups such as people living with HIV, and pregnant and lactating mothers," Mkhize said.The second phase starting on Monday will see vulnerable people such as those over 60 and those with comorbidities receiving priority before the general public can get vaccinated in the next phase.Mkhize said an overnight delivery of Pfizer vaccines on Sunday would bring the available doses in the country to just over 975,000."We will continue to vaccinate healthcare workers and complete the targeted 1.2 million healthcare workers in the coming week."We will also begin to vaccinate citizens 60 years and older who are most vulnerable of becoming ill or dying of COVID-19. Five million citizens are targeted to be completed by end of June, provided that the supply of vaccines flow as anticipated." the minister said."By the end of June we expect to have received 4.5 million doses of Pfizer and two million doses of Johnson and Johnson once (they are) released (after approval by the Food and Drug Administration in the US)," he said.Mkhize said vaccination would start on Monday at 87 sites across the country, 83 in the public sector and four in the private sector, all of which would be published for public information."We want to scale this up to just over 200 by the end of the week," Mkhize said as he explained that the remaining healthcare workers and those over 60 had already started receiving SMSs to indicate where and when they should report for their vaccinations.Electronic systems were set up a fortnight ago for people to register for vaccination."In all provinces, core teams are conducting robust registration drives and we are seeing that the numbers are already going up because these initiatives are making an impact on the community."To date, over 1.22 million senior citizens have registered," Mkhize said, adding that as the programme moves on, it might be possible for senior citizens who have not been able to register to walk in and get vaccinated, but not at this stage.The programme has been designed to avoid long queues, especially for senior citizens.Over 7,000 residents living in 102 old age homes will be visited personally to receive their vaccinations by the end of May as part of the rollout plan.The vaccination plans were announced soon after Premier David Makhura announced that South Africa's economic hub of Gauteng province was now officially in a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.For the first time in several weeks, South Africa recorded over 3,000 new coronavirus infections in a 24-hour period on Saturday.The Department of Health said 3,221 cases were confirmed, raising the infection count to 1,605,252. There had also been 44 more coronavirus-related deaths during this period, bringing the death toll since the pandemic started to 55,012.The recovery rate has dropped to 94.7 per cent, with 1,520,878 people recuperating so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-south-africa-launches-plan-to-vaccinate-citizens-at-highest-risk-of-dying-101621210106385.html
17-05-2021||World||UNICEF says rich countries can afford to donate Covax jabs||Countries belonging to the G7 and the European Union can afford to donate more than 150 million vaccines to countries in need without compromising their own goals, UNICEF said Monday.The world's seven richest states and the EU could help close the world's vaccine gap by sharing just 20 percent of their June, July and August stocks with the Covax jab scheme for poorer nations, a study by British firm Airfinity showed."And they could do this while still fulfilling their vaccination commitments to their own populations," UNICEF director Henrietta Fore said.The UK is due to host its fellow G7 member states Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US for a summit in June.By that time UNICEF said the Covax programme being co-led by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) will find itself 190 million doses short of what it had planned to distribute.The shortfall is in part due to a devastating flare-up of the virus in India, which was due to manufacture and export the majority of Covax doses and is now instead putting them to use at home.With additional shortages in supplies and funding, the statement called for swift action until more sustainable production models are within reach."Sharing immediately available excess doses is a minimum, essential and emergency stop-gap measure, and it is needed right now," it read.The US has 60 million AstraZeneca doses it could share, while France has pledged 500,000 doses and Sweden 1 million, with Switzerland considering a similar donation.- Yawning gap -Some 44 percent of the 1.4 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far injected around the world have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.3 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world's population.The yawning gap spurred WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to ask vaccine-wealthy nations last Friday to refrain from giving jabs to children and adolescents and instead donate those doses to Covax.The urgency stems from more than mere fairness: wherever the virus continues to circulate it could give rise to more contagious or more deadly variants that could wipe out any progress toward immunity."We are concerned that the deadly spike in India is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded," says UNICEF."Cases are exploding and health systems are struggling in countries near -- like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives -- and far, like Argentina and Brazil."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-says-rich-countries-can-afford-to-donate-covax-jabs-101621209782178.html
17-05-2021||World||Boris urges caution as B.1.617.2 variant from India clouds UK’s unlocking||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the next step out of lockdown must be taken “with a heavy dose of caution” as more coronavirus restrictions are lifted on Monday.As the bans on international travel and households mixing indoors are relaxed, the National Health Service mobile app has started showing individuals’ vaccine status, a key step in the development of so-called Covid passports that will be key to enabling foreign trips.But the government is concerned that the highly transmissible virus strain that originated in India could lead to a major surge in cases, and is accelerating the vaccine rollout to people aged 35 and over this week in an attempt to contain the new variant.Johnson has already warned that the final stage of lifting restrictions, due on June 21, may be delayed amid rising concerns over the India strain, as he urged the public to use Monday’s freedoms with care.“We are keeping the spread of the variant first identified in India under close observation and taking swift action where infection rates are rising,” Johnson said in a statement released by his office. “The current data does not indicate unsustainable pressure on the NHS and our extraordinary vaccination program will accelerate – with second doses being bought forward to give the most vulnerable maximum protection.”Johnson is facing demands from within his own Conservative Party to stick to his planned timetable for lifting the lockdown -- or even speed it up in the light of a successful vaccination rollout. For businesses such as nightclubs, which are being required to wait until next month at the earliest to reopen, the threat of another surge in infections is a major worry.On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock cited “new very early data” from Oxford University that shows vaccines do appear to work against the India strain, which government medical advisers have said may be 40-50% easier to transmit. It’s not yet known how much more transmissible the strain is, Hancock said in an interview with Sky News. Government medical advisers have said it may be 40% to 50% easier to pass on.Hancock warned that it could “spread like wildfire among the unvaccinated groups” and urged people to come forward for shots when eligible. “We have a high degree of confidence that the vaccine will overcome” the disease, he said, citing positive “new very early data” from Oxford University.Vaccines WorkOxford University professor John Bell confirmed that vaccines appear to work against the new variant. “In terms of severe disease, hospital admissions and death, the vaccinated population are going to be fine, and we just need to pump our way through this,” he told Times Radio.The U.K. will offer inoculations to people aged 35 and over this week, Hancock told the BBC. “It’s about going as fast as we possibly can nationwide,” he said. Almost 70% of the adult population had at least one dose as of May 14 and 37% have had two shots.The number of confirmed infections of the B.1.617.2 variant more than doubled in the past week from 520 to 1,313, according to Public Health England. A cluster of cases in the northwestern English towns of Bolton, Blackburn and Darwen has prompted the government to deploy the army to assist in testing and vaccination efforts.Hancock said he couldn’t rule out local measures to contain outbreaks. “The approach we’re taking in Bolton and Blackburn is to absolutely pile in testing and vaccinations to try to get on top of this,” he told Sky.He defended the timing of the government’s restrictions on travel from India. “The evidence we had at the time was that the positivity of people coming from India was low at the start of April,” Hancock said. “When we saw it rising, we brought in the ‘red list’ restrictions. That was before we knew about this new variant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-urges-caution-as-b-1-617-2-variant-from-india-clouds-uk-s-unlocking-101621207719198.html
17-05-2021||World||Israel stages new round of heavy air strikes on Gaza City||Israeli warplanes unleashed a series of heavy airstrikes at several locations of Gaza City early Monday, hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war with Gaza's Hamas rulers would rage on.Explosions rocked the city from north to south for 10 minutes in an attack that was heavier, on a wider area and lasted longer than a series of air raids 24 hours earlier in which 42 Palestinians were killed — the deadliest single attack in the latest round of violence between Israel and the Hamas militant group that rules Gaza.The earlier Israeli airstrikes flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, Palestinian medics said.In a televised address, Netanyahu said Israel's attacks were continuing at “full-force” and would “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” on the Hamas militant group, he said, flanked by his defense minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, in a show of unity.Hamas also pressed on, launching rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward civilian areas in Israel. One slammed into a synagogue in the southern city of Ashkelon hours before evening services for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Israeli emergency services said. No injuries were reported.In the Israeli air assault early Sunday, families were buried under piles of cement rubble and twisted rebar. A yellow canary lay crushed on the ground. Shards of glass and debris covered streets blocks away from the major downtown thoroughfare where the three buildings were hit over the course of five minutes around 1 a.m.The hostilities have repeatedly escalated over the past week, marking the worst fighting in the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians since Israel and Hamas' devastating 2014 war.“I have not seen this level of destruction through my 14 years of work,” said Samir al-Khatib, an emergency rescue official in Gaza. “Not even in the 2014 war."Rescuers furiously dug through the rubble using excavators and bulldozers amid clouds of heavy dust. One shouted, “Can you hear me?” into a hole. Minutes later, first responders pulled a survivor out. The Gaza Health Ministry said 16 women and 10 children were among those killed, with more than 50 people wounded.Haya Abdelal, 21, who lives in a building next to one that was destroyed, said she was sleeping when the airstrikes sent her fleeing into the street. She accused Israel of not giving its usual warning to residents to leave before launching such an attack.“We are tired,” she said, “We need a truce. We can’t bear it anymore.”The Israeli army spokesperson’s office said the strike targeted Hamas “underground military infrastructure."As a result of the strike, “the underground facility collapsed, causing the civilian houses' foundations above them to collapse as well, leading to unintended casualties,” it said.Among those reported killed was Dr. Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, the head of the internal medicine department at Shifa Hospital and a senior member of the hospital's coronavirus management committee. Two of Abu Al-Ouf’s teenage children and two other family members were also buried under the rubble.The death of the 51-year-old physician “was a huge loss at a very sensitive time,” said Mohammed Abu Selmia, the director of Shifa.Gaza’s health care system, already gutted by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed in 2007 after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces, had been struggling with a surge in coronavirus infections even before the latest conflict.Israel's airstrikes have leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest buildings, which Israel alleges contained Hamas military infrastructure. Among them was the building housing The Associated Press Gaza office and those of other media outlets.Sally Buzbee, the AP's executive editor, called for an independent investigation into the airstrike that destroyed the AP office on Saturday.Netanyahu alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating inside the building and said Sunday any evidence would be shared through intelligence channels. Neither the White House nor the State Department would say if any had been seen.“It’s a perfectly legitimate target,” Netanyahu told CBS’s “Face the Nation."Asked if he had provided any evidence of Hamas’ presence in the building in a call Saturday with U.S. President Joe Biden, Netanyahu said: “We pass it through our intelligence people.”Buzbee called for any such evidence to be laid out. “We are in a conflict situation,” Buzbee said. “We do not take sides in that conflict. We heard Israelis say they have evidence; we don’t know what that evidence is.”Meanwhile, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders asked the International Criminal Court on Sunday to investigate Israel’s bombing of the AP building and others housing media organizations as a possible war crime.The Paris-based group said in a letter to the court’s chief prosecutor that the offices of 23 international and local media organizations have been destroyed over the past six days. It said the attacks serve “to reduce, if not neutralize, the media’s capacity to inform the public.”The AP had operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas. The news agency’s cameras, operating from its top floor office and roof terrace, offered 24-hour live shots as militant rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surroundings.“We think it’s appropriate at this point for there to be an independent look at what happened yesterday — an independent investigation,” Buzbee said.The latest outbreak of violence began in east Jerusalem last month, when Palestinians clashed with police in response to Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. A focus of the clashes was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a hilltop compound revered by both Muslims and Jews.Hamas began firing rockets toward Jerusalem on Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza.At least 188 Palestinians have been killed in hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, including 55 children and 33 women, with 1,230 people wounded. Eight people in Israel have been killed in some of the 3,100 rocket attacks launched from Gaza, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group have acknowledged 20 fighters killed in the fighting. Israel says the real number is far higher and has released the names and photos of two dozen alleged operatives it says were “eliminated.”The assault has displaced some 34,000 Palestinians from their homes, U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, where eight foreign ministers spoke about the conflict.Efforts by China, Norway and Tunisia to get the U.N. body to issue a statement, including a call for the cessation of hostilities, have been blocked by the United States, which, according to diplomats, is concerned it could interfere with diplomatic efforts to stop the violence.Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Al-Malki urged the Security Council to take action to end Israeli attacks. Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, urged the council to condemn Hamas' “indiscriminate and unprovoked attacks.”The turmoil has also fueled protests in the occupied West Bank and stoked violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property.On Sunday, a driver rammed into an Israeli checkpoint in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families have been threatened with eviction , injuring six officers before police shot and killed the attacker, Israeli police said.The violence also sparked pro-Palestinian protests in cities across Europe and the United States.Israel appears to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators work to end the fighting and stave off an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza.The Israeli military said it destroyed the home Sunday of Gaza’s top Hamas leader, Yahiyeh Sinwar, in the southern town of Khan Younis. It was the third such attack in the last two days on the homes of senior Hamas leaders, who have gone underground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-stages-new-round-of-heavy-air-strikes-on-gaza-city-101621207395491.html

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the UN, stopped short of insisting on a ceasefire and said the Biden administration was in touch with all sides including Qatar, which has close ties with Hamas, and Egypt, which has a peace deal with Israel and borders Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-conflict-appalling-war-crimes-echo-at-unsc-meet-101621201106070.html
