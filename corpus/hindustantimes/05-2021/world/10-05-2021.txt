But it’s got to be done in a way that is cautious… we have just got to monitor the Indian variant, other variants,” said Johnson.He was joined at the briefing by Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England, who in his update on the pandemic circulation said that one of three subtypes of the Indian variant was of “some concern” as it showed a rise in numbers “sharply” in some parts of the UK from very low levels.“So that has to be monitored very carefully,” said Whitty.The Indian variant subtype B.1.617.2, which was found to be at least as highly transmissible as the dominant Kent variant in England, was designated as a VOC by PHE last week after over 500 cases were found in parts of England. It is among a list of variants, including South African and Brazilian variants, currently being monitored as VOCs in Britain.Under the eased lockdown rules from next week, people from different households so far able to meet only outdoors will be able to meet in indoor settings as up to six people or two households will be able to meet indoors and up to 30 people outdoors.From May 17 – the penultimate mark for a complete end to lockdown scheduled for June 21, the Stay in the UK restriction will be lifted and people will be able to travel for overnight stays and to green list countries. The unlock from next Monday will mean indoor hospitality can reopen and indoor entertainment can resume, including cinemas, museums, and children’s play areas.All remaining outdoor entertainment can reopen, such as outdoor cinemas and performances. Some larger events will be able to take place, including conferences, theatre and concert performances, and sports events. Restrictions on the number of attendees will remain in place.“The public can make informed, personal decisions on close contact, such as hugging, with their friends and family. Close contact continues to carry a risk of catching or spreading Covid-19, and people must consider the risk to themselves and to others. Covid-secure rules remain for the workplace and businesses, such as in shops and hospitality,” Downing Street said.Face coverings will no longer be needed in classrooms or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. Twice weekly home testing will remain in place to control infection rates. All remaining university students will be eligible to return to in-person teaching and learning from May 17, and should get tested twice a week upon return.Up to 30 people will now be able to attend weddings, receptions, and commemorative events including wakes, as well as standalone life-cycle events.These can take place outdoors or at any indoor Covid secure venue that is permitted to open. The number of people able to attend a funeral will be determined by the number that can be safely accommodated in the venue with social distancing in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-variant-got-to-be-monitored-says-boris-johnson-as-uk-lockdown-eases-101620668169715.html

The organizers, Indian owners of a Dubai helium factory, shifted production to oxygen when the latest surge in virus cases hit India.As calls for help back home grew, the factory enlisted the help of the main Hindu temple based in the UAE's capital of Abu Dhabi, BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, to send oxygen supplies. COVID-19 patients are suffocating in India's capital, New Delhi, and other cities because of the shortage.Hindu spiritual leaders, dressed in saffron robes, came to bless the oxygen before sending it out, showering rose petals on the shipment and marking the cylinders with traditional orange dye.The UAE’s economy is powered by millions of foreign workers from Southeast Asia. Indian citizens make up nearly 30% of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-temple-in-uae-ships-oxygen-aid-to-covid-hit-india-101620666697721.html
10-05-2021||World||Biden admin to revive short-term work programme for foreign entrepreneurs||The Biden administration announced on Monday it will revive a short-term work programme for foreign entrepreneurs that former president Donald Trump had wanted to kill.The International Entrepreneur rule was proposed by then president Barack Obama in his final days in office - on January 17, 2017. The Trump administration was opposed to it and delayed it from going into effect, but a court vacated the delay and ordered the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to continue the programme. But it was clear to everyone, it was in Trump’s crosshairs.Under the programme, foreign entrepreneurs are allowed to set up start-ups in the United States over a period of five years; the company must get at least $250,000 in US venture capital and employ at 10 people.The work permit comes under the authority of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to grant “parole”, which is different from a standard US visa. It allows a maximum of three persons for every start-up, to work in the US. Their families can join them, and spouses can seek work authorisation; but their children cannot.“Immigrants in the United States have a long history of entrepreneurship, hard work, and creativity, and their contributions to this nation are incredibly valuable,” said acting USCIS director Tracy Renaud. “The International Entrepreneur parole programme goes hand-in-hand with our nation’s spirit of welcoming entrepreneurship and USCIS encourages those who are eligible to take advantage of the programme.”“After four years of Trump-era obstruction, the International Entrepreneur Rule is finally coming to life,” tweeted Doug Rand, who had worked on immigration in the Obama White House. “It’s a pathway designed for entrepreneurs from abroad to create start-ups & jobs in the US.”President Biden has overturned or allowed to lapse many of former president Trump’s restrictive immigrant and non-immigrant visa programmes, including the suspension of Green Card (permanent residency). He has also proposed an ambitious legislation overhauling the immigration system, which, however, has no prospect of being enacted in its entirety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-to-revive-short-term-work-programme-for-foreign-entrepreneurs-101620666319495.html

Clinical testing started in Japan in March and if approved, it will be a new effective addition to Japan’s Covid-19 treatment, Kato said.A cocktail of two virus neutralizing antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab are synthetically manufactured copies of antibodies that the body produces after an infection. It was given to US President Donald Trump when he contracted the disease in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-purchase-antibody-cocktail-for-covid-19-treatment-101620664262211.html

Like in other fast-greying countries, it puts more onus on the working-age population to support the economy.While the government is keen to reverse the decline, economists say a drop in the number of marriages and a rise in divorces, a lack of government financial support for new parents, together with a long-term slowdown in economic growth, have made reversing the slide in the birth rate difficult.The birth rate dropped an alarming 15% last year as China battled the Covid-19 outbreak, which emerged late in 2019.The government plans to announce details on Tuesday of last year's once-in-a-decade census. On April 29, it quashed reports the census would reveal China's first population decline in 50 years, saying the population continued to grow.'MODEL' METROPOLISShenzhen government figures in 2019 showed it had the highest birth rate among China's major cities with 21.7 babies for every 10,000 of its 13.44 million population. That's in part because a large proportion of its population are of childbearing age.But Shenzhen is struggling to meet many of the aspirations of would-be parents.Its education system is stretched. Fewer than half of 16 year-olds can find a public school place. There are similar shortages of primary school spots in some areas after the number of primary school students doubled between 2015 and 2019.Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Shenzhen-based tech giant Huawei Technologies, has said a lack of school places makes it hard to tempt company staff posted overseas back to the city.Shenzhen is crammed into 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) - a third of Shanghai and an eighth of Beijing – so it is difficult to find room for more schools, Nie Xinping, a top city official said in December.The local government nevertheless has plans to add an extra 740,000 school places by 2025, up from 2.3 million in 2019."The government has worked hard, first catching up with building nurseries, then primary schools, now high schools – we're trying to catch this generation as it gets older," said a researcher with a government-affiliated think tank, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Shenzhen's education situation reflects wider challenges for parents across the country, reckons Zhiwei Zhang, the Shenzhen-based chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management."Without effective reform on education, it would be difficult to alleviate parents' anxiety and improve the replacement rate, even in a city like Shenzhen with great economic prosperity and other public services," he said.High living costs and the highest housing prices relative to income of any city in China also weigh on wannabe parents in Shenzhen. Other major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have experienced substantial rises in house prices too.The Shenzhen city government declined to comment.Yi expects the high cost of raising children in Shenzhen to push births down."Many young people are unable to get married," he said. "It is difficult for young couples to raise one child, let alone raise two children."Quan Quan, a 33-year-old masseuse in Shenzhen, illustrates Yi's point. She leaves her eight-year old daughter with her parents in her hometown near the central city of Chongqing, 1,400 km away.Quan's experience is typical of millions of workers across China who do not have access to local government services, such as free state schooling for their children, because authorities control the number of residency permits to limit pressure on local resources."Her teachers are good back home, and life is cheaper there, but of course it can't compare with Shenzhen, it's like heaven and earth," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shenzhen-has-highest-birth-rate-among-major-chinese-cities-but-101620664352867.html
10-05-2021||World||US pipeline hackers say their aim is money, not mayhem||The ransomware group accused of crippling the leading U.S. fuel pipeline operator said on Monday that its goal was to make money and not sow mayhem, a statement that experts saw as a sign the cybercriminals' scheme had gone farther than they had intended.The FBI accused the group that calls itself DarkSide of a digital extortion attempt that prompted Colonial Pipeline to shut down its network, potentially causing extraordinary disruption as gasoline deliveries dry up.In a statement on Monday, Colonial said it expected to "substantially" restore operational service by the end of the week.The terse news release posted to DarkSide's website early on Monday did not directly mention Colonial Pipeline but, under the heading "About the latest news," it noted that "our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society."The statement did not say how much money the hackers were seeking. Colonial Pipeline did not immediately offer comment on the hackers' statement. The hackers have yet to return repeated Reuters requests to their website for further comment.DarkSide's statement said its hackers would launch checks on fellow cybercriminals "to avoid social consequences in the future." It added the group was "apolitical" and that observers "do not need to tie us" with any particular government.The statement, which had several spelling and grammatical errors, appeared geared toward lowering the political temperature around one of the most disruptive digital ransom schemes ever reported.Some security experts interpreted the statement as an indication that the DarkSide hackers were now trying to put some distance between themselves and the chaos they had unleashed."This isn't the first time a threat group has gotten in over their heads," said Lior Div, the co-founder and chief executive of Boston-based security company Cybereason.He said that ransomware groups like DarkSide depended on being able to squeeze their victims discreetly, without attracting too much law enforcement scrutiny."The global backlash is hurting their business," said Div. "It is the only reason they are offering a mea culpa."The crippling of Colonial's IT system has led to isolated sales restrictions at retail pumps and is pushing benchmark gasoline prices to a three-year high.On Sunday the largest U.S. refinery - Motiva Enterprises LLC's 607,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery - shut two crude distillation units because of the outage at Colonial, according to people familiar with the matter.In an interview with Reuters, a senior official with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's cyber arm, CISA, said that the dramatic hack should serve as a wakeup call for people well beyond the energy industry."All organizations should really sit up and take notice and make urgent investments to make sure that they're protecting their networks against these threats," said Eric Goldstein, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pipeline-hackers-say-their-aim-is-money-not-mayhem-101620663445580.html

10-05-2021||World||Hundreds of bodies of Covid-19 victims still stored in New York's refrigerated trucks||New York City is still using refrigerated trucks to store bodies of coronavirus victims, more than a year after they were first set up as temporary morgues as deaths surged at the height of the pandemic.The city’s medical examiner’s office said Friday that 750 bodies are being kept in long-term storage in refrigerated trailers at a Brooklyn pier while family members sort out plans for their final resting places.Dina Maniotis, a deputy commissioner with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, told a city council committee on Wednesday that many of the bodies held at the 39th Street Pier could end up buried in the city’s potter’s field on Hart Island.In April 2020, the city shortened the amount of time it would hold unclaimed remains to 14 days before burying them on Hart Island. At the time, officials said, they were exploring the option of interring unclaimed remains on the island temporarily so they could be moved later on.Mark Desire, a spokesperson for the medical examiner’s office, said permanent burial on Hart Island is an option for the next-of-kin of Covid-19 victims whose bodies remain in refrigerated trucks.“Long term storage was created at the height of the pandemic to ensure that families could lay their loved ones to rest as they see fit,” Desire said. “With sensitivity and compassion, we continue to work with individual families on a case by case basis during their period of mourning.The non-profit news website The City reported on the matter this week. The website noted that between 500 and about 800 bodies have been kept in cold storage at any given time since April 2020.Those figures were based on estimates by the medical examiner’s office compiled by the website and Columbia University’s Stabile Center for Investigative Reporting.The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent 85 refrigerated trucks to serve as temporary morgues last year as Covid-19 deaths overwhelmed the city’s permanent morgues and filled storage spaces in many hospitals to capacity.Many were parked outside hospitals and workers in protective gear used forklifts to place bodies inside in what became a grim, daily ritual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-bodies-of-covid-19-victims-still-in-new-york-s-refrigerated-trucks-101620660542303.html
10-05-2021||World||Air raid sirens, explosions heard in Jerusalem amid tensions||Explosions have been heard in Jerusalem after air raid sirens sounded.The sirens came Monday, shortly after the Hamas militant group in Gaza had set a deadline for Israel to remove its security forces from the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas’ military wing, said the rocket attack was a response to what he called Israeli “crimes and aggression” in Jerusalem. “This is a message the enemy has to understand well,” he said.He threatened more attacks if Israel again invades the Al-Aqsa compound or carries out evictions of Palestinian families in a neighborhood of east Jerusalem.The sounds of outgoing rocket fire were heard in Gaza shortly before the sirens went off. Later, a new barrage of rockets was heard.There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS STORY. AP's earlier report is below:Israeli police firing tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site on Monday, the latest in a series of confrontations that threatened to push the contested city toward wider conflict.In an apparent attempt to avoid further confrontation, Israeli authorities changed the planned route of a march by ultranationalist Jews through the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. The marchers were ordered to avoid the area and sent on a different route circumventing the Muslim Quarter on their way to the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray.But tensions remained high after Monday morning's violence.More than a dozen tear gas canisters and stun grenades landed in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, as police and protesters faced off inside the walled compound that surrounds it, said an Associated Press photographer at the scene. Smoke rose in front of the mosque and the iconic golden-domed shrine on the site, and rocks littered the nearby plaza. Inside one area of the compound, shoes and debris lay scattered over ornate carpets.More than 305 Palestinians were hurt, including 228 who went to hospitals and clinics for treatment, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Seven of the injured were in serious condition. Police said 21 officers were hurt, including three who were hospitalized. Israeli paramedics said seven Israeli civilians were also hurt.The confrontation was the latest after weeks of mounting tensions between Palestinians and Israeli troops in the Old City of Jerusalem, the emotional center of their conflict. There have been almost nightly clashes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, already a time of heightened religious sensitivities.Most recently, the tensions have been fueled by the planned eviction of dozens of Palestinians from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of east Jerusalem where Israeli settlers have waged a lengthy legal battle to take over properties. Monday was expected to be particularly tense since Israelis mark it as Jerusalem Day to celebrate their capture of east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.On Monday, two anti-Arab members of Israel's parliament, surrounded by an entourage and police, pushed through a line of protesters in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Several Arab members of parliament were among those trying to stop Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, amid shouting and jostling. At one point during the scrum, the protesters pounded on the sides of a dumpster, and one man yelled at Smotrich in Arabic, “Get out of here, you dog!”Smotrich and Ben Gvir eventually got to the other side of a police barricade and entered a house already inhabited by settlers.Over the past few days, hundreds of Palestinians and several dozen police officers have been hurt in clashes in and around the Old City, including the sacred compound, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The compound which has been the trigger for rounds of Israel-Palestinian violence in the past, is Islam’s third-holiest site and considered Judaism’s holiest.An AP photographer at the scene said that early Monday morning, protesters had barricaded gates to the walled compound with wooden boards and scrap metal. Sometime after 7. a.m., clashes erupted, with those inside throwing stones at police deployed outside. Police entered the compound, firing tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets and stun grenades.At some point during the morning about 400 people, both young protesters and older worshippers, were inside the carpeted Al-Aqsa Mosque. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades into the mosque.Police said protesters hurled stones at officers and onto an adjoining roadway near the Western Wall, where thousands of Israeli Jews had gathered to pray.After several days of Jerusalem confrontations, Israel has come under growing international criticism for its heavy-handed actions at the site, particularly during Ramadan.The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed consultations on the situation Monday.Late Sunday, the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat. A White House statement said that Sullivan called on Israel to “pursue appropriate measures to ensure calm” and expressed the U.S.’s “serious concerns” about the ongoing violence and planned evictions.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against the criticism Monday, saying Israel is determined to ensure the rights of worship for all and that this “requires from time to time stand up and stand strong as Israeli police and our security forces are doing now.”Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Netanyahu, claimed in a tweet that “extremist Palestinians planned well in advance to carry out riots” at the holy site, sharing photos of mounds of stones and wooden barricades inside the compound.Ayman Odeh, a leading Arab politician in Israel, blamed the violence on Israel’s discriminatory policies toward the Palestinians and said it had provoked the violence. “Wherever you find occupation, you will find resistance,” he said at a news conference in Sheikh Jarrah.In other violence, Palestinian protesters hurled rocks at an Israeli vehicle driving just outside the Old City walls. The driver later told public broadcaster Kan that his windows were smashed by stones and pepper spray shot into the car. CCTV footage released by the police showed a crowd surrounding the car and pelting it with rocks when it swerved off the road and into a stone barrier and a bystander.Police said two passengers were injured.The day began with police announcing that Jews would be barred from visiting the holy site on Jerusalem Day, which is marked with a flag-waving parade through the Old City that is widely perceived by Palestinians as a provocative display in the contested city.But just as the parade was about to begin, police said they were altering the route at the instruction of political leaders. Several thousand people, many of them from Jewish settlements in the West Bank, were participating.In the 1967 war in which Israel captured east Jerusalem, it also took the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It later annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital. The Palestinians seek all three areas for a future state, with east Jerusalem as their capital.The recent round of violence began when Israel blocked off a popular spot where Muslims traditionally gather each night during Ramadan at the end of their daylong fast. Israel later removed the restrictions, but clashes quickly resumed amid tensions over the planned eviction of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah.Israel’s Supreme Court postponed a key ruling Monday that could have forced dozens of Palestinians from their homes, citing the “circumstances.”The tensions in Jerusalem have threatened to reverberate throughout the region.Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have fired several barrages of rockets into Israel, and protesters allied with the ruling Hamas militant group have launched dozens of incendiary balloons into Israel, setting off fires across the southern part of the country.Hamas issued an ultimatum, giving Israel until 6 p.m. to remove its forces from the mosque compound and Sheikh Jarrah and release Palestinians detained in the latest clashes. It was not immediately clear what Hamas planned to do if its demands weren't met.In response, COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry organ responsible for crossings with the Gaza Strip, announced Monday that it was closing the Erez crossing to all but humanitarian and exceptional cases until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-raid-sirens-explosions-heard-in-jerusalem-amid-tensions-101620660265602.html

All you need to know||The US Navy on Sunday announced that they seized a huge cache of weapons from a small ship in the international waters of the North Arabian Sea. The Navy said that the guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) and US Coast Guard Advanced Interdiction Team (AIT) discovered the illicit arms shipment, wrapped in green plastic, on a stateless dhow during a routine flag verification boarding on May 6.The scale of the find came into focus after the weapons were laid out on the deck of the US warship in a two-day operation. The massive arms haul covered much of the rear deck of the 567-foot (173-meter) USS Monterey, which was visible in the photographs shared by the US Navy.“The cache of weapons included dozens of advanced Russian-made anti-tank guided missiles, thousands of Chinese Type 56 assault rifles, and hundreds of PKM machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades launchers. Other weapon components included advanced optical sights,” the Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet said in a statement.The Navy further stated that the dhow was assessed for seaworthiness following the removal of all illicit cargo and its crew was released after questioning. While the 5th Fleet said the original source and intended destination of the material are currently under investigation, an American defence official told The Associated Press that the initial probe found the vessel came from Iran, indicating that the cargo was likely bound to Yemen.Yemen has been marred with internal conflicts for years in which the factions, including the Houthi rebels, are backed by external forces like Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Around 130,000 people have been killed in the ongoing civil war and at least 3.65 million people have been displaced since March 2015, according to the UN refugee agency, making it one of the biggest humanitarian crises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-massive-arms-haul-covered-rear-deck-of-567-foot-warship-all-you-need-to-know-101620658665802.html

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's press aide Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter."To humanity, we say: It's time to put this apartheid state in its place!"Erdogan himself had on Saturday called Israel a "cruel terrorist state" that was attacking Palestinians "in a savage manner devoid of ethics".Relations between Israel and Turkey have been strained since a Turkish NGO oversaw a flotilla of ships that tried to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2010.Hundreds of people demonstrated in support of Palestinians on Sunday evening outside Israel's consulate in Istanbul.The Turkish police did not intervene despite a ban on large public gatherings in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.A range of top Turkish officials took to Twitter on Monday to denounce Israel's actions.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said those "who do not speak out against this atrocity should not talk about (the) Middle East Peace Process".The four members of the Middle East Quartet involved in the stalled process -- the US, Russia, the EU and the UN -- on Saturday expressed "deep concern" over the violence and called on "Israeli authorities to exercise restraint".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-demands-end-to-israel-s-heinous-cruel-attacks-101620638475355.html

"We haven't seen any response from their side so far, so we are moving forward with the issue, as we were, in the court," he said.UK Club said the reduced amount proposed had not been reflected in SCA's claim filed at court."The Ever Given's owners still have not been provided with evidence that would support a claim of this size, which remains exceptionally large. The Ever Given's interests continue to negotiate in good faith with the SCA," it added.An Egyptian economic court is due to hold a hearing on May 22 to consider the SCA claim for what it describes as losses due to the blockage and costs for dislodging the ship, SCA sources said.An Egyptian investigation into the incident found no wrongdoing by the SCA or its pilots, the sources said, without elaborating.One source said the court could authorise the SCA to auction off the ship if the owner rejected any ruling to compensate the canal authority. Rabie has also mentioned such an outcome.An Egyptian court rejected an appeal by Shoei Kisen against the Ever Given's detention earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/insurer-of-ever-given-that-blocked-suez-canal-says-reduced-claim-still-high-101620654332247.html
10-05-2021||World||Vaccine maker BioNTech says no need to waive patents||The head of German pharmaceutical company BioNTech said Monday that there is no need to waive patents on coronavirus vaccines because manufacturers will be able to produce enough shots to supply the world over the coming year.Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, rejected the US-backed proposal to temporarily lift some intellectual property rights for vaccines in order to boost global supply during the ongoing pandemic.In a call with investors announcing the company's first-quarter net profit of 1.13 billion euros ($1.37 billion), Sahin said BioNTech and its US partner Pfizer had already delivered vaccines to more than 90 countries and more than doubled its forecast production capacity for the year.“We have now scaled the manufacturing capacity up to 3 billion doses in 2021, and more than 40% of these doses are expected to go to middle- and low-income countries,” Sahin said.Waiving patents would not ease supply shortages in the coming months, he said, citing the complexity of producing the mRNA-based shot his company developed last year.Sahin said his company is working to further expand its manufacturing network with its own sites, such as one now planned in Singapore, and through cooperation with other manufacturers to ensure greater supply while maintaining the quality of the vaccine. But he also noted that rival manufacturers have their own shots either on the market already or in the pipeline."We believe, together with the other vaccine developers, in the next 9 to 12 months, that there will be more than enough vaccine produced and there is absolutely no need for waiving patents,” he said.BioNTech's estimated revenues surged to over 2 billion euros for the period from January to March, compared with just 28 million euros in the same period last year, after it launched the first widely used vaccine against Covid-19 together with Pfizer, which holds the market and distribution rights in much of the world.The Mainz-based company said its revenues included over 1.75 billion euros in gross profits from vaccine sales in Pfizer's territories, and almost 200 million from sales to customers in its region. Based on current orders for some 1.8 billion doses, it expects full-year revenues of 12.4 billion euros in 2021.BioNTech shares rose by more than 7% to $196.60 in early trading Monday on Nasdaq.The results are a significant turnaround for the company, which made a net loss of 53 million euros in the first quarter of 2020.Early last year as the pandemic began, BioNTech pivoted from researching treatments for cancer to developing a vaccine against Covid-19. Like its rival Moderna, the company's vaccine uses mRNA technology to prime the body's immune system to attack the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-maker-biontech-says-no-need-to-waive-patents-101620658130906.html

"Seasonal influenza and Covid-19 combination vaccines will likely be critical to combating emerging Covid-19 variants," said Russell Wilson, the executive vice president and NanoFlu general manager of Novavax.Hamsters that received the combined vaccine had heightened levels of Covid-19 antibodies two weeks after the first immunization, which increased significantly after a second dose, compared to animals that received the Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, alone, the company said.Novavax said it expects to start clinical studies of the combined vaccine by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-in-animal-study-101620654364973.html
10-05-2021||World||Britain's PM Boris Johnson faces investigation over overseas trip rules||Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being investigated by the U.K. Parliament’s standards regulator amid claims he may have broken the rules on declaring a luxury holiday to the Caribbean.The premier and his partner traveled to the island of Mustique over the New Year in 2020 and questions have been raised in the British media over whether he properly registered payments toward the trip.Now Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, has confirmed she’s formally investigating whether Johnson broke the rules over the holiday.Johnson is already facing a series of inquiries into whether he has broken rules, with a number of them focusing on how he funded a lavish refurbishment of his official Downing Street apartment.The main opposition Labour party has repeatedly attacked Johnson over these arrangements. Yet voters don’t seem to care. In last week’s elections Johnson’s Conservatives performed better than expected while Labour slipped up.Under Parliamentary rules, MPs are required to register in a public report significant donations and gifts, including foreign visits which have not been paid for entirely from their own funds or by the government.Johnson last year registered Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross as having given him 15,000 pounds ($21,000) worth of “accommodation for a private holiday for my partner and me.”Ross at first said he hadn’t paid for the holiday but later clarified that the register was accurate and that he had “facilitated accommodation.” Labour then wrote to Stone requesting an investigation.“Another day, another investigation into Boris Johnson for more sleaze and dodgy dealings,” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said on Monday. “The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson’s luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-pm-boris-johnson-faces-investigation-over-overseas-trip-rules-101620645898756.html
10-05-2021||World||Cautious cuddling? England to OK hugs as lockdown eases||In England, it's going to be time to hug again.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to give the go-ahead for that much-missed human contact when he announces the next round of lockdown easing later Monday in the wake of a sharp fall in new coronavirus infections.The UK is now recording around 2,000 new coronavirus cases a day, compared with a daily peak of nearly 70,000 in January. Daily deaths have also plummeted with only two recorded on Sunday.The country's alert level was also lowered to level three from four on Monday following a “consistent” fall in cases, hospital admissions and deaths. This means that transmission of the virus is no longer deemed to be high or rising exponentially, though still being in general circulation.While hugs between households will be allowed again beginning May 17, Johnson is expected to stress that they should be done with care, given concerns about new virus variants that could bypass some of the immunity provided by Britain's successful vaccination campaign.Johnson is also expected to confirm that different households will be able to mix indoors in homes as well as in pubs and restaurants. However, the gatherings are to be capped at six people or two different households if that is higher. The limits on outdoor gatherings are expected to be raised to 30 people.Indoor entertainment activities such as cinemas, soft play areas, adult group sports, exercise classes and hotels are also expected to reopen.Since the lockdown started to be eased in recent weeks as part of a plan the government insists is being driven by “data, not dates,” the mixing of households was only allowed outdoors, such as in a garden or restaurant patio, provided that social distancing was followed.“I think it’s what most people have missed, that intimate contact with family and friends, and entertaining, having people in your own house, meeting outdoors," Health Minister Nadine Dorries said.The government has allowed some foreign travel to start on May 17 but only a handful of destinations are deemed safe enough to ditch the 10-day quarantine requirements upon return. Portugal and Iceland now have no quarantine requirements but other popular destinations such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece will still require quarantining and a series of coronavirus tests.Similar restrictions are being eased in the other parts of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — following a sharp fall in new infections as a result of a long winter lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines.Although the UK has recorded Europe's highest coronavirus death toll, with more than 127,500 dead, new infections have dropped dramatically. In addition, the success of Britain's vaccine rollout has raised hopes that this easing will not see the same virus resurgence that happened last fall following a lifting of restrictions during the summer.Around 53% of the British population have received one dose of vaccine while more than a quarter have had two jabs — one of the speediest vaccine rollouts in the world.The ensuing round of lockdown easing is expected on June 21. The hope is that all other limits on social contacts will be lifted then.Though the coronavirus backdrop is clearly much improved, there are concerns that the government is being overly hasty with lifting the restrictions on social contact at a time when some parts of the world, such as India, are in the midst of a huge resurgence of the virus, and the vaccine rollout still has a way to go.Gurch Randhawa, a professor of diversity in public health at the University of Bedfordshire, is one who's wary, and cautioned about potential mixed messaging coming from the government.“It is no doubt tempting to relax social distancing, offer the glimmer of a much needed hug, and lift restrictions on international travel, but this could be a big mistake at this stage of the Covid-19 pandemic," he said.“As a minimum, the government should be advising only those have received both vaccination doses to be hugging each other, and even, a short hug, with faces directed away from each other to minimize risk of Covid-19 transmission,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cautious-cuddling-england-to-ok-hugs-as-lockdown-eases-101620653009599.html

10-05-2021||World||Indian coronavirus variant found in Thai travelers from Pakistan||Health authorities in Thailand said Monday they have confirmed the country’s first cases of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, in a Thai woman and her 4-year-old son who have been in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan.The finding comes as Thailand battles a new wave of the coronavirus that began at the beginning of April, originating in upmarket entertainment venues in Bangkok and spawning clusters in several crowded slum communities. Many of the recent cases involve the British variant of the virus, which is more infectious than the original form found last year.Thailand banned travelers from India, other than Thai citizens, starting on May 1 in response to a massive outbreak of Covid-19 cases in the South Asian nation that began in early April. India has reported more than 22.6 million infections, second only to the United States, and more than 246,000 deaths. Both figures are widely believed to be undercounts.Thailand extended the entry ban to foreigners visiting from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal on Monday in an effort to keep the Indian variant from spreading, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanee Sangrat said.Apisamai Srirangsan, a deputy spokesperson for the government’s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration, said separately that Thai authorities are also worried about people who cross into Thailand illegally, mostly from neighboring Cambodia and Myanmar.Apisamai said the Indian variant was found in a pregnant 42-year-old woman who arrived on April 24 with three sons. She and her 4-year-old were staying in the same room under state quarantine. The two other sons, ages 6 and 8, stayed in another room and tested negative.Thailand on Monday announced 1,630 new cases, bringing its confirmed total to 85,005 since the pandemic began. There were 22 new deaths, for a total of 421.About one-third of the reported cases in the latest wave were found in Bangkok, where daily increases have declined to 565 on Monday from 980 on Sunday and a record 1,112 on Saturday.New clusters continue to be discovered in Bangkok, not only in crowded communities, but also at markets and department stores.Other clusters have been found among migrant workers at factories in two provinces near Bangkok.In the eastern province of Chanthaburi, a gem mining center, nearly 100 cases were found among African gem traders, the newspaper Thai Rath reported, citing the provincial health office. The governor this past weekend ordered the closure of gem and amulets markets, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-coronavirus-variant-found-in-thai-travelers-from-pakistan-101620652467603.html
10-05-2021||World||Biden reverses Trump's decision, protects gay and transgender in health care||The US will protect gay and transgender people against sex discrimination in health care, the Biden administration announced Monday, reversing a Trump-era policy that sought to narrow the scope of legal rights in sensitive situations involving medical care.The action by the Department of Health and Human Services affirms that federal laws forbidding sex discrimination in health care also protect gay and transgender people. The Trump administration had defined “sex” to mean gender assigned at birth, thereby excluding transgender people from the law's umbrella of protection.“Fear of discrimination can lead individuals to forgo care, which can have serious negative health consequences," HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “Everyone — including LGBTQ people — should be able to access health care, free from discrimination or interference, period.”Becerra said the Biden administration policy will bring HHS into line with a landmark Supreme Court decision last year in a workplace discrimination case, which established that federal laws against sex discrimination on the job also protect gay and transgender people.Despite that ruling, the Trump administration proceeded to try to narrow the legal protections against health care discrimination, issuing rules that narrowly defined “sex” as biological gender. A federal judge had blocked those rules from taking effect, although Trump administration officials argued that as a legal matter health care discrimination was a separate issue from the employment case the Supreme Court decided.Monday's action means that the HHS Office for Civil Rights will again investigate complaints of sex discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Hospitals, clinics and other medical providers can face government sanctions for violations of the law.The Biden administration action essentially restores policy established during the Obama years. The Affordable Care Act included a prohibition on sex discrimination in health care and the Obama administration had interpreted that to apply to gay and transgender people as well. It relied on a broad understanding of sex shaped by a person’s inner sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.Behind the dispute over rights for transgender people in particular is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender assigned at birth. Consequences can include severe depression. Treatment can range from gender confirmation surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing.Medical groups and civil rights organizations generally support broader legal protections for gay and transgender people, while social and religious conservatives sought to narrow their scope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-reverses-trump-s-decision-protects-gay-and-transgender-in-health-care-101620650598708.html
10-05-2021||World||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli loses vote of confidence in parliament||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli lost a trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday, in a fresh setback to the embattled premier seeking to tighten his grip on power after the CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Pushpakamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ withdrew support to his government.Prime Minister Oli secured 93 votes in the lower house of parliament during a special session convened on the directives of President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Oli, 69, required at least 136 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the confidence motion as four members are currently under suspension. A total of 124 members voted against the confidence motion while 15 members stayed neutral, Speaker Agni Sapkota announced. The session was attended by 232 lawmakers."As the votes cast in favour of the motion fell short to achieve a majority of the existing strength of the House of Representatives, I hereby declare that the prime minister’s motion to seek a vote of confidence has been rejected,” Sapkota announced before adjourning the House.With this, Prime Minister Oli is automatically relieved from his post as per Article 100 (3).Some 28 Lawmakers belonging to Oli’s rival faction led by Madhav Nepal-Jhala Nath Khanal abstained during the voting.The main Opposition Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), which control 61 and 49 votes, respectively, voted against Oli’s trust motion.The Janata Samajbadi Party, which has 32 votes, however, was divided. The Mahantha Thakur-led faction stayed neutral while the Upendra Yadav-led group voted against Oli.After its alliance Nepal Communist Party Maoist Centre led by Prachanda withdrew its support to the government last week, Oli’s government was reduced to a minority one.After losing the Vote of Confidence, the Prime Minister is automatically removed from his post and now the new coalition government will be formed as per the constitutional process, said senior Nepali Congress leader Prakash Man Singh.Senior leader of CPN-Maoist Ganesh Shah said that Oli should immediately resign from the post and pave way for the formation of an alternative government.The CPN-Maoist will join hands with the Nepali Congress and other parties who voted against Oli to form a coalition government at the earliest, he said.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.Oli repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House of Representatives, saying some leaders of his party were attempting to form a "parallel government".Oli, who joined politics as a student activist in his teenage and spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy, became Nepal's Prime Minister for a second time in 2018 as a joint candidate of the Left alliance.The alliance between the CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachana’-led CPN (Maoist Centre) won a majority in the House of Representatives and in six of the seven provincial assemblies in the 2017 elections. After their victory, the two parties formally merged in May 2018.However, the NCP, formed after the merger between Oli-led CPN-UML and 'Prachanda'-led CPN (Maoist Centre) in May 2018, split following the power tussle between the two leaders. ‘Prachanda’-led faction withdrew its support to the Oli government last wek, reducing it to a minority one.Known for his pro-China stance, Oli had earlier served as the country's prime minister from October 11, 2015 to August 3, 2016 during which Kathmandu's ties with New Delhi had strained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-prime-minister-oli-loses-vote-of-confidence-in-parliament-101620650130627.html
10-05-2021||World||Explained: What's behind the Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Jerusalem?||For weeks now, Palestinian protesters and Israeli police have clashed on a daily basis in and around Jerusalem's Old City, home to major religious sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims and the emotional epicenter of the Middle East conflict.Jerusalem has been the scene of violent confrontations between Jews and Arabs for 100 years and remains one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth. The latest clashes began a month ago with an Israeli move to block some Palestinian gatherings at the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, already a time of heightened religious sensitivities. After those restrictions eased, tensions over a plan to evict dozens of Palestinians from an east Jerusalem neighborhood continued to fuel confrontations.On Monday, stun grenades echoed across a holy hilltop compound, and hundreds of Palestinians were hurt in clashes between stone-throwing protesters and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police were also injured.Here's a look at why Jerusalem always seems to be on edge — and what set off the latest round of violence.Capital of two peoplesIsrael views Jerusalem as its “unified, eternal” capital. It had captured east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. But Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally.The fate of east Jerusalem has been one of the thorniest issues in the peace process, which ground to a halt more than a decade ago.Israelis on Monday were set to mark Jerusalem Day, a national holiday celebrating the annexation. In past years, thousands of Israelis — mainly religious nationalists — have marched through the Old City, including the densely populated Muslim Quarter, in a display considered provocative by many Palestinians.In recent days, hard-line Israelis have staged other events in east Jerusalem, leading to scattered, violent altercations with Palestinians.___The holy hilltopMonday's clashes took place in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City. The mosque is the third-holiest site in Islam and sits on a sprawling plateau that is also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock. Muslims refer to the compound as the Noble Sanctuary.The walled plateau is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount, because it was the location of biblical temples. Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 A.D., with only the Western Wall remaining. The mosques were built centuries later.Neighboring Jordan serves as the custodian of the site, which is operated by an Islamic endowment known as the Waqf. The site is open to tourists during certain times but only Muslims are allowed to pray there. The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray.In recent years, groups of religious and nationalist Jews escorted by police have been visiting the compound in greater numbers and holding prayers in defiance of rules established after 1967 by Israel, Jordan and Muslim religious authorities. The Palestinians view the frequent visits and attempted prayers by Jews as a provocation, and it often ignites scuffles or more serious violence.Some Israelis say the site should be open to all worshippers. The Palestinians refuse, fearing that Israel will eventually take over the site or partition it. Israeli officials say they have no intention of changing the status quo.___Discriminatory policiesJews born in east Jerusalem are Israeli citizens, while Palestinians from east Jerusalem are granted a form of permanent residency that can be revoked if they live outside the city for an extended period. They can apply for citizenship, but it's a long and uncertain process and most choose not to because they don't recognize Israeli control.Israel has built Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem that are home to some 220,000 people. It has severely limited the growth of Palestinian neighborhoods, leading to overcrowding and the unauthorized construction of thousands of homes that are at risk of demolition.The Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the New York-based Human Rights Watch cited the discriminatory policies in east Jerusalem in recent reports arguing that Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid. Israel rejects those allegations, saying Jerusalem residents are treated equally.___Threatened evictionsThe recent nightly clashes began at the start of Ramadan, when Israeli police placed barriers outside the Old City’s Damascus Gate, a popular gathering place after the evening prayers during the holy month when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. They later removed the barriers, but then protests escalated over the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.The families have been embroiled in a long legal battle with ideological Jewish settlers who seek to acquire property in crowded Palestinian neighborhoods just outside the Old City. Israel portrays it as a private real-estate dispute, but the families' plight has attracted global attention.___Wider unrestClashes in Jerusalem, and particularly in Al-Aqsa, often reverberate across the region.The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, has called for a new intifada, or uprising, like the one triggered by an Israeli politician's visit to Al-Aqsa in 2000. Gaza militants have fired rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached to them in support of the protesters as an informal cease-fire with Israel has started to fray.Protests have been held in the occupied West Bank and in Arab communities inside Israel. A series of deadly shootings in the West Bank last week has also heightened tensions.Jordan and other Arab nations that have friendly ties with Israel have condemned its crackdown on the protests, while Israel's archenemy Iran has encouraged Palestinian attacks. The U.S. and the EU have condemned the violence and expressed concern about the evictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-s-behind-the-clashes-in-jerusalem-101620648588230.html
10-05-2021||World||Palestinians stone Israeli car, which crashes, as Jerusalem seethes||On a busy street outside Jerusalem's walled Old City on Monday, a group of Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with rocks in a moment of violence captured on CCTV video.When it was over, the driver stood, an improvised bandage on his head and blood on his shirt, next to his wrecked car, guarded by a policeman with his pistol drawn. One of the attackers, who was hit by the vehicle, had already limped away.Palestinians accused the motorist of a deliberate ramming. Police say the driver lost control of the car.The incident took place as hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli police outside al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City in violence that coincided with Jerusalem Day, when Israel celebrates its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said more than 275 Palestinians were injured in the general violence. Police said 12 officers were hurt.The CCTV footage, which police released on Twitter, began with Palestinians milling around slow-moving traffic, apparently trying to spot Israeli drivers, and then converging on a white car.One of the Palestinians briefly opened a door of the vehicle as it backed away, rocks pelting its bonnet.The car then swerved back into the junction, striking one of the stone-throwers, throwing him backwards, and pinioning itself on a pavement barricade, the CCTV video showed.Several Palestinians rushed up to lob rocks at the driver and a passenger, who could be seen gesticulating through the window. The stone-thrower struck by the vehicle quickly got to his feet and limped off, helped by other Palestinians.Twenty-five seconds after the collision, an Israeli police officer arrived and fired his pistol in the air to disperse the crowd."Move back! Move back!" the policeman ordered, pointing his gun, while also appearing to warn the driver, who spat at the Palestinians, to stay next to the wrecked car."If you don't want trouble, get him out of here," a male voice can be heard responding.Interviewed on Israel's N12 news site, the driver said: "We tried to flee and our car ended up almost overturning."Police said he and a passenger were lightly hurt in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-stone-israeli-car-which-crashes-as-jerusalem-seethes-101620648578186.html

It's not a meme joke coin, it actually has some application use," he added, referring to its role in DeFi.But some analysts said ethereum's increasing valuation was not underpinned by data of how widely it is used."The continued divergence of its price relative to network activity raise questions about its valuation," J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a report to clients dated May 7.Factors such as the number of active digital addresses in its network would be more consistent with a price of around $1,000, the U.S. bank said.In the crypto world, the terms "ethereum" and "ether" have become synonymous. Technically, ethereum is the blockchain network in which applications are embedded, while ether is the token or currency that enables or drives the use of these applications.ALTCOINSBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, rose to a three-week high above $59,600 on Monday. Dogecoin, a recent outperformer, stabilised after losses on Sunday after comments by Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk on the Saturday Night Live TV show, where he said it was a "hustle".Smaller cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin, known as "altcoins," have been in demand in the past few weeks, pushing bitcoin's share of the overall $2.5 trillion digital currency market to its lowest in around two years.Dogecoin, which began as a social media joke in 2013, is up more than 700% in the last month.It was last trading at $0.51, after tumbling 38% in the last 24 hours on Musk's comments. It later steadied after Musk's commercial rocket company SpaceX said it would accept the meme-inspired cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment.The meme-based coin has become the fourth-largest digital currency, with a market capitalisation of $69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. It hit a record high on Thursday above $0.73.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secondbiggest-cryptocurrency-ethereum-breaks-4-000-to-hit-record-high-101620647295143.html

Attenborough’s warning comes after he was tasked to exhort world leaders over the next six months to put climate action at the top of their agenda as People’s Advocate of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is scheduled to take place in November in Glasgow.Attenborough, the world's most influential wildlife broadcaster, said that there could not be a more important moment to have international agreements on major issues. COP26 is being dubbed as the most important climate summit since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 to keep the rise of the global temperature below 2 degree Celsius."The epidemic has shown us how crucial it is to find agreement among nations if we are to solve such worldwide problems,” said Attenborough.“But the problems that await us within the next 5-10 years are even greater. It is crucial that these meetings in Glasgow, COP26, have success, and that at last the nations will come together to solve the crippling problems that the world now faces,” he added.📢 News: Sir David Attenborough has been named the COP26 People's Advocate.Welcome to the #COP26 family 💚With 6 months to go until the summit, hear him speak about why collective action is so important 👇#TogetherForOurPlanet | #ClimateAction pic.twitter.com/X8cC7dRQIsAlso Read | UK to toughen climate target before US President Joe Biden's summit: ReportsBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed gratitude towards the 95-year-old conservationist for agreeing to be COP26 People’s Advocate for the UK’s Presidency of the UN climate change summit.

He hurled vulgarities and racial slurs at her," Kaur said in a widely circulated Instagram post."My mum responded with a 'God bless you' and the guy kicked her in the chest. My mum landed on her back and hurt herself," she said.The man, whose identity is not yet known, ran away while the woman was left shaken and bleeding.Kaur said her mother brisk walks to work as a form of daily exercise, but the incident has left her "afraid of taking a walk in her own country".A report has been lodged and investigations are underway, police said.According to Singapore's health ministry guidelines, all people in the island nation aged six and above are required to wear masks as part of the safety measures against Covid-19 when outside their homes. They may remove their mask while engaging in outdoor or strenuous exercise, including brisk walking or walking up hilly terrain, but must put it back on after exercising.Those walking at a normal pace are required to wear a mask.The attack on Nita came days after a similar incident reportedly took place at Pasir Ris area on May 2, when a man was caught on camera shouting at a family of Indian expatriates and accusing them of spreading Covid-19.The online video shows that the man, believed to be a Singaporean, used derogatory terms against the family of four and asked them to "go back" and said they were "spreading the virus here", the Straits Times newspaper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-man-kicks-indian-origin-woman-for-not-wearing-mask-during-walk-hurls-racial-slurs-101620643262641.html

The country’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism revenue.The peak climbing season is usually between April and early June before the monsoon sets in.A team of Tibetan mountaineering guides will set up the separation line at the peak before climbers attempt to reach the summit from the Chinese side, official news agency, Xinhua, reported.The report did not make it clear how the separation line will be drawn and defined or what it will be made of.It’s likely that mountaineers climbing the north side of Everest from China will be prohibited from crossing the line or coming into contact with anyone or any objects on the Nepalese, side.A group of 21 Chinese nationals are en route to the summit on the Tibetan side, Xinhua reported.Though imported cases are reported daily, China has curbed the domestic transmission of Covid-19 infection. Nepal, however, has seen a surge in the outbreak with record new infections and deaths in recent days.Most major cities and towns in the Himalayan country between India and China are under lockdown and all domestic and international flights are grounded.In December, China and Nepal jointly announced that the mountain was 8848.86 metres or 29031.69 feet tall.Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Nepalese counterpart Bidya Devi Bhandari jointly announced the new height of the tallest mountain in the world through an exchange of letters.Until then, Nepal had recognised the height of the mountain as 8,848 metres as measured by the Survey of India in 1954.The announcement marked the end of a debate between Beijing and Kathmandu over a “three-metre” height difference the two neighbours had on the mountain’s height.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-set-up-covid-19-separation-line-on-mt-everest-101620643758262.html

In January, Washington banned the import of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour.Beijing denies the accusations and describes the camps as vocational training centres to combat religious extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-foreign-ministry-says-planned-un-event-on-xinjiang-an-insult-101620640156411.html

But amid a push to get as many people inoculated as possible, the government decided to allow doctors' offices to vaccinate any adults with it -- putting aside a priority system under which the oldest and most vulnerable have been vaccinated first.Health Minister Jens Spahn said authorities decided Monday to take the same approach with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, about which there are similar concerns. He estimated that 5 to 6 million over-60s in Germany still need to be vaccinated and that should be concluded by early June.Spahn said the largest deliveries from Johnson & Johnson, more than 10 million doses, are expected in June or July.Germany has now given nearly one-third of the population at least one vaccine shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-clears-j-j-astrazeneca-jabs-for-all-adults-101620641419401.html

Staff sounded alarm after a week||Authorities in eastern China were still hunting for the last of three leopards that escaped from a safari park, officials said Monday, while the park was facing criticism for concealing the breakout for nearly a week.The three leopards from the Hangzhou Safari Park were spotted by villagers as early as May 1, according to the state-owned Global Times newspaper. However, the safari park only reported the missing leopards and alerted the public on Saturday.Two of the leopards have already been captured, and are in good health, officials said. It is unclear how the leopards managed to escape.Efforts to capture the last leopard were ongoing as of Sunday night, according to a statement posted Monday by the Hangzhou local government on its official WeChat account.Those searching for the animal were using equipment such as drones as well as hunting dogs.The leopard was spotted by a drone early Sunday, but fled when people attempted to approach it, according to the Global Times.The delay in announcing the escape sparked criticism that the safari park had put people at risk, especially since the leopards were at large over the five-day Labor Day holidays in China with hordes of tourists visiting the city of Hangzhou. Hangzhou is one of China’s most popular tourist cities, famed for its tea plantations and the scenic West Lake.Authorities are investigating the cause of the leopards’ escape and have questioned the personnel in charge at the safari park.The safari park said it was “sincerely sorry” for not announcing the incident sooner, according to a statement on its Weibo microblogging account Saturday. As the young leopards were believed to be less aggressive, the park said it did not make the announcement to prevent causing panic among the public.The safari park has been temporarily closed while it reviews safety and management issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-leopards-escaped-a-zoo-in-china-staff-sounded-alarm-after-a-week-101620638835181.html

And once again, South Africa is waging a struggle that puts global solidarity to the test," he said.Ramaphosa said South Africa was one of only five countries on the African continent able to manufacture vaccines and that there was a need for new capacity to be built.South Africa has ordered enough Covid-19 vaccines for 46 million of its 60 million people via bilateral deals with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Pfizer.

It’s also planning to place high-resolution, night-capable cameras to monitor activities around islands claimed by the Philippines, he said.“Our objective is to drive away Chinese maritime militia and other Chinese vessels from our exclusive economic zone,” Sobejana told CNN Philippines Monday.China can resolve the dispute with the Philippines through their “common consensus to have dialogue and consultation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing Monday in Beijing, when asked about the Philippine military’s plan. Certain people are stirring up the issue, she added, without elaborating.Tensions between the Philippines and China in the disputed waters have escalated over the past weeks, with Manila protesting and asking Chinese vessels to leave the area. Still, Duterte has maintained a friendly tone, calling China a “benefactor” as the Philippines sources coronavirus vaccines from Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-plans-military-hub-in-south-china-sea-sea-cameras-amid-china-row-101620637654174.html

10-05-2021||World||'Vaccine tourists' fly from abroad for injections on US beach||A long line of people snaked across the sand of Miami Beach, Florida, as dozens of travelers from Latin America waited their turn at a pop-up coronavirus vaccination booth.Sweating under the Sunday afternoon sun, visitors checked into an online system -- no proof of residence required -- and soon after received a free, single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a vaccination card.People had come from all over Latin America -- Ecuador, El Salvador, Venezuela -- where the vaccine rollout has been slow and hampered by supply shortages."In my country, (Covid-19) is getting out of hand and there's not much chance we'll have access to the vaccine soon," Maria Bonilla, who arrived Saturday from Honduras, told AFP.The 40-year-old accountant flew in with her parents, aged 63 and 73. The three of them stood in line, wearing masks. "We had to make the decision to look for a solution outside the country," Bonilla said.Blanca Diaz, 50, who arrived Friday from Mexico, came to the same conclusion: "They are just starting to vaccinate older people," she said of her home country.The rush to find a vaccine has been accompanied by a sharp surge in airfares. Flights from Buenos Aires to Miami, which usually cost around $1,000, have jumped to $2,000 in May.Bonilla is acutely aware of her privilege to be able to travel with her parents to get vaccinated. "It's unfortunate. It already creates this division that some of us have access to health and others do not," she said.Miami Beach city commissioner David Richardson, a Democrat, who oversaw the facility, told AFP he has mixed feelings about the vaccine tourists."I think we, the United States government, should help as many people as possible," he said."My only concern is that it seems that the people who can afford to buy an airfare can come to the United States and get a vaccine now."And what about the poor people in South America?" Richardson asked, urging the US government to send vaccines overseas "so that everybody can have access to the vaccine, not just the people who can afford to come here."- Easing requirements -On Sunday, the pop-up vaccination booth inoculated 175 people with the Johnson & Johnson shot, the brand favored by tourists because it requires only one dose.This is the second weekend that the booth has been set up on the beach, and it will be back for the next few weekends.Richardson said he was authorized Sunday morning to provide vaccines to anyone over age 18.In theory, Florida vaccinates state residents or people who indicate -- verbally -- that they offer a service in-state. As of 10 days ago, it is no longer necessary to provide documented proof of residence.This easing of requirements was implemented to encourage undocumented residents to get vaccinated -- but it also has encouraged vaccine tourists.Since January, wealthy Latin Americans have been creatively circumventing the now-eliminated residency requirement.They would show bank statements for accounts with a US address, or temporary rental contracts -- even with Airbnb -- could be immediately canceled once they had been vaccinated.More than nine million people -- out of a total of 21.5 million residents -- have had at least one dose of the vaccine in Florida, according to the US health department."At this point, the people that haven't been vaccinated is certainly not because a lack of supply or a lack of availability," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-tourists-fly-from-abroad-for-injections-on-us-beach-101620636361146.html

The move follows a slump in the greenback on Friday after U.S. jobs data missed economists’ estimates.The yuan’s ascent comes even after the central bank tried to cap its gains by setting the daily fix at a weaker-than-expected level on Monday. China’s currency has climbed 1.8% this year to outperform all its Asian peers, and a rapid appreciation threatens to erode the competitiveness of the nation’s exports.“The yuan will continue to strengthen, as apart from a weaker dollar, the Chinese currency is also being supported by capital inflows and large trade surplus,” said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. “The PBOC will likely use the fixing to slow the gains but it won’t use direct intervention.”The yuan’s rise mirrors the Chinese economy’s gains, where surging exports and retail sales are in stark contrast to the uneven recovery seen in the U.S. and the euro zone. Gross domestic product climbed 18.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, powered by a jump in consumer spending.Apart from the dollar, the yuan also strengthened against a basket of its trading partners’ currencies. The CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan versus 24 peers, is close to the highest level since 2018.Chinese banks, including joint-stock and state lenders, boosted purchases of the dollar after the yuan advanced rapidly on Monday afternoon, traders said. The transactions helped to stabilize the exchange rate, according to the traders, who asked not to be named as they aren’t authorized to comment on the market publicly.“While the broad dollar declines are certainly supportive of Asian currencies, the yuan has become even more attractive because of its strong data and effective Covid-19 containment measures,” said Fiona Lim, senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Berhad in Singapore. The onshore yuan will advance to 6.36 in the coming 12 months, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yuan-jumps-to-3-year-high-as-china-s-economy-outpaces-peers-101620636913875.html

Her unease about her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein dates back to at least 2013, the paper said.The New York Times reported in October 2019 that the billionaire had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his New York townhouse. A spokeswoman for Microsoft Corp. co-founder said at the time that the meetings had centered on philanthropy. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking.The divorce was negotiated during the pandemic, involving legal teams working with a mediator to divide their fortune, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegs at $145 billion.The couple said that they plan on remaining co-chairs and trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Billionaire Warren Buffett serves as the foundation’s third trustee. All three have vowed to give away the vast majority of their wealth.In the days after the split was announced, a holding company that Bill Gates created transferred equity stakes in four different companies, worth more than $2 billion in aggregate, to Melinda French Gates, Bloomberg News has reported. The bulk of it is from about 14.1 million shares in Canadian National Railway Co.Days before he died in a New York jail, Epstein named a little-known biotech venture capitalist named Boris Nikolic as backup executor of his will.

Moon stressed, however, that his government has “no choice but to strictly enforce laws.”Police searched Park’s office last week after he announced that his group had launched balloons carrying 500,000 leaflets, 5,000 one-dollar bills and 500 booklets about South Korea’s economic riches across the border during April 25-29.Park’s action would be the first known violation of the law, which took effect in March and punishes anti-North Korean leafletting with up to three years in prison or a fine of 30 million won ($27,000).Officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency refused to confirm any details from the questioning or whether they were pushing for Park’s arrest.Park said his actions were aimed at informing North Koreans of the harsh realities of their country's authoritarian regime and claimed other activists would continue to launch leaflets across the border even if he goes to jail.“What do they even think (anti-North Korean) leaflets are? Do they have poisonous pills inside? Do they have bombs inside?” a visibly frustrated Park told reporters after arriving at the police agency.He said in North Korea “we were taught that South Korea was a colony of US imperialists and hell on Earth. What we are doing is writing letters (to the North) while living here, telling the truth through the leaflets.”North Korea is extremely sensitive to outside criticism about its leadership, and Park’s announcement drew vitriol from Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who handles inter-Korean affairs. She said in a statement released through state media that the leafletting was an “intolerable provocation” and that her government would look into corresponding measures.In 2014, North Korean soldiers at the border fired toward balloons flying toward their territory, prompting South Korean troops to return fire.Seoul’s anti-leafletting law was fiercely debated during a video conference hearing called by US lawmakers last month, where US Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey accused Seoul of retreating from its “longstanding commitment to human rights vis-à-vis North Korea and China, ostensibly in the cause of fostering better relations or achieving nuclear nonproliferation.”South Korean lawyer Jeon Sumi, who was among the panelists defending the law, criticized the leaflets’ “hyper aggressive” language toward North Korea’s leadership and insisted that flying them unnecessarily provokes the North and endangers the safety of South Koreans living in border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-police-summon-activist-over-anti-north-korean-propaganda-leaflets-101620636370954.html

10-05-2021||World||Pakistan to introduce 'new' rules to meet FATF demands: Report||Pakistan, keen to exit from the grey list of the FATF, is set to introduce new rules relating to anti-money laundering cases and change the prosecution process to meet its remaining tough conditions, a media report said on Monday.Pakistan was put on the grey list by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog for money laundering and terror financing in June 2018 and the country has been struggling to come out of it.The Dawn newspaper reported that the changes being made also include the transfer of investigations and prosecution of anti-money laundering (AML) cases from police, provincial anti-corruption establishments (ACEs) and other similar agencies to specialised agencies.This is part of two sets of rules including the AML (Forfeited Properties Management) Rules 2021 and the AML (Referral) Rules 2021 under the National Policy Statement on Follow the Money approved by the federal Cabinet meeting a few days ago, the report said.These rules and related notifications for certain changes in the existing schedule of Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010 (AMLA) would come into force immediately to be followed by the appointment of administrators and special public prosecutors for implementation.Based on these measures, the FATF would conclude if Pakistan has complied with three outstanding benchmarks, out of 27, that blocked its exit from the grey list in February this year.Several review meetings of the FATF are scheduled to begin in the second week of June, culminating in the next FATF plenary on June 21-25.The three outstanding action points (out of a total of 27) include (i) demonstrating that terrorist financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the directive of the designated persons or entities.Demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions; and (iii) demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, particularly those acting for them or on their behalf.Now, the government has decided to appoint dozens of administrators with the powers to confiscate, receive, manage, rent out, auction, transfer or dispose of or take all other measures to preserve the value of the properties and perishable or non-perishable assets to be confiscated under the AML 2010 rules or court orders.The AML (Forfeited Properties Management) Rules 2021 specify how the inventories would be measured, described or defined, protected, and evaluated for auction and how to complete all processes, the report said.The Anti-Money Laundering (Referral) Rules, 2021 are being introduced to enable transfer of the cases from one set of investigation agencies to another.The Cabinet was explained that based on the outcomes of the mutual evaluation, Pakistan was placed by Asia Pacific Group (APG) in the (Expedited) Enhanced Follow Up process which requires the country to submit its follow up report almost every quarter to the APG to provide it with an update on the progress made.These follow up reports (FURs) provide Pakistan a chance to request an upgrade in ratings of recommendations which have been earlier rated as ‘partially compliant’ and ‘non-compliant’ and where subsequently significant progress has since been made.So far, Pakistan has submitted three FURs in February and October 2020 and February 2021. Of these FURs, only one report had been adopted by the APG in which Pakistan was re-rated in Recommendation No 29 (Financial Intelligence Unit) from ‘partially compliant’ to ‘compliant’.In the remaining two FURs, Pakistan had requested for re-rating in 27 recommendations, analysis of which is being conducted by the APG and the same will be adopted within this month.Pakistan also has to issue a “National Policy Statement on Follow the Money (NPSFM)”, the report said.Because of this statement and rules, Pakistan’s compliance with FATF recommendations in Post Observation Period Report (POPR) would further improve with corresponding enhancement in the ratings or effectiveness of the FATF’s relevant Immediate Outcomes, it said.Pakistan’s POPR would be reviewed by the FATF’s Asia-Pacific Joint Group (A-PJG), and based on the report of this group, the FATF would decide further course of action on Pakistan’s progress on the POPR in its plenary scheduled during June 21-25, it added.

10-05-2021||World||Nepal urges Everest climbers to bring back empty oxygen tanks for Covid-19 patients||Nepal is so short of oxygen canisters that it has asked climbers on Mount Everest to bring back their empties instead of abandoning them on mountain slopes, an official said on Monday, as it struggles with a second wave of the coronavirus.The country issued climbing permits to more than 700 climbers for 16 Himalayan peaks - 408 to Mount Everest - for the April-May climbing season in a bid to get the mountaineering industry and tourism back up and running.The Nepal Mountaineering Association has asked the climbers to help Nepal deal with a surge in Covid-19 cases that has brought the country's fragile healthcare system to breaking point, as it has in neighbouring India where deaths held close to record highs on Monday.Kul Bahadur Gurung, a senior official with the NMA, said climbers and their Sherpa guides were estimated to have carried at least 3,500 oxygen bottles this season. These bottles often get buried in avalanches or are abandoned on the mountain slopes at the end of the expedition."We appeal to climbers and sherpas to bring back their empty bottles wherever possible as they can be refilled and used for the treatment of the coronavirus patients who are in dire needs," Gurung told Reuters.On Sunday, Nepal reported a daily increase of 8,777 infections, 30 times the number recorded on April 9. The total caseload stands at 394,667 and 3,720 deaths, according to government data.Many private and community hospitals in Kathmandu have said they are unable to take any more patients due to lack of oxygen. There was a shortage of both the gas and canisters."We need about 25,000 oxygen cylinders immediately to save people from dying. This is our urgent need," Samir Kumar Adhikari, a health ministry official said."We also need oxygen plants, compressors and ICU beds urgently," Adhikari said. Nepal has asked China to send 20,000 cylinders, some of which will be airlifted to meet urgent needs, another official said.China has pledged to provide oxygen cylinders, ventilators and other medical supplies, Health and Population Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said.Nepal has only 1,600 intensive care beds and fewer than 600 ventilators for its population of 30 million with just 0.7 doctors per 100,000 people, according to ActionAid Nepal.Prakash Thapa, a doctor at the Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, in southwest Nepal bordering India, said patients were sleeping on the floor and corridors."We are somehow managing so far but it will be difficult to take any more patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-urges-everest-climbers-to-bring-back-empty-oxygen-tanks-for-covid-19-patients-101620633165587.html

Parents are waking their children and rushing them to bomb shelters," the IDF said on Twitter on Monday as reported by Sputnik.About half an hour earlier, the IDF said that air raid sirens had sounded in southern Israel.On Sunday, a total of four rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza. Two of the rockets exploded inside Gaza; one was intercepted by the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System. According to the IDF, no Israeli casualties have been reported so far.The Israeli forces attacked Hamas targets in response to the Sunday rocket launches from Gaza."In response to the explosive arson balloons & 4 rockets fired from Gaza at Israel yesterday, IDF tanks just struck Hamas terror targets in Gaza," the IDF said on Twitter in the early hours of Monday, reported Sputnik.In the early hours of Sunday, the IDF detected another rocket launch from Gaza into Israeli territory. The projectile reportedly landed in a field. The Israeli forces targeted a Hamas military post in southern Gaza in response to the rocket attack.Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported that 14 more people have been treated for injuries amid clashes in Jerusalem. At least 560 people have been treated for injuries in the last three days.Clashes in Jerusalem are reportedly continuing and there are reports of gatherings at West Bank checkpoints near Ramallah.Over 70 Palestinians in total are set to be evicted from Sheikh Jarrah in the coming weeks to be replaced by right-wing Jewish Israelis.

10-05-2021||World||Premiers of Canadian provinces, leaders to raise Covid-19 funds for India||Premiers of Canadian provinces, mayors of cities and other leaders from across the country will join over 80 Indo-Canadian organisations for a major “oxygen” fundraiser next Sunday for procuring and sending critical equipment required in India to combat the raging Covid-19 crisis there.The virtual fund-raiser will be held on May 16 and among those who have confirmed their participation are the premiers of the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan, Doug Ford and Scott Moe, respectively. Also on board are the mayors of Brampton and Mississauga, Patrick Brown and Bonnie Crombie. The event is being coordinated by the Indo-Canadian Chamber of Commerce or ICCC, and it has partnered with 82 other community organisation for the Marathon - Oxygen for India fund-raiser, which is scheduled to go on for four-and-a-half hours.Vijay Thomas, president of ICCC, said that their target is to raise $ 2 million Canadian dollars at least, to purchase oxygen concentrators and generators to be dispatched to India.Thomas said that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several federal cabinet ministers have also been invited to participate in the fundraiser, though their confirmations are still awaited. “We have also invited every premier from coast-to-coast and hope to get 50 Canadian leaders to join us,” he said.The objective is to “raise awareness among Canadians at large about the situation on India and that Canada stands by India just as India stood by Canada when it needed vaccines”, he said.With its partner organisations, ICCC has already bought 2,000 oxygen concentrators so far, of which 200 have already reached India, and 1,500 are in transit, while the remainder are being processed.“We are looking at oxygen generators for small and mid-size hospitals to power beds and have them reach as quickly as possible since time is of essence,” Thomas said.To fashion “as wide an alliance as possible” for this purpose, ICCC is working with Indian associations across cities like Montreal and Vancouver, and community groups dedicated to regions or states like those for Haryana, Rajasthan and Goa, among others.While the Indo-Canadian community makes these efforts, the Canadian government has sent 25,000 vials of the anti-viral remdesivir as well as 50 ventilators to India, with another 300 ventilators likely to leave Canada soon. In addition, the federal government has provided $10 million Canadian dollars to the Canadian Red Cross, which is working with the Indian Red Cross Society.Provincial governments have also stepped in to help. Ontario shipped off 3,000 ventilators on Friday, as the province’s premier Doug Ford tweeted, “I am very proud to help our friends in need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/premiers-of-canadian-provinces-leaders-to-raise-covid-19-funds-for-india-101620624197437.html

10-05-2021||World||Gangster executed outside Vancouver airport||An Indo-Canadian gangster was executed by suspected rivals outside the main terminal of the Vancouver International Airport or YVR on Sunday afternoon, with the suspects firing upon pursuing police while fleeing.While the victim has not been formally named by investigators, the Vancouver Sun identified him as Karman Singh Grewal, 28, who had a long history of being associated with gangs in the region. At a press conference at the airport late on Sunday, Sgt Frank Jang, spokesperson for the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said the execution-style killing was “linked to ongoing gang conflict” that has marked the region in recent times.The Vancouver Sun also reported Grewal was “very close” to gangster Jimi Sandhu, who was deported to India in 2016.The shooting occurred at around 3pm on Sunday afternoon outside the main terminal of the airport, from where flights depart for national and international destinations. The airport remained open with “restricted access.” Chief superintendent Will Ng of the Richmond Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) told reporters that the murder was “targeted and carried out in broad daylight” and that “this generation of gangsters is taking things to another level”.Trains to the Sea Island in Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver, where the airport is located, were temporarily halted as was traffic from a tunnel and bridges leading to it.The Richmond detachment of RCMP tweeted that officers intercepted the getaway vehicle and were shot at by the suspects. While the officers were not hurt, the suspects escaped. What is believed to be their vehicle was found torched in the nearby township of Surrey.In a statement released on Sunday evening, the airport authorities said, “RCMP responded to a police incident at Vancouver International Airport outside the main terminal today. It has since been contained. Our thoughts are with those impacted by today’s incident. The airport is open and safe for airport workers and those who need to travel.”Gangland activity has been on the rise in the area in recent weeks. Four confirmed killings have been reported there over the past three weeks. These gangs have a strong Indo-Canadian presence as well, as one significant figure among them, Harb Dhaliwal, was gunned down outside a restaurant in Vancouver on the evening of April 17.CBC News described the airport incident as the “the most brazen shooting yet in Metro Vancouver’s latest spurt of gun violence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gangster-executed-outside-vancouver-airport-101620622877298.html

Two supermarket staff members were among those injured.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the motivation for the attack had not been established but police didn't have any evidence to suggest it was domestic terrorism.“Needless to say that such an attack is hugely concerning, and I do want to acknowledge the really early reports of courageous acts by bystanders who have taken action in order to protect those around them,” Ardern said. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this attack.”Ardern said five people had been taken to Dunedin Hospital with stab wounds or related injuries. Their conditions were not immediately available.People in the store at the time told local media that it was a chaotic scene as people began screaming and running toward the exits. They said some brave shoppers had tried to stop the man and pin him down.“We are shocked and devastated by the events in our Dunedin Central Store this afternoon,” Countdown said in a statement. “Our priority right now is our injured team members and caring for our wider team in the wake of this extremely traumatic event. We are deeply upset that customers who tried to help our team members were also injured.”Police said they would be releasing more details on the incident later on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-injured-in-stabbing-attack-at-new-zealand-supermarket-suspect-arrested-101620621539777.html
10-05-2021||World||Myanmar poet dies in detention, body returned with organs missing||Myanmar poet Khet Thi, whose works declare resistance to the ruling junta, died in detention overnight and his body was returned with the organs removed, his family said on Sunday.A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls to request comment on the death of Khet Thi, who had penned the line "They shoot in the head, but they don't know the revolution is in the heart." His Facebook page said he was 45.Khet Thi's wife said both of them were taken for interrogation on Saturday by armed soldiers and police in the central town of Shwebo, in the Sagaing region - a centre of resistance to the coup in which elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted."I was interrogated. So was he. They said he was at the interrogation centre. But he didn't come back, only his body," his wife Chaw Su told BBC Burmese language news in tears from Monywa, around 100 km (60 miles) away by road."They called me in the morning and told me to meet him at the hospital in Monywa. I thought it was just for a broken arm or something ... But when I arrived here, he was at the morgue and his internal organs were taken out," she said.She had been told at the hospital he had a heart problem, but had not bothered to read the death certificate because she was sure it would not be true, Chaw Su said. Reuters was unable to reach the hospital for comment.Chaw Su said the army had planned to bury him but that she pleaded with them for the body. She did not say how she knew her husband's organs had been removed."He died at the hospital after being tortured in the interrogation centre," the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said in a bulletin that put the toll of civilians killed since the coup at 780.The group, which monitors details of killings, did not identify the source of its information.OTHER POETS DIEDKhet Thi was at least the third poet to die during protests since the Feb. 1 coup.Khet Thi had been a friend of K Za Win, 39, a poet who was shot dead during a protest in Monywa in early March.Cultural figures and celebrities have been prominent supporters of opposition to the coup with protests daily in different parts of the Southeast Asian country in spite of the killings and thousands of arrests.Khet Thi had been an engineer before quitting his job in 2012 to focus on his poetry and to support himself by making and selling ice cream and cakes."I don't want to be a hero, I don't want to be a martyr, I don't want to be a weakling, I don't want to be a fool," he wrote two weeks after the coup. "I don't want to support injustice. If I have only a minute to live, I want my conscience to be clean for that minute."More recently, he wrote that he was a guitar player, a cake baker and a poet - not someone who could fire a gun. But he implied his attitude was changing."My people are being shot and I can only throw back poems," he wrote. "But when you are sure your voice is not enough, then you need to choose a gun carefully. I will shoot."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-poet-dies-in-detention-body-returned-with-organs-missing-101620616708672.html
10-05-2021||World||US expresses 'serious concerns' about Jerusalem clashes, Palestinians' evictions||U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday expressed "serious concerns" to his Israeli counterpart about violent clashes in Jerusalem sparked by planned evictions of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the White House said in a statement.Sullivan in a phone call with Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat "encouraged the Israeli government to pursue appropriate measures to ensure calm during Jerusalem Day commemorations."New confrontations broke out between Palestinians and Israeli police in parts of East Jerusalem on Sunday, including in Sheikh Jarrah and outside the walled Old City, as well as in Haifa, a mixed Arab-Jewish city in northern Israel at the height of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The clashes have been sparked by the planned evictions of several Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem, an area captured by Israel in a 1967 war.Israel's attorney-general secured a deferment on Sunday of an Israeli Supreme Court hearing on the evictions, a session that had threatened to stoke more violence in the holy city and heighten international concern."Mr. Sullivan also reiterated the United States’ serious concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood," the White House statement said.Sullivan and Ben-Shabbat "agreed that the launching of rocket attacks and incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel is unacceptable and must be condemned," the White House added.It said Sullivan also expressed the Biden administration's commitment to Israel's security and to supporting peace and stability throughout the Middle East and would remain fully engaged in the days ahead to promote calm in Jerusalem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-serious-concerns-about-jerusalem-clashes-palestinians-evictions-101620612486606.html
10-05-2021||World||US government working to aid top fuel pipeline operator after cyberattack||The White House was working closely with top US fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline on Sunday to help it recover from a ransomware attack that forced the company to shut a critical fuel network supplying populous eastern states.The attack is one of the most disruptive digital ransom schemes reported and has prompted calls from American lawmakers to strengthen protections for critical US energy infrastructure from hacking attacks.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the pipeline fix was a top priority for the Biden administration and Washington was working to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions by helping Colonial restart as quickly as possible its more than 5,500-mile (8,850 km) pipeline network from Texas to New Jersey."It's an all hands on deck effort right now," Raimondo said on CBS' "Face the Nation" program. "We are working closely with the company, state and local officials, to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren't disruptions in supply."Colonial said on Sunday its main fuel lines remain offline but some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points are now operational. Neither Raimondo nor the company gave an estimate for a full restart date and Colonial declined further comment on Sunday.US gasoline futures jumped more than 3% to $2.217 a gallon, the highest since May 2018, as trading opened for the week and market participants reacted to the closure.Colonial transports roughly 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline and other fuels from refiners on the Gulf Coast to consumers in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States.Its extensive pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic.A Charlotte Douglas International Airport spokesperson said the airport had supply on-hand and was "monitoring the situation closely," adding that the complex is supplied by another major pipeline as well as Colonial.Retail fuel experts including the American Automobile Association said an outage lasting several days could have significant impacts on regional fuel supplies, particularly in the southeastern United States.During previous Colonial outages, retail prices in southeastern states have risen substantially.Offices of governors in several of the US states most vulnerable to fuel shortages - including Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland - were not immediately available for comment.CYBERCRIMINALS SUSPECTEDWhile the US government investigation is in the early stages, a former US official and three industry sources said the hackers are suspected to be a professional cybercriminal group called DarkSide.DarkSide is one of many ransomware gangs extorting victims while avoiding targets in post-Soviet states. The groups gain access to private networks, encrypt files using software, and often also steal data.They demand payment to decrypt the files and increasingly ask for additional money not to publish stolen content.In the Colonial attack, the hackers took more than 100 gigabytes of data, according to a person familiar with the incident.As the FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond, the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline Saturday, the person said.Colonial's data did not appear to have been transferred from that system anywhere else, potentially limiting the hackers' leverage to extort or further embarrass the company.Cybersecurity firm FireEye is among those dealing with the attack, industry sources said. FireEye declined to comment. Colonial said it was working with a "leading, third-party cybersecurity firm," but did not name the firm.Messages left with the DarkSide hackers were not immediately returned. The group's dark website, where hackers regularly post data about victims, made no reference to Colonial Pipeline.Colonial declined to comment on whether DarkSide hackers were involved in the attack, when the breach occurred or what ransom they demanded.BIDEN BRIEFED ON HACKPresident Joe Biden was briefed on the cyberattack on Saturday morning, the White House said, adding that the government was working to try to help the company restore operations and prevent supply disruptions.US Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who sits on the Energy Committee, said lawmakers are prepared to work more with privately held critical infrastructure companies to guard against cyberattacks."The implication for this, for our national security, cannot be overstated. And I promise you, this is something that Republicans and Democrats can work together on," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press."Another fuel pipeline serving the same regions carries a third of what Colonial does. Any prolonged outage would require tankers to transport fuels from the US Gulf Coast to East Coast ports.The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is issuing a temporary hours of service exemption to truckers transporting refined products to 17 southern and east coast states including Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and New York.Complicating the fallback plans, according to one industry source familiar with the federal response, was that the ranks of fuel-truck drivers for the main road transportation companies, which could pick up some of the pipeline volume, are down by 25% or more because of coronavirus infections.Oil refining companies contacted by Reuters over the weekend said their operations had not yet been impacted. Some were working to find alternative transport for customers.The privately held, Georgia-based company is owned by CDPQ Colonial Partners L.P., IFM (US) Colonial Pipeline 2 LLC, KKR-Keats Pipeline Investors L.P., Koch Capital Investments Company LLC and Shell Midstream Operating LLC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-working-to-aid-top-fuel-pipeline-operator-after-cyberattack-101620609901944.html

For about a day, the acquaintances of the disappeared made independent attempts to find the man, after which they reported the incident to the police," the statement said.The Ministry said that search operations underway were complicated by the difficult terrain and the presence of wetlands.Murakhovsky was promoted to the position of Health Minister of the Omsk region after his handling of Navalny's hospitalisation last year, CNN reported citing TASS.He was the chief doctor at Omsk emergency hospital number 1 when Navalny was admitted to the acute poisoning unit of the hospital on August 20, 2020, after falling ill on a plane heading from Siberia to Moscow.Murakhovsky had then told the media that the main working diagnosis for the Kremlin critic was "a metabolic disorder which caused a sharp drop in blood sugar", CNN reported.Navalny had ridiculed the promotion of Murakhovsky to Omsk regional health minister, saying: "You lie, fake test results, are ready to please the bosses in any way - you get an award and a promotion."In February this year, a senior doctor of the hospital, Sergey Maximishin, suddenly died at the age of 55. Rustam Agishev - another top doctor who worked at the hospital, also died in March, although it is not clear if Agishev had anything to do with Navalny's treatment.Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied any role in Navalny's poisoning, and prison officials say they are providing adequate care.The Kremlin critic went on hunger strike on March 31 while in prison to demand medical care, but ended it last week when he was finally given medical attention.Russia has brought several cases against Navalny, which he and his supporters say are trumped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-doctor-at-russian-hospital-that-treated-opposition-leader-navalny-goes-missing-101620607710052.html

The Taliban declared similar ceasefires last year to mark Islamic holidays.The government usually reciprocates with a truce. Fraidon Khawzon, spokesman for chief negotiator Abdullah Abdullah, said early Monday: "We welcome the announcement....the Islamic republic is also ready and will announce soon."'Bodies piled on top of each other' The latest offer comes after the government blamed the Taliban for Saturday's attack outside a girls' school in Dasht-e-Barchi, a suburb of the capital largely populated by the Shiite Hazara community, which is often targeted by extremist Sunni Islamist militants.A series of blasts outside the school -- when residents were shopping ahead of the holiday -- killed more than 50 people and wounded over 100.It was the deadliest attack in more than a year.The Taliban, who denied responsibility, had earlier issued a statement saying the nation needed to "safeguard and look after educational centres and institutions".On Sunday, relatives buried the dead at a hilltop site known as "Martyrs Cemetery", where victims of attacks against the Hazara community are laid to rest.Hazaras are Shiite Muslims and considered heretics by extremist Sunnis. Sunni Muslims make up the majority of the Afghan population.Bodies in wooden coffins were lowered into graves one by one by mourners still in a state of shock and fear, an AFP photographer said."I rushed to the scene (after the blasts) and found myself in the middle of bodies, their hands and heads cut off and bones smashed," said Mohammad Taqi, a resident of Dasht-e-Barchi, whose two daughters were students at the school but escaped the attack."All of them were girls. Their bodies piled on top of each other."Books and school bags belonging to the victims still lay scattered at the site of the attack.The Taliban insist they have not carried out attacks in Kabul since February last year, when they signed a deal with Washington that paved the way for peace talks and withdrawal of the remaining US troops.But the group has clashed daily with Afghan forces in the rugged countryside even as the US military reduces its presence.Taliban chief warns USThe United States was supposed to have pulled all forces out by May 1 as agreed with the Taliban last year, but Washington pushed back the date to September 11 -- a move that angered the insurgents.The leader of the Taliban, Hibatullah Akhundzada, reiterated in a message released ahead of Eid that any delay in withdrawing the troops was a "violation" of that deal."If America again fails to live up to its commitments, then the world must bear witness and hold America accountable for all the consequences," Akhundzada warned in Sunday's message.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has declared a day of national mourning for Tuesday."This savage group does not have the power to confront security forces on the battlefield, and instead targets with brutality and barbarism public facilities and the girls' school," he said in a statement.Saturday's blasts drew widespread global condemnation.Pope Francis called it "an inhumane action", while Iran blamed the jihadist Islamic State.India, meanwhile, called for the dismantling of "terrorist sanctuaries" and a ceasefire to boost peace efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-declare-three-day-afghan-ceasefire-for-eid-holiday-101620605241663.html

There is no better person to build momentum for further change as we approach the COP26 climate summit in November,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Johnson, who is keen to burnish his environmental credentials, has said he will push leaders at the G7 summit he will chair to make firm climate commitments.Attenborough said COP26 had to succeed.“There could not be a more important moment that we should have international agreement. The epidemic has shown us how crucial it is to find agreement among nations if we are to solve such worldwide problems," he said.In February, Attenborough told the U.N. Security Council that climate change is the biggest security threat that modern humans have ever faced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-names-sir-david-attenborough-as-people-s-advocate-ahead-of-key-climate-summit-101620606391947.html
10-05-2021||World||Weekend of clashes in Jerusalem's old city: Bibi vows to impose order after chaos||Israel vowed on Sunday to restore order in Jerusalem after hundreds of Palestinian protesters were wounded in a weekend of clashes with Israeli security forces, while the justice ministry put off a key court ruling on a flashpoint property dispute.Consecutive nights of violence around the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City has been the worst since 2017, fuelled by a years-long bid by Jewish settlers to take over nearby Palestinian homes in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.Ahead of a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also referred to as “Bibi”, warned that Israel “would decisively and responsibly impose law and order in Jerusalem”.Amid growing international calls for a de-escalation, Tunisia said the UN Security Council was to hold a closed-door meeting on Monday, at its request, to discuss the violence.Some 121 Palestinians were wounded in Saturday’s overnight clashes. Israeli police said 17 of its officers were wounded.The previous night more than 220 people, again mostly Palestinians, were hurt as police stormed Al-Aqsa, saying Palestinians had thrown rocks and fireworks at officers.Four Arab countries that normalised ties with Israel over the past year - the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan - all condemned Israel’s actions and voiced support for the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weekend-of-clashes-in-jerusalem-s-old-city-bibi-vows-to-impose-order-after-chaos-101620606399527.html

A small group of adults stood nearby, some of them audibly sobbing, along with a small child.Freddie Marquez, 33, said his mother-in-law was one of the victims and that he was at the party but left around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday.Some time after midnight, he received a call from the son of one of the women at the party, who was crying on the phone."Somebody came in and shot everybody," Marquez said, relating what he had been told on the phone.SPATE OF MASS SHOOTINGSThe massacre was the latest in a resurgence of mass shootings in the United States after such occurrences seemed to recede during the height of coronavirus pandemic restrictions.Among the incidents this year was one in Boulder, Colorado, where a 21-year-old man has been charged with killing 10 people in a March 22 shooting spree at a supermarket about 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Denver. That came less than a week after another 21-year-old gunman was accused of killing eight people at three Atlanta-area day spas.Colorado was also the state where two other deadly rampages took place, both in the Denver area: the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 15 people including the two perpetrators, and the 2012 shooting in an Aurora movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded about 70. The Aurora shooter is serving a life sentence.The recent shootings have revived the gun control debate, with Democratic President Joe Biden calling them a "national embarrassment" and calling for new legislation from Congress.But he faces serious opposition from gun rights advocates including Republicans and some Democrats who cite the U.S. Constitution's protection of gun ownership rights.Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said that "my heart breaks for the families" in Sunday's attack and promised to support them."My vow to this community and to the families who have lost someone today, is that this department will do everything we can to find you the answers you deserve and be here for you with an unwavering support," Niski said in the police statement.Police said they withheld releasing details of the shooting for several hours "in order to properly and respectfully notify family members of the deceased and ensure support was in place."The names of the victims will be released later, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-killed-at-colorado-birthday-party-shooting-children-survive-101620605230762.html

10-05-2021||World||Colonial Pipeline hack: What we know so far||Ransom-seeking hackers have broken into Colonial Pipeline, prompting the company to shut one of America's major arteries for fuel delivery.Here is a look at what we know, and what we don't, about one of the most disruptive digital shakedown efforts to hit a US company.Who is involved ? Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline and the US government have both blamed ransomware for the massive outage, pointing the finger at cybercriminal gangs who routinely hold data and computer networks hostage in exchange for digital currency payments.There is no official word on which group is believed to have carried out the intrusion - and attributing malicious activity online can be extremely difficult - but a former US official and three industry sources told Reuters a group dubbed "DarkSide" was among the suspects. If so, that would lay the responsibility on a new but professional group of criminals believed to be operating out of the former Soviet republics.Cybersecurity FireEye is involved with the incident response, according to three industry sources.How bad is it ?Ransomware can deal catastrophic damage to an organization's network by locking away critical data or even wrecking computers beyond repair. But the effect on the actual nuts and bolts of energy companies' operations varies.A destructive cyberattack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 crippled the oil giant's computer network but left production more-or-less unscathed. By contrast, a more recent ransomware incident at Norsk Hydro temporarily pushed the aluminum maker to switch away from automated production at its smelters.Experts say the severity of the Colonial case will depend on whether the ransomware made its way into the company's operational technology network, which interfaces with the pipeline itself. Earlier this year, US government officials announced that an intrusion at an unnamed natural gas compression plant that spilled over into its operational technology network forced a two-day shut down of its entire pipeline.Colonial has not given any public indication as to the reach of the ransomware outbreak, but Robert M. Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, said he believed Colonial's operations network was shut down proactively "to make sure that nothing spread into those systems."He said that will hopefully translate to "a temporary outage versus something that would be more sustained."What happens next ?US government officials are working with Colonial to help it recover while scrambling to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions should the outage continue.Colonial's pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic, and experts say regional fuel supplies could be impacted if the pipeline stays shut."A one-to-two-day outage is really a minor inconvenience," said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. But by day four or five, he said, "we could see a much greater widespread impact through large areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and the southeast."Whether the pipeline stays shut that long in turn depends on how deeply the hackers penetrated Colonial's network - and how soon cybersecurity experts can pull them out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colonial-pipeline-hack-what-we-know-so-far-101620597705085.html

Some families were still searching hospitals for their children.“The first blast was powerful and happened so close to the children that some of them could not be found,” said an Afghan official, requesting anonymity.On Sunday, civilians and policemen collected books and school bags strewn across a blood-stained road now busy with shoppers ahead of celebrations for Eid al-Fitr next week.President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday blamed Taliban insurgents but a spokesman for the group denied involvement and condemned any attacks on Afghan civilians.Pope Francis called the attack as “inhuman act” in remarks to pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City on Sunday.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the attack and expressed his deepest sympathies to the victims’ families and to the Afghan government and people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-school-blast-toll-rises-to-68-101620596194161.html

But so far, it has stopped short of adding it to its list of “variant of concern (VOC)”.Some national health authorities, including in the US and Britain, said they consider B.1.617 a VOC, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit. “B 1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations that increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection,” she said.SA, UK and B’desh detect cases of Indian variantSouth Africa, Britain and Bangladesh have all detected more cases of the Indian variant. South Africa’s health ministry said four cases have been recorded in the country. Seven cases of the Indian variant have been found in the UK’s Bedfordshire county. In Bangladesh, it was detected as the country’s first case of the variant first identified in India.EU does not renew order for AstraZeneca vaccineThe EU Commission did not renew its order for AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the EU’s internal market commissioner said on Sunday. “We have not renewed the order for after June.

10-05-2021||World||EU launches conference to debate its future with citizens||French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday expressed hope that Europe would rediscover the path of “great projects, great ambitions and great dreams” as the European Union launched a wide consultation process meant to design the shape of the bloc's future.Macron spoke as part of Europe Day, the inaugural event of the Conference on the Future of Europe in the French city of Strasbourg.“What Europe do we want in 10 years, 15 years from now?,” Macron asked in his opening speech, calling on people to debate all major issues, from the bloc’s borders to new institutions, cultural projects, education and the fight against climate change.The process also aims at bringing the EU's complex decision-making closer to its 450 million citizens.While advocating for Europe’s democratic model, based on solidarity, Macron acknowledged that “we’ve seen that sometimes Europe didn’t go fast enough and maybe didn’t have enough ambition.”He called on Europeans to get inspired by the United States to rediscover ways to “shape the future and move fast.”The pandemic has shown that the EU lacked the effective tools to react quickly to a continent-wide emergency. The bloc was notably criticized at the beginning of the year for its vaccination campaign starting slower compared to the U.S. and the United Kingdom.“The pandemic has been traumatic ... and like all trauma we need to find a way of talk about it if we want to move beyond it," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “And there’s no better way to do that than by offering prospective, hope and the ability to change things for the better."The process is meant to allow “young people in particular to have their say” about Europe's future, she said.A digital platform and series of conference-related events will enable people to share their views on changes and improvements they wish for the EU.The conference's plenary will be composed of representatives from the European Parliament, member states, the European Commission, as well as representatives from all national parliaments, social partners, the civil society and panels of citizens.European Parliament President David Sassoli said “as we are about to rebuild our economies and our societies on new foundations ... it is even more crucial and urgent to listen to our fellow citizens, to feel their needs, their expectations in terms of assistance, jobs, dignity, security and prosperity.”The conference is expected to reach conclusions to provide guidance on the future of Europe by spring 2022.Meanwhile, Macron hoped the European Parliament will be able to hold its next plenary session in June in Strasbourg, its official seat. European lawmakers didn’t return to the French city since February last year because of the virus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-launches-conference-to-debate-its-future-with-citizens-101620585325140.html
