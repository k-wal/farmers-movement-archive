At least 10 suspects were arrested, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/25-killed-in-rio-de-janeiro-police-raid-on-drug-gang-101620320715687.html

06-05-2021||World||Germany rejects US proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines||Germany on Thursday rejected a U.S. proposal to waive patent protection for Covid-19 vaccines, saying the greatest constraints on production were not intellectual property but increasing capacity and ensuring quality.President Joe Biden on Wednesday voiced support for a waiver in a sharp reversal of the U.S. position, and his top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, swiftly backed negotiations at the World Trade Organization.The German government stood behind the goal of a worldwide supply of Covid-19 vaccines, a government spokeswoman said, adding however that the main factors in vaccine production are capacity and quality standards, and not patents."The protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so in the future," the spokeswoman said in a statement.She said Germany supported the COVAX initiative, with the aim of ensuring that as many people in the world as possible have access to vaccines, adding that discussions were continuing at the WTO.The WTO said in April that of 700 million vaccines administered around the world, only 0.2% had been in low-income countries. A recent surge of infections in India, the world's second most populous country, has underlined the point.The European Union is willing to discuss a proposal to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday, as drugmakers fought their ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-rejects-us-proposal-to-waive-patents-on-covid-19-vaccines-101620318008154.html
06-05-2021||World||Putin backs Russia waiving patents on its Covid-19 vaccines||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said he supported the idea of a waiver on patent protections for coronavirus vaccines as Russia registered its fourth virus jab called Sputnik Light.A campaign to lift patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines picked up steam on Thursday, with French, German and EU leadership saying they were ready to discuss a proposal by US President Joe Biden, before Putin added his support."We are hearing from Europe an idea that, in my opinion, deserves attention -- namely, to remove patent protections from vaccines against Covid-19 altogether," Putin said during a televised meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova."Russia would of course support such an approach," Putin said, urging Golikova to work out the logistics."As I have said many times... We should not think about how to extract maximum profit, but about how to ensure people's safety."Supporters of waivers for vaccines argue that poor countries are struggling to get inoculation drives underway while rich countries protect the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical giants.Russia has registered three coronavirus vaccines, and on Thursday approved a fourth -- a single-dose version of its Sputnik V jab called Sputnik Light.Moscow has actively pushed Sputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- around the world, with more than 60 countries having approved it for use.Russia registered the jab in August before results from large-scale clinical trials, but leading medical journal The Lancet has since said it is safe and more than 90 percent effective.In addition to the Sputnik jabs, Russia has also registered two other homegrown vaccines, the EpiVacCorona and CoviVac.'As simple and reliable as a Kalashnikov'In his meeting with Golikova Thursday, Putin said that while Western countries had developed "innovative" vaccines, Russia's are the safest and most reliable."As simple and reliable as a Kalashnikov assault rifle," he said.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped finance the vaccine, said in a statement that Sputnik Light "demonstrated 79.4 percent efficacy" compared to 91.6 percent for the two-shot Sputnik V.The state-run Gamaleya research institute, which developed Sputnik V, said Thursday that more than 20 million people globally have received their first dose of the shot.Russia, however, has struggled to inoculate its own citizens since beginning its jab drive in early December.Golikova on Thursday told Putin that 9.4 million Russians have been fully vaccinated, while 13.4 million have received their first dose in the country of 144 million people.Polls show many Russians are sceptical of Covid-19 vaccines.Last month Putin said he hoped 70 percent of Russia's adult population will be inoculated by autumn and appealed for all Russians to get a vaccine.The country has been among the hardest hit by Covid-19 with over 112,000 deaths as of Thursday, according to a tally by health officials.But authorities have been criticised for downplaying the severity of the pandemic by counting only fatalities where the coronavirus was found to be the primary cause of death after an autopsy.Figures released by the Rosstat statistics agency last week showed that Russia had actually recorded some 250,000 virus-related deaths by the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-backs-russia-waiving-patents-on-its-covid-19-vaccines-101620317866768.html
06-05-2021||World||Moderna sees no impact on Covid-19 vaccine from potential patent waiver||Moderna Inc on Thursday said it believes countries around the globe would continue buying its Covid-19 vaccine for years even if patents on the shots are waived, noting that rivals would face significant hurdles in scaling up manufacturing.The comments come a day after the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic, paving the way for what could be months of negotiations to hammer out a specific waiver plan.Moderna shares were off 7.5% after falling as much as nearly 12% earlier. Shares of other Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer Inc were also down on the patent news."While this is a negative headline," said Morgan Stanley analysts in a research note, there is no mechanism "to force management to teach other manufacturers how to make their vaccine, suggesting no change to the status quo."Moderna, which said in October it would not enforce patents on its vaccine during the pandemic, noted the lack of companies able to rapidly scale up complex manufacturing of a similar vaccine to meet surging global demand."They will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale manufacturing. This does not happen in 6 or 12 or 18 months," Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on a post-earnings conference call.Moderna has faced its own hurdles scaling up production with some shortfalls in the manufacturing supply chain, which includes Swiss contract manufacturer Lonza Group, leading to delivery delays in Europe.Bancel said he has had to tell some countries, "we're very sorry. We have no more supply for you in 2021."Still, the company said it expects to produce between 800 million to 1 billion doses this year.Moderna raised its 2021 sales forecast for its Covid-19 shot by 4.3% to $19.2 billion on Thursday, two days after Pfizer increased its full-year Covid-19 vaccine sales forecast more than 70% to $26 billion.Moderna expects vaccine output could increase to 3 billion doses in 2022 to meet demand from nations looking to stock up supplies and sign up deals for "booster" doses.Early clinical trial data released on Wednesday showed that a third dose of either Moderna's current shot or an experimental new vaccine increases immunity against the more easily transmissible virus variants first found in Brazil and South Africa.Moderna, which is seeking to expand authorization of its vaccine to children and adolescents, on Thursday said an initial analysis of a study in those aged 12 to 17 showed an efficacy rate of 96%.The company also reported its first-ever quarterly profit on sales of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-sees-no-impact-on-covid-19-vaccine-from-potential-patent-waiver-101620316434795.html

06-05-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to pandemic low of 498,000||The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid fell last week to 498,000, the lowest point since the viral pandemic struck 14 months ago and a sign of the job market's growing strength as businesses reopen and consumers step up spending.Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that applications declined 92,000 from a revised 590,000 a week earlier. The number of weekly jobless claims ‚Äî a rough measure of the pace of layoffs ‚Äî has declined significantly from a peak of 900,000 in January as employers have ramped up hiring.At the same time, the pace of applications is still well above the roughly 230,000 level that prevailed before the viral outbreak tore through the economy in March of last year.As vaccinations have been more widely administered, restrictions on businesses have gradually lifted and consumers have become more willing to travel, shop and dine out, stronger spending has boosted hiring, slowed layoffs and accelerated growth. The economy grew last quarter at a vigorous 6.4% annual rate, with expectations that the current quarter will be even better.In March, employers added nearly 1 million jobs, the most since August. Roughly the same number is expected to be reported Friday when the government issues the jobs report for April. Even so, the economy will still be more than 7 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.The government‚Äôs report Thursday showed that about 16.2 million people were continuing to collect unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 17, down from 16.6 million in the previous week. That's a sign that some former recipients have found jobs.As economic growth has accelerated, sales of vehicles and newly built homes have soared, manufacturing output has risen and Americans on average have increased their savings and wealth. In part, this is because of $1,400 stimulus checks that were distributed to most adults and in part because many affluent households have built up savings while working from home and have benefited from a surging stock market.The economy, though, is restarting so quickly that it‚Äôs creating supply bottlenecks and parts shortages. Many companies, especially restaurants, can‚Äôt find enough applicants to fill available jobs. Others are raising pay to attract more applicants.Shortages of raw materials and parts have swollen prices for lumber, copper and semiconductor chips, which are critical to the housing and auto industries, among other sectors. Those higher costs, along with wage pressures, have elevated fears that inflation could accelerate.Analysts have forecast that when the monthly jobs report is released Friday, it will show that the economy added 975,000 jobs in April, according to data provider FactSet, and that the unemployment rate fell from 6% to 5.8%. That would show that more Americans are looking for work and more employers are hiring them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-pandemic-low-of-498000-101620305542092.html
06-05-2021||World||France, Britain send patrol boats to Jersey in post-Brexit fishing row||France and Britain deployed maritime patrol vessels to the waters off the Channel island of Jersey on Thursday as a dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights escalated.The European Union called for calm over the row, which on Thursday saw a flotilla of French trawlers sail in protest to Jersey's main harbour and a French minister suggest earlier in the week that Paris might cut electricity to the island.French fishermen say they are being unfairly deprived of access to rich fishing grounds off the coast of Jersey, a self-governing British Crown Dependency.Jersey says it is following the rules for issuing licenses set out in Britain's post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who led the 2016 Brexit campaign, had cast the trade deal as a way to take back control of the United Kingdom's destiny after Brexit.On Thursday, he said the two Royal Navy vessels would remain off Jersey as a precautionary measure, according to his office.An official from the French presidency said the deployment of patrol vessels from both France and Britain was aimed at preventing clashes between trawlers on opposing sides of the row.France is angry on April 30 Jersey issued 41 licenses with what the Paris government called unilaterally imposed conditions, including the time French fishing vessels could spend in Jersey's waters.Jersey officials have said the accord stipulates licenses take into account how much time a vessel spent in Jersey's waters before Brexit.FRENCH FLOTILLAThe Europe Commission said that until further justifications had been provided by Britain, Jersey officials should not be attaching new conditions to the issuance of licenses."Full compliance with the TCA (Brexit trade deal) is essential in this process," Commission spokeswoman Vivian Loonela told a news briefing.A fleet of about 50 fishing boats approached Jersey, which lies 14 miles off northern French shores and 85 miles from Britain's southern coast, at dawn, with some crew holding red flares aloft.At least one French trawler entered the harbour and briefly blocked the Commodore Goodwill, a cargo vessel and ferry that connects the Channel islands to the British mainland.The French presidency official said the deployment of patrol vessels spoke of France's concern and frustration, as well as a desire "for the correct application of agreements," sealed when Britain left the EU.Ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com showed one of the two French vessels, Athos, located approximately 20 km south-east of Jersey.It was at least 20 km away from the two British naval vessels, the HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which were on the south-western side of the island.Jersey government officials said they would meet representatives of the protesters to listen to their concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-britain-send-patrol-boats-to-jersey-in-post-brexit-fishing-row-101620307077657.html
06-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Setback to Biden‚Äôs vaccine push as average shots per day down 37%||President Joe Biden is running out of Americans willing to roll up their sleeves for Covid-19 shots, dragging out his bid to vanquish the pandemic and forcing the administration to refocus its vaccination strategy.Biden and his aides detailed the latest phase of his pandemic response this week as domestic demand for vaccinations dries up and inoculations slide. The U.S. is now giving an average of 2.13 million shots a day, down from 3.37 million about three weeks ago. And on Tuesday, which has the lowest shots of any day of the week, fewer than a million were given for the first time since February.In response, Biden is altering his strategy. The administration announced this week that it would concentrate more on smaller clinics and mobile sites in rural areas, while planning to wind down mass-vaccination sites.The low-hanging fruit in the U.S. vaccine campaign is gone, and the modesty of Biden‚Äôs latest goal reflects the challenge: He has pledged about another 100 million shots in the next 60 days. That‚Äôs the same pace as his first 100 million, when vaccines were at a premium, but roughly half the pace of his second 100 million.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to get more granular, I think, rather than large,‚Äù Biden said at the White House this week.He again pleaded for Americans to get shots, and cast the slowdown as long expected.‚ÄúAt the end of the day, most people will be convinced by the fact that their failure to get the vaccine may cause other people to get sick and maybe die,‚Äù he said.Vaccine Tracker: More than 1.21 Billion ShotsBiden‚Äôs challenge would be the envy of nearly every other country -- a surplus of shots and a shortage of arms. Across the U.S., 57% of adults have received at least one dose. Biden hopes to hit 70% by July.Slowing PaceA Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Thursday found that 9% of respondents in April hadn‚Äôt gotten the vaccine but still planned to as soon as possible, down from 30% a month earlier. Another 15% said they‚Äôd wait and see, while 19% said they would never get it or would do so only if required. Lack of information remains a hurdle -- 29% of respondents, and 42% of Hispanic respondents, said they‚Äôre not sure if they‚Äôre yet eligible.‚ÄúThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to reaching these different groups, and a variety of strategies will be needed,‚Äù foundation Executive Vice President Mollyann Brodie said in a statement.The impact of a slowing inoculation rate remains unclear. U.S. Covid cases are falling, with the 7-day average of new cases now 12% lower than the week before. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published research Wednesday that modeled trend lines for U.S. case numbers in several scenarios. In two of them, high vaccination rates drive new cases down to nearly nothing by September, while two models with lower vaccination rates still forecast a decline, though not as sharply.‚ÄúThese modeled scenarios show that ongoing efforts to continue to increase vaccination coverage and maintain physical distancing, masking, isolation, and quarantine are warranted,‚Äù the authors wrote.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the study offers both hope and a warning.‚ÄúThe results remind us that we have the path out of this,‚Äù she said at a briefing Wednesday. But spreading variants of the virus could keep the pandemic simmering for months to come if vaccinations lag, she said.‚ÄúWe need to keep vaccinating people, but we all need to keep practicing certain prevention interventions to help us get to the predicted good outcomes,‚Äù she said.Biden‚Äôs team, meanwhile, has backed away from predicting a threshold for so-called herd immunity, when enough of the population is vaccinated to prevent the virus‚Äôs spread. Biden‚Äôs medical advisers have said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a probably a phrase that doesn‚Äôt really apply here to this particular virus in this circumstance,‚Äù White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told CNN this week.Some experts downplay the vaccination slowdown, pointing to Israel, which saw a sharp decline in cases when roughly 40% of its population was fully vaccinated. As of now, 45% of people in the U.S. -- including kids, who aren‚Äôt eligible for shots -- have one dose and 32% are fully vaccinated.Some level of decline was inevitable. ‚ÄúWhile I want to have as high a vaccination rate as possible, I‚Äôm not worried about it,‚Äù said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The point of vaccinations was to reduce Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and high uptake of shots among more vulnerable people has already begun to do that, he said.‚ÄúWe knew that, when we went into the general population, there was going to be less of a motivation for vaccination, and we would hit a wall, but we‚Äôre still seeing the benefits of the vaccine,‚Äù he said.Biden‚Äôs team has downplayed the slowing pace of shots, saying it was always expected as the number of vaccinated people increased. They draw a distinction between the holdouts -- some are skeptics, while others are willing to get the shot but simply won‚Äôt seek it out. Polls show the the number of people who say they won‚Äôt get the shot has been falling.The White House has worked for months ‚Äúto get prepared to make sure that vaccines find people if people aren‚Äôt going out of the way to find them, to make it easy, and to make sure that people‚Äôs questions get answered,‚Äù adviser Andy Slavitt said Wednesday.Text for ShotsThe administration‚Äôs new phase includes three pillars. One is making vaccines easier to find.The government has created a text-message tool and websites to find appointments, and has ordered pharmacies to make more walk-in appointments available.The administration also will begin shipping more vaccine to rural health clinics and mobile sites, in part to focus on the roughly 10% of Americans who live more than 5 miles from a vaccine site.Biden is also working with businesses to set up incentives for people to get a shot. For example, his team on Wednesday touted discounts offered at Albertsons Cos. Inc. Safeway stores, CVS Health Corp. stores and Target Corp. for people who get vaccinated.Secondly, Biden‚Äôs team is trying to persuade reticent Americans to get shots, urging them to talk to their doctors, pharmacists, faith leaders or vaccinated neighbors.‚ÄúNearly 85% of seniors have had at least one vaccination shot, and the wide cross-section of the nation trust the vaccine regardless of race or ideology,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúNow we need to make that same progress for those under 65 years of age.‚ÄùBiden appealed to younger people to get the shot. ‚ÄúEven if your chance of getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk when you have a safe, free, and convenient way to prevent it?‚ÄùFinally, Biden is preparing a push for vaccinating adolescents. Pfizer Inc.‚Äôs shot may soon be authorized for children age 12 to 15 -- potentially opening eligibility to millions who can‚Äôt get a shot now.If authorized, the administration will move quickly to distribute shots through existing channels, including about 20,000 pharmacies, as well as through pediatricians‚Äô offices. Biden will push to get as many teenagers as possible their first shot by July, to ensure they‚Äôre fully vaccinated in time for school in the fall.(Updates with KFF poll in ninth and tenth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com¬©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-setback-to-biden-s-vaccine-push-as-average-shots-per-day-down-37-101620306416144.html

Here‚Äôs why||The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on Wednesday warned about the worrying surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Nepal. The Himalayan nation, which shares an extensive border with India, is reporting around 230 daily confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, a similar number India was reporting two weeks ago."What is happening in India right now is a horrifying preview of Nepal‚Äôs future if we cannot contain this latest Covid surge that is claiming more lives by the minute," Dr Netra Prasad Timsina, chair of the Nepal Red Cross, said in a statement.Across Nepal, 44% of Covid-19 tests returned positive results last weekend, according to government authorities quoted by IFRC. The global humanitarian network highlighted that many hospitals in Nepal, especially southern towns near Indian borders, are full and overflowing with Covid-19 patients. It further warned about the ‚Äúgrave fears of mass deaths‚Äù if the coronavirus continues spreading unchecked across the country.According to IFRC, Nepal is recording 57 times more cases than this time last month when the country was reporting less than five daily cases per million people. On Wednesday, Nepal registered over 8,600 new cases of Covid-19, the highest since the start of the pandemic.‚ÄúIt is beyond distressing to see that people cannot say goodbye to their loved ones as cremations are taking place at record levels due to these new Covid variants, which are striking down people of all ages in Nepal,‚Äù Dr Timsina stated.Also Read | It‚Äôs not just India. New virus waves hit developing nationsThe humanitarian aid organisation noted that other neighbours of India like Bangladesh and Pakistan have also been severely impacted by another wave driven by new variants. Alexander Matheou, Asia Pacific director for the IFRC, stressed that though all eyes are currently on India, other countries across South Asia may be facing the same in the coming weeks.‚ÄúWe need to act now and we need to act fast to have any hope of containing this human catastrophe. This virus has no respect for borders and these variants are running rampant across Asia,‚Äù said Matheou.Nepal has fewer doctors per capita than India, as per the global health observatory of the World Health Organization (WHO), and also has a lower vaccination rate than its neighbour. As of April 28, only about 7% of the Nepali population had been administered with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has urged foreign donors to supply vaccines and critical care medicines to prevent a collapse of the country's health infrastructure. Dr Samir Adhikari, a spokesperson for Nepal's ministry of health and population, on Monday said that the situation in the country is worsening every day and ‚Äúmay go out of control in future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-19-situation-horrifying-preview-of-nepal-s-future-here-s-why-101620304849520.html
06-05-2021||World||Russia authorises single-dose Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine for use||Russia has authorised the one-shot Sputnik Light version of its Covid-19 vaccine for use, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Thursday, a move that could help vaccine supplies go further in countries with high infection rates.Developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, the slimmed-down vaccine, which the RDIF said is 79.4% effective against Covid-19 and costs under $10 a dose, has been earmarked for export and could increase the number of people with partial immunity.One of its main potential uses is as a vaccine that can be shipped to a country in the grip of an acute outbreak which needs to be subdued quickly."The single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine demonstrated 79.4% efficacy according to analysed data taken from 28 days after the injection was administered as part of Russia's mass vaccination programme between 5 December 2020 and 15 April 2021," the RDIF said in a statement.A Phase III clinical trial involving 7,000 people was under way in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Ghana and other countries, the RDIF said. Interim results are expected later this month.According to authorities, around 8 million Russians have so far been fully inoculated with the flagship two-dose Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race in a nod to the project's geopolitical importance for Moscow.Russian scientists last month said Sputnik V was 97.6% effective against Covid-19 in a "real-world" assessment based on data from 3.8 million people.The slower pace of vaccination in Russia compared to other countries with domestically produced vaccines has provoked questions over its export intentions from some European officials. The European Medicines Agency has not yet approved the shot and Austria on Tuesday said it would only buy Sputnik V after EMA approval."The single-dose regimen solves the challenge of immunizing large groups in a shorter time, which is especially important during the acute phase of the spread of coronavirus, achieving herd immunity faster," said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev.He added that the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine would remain the main source of vaccination in Russia, which has already authorised two other vaccines for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-authorises-single-dose-sputnik-light-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-101620304211510.html

And, Beijing was furious last year when Australia was among the first countries to call for an independent investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, which started from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.CHINA CONDEMNS G7 STATEMENTChina condemned on Thursday a joint statement by G7 foreign ministers, which expressed support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan, saying it was a gross interference in China‚Äôs internal affairs.In a rare step, the G7 statement also said they supported Taiwan‚Äôs participation in World Health Organisation forums and the World Health Assembly - and expressed concern about ‚Äúany unilateral actions that could escalate tensions‚Äù in the Taiwan Strait.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang said the statement made ‚Äúgroundless accusations‚Äù which were a gross interference in China‚Äôs internal affairs, which it firmly condemned.The G7 as a group should take concrete action to boost the global economic recovery instead of disrupting it, he added.The G7 statement was welcomed in Taiwan where the government said this was the first time foreign ministers had mentioned the island in their joint communique.The G7 is an intergovernmental organisation consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-economic-dialogue-mechanism-with-australia-101620299692034.html

But some European governments are more cautious about dealing with the government of an important export market.Beijing rejects complaints that it mistreats minorities and says camps in Xinjiang are for job training to promote economic development and combat radicalism among the western region‚Äôs predominantly Muslim population.China also was irked that G-7 governments for the first time unanimously recommended Taiwan be allowed ‚Äúmeaningful participation‚Äù in the WHO. Wednesday's statement cited Taiwan's success in controlling the coronavirus.The communist Beijing government says Taiwan, which split with the mainland in 1949 after a civil war, has no right to conduct foreign relations or participate in global bodies as a sovereign government.‚ÄúTaiwan‚Äôs participation in international organizations, including the activities of the World Health Organization, which is composed of sovereign states, must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle,‚Äù Wang said.G-7 governments should be working on improving access to coronavirus vaccines for developing countries instead of ‚Äúmaking accusations and interfering with other countries in a condescending way,‚Äù Wang said.‚ÄúAttempts to disregard the basic norms of international relations and to create various excuses to interfere in China‚Äôs internal affairs, undermine China‚Äôs sovereignty and smear China‚Äôs image will never succeed,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strongly-condemn-china-rejects-g-7-criticism-on-human-rights-economic-record-101620297613982.html

"I didn't really want to name him Glenn."Instead she asked Dr. Glenn, who gave his adopted children Hawaiian middle names, for a suggestion. He offered ‚ÄúKaimana,‚Äù which is now one of the boy‚Äôs middle names.The child will have to stay in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit he is full term, about another 10 weeks, Mounga said.‚ÄúThe aloha spirit is definitely felt here,‚Äù she said about the care she has received in Hawaii.‚ÄúIt's very different from the mainland," Mounga said. ‚ÄúIt just feels comforting, and everyone is willing to help.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mom-who-gave-birth-on-flight-didn-t-know-she-was-pregnant-101620294740537.html
06-05-2021||World||China suspends economic dialogue with Australia, relations plunge to new lows||China on Thursday suspended an economic dialogue with Australia, stepping up a pressure campaign that began over Australian support for a probe of the coronavirus and has disrupted exports to the country's biggest foreign market.Relations have plunged to a multi-decade low since Beijing blocked imports of Australian coal, wheat and other goods over the past year. But it has failed to force Prime Minister Scott Morrison‚Äôs government to offer concessions.The suspension follows Australia‚Äôs decision last month, citing ‚Äúnational interest,‚Äù to cancel two deals signed by the state of Victoria with China‚Äôs multibillion-dollar ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù construction initiative. Beijing warned then it might respond.The step ‚Äúsignals a deterioration‚Äù in official ties but is largely symbolic, said Caitlin Byrne, a specialist on Australia‚Äôs diplomatic relations in the Asia-Pacific region. She said officials haven‚Äôt met under the dialogue since 2017.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly an important and symbolic move, but in terms of substance, the impact here is limited,‚Äù said Byrne, director of the Griffith Asia Institute at Australia's Griffith University.Beijing will ‚Äúindefinitely suspend all activities‚Äù under the China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue, said a statement by the Cabinet‚Äôs planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission.A foreign ministry spokesman gave no details for why but accused Australia of abusing ‚Äúso-called national security reasons to severely restrict and suppress economic and cultural cooperation projects.‚Äù‚ÄúWe urge the Australian side to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice" and ‚Äústop the crazy crackdown on China-Australia cooperation,‚Äù said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin.China holds annual economic dialogues with Australia, the United States and some other governments to discuss trade disputes and other issues.‚ÄúThis is unfortunate. We do need dialogue with China,‚Äù said Australian opposition leader Anthony Albanese in Sydney. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be just on their terms, though. It‚Äôs got to be on both countries‚Äô terms.‚ÄùChina's relations with Australia, India and some other neighbors are increasingly strained by the ruling Communist Party's assertiveness abroad, including claims to disputed territory and accusations Beijing tries to influence politics in Australia and other Western democracies.China blocked imports of most Australian goods last year after its government called for an investigation into the coronavirus, which emerged in central China in late 2019.Chinese ministers refuse to take calls from their Australian counterparts.Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan expressed disappointment in a statement.‚ÄúWe remain open to holding the dialogue and engaging at a ministerial level,‚Äù Tehan said.China is Australia‚Äôs No. 1 foreign market, but the sanctions impact has been limited because Chinese steel mills still buy Australian iron ore, the country‚Äôs most valuable export.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-economic-dialogue-with-australia-relations-plunge-to-new-lows-101620294841908.html
06-05-2021||World||Joe Biden ready to push case for $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan in Louisiana||President Joe Biden will push the case for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan in the reliably Republican state of Louisiana ‚Äî directly challenging GOP lawmakers who say that low taxes for corporations and the wealthy will fuel economic growth.Biden is leaning into the stagecraft of the presidency on Thursday by choosing to speak in the city of Lake Charles in front of a 70-year-old bridge that is 20 years past its designed lifespan.Even as he engages with Republicans in Washington, Biden is trying to sell their voters on the idea that higher corporate taxes can provide $115 billion for roads and bridges and hundreds of billions of dollars more to upgrade the electrical grid, make the water system safer, rebuild homes and jump-start the manufacturing of electric vehicles.A White House official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the speech ahead of delivery, said Biden would pose a basic question to voters about whether tax cuts for big companies and CEOs will make the country stronger than programs designed to bolster the middle class.Biden hinted at the theme when answering questions from reporters after a Wednesday speech at the White House that also emphasized his separate $1.8 trillion plan for education and children to be funded by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans.‚ÄúWhat's going to grow America more?‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúWhat's going to help you and your security more? The super wealthy having to pay 3.9% less tax or having an entire generation of Americans having associate degrees?‚ÄùBiden then began to whisper: ‚ÄúGuess what. It grows the economy. Benefits everybody. Hurts nobody.‚ÄùRepublican lawmakers have doubled down on low taxes as a core pillar of their ideology and partisan identity. Several GOP senators favor spending $568 billion on infrastructure over five years, a small fraction of what the Democratic president has proposed ‚Äî a sign of how difficult a deal might be.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that Republicans would rather finance infrastructure through user fees such as tolls and gasoline taxes, though he declined to specify which fees he would back.‚ÄúWe're open to doing a roughly $600 billion package, which deals with what all of us agree is infrastructure and to talk about how to pay for that in any way other than reopening the 2017 tax reform bill,‚Äù McConnell said Monday at the University of Louisville.The Biden administration is banking that its message could play in Louisiana, which last backed a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996. Louisiana has been barraged by 30 extreme weather events over the past decade that caused $50 billion worth of damage. Biden is seeking $50 billion to make infrastructure better able to withstand storms, winds and flooding.Hurricanes battered Lake Charles, a city of 78,000 residents, twice last year over the course of six weeks. Biden also plans to tour a water plant in New Orleans.His infrastructure package received support in a newspaper editorial last week by Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter, a Republican, and Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins, a Democrat.‚ÄúThe unfortunate truth is that our aging infrastructure and local government budgets cannot withstand the strain of increasingly frequent storms,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúAs mayors of great American cities in the South, we lie awake at night dreading each forecasted storm.‚ÄùThere is general agreement among Democrats and Republicans in Washington about the need for infrastructure spending. But there are two significant hurdles for Biden's proposal to garner Republican backing.First, Republican lawmakers would prefer a narrower definition of infrastructure that is concentrated on roads, bridges, airports, transit and broadband rather than renewable energy and access to caregivers. Second, they object to Biden's proposal to pay for his plan by undoing the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump. Biden is seeking to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-ready-to-push-case-for-2-3-trillion-infrastructure-plan-in-louisiana-101620293897602.html

They were enforcing a ban on travel by air, land, sea, and rail announced in April which is due to be in place between May 6-17.Millions of people in the world‚Äôs largest Muslim-majority nation traditionally ‚Äúmudik‚Äù or return home to visit their families for the celebrations.But senior health officials have expressed concern about the emergence of new and more virulent coronavirus mutations across Indonesia, including two cases this week of the B.1.617 variant, which was first identified in India late last year and is ravaging the country.Indonesia has seen the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Southeast Asia.Despite the risks, some people still tried to dodge the rules early on Thursday, with police saying on Twitter that several individuals had tried to leave the capital city by hiding out on the back of a vegetable truck."I will still try to return home because this has become a tradition even though we have not gone home for two years already," said 44-year old Basuki Riyanto, who was contemplating how to get to Central Java province on Thursday."I will try to go ahead regardless of the conditions if there is a closure."Indonesia has reported a total of 1,691,658 confirmed coronavirus cases and 46,349 Covid-19 deaths.Earlier this week, the country's health minister said the first two cases of the Indian variant had been identified in Jakarta. Some 13 cases of the B.117 variant first detected in the United Kingdom were previously discovered in the country.The risk of a spike in Covid-19 infections is weighing on Indonesia's economic outlook this year. Household consumption, the biggest component in the country's gross domestic product (GDP), shrank in the first quarter of 2021.Southeast Asia's biggest economy slumped 0.74% year-on-year in the January-March period, contracting for a fourth consecutive quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-begins-its-eid-al-fitr-travel-ban-as-some-try-to-skirt-rules-101620292108469.html

Most of the cases reported on Wednesday were in the crowded capital Male.Restrictions have been placed on movement between islands, although there are no curbs on tourists headed to private island resorts if they can produce a negative Covid-19 test. The health agency also ordered mandatory physical distancing in mosques."The numbers are very high. If we are not able to significantly lower these numbers, we are going to face very difficult days. So we have to get ready," said Mabrook Azeez, the spokesman for the President's Office.There were large gatherings during the council elections held on April 10, and mass groupings have only increased during Ramadan, with communal prayers being held without any physical distancing in the capital Male.Australian cricketers and staff involved in the Indian Premier League are headed to the Maldives after the tournament's abrupt suspension over the coronavirus crisis in India. They will quarantine there before heading home.Vaccination queues in the Maldives have also lengthened during Ramadan due to shortened hours, with thousands lining up without any physical distancing to get their shots.Azeez said the government is looking for foreign medical workers and local volunteers to staff the main public hospital in Male.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-imposes-night-curfew-after-steep-jump-in-covid-19-infections-101620292092524.html

Are you like this dog who can't wait to go out and play?" said the post in Chinese, which was accompanied by a video of an excited puppy trying to climb over a safety gate.The post drew an angry backlash from some Weibo users, however, who felt the comparison was inappropriate, and was later deleted."Is this American humour? I believe they did it on purpose!" one user wrote."Dogs in American culture basically have positive meanings, but in Chinese culture and idioms, they are mostly negative," wrote another user. Others quipped that the students' "master" was now calling them back to the United States.The Global Times, an English-language tabloid run by the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily, also cited netizens as saying that the post was "blatant racism".A U.S. embassy spokesman in Beijing issued an apology on Thursday morning to anyone who had been offended by the comments."The social media post in question was meant to be light-hearted and humorous," he said. "We took it down immediately when we saw it was not received in the spirit we intended."It is not the first time animal-related remarks have sparked a backlash in China. In 2019, a senior economist from UBS was placed on leave after comments about pigs in China were perceived by some as a racial slur. He was later reinstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-you-like-this-dog-us-embassy-social-media-post-on-student-visa-backfires-101620290660647.html

Cascade shifted about $1.8 billion of shares in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc. this week to French Gates, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.Their separation is expected to involve a wealth transfer on a scale that‚Äôs only been seen in a few other divorces, though few details have yet emerged. It could also have ramifications for one of the most important philanthropic organizations on the planet. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given away more than $50 billion to support health care, education, gender equality and efforts to combat climate change.Cascade transferred a stake worth about $120 million in Coca-Cola Femsa and a holding valued at about $386 million in Grupo Televisa to French Gates, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the filings.Gates, the 65-year-old co-founder of Microsoft Corp., is worth $144.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. French Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who‚Äôs gained international prominence co-running the foundation, and more recently for starting Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company to advance ‚Äúsocial progress‚Äù in the U.S.Bill Gates‚Äôs biggest asset is Cascade Investment, which he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. Cascade oversees a vast portfolio comprising real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies.The biggest public position is agricultural-machinery maker Deere & Co., with Cascade holding more than 10% of the stock valued at about $12 billion, followed by an $11.8 billion stake in waste-collection company Republic Services Inc., Bloomberg data show. That‚Äôs followed by Canadian National and Ecolab Inc.Most of the portfolio, overseen by money manager Michael Larson, is comprised of North American companies, but it also owns stock in Diageo Plc, the world‚Äôs largest distiller, and London-based private-jet services firm Signature Aviation Plc.The divorce comes two years after the 2019 separation announcement of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott, another billionaire tech couple in Washington State. That split led to a division in the couple‚Äôs 16% stake in Amazon.com Inc., with Bezos getting 75% of the holding and Scott 25%.The Gateses are also among the largest landowners in America and have homes including their 66,000 square-foot mansion in Medina, Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melinda-gates-gets-billions-in-shares-from-cascade-bill-gates-s-biggest-asset-101620290640573.html

They also say waiving patents would not instantly resolve the problem, with a lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity.Vaccine-making is also complicated, as evidenced by production problems of AstraZeneca, and would also require a transfer of technology, know-how, and personnel.The United States said on Wednesday it supported the waiver, although trade chief Katherine Tai cautioned that negotiations would take time.Von der Leyen said that, in the short run, the European Union called upon all vaccine-producing countries to allow exports and to avoid measures that disrupt supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-ready-to-discuss-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620290894650.html
06-05-2021||World||If India is in dire straits, then world is in dire straits, says USIBC president||If India is in dire straits, then the world is in dire straits, the head of a top business advocacy group has said, as the US corporate sector mounted an unprecedented effort to help India successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic.‚ÄúThe speed with which the Covid crisis in India has escalated and ravaged the entire country, it has created a sense of urgency in the corporate community,‚Äù Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council told PTI in an interview.She said that the US companies were probably the first to realise that things were moving in a perilous direction, as they were hearing about it from their workforce in India.As a result, they started mobilising early on. It was about two weeks ago that the American business community started mobilising their resources.A newly created Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, composed of CEOs of top 40 companies, announced an effort to provide massive immediate assistance to India including shipping 1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen concentrators.The Task Force, through its Steering Committee, is working closely with the White House, the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development to coordinate corporate donations and with the Indian Government as well.Last week, it had a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and on Wednesday morning it had a meeting with Indian officials in particular from the Niti Aayog.‚ÄúWe have mobilised an outpouring of support from the corporate community from across sectors,‚Äù she said.The companies that mobilised on the ventilator initiative range from Facebook and Amazon to Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Amway, Qualcomm, VMware, Union Pacific, McCormick and Cardinal Health.One of the driving forces has been Accenture and Microsoft, she said, adding that IBM has played a critical role in supporting this overall effort.She praised the efforts of the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum in mobilising resources towards oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators.‚ÄúWe have not seen in any prior instance this kind of an effort to create a unified coordinated structure,‚Äù Biswal said.‚ÄúWhat is unfolding in India, we recognise is not going to stay with India. This is a pandemic that has been ravaging around the world,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúIf we're seeing a new phase unfold in India, then we know that that is something that we need to prepare to address in India because the country is so critically important. It‚Äôs a humanitarian driver. It is also a driver that recognises that a global pandemic response is not possible and not effective without India playing its critically important role,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúSo, if India is in dire straits, then the world is in dire straits and we all need to band together to support India, and band together to figure out how we manage this next phase,‚Äù Biswal, who previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, said in response to a question.Describing India as the critical component to the global economy, she said the service economy in India is critical to the functioning of the financial sector, the functioning of the insurance industry and even hospital and university administration in the United States has key elements of operations in India.‚ÄúIt is also a vital part of the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the vaccine supply chain,‚Äù Biswal said, adding that they affect both India and the world.While the focus is on meeting the needs of the Indian people, they are also thinking about the needs of the global economy.‚ÄúBecause we want to make sure that one, the economic wellbeing and livelihoods of the Indian people, but also their ability to engage with, and be a fundamental part of the global economy is also protected and preserved and sustained as best as possible,‚Äù Biswal said.‚ÄúWe are bringing in so many key actors from the business community. We are also reaching out to some partners in the nonprofit community to make sure that we are sensitive to the communities and the people that are impacted by this crisis,‚Äù she said.Punit Renjen, the Deloitte CEO, told PTI that it‚Äôs India‚Äôs hour of need and as such, it is time for the world to step up its efforts and help it address the Covid-19 crisis.‚ÄúThis is India's hour of need. India helped us out when we were going through it in the Western world. And it is up to us to step up, not only for the people that call India home but for all of us,‚Äù Renjen said.‚ÄúThis is a global crisis. If the virus is in one environment, and then mutates, it will impact everybody. No one is safe unless all of us are safe. So, we have to step up. This is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do for each of us as business leaders,‚Äù Renjen said.‚ÄúThis is going to be a long fight,‚Äù said Renjen, whose mother based in Rohtak has tested positive with Covid-19 and several of his family members along with a large number of the estimated 50,000 Deloitte employees in India.To address the current situation, he said, Deloitte is encouraging its 300,000 professionals across the globe to give to three charities: GiveIndia, United Way India and the PM Cares Fund.Deloitte as part of the global business Task Force is focused on getting immediate aid to India. The first set of 1,000 oxygen concentrators, courtesy of Deloitte was delivered over the last few days to India.‚ÄúWe have now commitments from a number of corporates, for 25,000, oxygen concentrators,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe are also focused on cryogenic containers for oxygen,‚Äù he said, adding that Deloitte is working with other companies to get other essential medical supplies to India.‚ÄúWhat we also need to do is, we have to stop the crunch at the hospital. ‚ÄúWe are close to announcing an innovative approach to expand the medical ward to address the crush on hospitals,‚Äù he said.Other multinationals, he observed, are stepping up and are doing the same things that Deloitte is doing.Deloitte, he said, is directly supporting the US India Strategic Partnership Forum in their work with the government of India.It is providing pro-bono services to help the USISPF.Responding to a question, Renjen said he is very impressed with the assistance the Biden administration has provided to India.‚ÄúI was very pleased to see that they were going to release the AstraZeneca shots. Further there, and they were going to release some raw materials so vaccines can be reduced. Vaccines, and getting those to India would be very important,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-india-is-in-dire-straits-then-world-is-in-dire-straits-says-usibc-president-101620280929532.html

Commercial and special flights between India and China have been banned since last year.South China‚Äôs Zhejiang province and Shanghai have also reported imported cases and asymptomatic cases from India.At least one among the 18 infected persons is an Indian national, the tabloid Global Times reported on Tuesday.‚ÄúOne asymptomatic case involved an Indian man who landed in Shanghai from Niger via Paris, and he then went to Zhejiang‚Äôs Yiwu on April 30 after quarantine, and tested positive on Saturday,‚Äù the Global Times report said.The Covid-19 strain prevalent in India has been detected in ‚Äúsome cities in my country, and everyone is very concerned,‚Äù Wu Zunyou, the CDC‚Äôs chief epidemiologist, had said last Thursday.Wu did not specify in which cities the cases were detected.China‚Äôs national health commission (NHC) on Wednesday said the country had added seven new imported Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours.China has reported a total of 90,721 Covid-19 cases and 4,636 deaths since the start of the pandemic, with the last death recorded this January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detects-18-cases-of-double-mutant-covid-19-virus-from-india-101620275569038.html
06-05-2021||World||US backs India, South Africa‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver plan||The Biden administration on Wednesday announced the United State will support temporary waiver of intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines, accepting a key element of a joint proposal by India and South Africa at the WTO, and said it will ‚Äúactively participate‚Äù in negotiations to ‚Äúmake that happen‚Äù.The decision reversed former President Donald Trump‚Äôs opposition to the proposal in its entirety, was welcomed as ‚Äúmonumental‚Äù by WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and was a called a ‚Äúbold decision‚Äù by Doctors Without Borders (M√©decins Sans Frontier√® ‚Äî MSF).People familiar with the matters said it is a ‚Äúlimited waiver‚Äù that the US is supporting, as it covers only vaccines and not therapeutics and related technologies as proposed by India and South Africa. And given the consensus-based approach of the WTO, it will not happen overnight.‚ÄúThe administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,‚Äù US trade representative Katherine Tai said, adding, ‚ÄúWe will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) needed to make that happen.‚ÄùThe proposal will now be discussed and cleared by the general council, which is the highest decision-making body of the WTO, which will lay down conditions under which member countries will be allowed to ‚Äúviolate‚Äù the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which protects patents and copyrights. This could take weeks and months or years as it did when WTO dealt with patented drugs and HIV/AIDS, that was the last time it confronted similar policy challenges, according to people familiar with ongoing negotiations.Also Read | 412,262 fresh Covid-19 cases take India‚Äôs tally to over 21 millionThough immediately ‚Äúpleased‚Äù by the US decision, India would wait for the conclusion of the text-based negotiations for the final outcome of its proposal. , It could be the largest beneficiary of the waiver as the vaccination-producing hub of the world, currently overwhelmed by domestic demand.In the joint proposal filed in October, India and South Africa had sought a waiver of TRIPS provision ‚Äúin relation to prevention, containment or treatment of Covid-19‚Äù, covering, in other words, vaccines, diagnostic kits and technologies and therapeutics such as Remdesivir. The US support for waiver is only for vaccines.The Biden administration had been under mounting pressure from lawmakers of the ruling Democratic party and rights groups at home and a growing number of WTO member nations ‚Äî more than 100 at last count ‚Äî to reverse US opposition to the waiver proposal ordered by Donald Trump who was in office when India and South Africa had moved their joint proposal last October. The United States was joined in its opposition to the waiver by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and Switzerland, essentially developed countries that had built up sizable stockpiles of vaccines and therapeutics.‚ÄúThe administration‚Äôs aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,‚Äù Tai said. ‚ÄúAs our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the administration will continue to ramp up its efforts ‚Äì working with the private sector and all possible partners ‚Äì to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.‚Äù.India and South Africa moved the proposal before the WTO last October calling for temporary waiver of the agreement on TRIPS, to protect patents and copyrights, with the goal of ensuring easy and affordable access globally, and specially to developing countries, to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies till the pandemic had been crushed.Also Read | How different will Covid‚Äôs 3rd wave be from first two? What government saysThe proposal secured the support of the majority of the members of the WTO but ran up against a small group of developed countries led by the United States.‚ÄúThe decision probably wasn‚Äôt made lightly,‚Äù said Atman Trivedi, an Obama administration official who was on Biden‚Äôs presidential transition team, pointing to the centrality of intellectual property safeguards to the American economy. ‚ÄúBut the strong humanitarian case, as infections surge in India, throughout South Asia, Latin America, and other parts of the developing world, is compelling.‚ÄùThe second wave of Covid-19 epidemic in India did indeed insert a sense of urgency into the debate on whether or not the US should support the waiver, as the tragedy unfolding in overcrowded, ill-equipped and understaffed hospitals and overwhelmed cremation grounds was depicted in graphic details in words and visuals in US media.Rick Rossow, who holds the India chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a leading tank, welcomed the Biden administration decision but said, ‚ÄúIndia and other nations have the right to break patents anyways under Compulsory License rules.‚Äô‚ÄúBut proactively announced American support further helps repair the damage caused by the noticeable period of American inaction from mid-April,‚Äù he added.The United States announced an expansive package of assistance for India last weekend, which many observers here and in India have said was too late to stem the devastation that is unfolding there, with untold shortages of life-saving oxygen supplies, personal protective equipment and therapeutics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backs-india-south-africa-s-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-plan-101620274368820.html

The 'out of control' debris will enter the earth's atmosphere this weekend but since space debris¬†has, on previous occasions too, hit the earth's surface without posing a threat to life or safety, there is no reason to panic, according to the report.¬†Most debris burns up in the earth's atmosphere before having the chance to crash into its surface but at times, pieces of a large object may hit the earth. The most recent example of this is when last year, a large piece of uncontrolled space debris passed directly over Los Angeles and Central Park in New York City before landing in the Atlantic Ocean.Here is all you need to know about the phenomenon:- Space debris reentering the earth's atmosphere and hitting its surface is not a very common phenomena as space agencies try to avoid leaving big objects that they cannot control in orbit.- While the junk floating around in space poses little risk to life on earth, it¬†threatens the active satellites that provide services such as tracking the weather and studying the earth's climate etc.¬†- According to a statement from Defense Department spokesperson Mike Howard, the Chinese Long March 5B rocket is expected to enter earth's atmosphere around May 8, the CNN report said.¬†The US Space Command is tracking the rocket's trajectory, he said. The exact location where the debris is going to land is difficult to determine until it is a few hours away due to the speed in which it is travelling, he added.- "We expect it to reenter sometime between the eighth and 10th of May. And in that two-day period, it goes around the world 30 times. The thing is traveling at like 18,000 miles an hour. And so if you're an hour out at guessing when it comes down, you're 18,000 miles out in saying where," Howard told CNN.- According to¬†Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University, there was no need for people to take any precaution in view of the event. "The risk that there will be some damage or that it would hit someone is pretty small -- not negligible, it could happen -- but the risk that it will hit you is incredibly tiny. And so I would not lose one second of sleep over this on a personal threat basis," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-debris-to-crash-into-earth-this-weekend-101620270262563.html
06-05-2021||World||Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed over 'unlawful' Tiananmen Square vigil||Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong's sentence was extended by another 10 months by the administration after he pleaded guilty to taking part in an "unlawful" Tiananmen Square protest last year, news agencies reported on Wednesday. The charges relate to Wong participating in an "unauthorised assembly" on June 4 last year to commemorate the Chinese regime's 1989 crackdown on protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, reported news agency Reuters.In what is sometimes called the 1989 'Tiananmen Square massacre' or the 'June Fourth incident', Chinese troops armed with assault rifles and tanks fired on student-led protest demonstrations in Beijing to suppress the popular national movement. The Communist Party of China continues to forbid any discussion of the incident, but June 4 is commemorated by several 'pro-democracy' activists, including those in Hong Kong, in a vigil to remember the deaths of the protesters.The Hong Kong administration banned the vigil this time around, citing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, a first since 1990, but the district court heard that some 20,000 participants, including Joshua Wong, had still gathered on June 4, according to the South China Morning Post.Wong, 24, already in prison because of other illegal assembly convictions and among 47 activists charged under the city's sweeping national security law, was sentenced in the district court on Thursday. A 15-month sentence was reduced to 10 because of his guilty plea.Three other prominent young activists -- Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, and Jannelle Rosalynne Leung -- who also participated in the demonstrations, were sentenced to prison as well, albeit for a lesser duration than Wong's. Two other defendants, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Sunny Cheung Kwan-yang, have fled the city and are wanted by the cops, reported SCMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-jailed-over-unlawful-tiananmen-square-vigil-101620270578018.html
06-05-2021||World||UN says 155 million people faced acute hunger in 2020, may be worse this year||At least 155 million people faced acute hunger in 2020, including 133,000 who needed urgent food to prevent widespread death from starvation -- and the outlook for 2021 is equally grim or worse, a report by 16 organizations said Wednesday.The report, which focuses on 55 countries that account for 97% of humanitarian assistance, said the magnitude and severity of food crises last year worsened as a result of protracted conflicts, the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, and weather extremes that exacerbated ‚Äúpre-existing fragilities.‚ÄùThe 155 million people faced ‚Äúcrisis," ‚Äúemergency" or ‚Äúcatastrophe/famine" levels of food needs, an increase of around 20 million people from 2019, it said.According to the report, two-thirds of the people in those crisis levels were in 10 countries -- Congo, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, northern Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Haiti. The 133,000 facing starvation, death, and destitution were in Burkina Faso, South Sudan, and Yemen.‚ÄúThe number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent food, nutrition and livelihoods assistance is on the rise,‚Äù U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in the forward to the 307-page Global Report on Food Crises.‚ÄúThere is no place for famine and starvation in the 21st century,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to tackle hunger and conflict together to solve either.‚ÄùArif Husain, the World Food Program‚Äôs chief economist, said at a U.N. news conference for the release of the fifth annual report that the biggest driver of food crises is conflict, which accounted for 99 million people in 23 countries facing food crisis last year.‚ÄúUnless we start finding political solutions to conflicts,‚Äù the number of people needing humanitarian assistance will keep increasing, he said.According to the report, 40.5 million people in 17 countries faced acute food insecurity last year because of ‚Äúeconomic shocks‚Äù including the fallout from the pandemic.First and foremost, Husain pointed to declining incomes as a result of the 255 million jobs lost in the pandemic ‚Äî ‚Äúfour times more than the financial crisis‚Äù in 2008. He also expressed concern that the amount of debt taken on by countries large and small to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus ‚Äúhas exploded.‚ÄùDominique Burgeon, director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization‚Äôs office in Geneva, said 60% to 80% of the 155 million people facing acute food insecurity depend on agriculture, but last year FAO was able to assist only about 30%.The report presented some other grim statistics from 2020: 75.2 million children under 5 years old living in the 55 countries were ‚Äústunted‚Äù in their growth and 15.8 million were ‚Äúwasted,‚Äù or underweight for their height.In terms of the prevalence of people facing a crisis, emergency, or famine levels of food needs, the report said Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Syria had more than half their analyzed populations at the crisis level or worse, and five countries -- Afghanistan, Haiti, Lesotho, Yemen, and Zimbabwe -- had between 40% and 45% of their populations at those levels.Looking to 2021, the report said, ‚Äúfood crises are becoming increasingly protracted and the ability to recover from new adverse events is becoming more difficult.‚Äù‚ÄúConflict, the Covid-19 pandemic, and large-scale economic crises are expected to extend food-crisis situations in 2021, necessitating continuing large-scale humanitarian assistance,‚Äù it said.The report made forecasts based on 40 of the 55 countries, saying those for the other 15 countries weren't available.It said over 142 million people in those 40 countries are forecast to face food crises, emergencies, or catastrophes this year. Around 155,000 people are likely to face ‚Äúcatastrophe/famine" through mid-2021 ‚Äî around 108,000 in South Sudan and 47,000 in Yemen, the report said.WFP‚Äôs Husain said, for example, that providing one single meal per day for a year for 34 million people would cost about $5 billion, saying that the most critical needs are funding and humanitarian access.‚ÄúWithout that, we won‚Äôt be able to save lives,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-155-million-people-faced-acute-hunger-in-2020-may-be-worse-this-year-101620268848577.html

The rocket flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) before a controlled descent, based on live video streamed by the company. The landing was marred only by a small fire at the bottom of the vehicle that was extinguished after a few minutes.Also Read: SpaceX Starship explodes during landing, FAA launches probeThe milestone achievement paves the way for more ambitious tests of a rocket that SpaceX founder Elon Musk envisions as a future workhorse for trips to the moon and Mars. NASA recently picked SpaceX to develop a moon-landing system for astronauts with Starship. The company also envisions the stainless steel behemoth as eventually being capable of reducing travel times across Earth with hypersonic, point-to-point trips.The previous Starship rocket test flight, on March 30, sent smoking debris raining down on the area after a mishap. An earlier prototype touched down at a slight incline, only to be engulfed in flames shortly after landing. Two previous efforts ended in fireballs. No people were aboard any of the spacecraft.SpaceX conceived the Starship as a versatile, fully reusable craft that can carry 100 metric tons. Excluding a booster rocket that creates a two-stage system, Starship is 160 feet high with a 30-foot diameter, able to carry as many as 100 passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-nails-the-landing-in-fifth-test-of-its-starship-rocket-101620260943906.html

The newly released students arrived at police headquarters in Kaduna city on Wednesday night looking weak, forlorn and wearing dirty, torn clothing.One female student could not walk alone and was carried into the building, while another was rushed to the hospital.Police did not allow journalists to speak to the students.More than 700 people have been abducted from schools in northwest Nigeria since December in a rash of kidnappings for ransom in the volatile region.Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has repeatedly said his state government will not negotiate with "bandits", as the criminal gangs are known, or pay ransoms.Abdullahi Usman, chairman of the parents' association, said a ransom was paid for the students' release, but refused to say who had paid or how much.Friday Sanni, father of two abducted girls, said police had not yet allowed parents to see them. As he waited, he fretted over the fate of his daughters Rejoice, 17, and Victory, 19."We pray it is all of them," he said.President Muhammadu Buhari released a statement that welcomed the release of 27 students. His office did not respond to questions regarding the discrepancy in the number.Kaduna police spokesman Mohammed Jalige said all remaining students had been released and would undergo medical examination before their release on Thursday.Samuel Aruwan, the Kaduna state commissioner for internal security, said in a statement that the government rejoiced with the freed students, and called on them to "put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead."He did not comment on whether a ransom was paid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weak-and-tattered-29-students-freed-in-nigeria-s-kaduna-101620260516146.html
06-05-2021||World||Facebook has 6 months to determine if Donald Trump returns||Facebook Inc's oversight board on Wednesday upheld the company's suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump but said the company was wrong to make the suspension indefinite and gave it six months to determine a "proportionate response."Trump called the decision and his banning across tech platforms "a total disgrace" and said the companies would "pay a political price."The much-awaited board verdict has been watched for signals on how the world's largest social media company will treat rule-breaking political leaders in the future, a key area of controversy for online platforms.Also Read: Facebook oversight board upholds Trump suspensionThe board, created by Facebook to rule on a small slice of its content decisions, said the company was right to ban Trump following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.Facebook indefinitely blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 riot. It enacted the suspension after removing two of Trump's posts during the Capitol riot, including a video in which he said supporters should go home but reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud, saying "I know your pain. I know you‚Äôre hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us."But the board said Facebook should not have imposed an indeterminate suspension without clear standards and said the company should determine a response consistent with rules applied to other users. It said Facebook could determine that Trump's account could be restored, suspended temporarily or permanently banned."Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency, and transparency," said former federal Judge Michael McConnell, co-chair of the Oversight Board, during a press conference after publishing its decision on Wednesday.In an interview with Reuters, board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said public figures should not be allowed to incite violence or create harm though their posts, but that Facebook "can't just invent new sanctions as they go along."In its decision, the board said Facebook refused to answer some of the 46 questions it posed, including those on how its news feed affected the visibility of Trump's posts, and whether the company planned to look into how its technology amplified content as it had done in the events leading to the Capitol siege.The board said Facebook's existing policies, such as deciding when material is too newsworthy to remove, need to be more clearly communicated to users. It also called on Facebook to develop a policy that governs how it handles novel situations where its existing rules would be insufficient to prevent imminent harm. See takeaways from the board's decision.Facebook's business has thrived during the controversy and its main source of revenue, advertising, has boomed as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions begin to ease in the United States, but lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns about the power of Facebook and other social media, many calling for new regulations and some calling for breakups of big tech.Trump called the move "an embarrassment to our Country," and added that "Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before."At a Financial Times conference after the verdict, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communication, said the company would hope to resolve the matter "considerably faster" than six months.Tech platforms have grappled in recent years with how to police world leaders and politicians that violate their guidelines. Facebook has come under fire both from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech and those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.Facebook was one of a slew of social media sites that barred the former president, including Twitter Inc, which banned him permanently, a move welcomed by some civil rights groups and social media researchers. Political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders expressed concern that private companies could silence elected officials on their sites.At the time of the suspension, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said "the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great." The company later referred the case to its recently established board, which includes academics, lawyers and rights activists.The binding verdict means Trump will not for now be able to return to Facebook's platforms, where he had a combined 59 million followers across Facebook and Instagram. His campaign spent about $160 million on Facebook ads in 2020, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive's campaign tracker.On Tuesday, Trump launched a web page to share messages that readers can then re-post to their Facebook or Twitter accounts. A senior adviser has said Trump also plans to launch his own social media platform.Wednesday's decision marks a milestone for the oversight board, which Facebook financed with $130 million. The body has been hailed as a novel experiment by some researchers but criticized by those who have been skeptical about its independence or view it as a PR stunt to deflect attention from the company's more systemic problems."This verdict is a desperate attempt to have it both ways, upholding the 'ban' of Donald Trump without actually banning him, while punting any real decisions back to Facebook," said a group of academics, experts and Facebook critics known as the "Real Facebook Oversight Board."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-has-6-months-to-determine-if-trump-returns-101620260207948.html

The idea has gained support among some progressive lawmakers in the West.More than 100 countries have come out in support of the proposal, and a group of 110 members of Congress ‚Äî all fellow Democrats of Biden ‚Äî sent him a letter last month that called on him to support the waiver.Opponents ‚Äî especially from industry ‚Äî say a waiver would be no panacea. They insist that production of coronavirus vaccines is complex and can‚Äôt be ramped up by easing intellectual property. They also say lifting protections could hurt future innovation.Stephen Ubl, president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the U.S. decision ‚Äúwill sow confusion between public and private partners, further weaken already strained supply chains and foster the proliferation of counterfeit vaccines.‚ÄùDr. Michelle McMurry-Heath, chief executive of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization trade group, said in a statement that the decision will undermine incentives to develop vaccines and treatments for future pandemics.‚ÄúHanding needy countries a recipe book without the ingredients, safeguards, and sizable workforce needed will not help people waiting for the vaccine," she said.Pfizer declined to comment on Biden‚Äôs announcement, as did Johnson & Johnson, which developed a one-dose vaccine meant to ease vaccination campaigns in poor and rural areas. Moderna and AstraZeneca didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.The companies have made some efforts to provide vaccine doses to poor countries at prices well below what they‚Äôre charging wealthy nations.For instance, Johnson & Johnson agreed last week to provide up to 220 million doses of its vaccine to the African Union‚Äôs 55 member states, starting in this year‚Äôs third quarter, and agreed in December to provide up to 500 million vaccines through 2022 for low-income countries via Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.Shares of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson ‚Äî huge companies with many lucrative products ‚Äî fell less than 1% on the news. But Moderna, whose vaccine is the company‚Äôs only product, fell 6.2% in late-afternoon trading before gaining back two-thirds of a percent in after-hours trading.It remained unclear how some countries in Europe, which have influential pharmaceutical industries and had previously shared U.S. reservations about the waiver, would respond.WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said a panel on intellectual property at the trade body was expected to take up the waiver proposal again at a ‚Äútentative‚Äù meeting later this month, before a formal meeting June 8-9. That means any final deal could be weeks away at best.Authors of the proposal have been revising it in hopes of making it more palatable.Okonjo-Iweala, in remarks posted on the WTO website, said it was ‚Äúincumbent on us to move quickly to put the revised text on the table, but also to begin and undertake text-based negotiations.‚Äù‚ÄúI am firmly convinced that once we can sit down with an actual text in front of us, we shall find a pragmatic way forward‚Äù that is ‚Äúacceptable to all sides,‚Äù she said.Co-sponsors of the idea were shuttling between different diplomatic missions to make their case, according to a Geneva trade official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. A deadlock persists, and opposing sides remain far apart, the official said.The argument, part of a long-running debate about intellectual property protections, centers on lifting patents, copyrights and protections for industrial design and confidential information to help expand the production and deployment of vaccines during supply shortages. The aim is to suspend the rules for several years, just long enough to beat down the pandemic.The issue has become more pressing with a surge in cases in India, the world‚Äôs second-most populous country and a key producer of vaccines ‚Äî including one for COVID-19 that relies on technology from Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca.Michael Yee, a Jefferies Group biotech analyst, wrote to investors that the key access issues for developing countries aren‚Äôt patents or price, but an inadequate supply of the materials needed and the know-how to produce the vaccines and keep quality high ‚Äî which one of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs contract manufacturers in the U.S. failed to do, ruining millions of doses.‚ÄúManufacturing supplies, raw materials, vials, stoppers, and other key materials are in limited supply for 2021,‚Äù and may still be next year and beyond, Yee wrote. That‚Äôs partly because it takes time to make all those components, and Moderna and Pfizer have commitments to buy them ‚Äúfrom major suppliers in huge bulk over the foreseeable future.‚ÄùHe added that Pfizer previously sought authorization to sell its vaccine to India, which rejected its application and asked that additional studies be run. The U.S., European Union and many other countries have given that emergency authorization.Proponents, including WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, note that such waivers are part of the WTO toolbox and insist there‚Äôs no better time to use them than during the once-in-a-century pandemic that has taken 3.2 million lives, infected more than 437 million people and devastated economies, according to Johns Hopkins University.‚ÄúThis is a monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19," Tedros said in Wednesday statement. He said the U.S. commitment "to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of American leadership to address global health challenges.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backs-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-plan-proposed-by-india-south-africa-101620259025472.html
06-05-2021||World||US announces support for Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver||US President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday announced its support for a global waiver on patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines, and will negotiate the terms at the WTO.While intellectual property rights for businesses are important, Washington "supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines," US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement."This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures," she added.Biden had been under intense pressure from world leaders to agree to waive protections for vaccine manufacturers in order to ramp up production and get the jabs out to more countries as rich nations have swept up the majority of the doses.Tai said the United States will participate in the negotiations within the World Trade Organization but cautioned that discussions "will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved."The global trade body has for months been facing calls led by India and South Africa to temporarily remove the intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines, in a move proponents say would help boost production in developing countries that so far have received far fewer jabs.But that notion has until now met fierce opposition from pharmaceutical giants and their host countries, which insist the patents are not the main roadblocks to scaling up production, and warn the move could hamper innovation.WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been pressing for an international agreement to provide at least a temporary patent waiver."We need to have a sense of urgency on how we approach this issue of response to Covid-19 because the world is watching," she said earlier Wednesday, describing equitable access to the tools to fight the pandemic as the "moral and economic issue of our time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-support-for-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620243476047.html

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared to backtrack from the move, saying it was highly unlikely violators would be jailed.Michael Bradley and Chris Ward lodged the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon. The application firstly said that the Commonwealth was acting outside its powers and secondly that the health minister Greg Hunt‚Äôs declaration was in breach of an implied freedom to return home, ABC news reported. Some critics have accused the government of racism because such drastic travel restrictions were not introduced when infection rates were rapidly increasing in the US and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stranded-australian-man-in-india-challenges-country-s-travel-ban-101620241503787.html
