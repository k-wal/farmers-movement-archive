He dismissed the European Union’s reaction -- including a recommendation to airlines to stop flying over Belarus and plans for new sanctions on the country -- as “based on emotions.”Russia will look for ways to expand air service with Belarus to make up for some of the routes affected by the EU’s limits on Minsk’s state airline, Peskov said.The $500 million -- to be released in the near future -- is part of $1.5 billion in loans that was agreed last year and had been expected by the end of next month. Lukashenko didn’t ask for further assistance, Peskov said, but the two leaders did discuss closer tax and customs cooperation.In their second day of talks, they went sailing on the Black Sea, Peskov said.The U.S. administration announced it would re-impose sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises late Friday, and is developing additional penalties to target government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-pushes-ahead-with-belarus-loan-as-tensions-grow-101622310813276.html

My administration’s revocation of Choksi’s citizenship has been frustrated by a litigation brought against the state,” Gaston Browne said according to reports in Antiguan media.“We are determined to revoke Choksi’s citizenship and to concurrently pursue his extradition to India to face criminal charges there. There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship,” Browne further added. Browne last week said that if Choksi flees the country his citizenship will be revoked. Choksi was reported missing on May 25 after he went to the southern side of the island for dining at a restaurant.The UPP earlier in the day accused Browne of ‘corrupting the rule of law’ referring to Browne’s request to the Dominican authorities to send Choksi to India directly and not repatriate him to Antigua and Barbados. “It was the Gaston Browne administration that granted citizenship to Mr. Choksi. As inconvenient and embarrassing as it may be for the government, Mr. Choksi is a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda – not India,” the UPP said according to a report by news agency Antigua News Room.Choksi, who is currently in Dominica, claimed that he was abducted and taken to the island by force. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court said that it will hear a habeas corpus petition filed by Choksi’s lawyers Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal last week denting India’s hopes of extraditing Choksi, who is wanted in a ₹13,500 crore loan fraud case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-row-lights-up-a-political-firestorm-in-antigua-pm-browne-hits-back-101622310686498.html

But the attention was mostly on the concert-goers.The Paris public hospital authority helped organize the event to determine whether it’s safe to allow 5,000 masked people to dance together in the open pit of an indoor concert arena without social distancing.The attendees are seeing the show for free but were required to take three virus tests, two before and one after the concert. To further reduce risk, organizers only allowed people 18-45 years old without underlying health conditions to participate, according to the hospital authority.France has not allowed such music concerts since early 2020. Cultural venues were shut for most of the past 14 months as authorities tried to contain persistent surges of virus infections that filled hospitals and were linked to more than 109,000 deaths.France’s Covid-19 hospitalization rates and confirmed cases have steadily shrank in recent weeks as vaccinations increase.Similar test concerts have been held in other European countries recently, including Spain, the Netherlands and Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dancing-like-there-s-no-covid-19-paris-hosts-test-concert-101622309638281.html

The container yard of the port has been partly shut since last week after an outbreak of Covid-19 among port staff and in the broader community, state media reported.The disruptions will continue into the coming week, with shipping firm AP Moller-Maersk A/S reporting delays in its schedules due to the closure. Any delays will likely put further pressure on the already sky-high costs of shipping goods from China, which have soared on record export demand, a shortage of containers, and other factors.Those shipping costs are just one of the factors boosting the price of China’s exports, which is threatening to fuel global inflation.Yantian is one of the busiest ports in the world, with a cargo throughput of 13.34 million twenty-foot equivalent unit in 2020, a standard measurement used in freight industry, according to figures from the Shenzhen Transportation Bureau. It serves about 100 ships a week, according to a report on a Shenzhen government website.The local government said in a notice Friday it will conduct mass testing of the entire population of the Yantian district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-outbreak-partly-closes-one-of-china-s-busiest-ports-101622304319906.html
29-05-2021||World||Americans will hit the road with highest fuel price since 2014||Americans will hit the road this holiday weekend with the highest gasoline prices in seven years and the White House promising to monitor fuel costs.The national average price at the pump hit $3.045 per gallon this month, the highest since 2014, and was just a 10th of a cent below that on Friday, according to data from auto club AAA.“The President knows that gas prices are a pain point for Americans,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Friday. “President Biden is opposed to any proposals to raise the gas tax. And it’s why we will continue to monitor prices, and are glad that Americans can get on the road again.”Gasoline demand is roaring back close to levels seen before the pandemic as the world’s largest economy opens up and avid drivers take to the roads after a year of lockdowns and restrictions.Summer gasoline demand may average out to normal, with some weeks above record levels at 10 million barrels per day, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. Any disruption to refinery supplies in the form of a hurricane or unexpected outage could send prices surging.“The worry is that any hiccup could be made worse by the truck driver shortage, leading to slow restorations and further price implications,” De Haan said in an email.The weekend before the Memorial Day holiday on Monday typically marks the start of the U.S. driving season.National demand for gasoline, as measured by the four-week average for supplied fuel, has jumped above 9 million barrels a day for the first time since March of last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.That’s at a time when the country’s gasoline supply is straining to recover from the week-long shutdown earlier this month of the Colonial pipeline. The nation’s largest fuel pipeline, which takes gasoline and diesel from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, was temporarily hobbled by a cyberattack, touching off regional gasoline shortages.Restoring regional supplies hasn’t been as easy as restarting the flow of fuels, in part because of a severe shortage of trucks and drivers needed to ferry gas from hubs to retailers. And refineries are operating at some of the lowest seasonal rates in almost a decade, as a result of the drop in demand during the pandemic.In her statement, Psaki said that prices are in line with where they’ve been in recent years in real terms, or when discounted for inflation.“As Americans are hitting the road, they are paying less in real terms for gas than they have on average over the last 15 years,” she said. “They’re paying about the same as they did in May 2018 and May 2019.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-will-hit-the-road-with-highest-fuel-price-since-2014-101622295235721.html
29-05-2021||World||Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claims||The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’ and was created by Chinese scientists while working on ‘gain-of-function' research in a Wuhan lab, according to a Daily Mail report citing a new study. The report claimed that the scientists took a natural coronavirus ‘backbone’ found in bats and added a new ‘spike’ which turned it into deadly and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2.British Professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr Birger Sørensen authored the new 22-page paper which is set to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, as per Daily Mail. The study reportedly claimed that the Chinese scientists also tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering the viruses to make it look like they naturally arose from bats.Quoting the authors, Daily Mail said that the duo had “prima facie evidence of retro-engineering in China” for a year but was ignored by academics and major journals. The study also accuses Chinese labs of “deliberate destruction, concealment or contamination of data.”What is gain-of-function research?Gain-of-function research alters an organism or disease in a way that increases the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens. Scientists work on gain-of-function projects to study their potential effects on humans in order to stay ahead of the curve of potential new diseases. But it also carries a risk of an outbreak if not conducted safely.Also Read | Why is Chinese state media targeting Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy?The US Senate on Tuesday passed an amendment to permanently ban the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies from funding gain-of-function research projects in China.“We don’t know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally,” Republican senator Rand Paul, who sponsored the amendment, said in a statement.The NIH had released a statement last week, saying neither the research agency nor the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) ever approved any grant to support “gain-of-function” research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans. The US agency also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to begin the second phase of their investigation without delay.“While many still deny funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan … the passage of my amendment ensures that this never happens in the future,” said Paul.The scientific community is yet to find the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and renewed demand by the United States to reinvestigate the source has angered China. In a video message to the 74th World Health Assembly (WHA), US health secretary Xavier Becerra demanded independence for international experts to fully assess the source of the virus which has claimed more than 3.5 million lives so far.Also Read | Facebook says won't remove posts claiming Covid-19 is 'man-made'The speculation around the virus origin was fuelled by top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci’s comment during a virtual event hosted by Poynter Institute. Fauci said that he was not convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally”, stressing that the world should continue to investigate “what went on in China.”US President Joe Biden on Wednesday ordered intelligence officials to “redouble” efforts to probe the origins of the pandemic, including the possibility of a Chinese laboratory link. Biden said in a statement that the majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around two scenarios but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-has-no-credible-natural-ancestor-created-in-wuhan-lab-new-study-claims-101622300739493.html
29-05-2021||World||Egypt court adjourns Suez ship case for more compensation talks||An Egypt court on Saturday adjourned a case on the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal to allow for more time to negotiate for a compensation.The court in Ismailia town postponed the hearing to June 20 after requests from lawyers representing the Suez Canal Authority and the owner of the 400-meter-long Ever Given.The authority was claiming more than more than $916 million in damages linked to the waterway’s six-day closure in March, which roiled shipping markets. But it lowered the figure in out-of-court negotiations to $550 million, saying it has miscalculated the value of the cargoes aboard of the ship. The vessel’s insurers said the demand is still too high.“There are endeavors to reach a settlement and because they are good clients, we are asking the court to postpone to negotiate and study the offer submitted by the owners,” Nabil Zidan, the lawyer for the Suez Canal Authority, said in the court.“Negotiations are on and there’s flexibility from both sides,” said Ahmed Abu Shanab, the ship owner’s lawyer.Ahead of the hearing on Sunday, Zidan said the Suez Canal Authority will recalculate its claim, without elaborating on what that means for the lawsuit or what the new figure will be.The Ever Given’s owner has previously offered to pay $150 million, according to the authority, which says that doesn’t cover losses of transit fees, damage to the waterway and costs of equipment and labor.The Ever Given is owned by Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and was freed on March 29 after a salvage operation and sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, about halfway along the canal, where it has been kept ever since.About 50 ships a day pass through the Suez canal, which can cut a voyage between Europe and Asia by two weeks. More than 400 vessels were held up by the blockage, though most were able to pass through the channel soon after it was reopened. Egypt in May started dredging to widen the southern end of the canal where the Ever Given got stuck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-court-adjourns-suez-ship-case-for-more-compensation-talks-101622293902797.html

The concentration of virus in the throat fluid increases rapidly and spreads very strongly to the surrounding environment."He did not specify the number of cases recorded with this new variant but said Vietnam will soon announce the discovery in the world's map of genetic strains.There were seven known coronavirus variants in Vietnam before Long's announcement, according to the Ministry of Health.The communist country has previously received widespread applause for its aggressive pandemic response, with mass quarantines and strict contact tracing helping keep infection rates relatively low.The new round of infections has made the public and government fearful and authorities quickly moved to place strict limits on movement and business activity.Cafes, restaurants, hair salons and massage parlours as well as tourism and religious spots have been ordered to close in various areas of the country.Vietnam -- a country of 97 million people -- has vaccinated a little over a million citizens.It is now ramping up its jab rollout and hopes to achieve herd immunity by the end of the year, according to the minister for health.Authorities have called on people and businesses to donate money to help procure vaccines, while embassies and international organisations have been contacted for assistance, state media reported.The country presently has close to two million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine remaining, but said it is buying more than 30 million doses of the Pfizer shot.It is also in talks with Russia to produce Sputnik V, according to state media, and is working on a home-grown vaccine.In nearby Thailand, the government on Saturday took exception to media reports in Britain that labelled a new strain causing concern there as the Thai variant.The strain was first detected in Thailand in a 33-year-old Egyptian traveller, UK health authorities said, but 109 cases have since been found in Britain."Principally speaking, it should not be called the Thai variant because the infected person is from overseas," said Opas Kankawinpong, head of Thailand's disease control department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-discovers-new-hybrid-virus-variant-a-combination-of-strains-from-india-uk-report-101622291526911.html

But the ease in travel restrictions excluded 20 countries where the ban on flights continued as a part of Covid-19 preventive measures.The ban, which originally came into effect on February 3, applied to all non-citizens, diplomats, health practitioners and their families who have passed through any of the prohibited countries in the 14 days prior to their application to enter Saudi Arabia.Also Read | Saudi Arabia will start issuing tourist visas again soon, official saysNow the kingdom has decided to lift the ban from 11 of them based on the Public Health Authority's report regarding the epidemiological situation which “showed stability and effectiveness in controlling the pandemic” in those countries, reported SPA.Here’s the list of countries from which Saudi Arabia will lift the ban:The travel ban will continue to remain in effect for the remaining nine countries, including India and Pakistan.Here’s the list of countries where Saudi Arabia’s travel ban will remain in effect:(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-lifts-travel-ban-from-11-countries-india-and-pakistan-excluded-here-s-the-list-101622290809096.html
29-05-2021||World||Friends: The Reunion censored in China||A laudatory article by China’s official Xinhua news agency on Friends: The Reunion has talked about the sitcom’s “unique appeal” and “massive influence” but glossed over how censors here clipped several minutes before screening the special show in China.The article quoted Chinese citizens heaping praise on the American sitcom - which has a huge following in urban China - and how it influenced their lives from helping them to learn English and giving them a peek into American culture.But, the Xinhua article left out how Chinese streaming sites had carefully censored the appearances of Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, the South Korean boy band, BTS and LGBTQ references from the version aired.It is still unclear whether Chinese government ordered the cuts or whether the streaming platforms, iQiyi, Youku and Tencent Video, themselves decided against airing what they knew would be sensitive to the government.The musicians and the censored band have fallen foul of Beijing over the years.Lady Gaga, for one, is a persona non grata in China following her meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016.Beijing accuses the Tibetan leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner of being a “dangerous separatist”.And, Bieber first came under fire in China in 2014 for photographing himself visiting Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni war shrine, a site that honours Japanese World War II war criminals alongside other casualties of war, the entertainment news website, Variety, reported.Not that the cuts went unnoticed in China.“Are we reverting to the isolationist Qing dynasty, closed off to the rest of the world?” a commenter on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform was quoted as saying by Variety.Many supported the censorship as well.The Xinhua article acknowledged the sitcom’s enduring influence in China.“The highly anticipated reunion special of the American sitcom Friends has taken its massive Chinese fan base by storm with a nostalgic and tear-jerking tribute to the all-time hit series,” the article said.It went on to report how the reunion special made it to among the top 10 trending topics on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Thursday night, with netizens saying the reunion has allowed them to “relive their youth” or simply expressing their longtime affection for the series.In China, the series was “…much more than a TV comedy from the outset”.It first gained popularity in the late 1990s as a tool for learning the English language. Then, the country’s post-1980s and post-1990s generations discovered its unique appeal as a window to learn about the American culture, the Xinhua article said.Overall, the response in China to the episode has been overwhelmingly positive, with countless fans describing how the special brought tears to their eyes, the Variety article pointed out.“This whole show brings up so many memories - I’ve watched all ten seasons more than a dozen times. I don’t have many friends, but they are really like friends of mine,” a Weibo user wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/friends-the-reunion-censored-in-china-101622288851172.html

This is the first in-country detection of the latter strain, the NIH said in a statement.As per protocols, contact tracing of all the cases is in progress by the Field Epidemiology & Disease Surveillance Division and District Health Office (DHO), Islamabad, the report said.The NIH said the continued detection of global strains highlighted the ongoing need for observation of guidelines, usage of masks and need for vaccination.After India’s outbreak of Covid-19 fuelled by the new strain earlier this year, Pakistan in April imposed a ban on travellers arriving from the neighbouring country via the air, sea and land routes, he report said.However, in May, the variant was detected in Thai travellers who had visited Pakistan, the report said.Health authorities in Thailand had confirmed the country’s first cases of the variant first identified in India in a Thai woman and her 4-year-old son who were reportedly put in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan, it said.The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier said that the B.1.617 strain of coronavirus was found in dozens of countries all over the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-case-of-b-1-617-covid-19-variant-found-in-pakistan-101622284893922.html

Jeremy Corbell on Thursday posted a 46-second clip on Twitter, saying the event was captured in June 2019 by the Combat Information Centre of the USS Omaha, an Independence-class littoral combat ship, off the coast of San Diego.The clip shows a radar screen in which several objects can be seen moving around the ship. "Holy sh*t! They're moving fast...They're turning around," an unidentified man is heard saying. Corbell, the filmmaker behind the documentary 'Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers', said that the footage is “corroborative electro-optic data demonstrating a significant UFO event series.”2019 US Navy warships were swarmed by UFOs; here's the RADAR footage that shows that.

The former president acknowledged that there’s evidence on mysterious objects with inexplicable behaviour that "we can't explain." "They did not have an easily explainable pattern, and so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is," Obama said. "I have nothing to report to you today," he added.Also Read | ‘Hate to say this’: Pilot reported UFO sighting, FBI ‘aware’ of incidentThe theories around UFOs have become mainstream in recent times, especially after the US Navy released seven incident reports last year, revealing more details about the series of encounters between Navy pilots and ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’. In December 2020, a unique 180-day countdown for US intelligence started when President Donald Trump signed a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government spending bill into law.The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 was a part of the spending bill under which the Senate intelligence committee directed the intelligence agencies to submit a report on “unidentified aerial phenomena” within 180 days. The committee has directed the federal agencies to identify potential national security threats posed by UFOs and to assess the possibility of an adversary nation behind such activities.The intelligence report on UFOs is expected in June as former federal officials have hinted that the unclassified report will include unexplainable events.“Ultimately when you have exhausted all those what-ifs and you're still left with the fact that this is in our airspace and it's real, that's when it becomes compelling, and that's when it becomes problematic," Luis Elizondo, former director of the defense department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, told "60 Minutes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/documentary-filmmaker-releases-video-of-swarm-of-ufos-over-us-navy-ship-101622284366215.html

Three heavily armed militants had carried out the attack on the Chinese consulate located in Clifton on November 23, 2018.Four people, including security personnel and visa seekers, were killed in the attack. The attackers, later identified as Abdul Razzaq, Raees Baloch and Azal Baloch, were also killed in their fight with police. A large number of weapons, ammunition and explosives were found on them.The accused - Ahmed Hasnain, Muhammad Aslam, Nadir Khan, Ali Ahmed and Abdul Latif - were arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department for allegedly facilitating the attack. According to the IO, Latif and Aslam had confessed to the crime before a judicial magistrate a week after their arrest.Besides the indicted suspects, the police had also booked BLA chief Hyrbyair Marri and other leaders Kareem Marri, Bashir Zaib, Aslam Baloch, Noor Bakhsh Mengal, Rehman Gul, Nisar, Gaindi, Sheikhu Sharif, Hamal, Agha Sher Dil and Munshi. All of them have been declared proclaimed offenders in the case.Issuing perpetual warrants of arrest for the absconders, the ATC earlier ordered police to approach Interpol for the arrest of Hyrbyair who is living in exile and who allegedly masterminded the attack from a foreign country.The charge sheet said the terrorists stormed the consulate building and started firing and throwing hand grenades, which killed assistant sub-inspector Ashraf Dawood and police constable Muhammad Amir who were performing security duty at the first checkpost. A visa seeker, Tahir Shah, and his father, Niaz Ahmed, were also killed by the attackers, it reported further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fails-to-prove-alleged-india-role-in-china-consulate-attack-101622278564795.html

Several videos posted on social media showed carpets of mice scurrying across barn floors, crowded around machinery, and entering thick grain silos made of steel as farmers struggled to control the rodents.The mice have also entered homes, inside containers and finding their way into water tanks, footage posted by local media channels showed. According to the local reports, they also bit farmers and patients in the hospital while they were asleep.WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT – Farmers are struggling as the biggest plague of mice in decades continues to sweep across Australia’s New South Wales https://t.co/LTDpEKnIoy pic.twitter.com/PFf2eqaLTPMeanwhile at Chuck E. Cheese...🐁🧀https://t.co/r0ZWlGubyyFarmers' nightmareThe crisis has prompted the New South Wales government to order 5000 litres of the banned poison Bromadiolone from India. "It’s actually the strongest mouse poison we can get anywhere on the face of the earth that actually will kill these things within 24 hours," said Adam Marshall, the state’s agriculture minister.The state government has also released $50 million ($39 million) in funding to tackle the infestation, which is gradually spreading to Queensland state. However, the order is yet to receive approval from the federal government over concerns that the potent pesticide may also kill other animals and family pets.According to an AP report, the infestation is contaminating sorghum exports with animal droppings, causing quality downgrades and leading to cancelled shipments of the grain. The mice woes come as farmers in Australia's most populous state have already been hit by fires, floods and pandemic disruptions in recent years.Despite, government's intensive baiting programmes, it had little to no success against the infestation. Locals are hoping for heavy rain to drown the mice in their burrows.Plagues seemingly appear from nowhere and often vanish just as fast. Disease and a shortage of food are thought to trigger a dramatic population crash as mice feed on themselves, devouring the sick, weak and their own offspring.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mice-plague-hits-australia-farmers-pin-hope-on-banned-poison-from-india-101622278175412.html

Hong Kong Alliance can no longer organise the candlelight vigil this year in a lawful manner. We will stop promoting the vigil, said Richard Tsoi of the alliance to the press.“On that day, we won’t, as an organisation and members of Hong Kong Alliance, appear and join.”Tsoi said he believed Hong Kong people would still commemorate the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in a peaceful manner.Samuel Chu, who runs the Hong Kong Democracy Council in Washington, retweeted an image of Tsoi making his statement, writing, “We will light a candle for you and all of Hong Kong".Hong Kong's Security Bureau issued a statement warning people not to take part in illegal assemblies or violate the national security law imposed on the territory by Beijing.Liauw Ka-kei, senior superintendent of the Hong Kong Island Region, told a news conference that the police welcomed the appeal board decision, also urging the public not to participate in or publicise any unauthorised assembly.“Police have reasonable grounds to believe that the activities not only include the risk of infecting Covid-19 by participants and other people but also pose a serious threat to the life and health of all citizens, jeopardising public safety, and affecting the rights of others,” he said.Liauw said the police would adopt a zero-tolerance approach and take resolute action against anyone who violated the law.The security law combined with coronavirus restrictions have cleared the city's streets of protesters after anti-government demonstrations plunged the financial hub into turmoil in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-organisers-lose-appeal-to-hold-tiananmen-vigil-101622274707111.html

May 29 thus became known as Mt Everest Day in Nepal to mark their achievement, a day celebrated with pomp and much celebration.Norgay and Hilary both were part of British army officer John Hunt’s expedition and reached the summit, the highest point on Earth, at 11:30am on May 29. They spent only 15 minutes atop Everest and Hilary clicked the most famous photo of Norgay, one where he is seen posing with his ice axe.Before setting off with the 1953 expedition team Norgay had attempted to reach the summit with a Swiss team and had successfully scaled 200 metres of Mt Everest. Experts say this made Norgay one of the most experienced climbers in Hunt’s team.The news of Norgay and Hilary’s achievement reached the United Kingdom on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and three days after their actual climb. Hillary and John Hunt were both knighted and Norgay was awarded the George Medal, a civilian medal of bravery. Years after Norgay’s death his grandson Tashi Tenzing pointed out that his grandfather, like the other two gentlemen, should also have also been knighted. A point which brought into focus the unfair treatment of Nepali Sherpas who have assisted climbers in their endeavours.Sir Edmund Hilary hailed from New Zealand and his ascent formed a bond between Nepal and his homeland. During the Nepalese government’s attempts to measure the height of Mt Everest, following the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the New Zealand government came to Nepal’s Survey Department (Napi Bibhag) aid with a Global Navigation Satellite, and trained technicians. Hilary is fondly remembered by the mountainous Khumbu community, where a memorial has been erected in his honour above the village of Khumjung.The revised height of Mt Everest has been pegged at 29,031 ft, 8,848.86 metres above sea level, by authorities of China and Nepal.Both Norgay and Hilary inspired a generation of mountaineers who make countless attempts every year to climb Mt Everest, traffic to which has not been dampened by the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-this-day-in-1953-edmund-hilary-and-tenzing-norgay-scaled-mt-everest-for-the-first-time-101622270193034.html

The federal health body in a fresh set of guidelines said that kids who are fully vaccinated can skip wearing face masks or practice social distancing indoors or outside.However, kids who are not yet fully vaccinated against the viral infection that has killed over three million people around the world, were advised to follow the norms especially if they are indoors or in crowded outdoor settings. Social distancing, staying 3 to 6 feet from others, is recommended for the unvaccinated, but not for the vaccinated, it said in the advisory according to news agency AP.The revised guidelines come as summer camps start to open in parts of the country. Tom Rosenberg, president of the American Camp Association, said, the will open the door to a more conventional camp experience, AP reported.Earlier this month, CDC said that it has relaxed the face mask rules for people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. "If you are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, you can resume activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws, incl. local business and workplace guidance," it said while announcing the decision.US President Joe Biden also appeared without a mask and addressed reporters in the White House. "A great day,” in the fight against Covid-19, he said on May 13.On May 10, the US government authorised the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, offering a way to protect the nation's adolescents before they head back to school in the fall.Children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill from Covid-19, yet they represent nearly 14% of the nation’s coronavirus cases. At least 296 have died from Covid-19 in the US alone, and more than 15,000 have been hospitalised, AP reported citing a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics.According to a report by AP, about 2.5 million of the roughly 17 million US kids have gotten at least one shot. A second dose is required, three weeks after the first, and then it takes two more weeks before the vaccine fully takes effect.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-eases-face-mask-social-distancing-norms-for-kids-at-summer-camps-101622264174155.html

The group was given up for dead until it was resurrected in 2017.Jaishankar was India’s foreign secretary then. The first meeting of the renewed Quad, on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, was scaled up to the level of ministers in 2019. Jaishankar attended that first ministerial, which took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meetings.“I say this to you as someone who has pretty much attended all the, you know, not all the Quad meetings, or various Quad meetings at various levels as the Quad developed,” Jaishankar said, speaking of the group in personal terms for the first time, as he also positioned it in a geostrategic context.“We see the Quad (as) an expression of the convergence of interests of many countries, it is in many ways a reflection of the contemporary nature of the world order, where you know, it’s not a, sort of, you know, at some stage, we have to put the Cold War behind us,” Jaishankar said, going on to dismiss sceptics and critics as those “who are stuck in the Cold War”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-fill-important-gap-in-global-affairs-says-jaishankar-101622264188978.html

VnExpress quoted Long as saying Vietnam would announce the newly discovered variant to the world soon.Vietnam had previously reported seven virus variants: B.1.222, B.1.619, D614G, B.1.1.7 (the UK variant), B.1.351, A.23.1 and B.1.617.2 (the Indian variant).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-detects-hybrid-of-b-1-617-and-uk-covid-19-variant-101622263231208.html

Shipments linked to the company have dropped over the past year to about USD 200,000, officials said.“We will not tolerate any amount derived from forced labor,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters as he announced the measure.CBP issued what is known as a withhold release order that halts shipments that have suspected links to forced labor, under a law that has been on the books for decades, ostensibly to protect US producers from unfair competition.The law has been used with increased frequency in recent years, given the growing awareness of the prevalence of what is essentially modern-day slavery in a range of industries, with workers forced to work long hours for low pay, or none at all, and subjected to violence.CBP found that Dalian's operations, across the fleet, met all 11 criteria for forced labor laid out by the International Labor Organization, including the holding back of wages, inhumane conditions and physical intimidation, said John Leonard, the acting executive assistant commissioner of the agency's Office of Trade.“This was a rather egregious example," Leonard said.Both the State Department and Labor Department have also documented abusive conditions in the Chinese fishing industry, where mostly foreign crews often work 18 to 22 hours per day under abysmal conditions.US authorities have used the Tariff Act of 1930 to halt imports from specific companies, individual fishing vessels and all cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the Chinese government is waging a brutal assimilation campaign against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.The announcement Friday marks the first time that the US has sought to block imports from a company's entire fishing fleet, a sign that the CBP's investigation found evidence of widespread abuse on Dalian vessels around the world.Indonesia's government in May 2020 accused the company of “inhuman” treatment of fishermen from that country, with dozens of men forced to work 18 hours a day for no pay or less than agreed upon. It said the conditions led to illnesses that killed at least three fishermen, whose bodies were cast overboard into the Pacific Ocean.Dalian did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through its website.The company has had recent financial troubles, but Leonard said it appears to be reorganizing and planning to resume operations. “We need to be vigilant,” he said.

29-05-2021||World||US agencies largely fended off latest Russian hack: White House||The White House says it believes US government agencies largely fended off the latest cyberespionage onslaught blamed on Russian intelligence operatives, saying the spear-phishing campaign should not further damage relations with Moscow ahead of next month’s planned presidential summit.Officials downplayed the cyber assault as "basic phishing" in which hackers used malware-laden emails to target the computer systems of US and foreign government agencies, think tanks and humanitarian groups. Microsoft, which disclosed the effort late Thursday, said it believed most of the emails were blocked by automated systems that marked them as spam.As of Friday afternoon, the company said it was "not seeing evidence of any significant number of compromised organizations at this time.”Even so, the revelation of a new spy campaign so close to the June 16 summit between President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin adds to the urgency of White House efforts to confront the Kremlin over aggressive cyber activity that criminal indictments and diplomatic sanctions have done little to deter.“I don’t think it'll create a new point of tension because the point of tension is already so big,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This clearly has to be on the summit agenda. The president has to lay down some markers” to make clear “that the days when you people could do whatever you want are over.”The summit comes amid simmering tensions driven in part by election interference by Moscow and by a massive breach of US government agencies and private corporations by Russian elite cyber spies who infected the software supply chain with malicious code. The US responded with sanctions last month, prompting the Kremlin to warn of retribution.Asked Friday whether the latest hacking effort would affect the Biden-Putin summit, principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, "We’re going to move forward with that.”The US, which has previously called out Russia or criminal groups based there for hacking operations, did not blame anyone for the latest incident. Microsoft attributed it to the group behind the SolarWinds campaign, in which at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private sector companies were breached through a contaminated software update.In this case, hackers gained access to an email marketing account of the US Agency for International Development, and masquerading as the government body, targeted about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations. At least a quarter of them involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work, Microsoft Vice President Tom Burt said in a blog post late Thursday.The company did not say what portion of the attempts may have led to successful intrusions but said in a separate technical blog post that most were blocked by automated systems that marked them as spam. The White House said even if an email eluded those systems, a user would still have to click on the link to activate the malicious payload.Burt said the campaign appeared to be a continuation of multiple efforts by the Russian hackers to “target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts.” He said the targets spanned at least 24 countries.Separately, the prominent cybersecurity firm FireEye said it has been tracking “multiple waves” of related spear-phishing by hackers from Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency since March — preceding the USAID campaign — that used a variety of lures including diplomatic notes and invitations from embassies.The hackers gained access to USAID's account at Constant Contact, an email marketing service, Microsoft said. The authentic-looking phishing emails dated May 25 purport to contain new information on 2020 election fraud claims and include a link to malware that allows the hackers to “achieve persistent access to compromised machines.”Microsoft said the campaign is ongoing and built on escalating spear-phishing campaigns it first detected in January.USAID spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala said Friday that it was investigating with the help of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Constant Contact spokeswoman Kristen Andrews called it an “isolated incident.”While the SolarWinds campaign,was supremely stealthy and began as far back as 2019 before being detected in December by FireEye, this campaign is what cybersecurity researchers call noisy, meaning easy to detect.And though "the spear phishing emails were quickly identified, we expect that any post-compromise actions by these actors would be highly skilled and stealthy,” FireEye's VP of analysis, John Hultquist, said in a statement Friday. He said the incident “is a reminder that cyber espionage is here to stay.”Many cybersecurity experts did not consider the operation an escalation of online Russian aggression.“I think it's par for the course," said Jake Williams, president of Rendition Infosec and a former US government hacker. He said it’s naive to think that US cyber operators aren’t engaged in similar operations targeting adversaries.Bobby Chesney, a University of Texas at Austin law professor specializing in national security, said it is nowhere near as serious as the SolarWinds hack. Nor does it come anywhere near the damage done by the ransomware attack earlier this month — by Russian-speaking criminals tolerated by the Kremlin — that temporarily knocked the Colonial Pipeline offline.Chesney said he thought it was wrong to regard the USAID targeting as a Russian response to sanctions or a sign the sanctions were somehow feckless.“I don't think it proves anything, really,” Chesney said. “It's no surprise at all that the SVR is still engaged in espionage in the cyber domain. I don't think we tried to deter them out of doing this wholesale.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-largely-fended-off-latest-russian-hack-white-house-101622255419314.html

He will now have to serve a total of 20 months for his multiple protest convictions.Seven other leading activists, including 25-year-old youth campaigner Figo Chan, as well as former lawmakers Lee Cheuk-yan and Leung Kwok-hung, were also given new jail terms.The new sentences are the latest in a relentless and successful campaign by China to smother dissent and dismantle Hong Kong’s democracy movement.The clashes with police on China’s October 1 National Day were some of the worst of that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jimmy-lai-seven-other-hong-kong-dissidents-jailed-for-rallies-against-china-101622255923855.html

In the House of Representatives, 35 of the chamber’s 211 Republicans joined Democrats in support of the commission that was to be modelled after the panel convened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and which had strong bipartisan support.US says goodbye to Open Skies accord with RussiaUS announced on Friday it has decided not to return to the Open Skies Treaty saying Russia has violated the accord.The post-Cold War treaty was meant to build trust by allowing the two powers and their allies to monitor one another’s airspace.

"While accidental and not visible to the public, this was completely unacceptable, and I apologize unreservedly."In April, the MP was caught standing naked between the flags of Canada and Quebec, his private parts hidden by his phone, while connected by video to a Question Time session in Parliament.Amos, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, also claimed that was an accident.In the most recent episode, he was caught urinating into a coffee cup, the Conservative opposition said in a statement."This is the second time Mr. Amos has been caught exposing himself to his colleagues in the House, and the House of Commons, virtual or otherwise, must be free of this type of unacceptable behaviour," said Conservative MP Karen Vecchio."This is a pattern of behavior from Mr. Amos and it's now clear that Trudeau's Liberals failed in their duty to ensure a safe work environment following the first incident," she hammered in a statement.Amos, 46, announced he was "temporarily" stepping down from some of his parliamentary duties while continuing to represent his constituency.

US power plants are projected to consume 16% more coal, and China is seen burning a record amount of the fuel, although President Xi Jinping wants the country to start reducing coal use from 2026.Guterres also reiterated that developed countries must meet the $100 billion goal in aid and new climate commitments, including for the period of 2021-2025. At least 50% of climate finance should be for “adaptation and resilience,” he said. His speech comes ahead of the highly-anticipated COP26 meeting in November, where officials from 197 countries gather to solve climate issues. This year, signatory countries are expected to update their initial pledges to help achieve the Paris Agreement goals.Speaking on the virus pandemic, Guterres said that the global vaccine gap must be closed urgently.“We must unite to produce and distribute sufficient vaccines for all, especially to reach low-income countries that are falling behind,” he said. “Covax, the global vaccine equity mechanism, can help achieve this.”More must also be done to support developing countries on the brink of a debt crisis, Guterres said, adding he has called for a further extension to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative into 2022 for all countries in need, including middle-income nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-wants-countries-to-stop-investing-in-coal-seeks-climate-pledges-101622253353699.html
29-05-2021||World||'When volcano starts spitting': Nearly 400,000 flee DR Congo fearing eruption||The eastern DR Congo city of Goma was eerily deserted after nearly 400,000 of its inhabitants fled following warnings that nearby Mount Nyiragongo volcano may erupt again.The authorities geared up for a major humanitarian effort, centred on Sake, around 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of the city, where tens of thousands of people are gathered.Located on the shore of Lake Kivu in the shadow of Africa's most active volcano, the city has lived in fear since Nyiragongo roared back into life last weekend.The strato-volcano spewed rivers of lava that claimed nearly three dozen lives and destroyed the homes of some 20,000 people before the eruption stopped.Scientists have since recorded hundreds of aftershocks.They warn of a potentially catastrophic scenario -- a "limnic eruption" that could smother the area with suffocating carbon dioxide.A report on an emergency meeting early Friday said 80,000 households -- around 400,000 inhabitants -- had emptied on Thursday following a "preventative" evacuation order.Most people have headed for Sake or the Rwandan border in the northeast, while others have fled by boat across Lake Kivu.Late Friday, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said those fleeing needed "urgent, global support".Aid efforts are being organised to provide drinking water, food and other supplies, and workers are helping to reunite children who became separated from their families.Nearly 10,000 people are taking refuge in Bukavu on the southern bank of Lake Kivu, according to governor Theo Ngwabidje, many of them in host families.- Quieter night -Several days of aftershocks, some of them equivalent to small earthquakes, yielded to a quieter night Thursday, and tremors eased both in numbers and intensity, an AFP journalist said.But late Friday afternoon black smoke could be seen rising from the crater on the horizon, causing worry.General Constant Ndima, the military governor of North Kivu province, ordered the evacuation of districts that potentially applies to nearly 400,000 out of Goma's 600,000 residents, according to an estimate by the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.The wider Goma area has a population of around two million.The authorities arranged transport towards Sake, but the roads became choked with cars, trucks, buses and people seeking safety on foot.Many spent the night in the open or slept in schools or churches.Evacuee Eugene Kubugoo said the water was giving children diarrhoea, adding: "We don't have anything to eat or any place to sleep."Tens of thousands had fled Goma last Saturday night but many returned when the eruption ended the following day.- 'Limnic' risk -Friday's report, issued after experts carried out a risk assessment at the volcano's summit, said "seismicity and ground deformation continues to indicate the presence of magma under the Goma area, with an extension under Lake Kivu."People should remain vigilant and listen to news bulletins, as the situation "may change quickly", it warned.Volcanologists say the worst-case scenario is of an eruption under the lake.This could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) that are currently dissolved in the water's depths.The gas would rise to the surface of the lake, forming an invisible cloud that would linger at ground level and displace oxygen, asphyxiating life.In 1986, one of these so-called limnic eruptions killed more than 1,700 people and thousands of cattle at Lake Nyos in western Cameroon.- Empty city -On Friday, almost all of the shops and banks in central Goma were closed, and just a handful of people and some motorcycle taxis were on the usually bustling streets.In the poorer districts in the north of the city, a handful of stores were open and there were more people, including children who gambolled near a water truck."I will stay in the city. I know that I'm in imminent danger but I don't have a choice," said Aline Uramahoro, who has a beer store."I will leave when the volcano starts spitting."Nearly 3,500 metres (11,500 feet) high, Nyiragongo straddles the East African Rift tectonic divide.Its last major eruption, in 2002, claimed around 100 lives and the deadliest eruption on record killed more than 600 people in 1977.Herman Paluku, who gave his age as 94, said he had seen them all -- and insisted he wouldn't budge this time."There is a small hill near here which means that the lava does not reach us.

Pratasevich, 26, has been detained in Minsk alongside his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, despite international calls for their release.European Union officials on Thursday detailed plans for their own sanctions against Belarus that would hit economic sectors close to Lukashenka, including the country’s potash industry. Those are likely to have a greater impact than the penalties announced by the White House; US trade with Belarus amounted to only about $112 million in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau.The announcement came after some lawmakers earlier this week called for the Federal Aviation Administration to fully prohibit US aircraft from entering Belarus air space after the episode. The US is suspending its discretionary application of the 2019 US-Belarus Air Services Agreement, the White House said.Russia has backed Lukashenko over the past quarter century, including during a brutal crackdown on the opposition last year, even as he resisted Moscow’s push for closer economic and political union. Even so, he has been adept in the past at playing off the EU and Russia against each other to retain his independence.Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly greeted Lukashenko in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday.“I’m very happy to see you,” Putin said, agreeing as Lukashenko belittled Western criticism of the airliner incident as “a surge of emotions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-sanctions-on-belarus-over-journalist-s-detention-issues-do-not-travel-warning-to-citizens-101622251183369.html
29-05-2021||World||US, Hong Kong climbers set records on Everest||Climbers from the United States and Hong Kong have set new records as they scaled Mount Everest this week, hiking officials said on Friday.Arthur Muir, 75, became the oldest American to climb the world’s highest peak at 8,848.86-metres on Sunday, an official from the company that organised the expedition said.“Arthur Muir is the oldest American at 75 years old to summit Mount Everest,” Garrett Madison, expedition leader at the Madison Mountaineering company told Reuters from the base camp.Muir beat the record set by Bill Burke, who became the oldest American to climb the mountain at the age of 67 in 2009.Separately, Hong Kong mountaineer Tsang Yin-hung has recorded the world’s fastest ascent of Everest by a woman with a time of just under 26 hours. Tsang, 44, scaled the mountain in a record time of 25 hours and 50 minutes on Sunday, Everest base camp’s government liaison officer Gyanendra Shrestha said.“She left the base camp at 1.20pm on Saturday and reached (the top at) 3.10pm the next day,” Shrestha told AFP.But Tsang still needs to present her claim to officials from Guinness World Records to receive certification of her feat, he added. The Nepal government certifies that climbers have reached the summit but does not issue certifications for records.The fastest woman to conquer Everest had been Nepali Phunjo Jhangmu Lama when she completed the climb in 39 hours 6 minutes.In 2017, Tsang became the first Hong Kong woman to reach the top. It was her third attempt at scaling the Himalayan peak.Nepal has issued a record 408 Everest permits for this climbing season after last year’s season was cancelled due to the pandemic. Up to 350 people have summited the mountain so far this spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hong-kong-climbers-set-records-on-everest-101622250964363.html
29-05-2021||World||Putin offers support to Belarus President||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday offered his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko support in his standoff with the West over his handling of the grounding of a passenger jet and the arrest of a dissident blogger.The West has accused Belarus of piracy after Belarusian air traffic control on Sunday informed the Ryanair pilot of a hoax bomb threat and Minsk scrambled a MiG-29 fighter plane to escort the jetliner down, and then arrested Roman Protasevich, a blogger and critic of Lukashenko, along with his girlfriend.Both are now languishing in jail. Accused of orchestrating mass riots, Protasevich could be jailed for up to 15 years.But Putin, a close ally of Lukashenko, gave his support to Lukashenko, warmly welcoming him for talks in the southern Russian city of Sochi and agreeing with Lukashenko that the West's reaction to the incident was "an outburst of emotion"."At one time they forced the Bolivian president's plane to land and took him out of the plane and nothing, silence," said Putin, referring to a 2013 incident in which Evo Morales' plane was forced to land in Austria at a time when the United States was trying to intercept whistleblower Edward Snowden.The talks in the Black Sea city of Sochi were organised before the plane incident, but come after many European nations have imposed flight bans on Belarusian aviation and the EU is weighing further sanctions.Lukashenko told Putin he would show him some confidential documents about the Ryanair incident that would help the Russian leader understand what really happened."There is always someone who causes problems for us. You know about them, I'll inform you," Lukashenko told Putin."I brought some documents so that you understand what is happening."Looking relaxed and smiling, Putin had earlier suggested the two men take a sea dip, something Lukashenko agreed to.Russia, a close ally which sees the ex-Soviet republic of 9.5 million as a strategically important buffer to its west, had offered verbal support to Minsk before the Putin meeting, while dismissing speculation it was itself complicit in the incident.Moscow says Belarus has shown a readiness for transparency in the row and has described the West's reaction to the plane incident as "shocking," with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing it of "demonising" the authorities in Minsk.Russia and Belarus, which are formally part of a "union state", have been in talks for years to further integrate their nations, a process that has long spurred fears among Belarus's beleaguered opposition that Lukashenko might trade off chunks of sovereignty in return for political backing from the Kremlin.Putin told Lukashenko the two men were continuing to build the union state, but were doing so steadily, without haste, and in a low key way.In power since 1994, Lukashenko with Russia's help faced down the biggest protests of his rule last summer over election rigging, allegations that he denied. The protests lost momentum amid a violent crackdown, but his critics plan to stage new ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-offers-support-to-belarus-president-101622249615662.html
29-05-2021||World||'Just want him here': Family of US journalist detained in Myanmar hopes for his return||The mother of a journalist detained in Myanmar says she and the family “just want him here” in Michigan.“It was a total visceral reaction, gut, visceral, numbing, nauseating, tearful, helpless feeling," Rose Fenster said, describing how she felt when learning about the detention of her son, Danny Fenster.The 37-year-old managing editor of Frontier Myanmar was detained at Yangon International Airport on Monday as he was preparing to board a flight to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, en route to the Detroit area to see his family.“It’s important we get this resolved as quickly as possible. We’re on Day 5, so time is crucial. We want him out of there,” Bryan Fenster, Danny’s older brother, said during an interview Friday at their parents’ home in Huntington Woods, Michigan.Earlier in the day, the US State Department said it was deeply concerned about the detention of Danny Fenster and another American citizen who also has been working as a journalist in Myanmar. The State Department is pressing that country’s military government for their immediate release.It said in a statement that it will keep seeking the release of Fenster and Nathan Maung “until they are allowed to return home safely to their families.”Frontier Myanmar is a news and business magazine that is published in English and Burmese and also online.Human rights organizations and groups promoting freedom of expression have been calling for the release of both men, as well as all other journalists being held by Myanmar’s military government.Michigan Rep. Andy Levin said he has been in close contact with the State Department and the Fenster family, whom he represents in Congress.“This is about freeing an American citizen who has been unjustly detained,” Levin said. “And we’re all rowing in the same direction here.”Bryan Fenster said his brother has been taken to Insein Prison in Yangon, which over decades has housed thousands of political prisoners, including many from the current movement protesting military rule.“We've been hearing terrible things about the conditions there,” Bryan Fenster said,Maung and Myanmar national Hanthar Nyein, co-founders of the Myanmar news website Kamayut Media, were arrested on March 9, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, citing accounts in Myanmar media. The group said it had reports that Maung, the website's editor-in-chief, and Hanthar, a news producer, had been physically mistreated by guards in their first few weeks at Insein Prison.The State Department statement said consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Yangon had paid a virtual visit to Maung on Monday but so far have not been granted access to Fenster. It said it urged the authorities “to grant consular access, as required by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, without delay, and to ensure proper treatment of both Nathan and Daniel while they remain detained.”Two other foreign journalists have been arrested by the military junta that took power in February after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Freelancers Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan have since been deported.“The ongoing persecution, intimidation, harassment and violence faced by journalists in Myanmar constitutes a clear attempt by the military authorities to suppress peaceful dissent and obscure violations committed by security forces in the wake of the 1 February coup,” the human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. “The nationwide crackdown has resulted in widespread denial of the rights to freedom of expression and access to information.”It said that according to Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 88 journalists have been arrested since the army’s takeover, with more than half still in detention, and 33 in hiding.According to the Assistance Association, which has kept a detailed tally of arrests and deaths since the military takeover, more than 4,300 people are in detention, including 104 who have already been sentenced.Reporters Without Borders and PEN International are among other groups calling for the release of the journalists.“As a mom, I just want him here," Rose Fenster said. “And just, I love him, love him, love him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-want-him-here-family-of-us-journalist-detained-in-myanmar-hopes-for-his-return-101622246985349.html
29-05-2021||World||Joe Biden's tax plan forecast to bring in $3.6 trillion over the next decade||President Joe Biden’s proposed tax hikes are forecast to bring in $3.6 trillion over the next decade, the Treasury Department said Friday, a key funding source for the $4 trillion he hopes to spend remaking the American economy and social safety net.The figure, representing the sum of all tax increases if enacted by Congress, came as is part of the “Greenbook” report that accompanies the White House’s $6 trillion 2022 budget request, also released on Friday. It effectively serves as the revenue side of the ledger, against Biden’s spending priorities in the budget.After accounting for the $1.2 trillion in tax credits for clean energy, electric cars, low-income families and housing investment, the plan would net Biden about $2.4 trillion to invest in other economic priorities. The White House has said that the $4 trillion combination of its American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan would be fully paid for over 15 years.The Greenbook, which hasn’t been released since President Barack Obama’s final year in office in 2016, is the most comprehensive look at the tax and revenue proposals the administration endorses.The document spans the gamut of Biden proposals, including a global minimum corporate tax, an increase in the levy on capital gains at death and closing the carried interest tax break for fund managers, all of which Biden has already outlined in his funding proposals for his longer-term spending plans.The top income tax rate would increase to 39.6% from 37% starting in 2022, according to the proposal. Married couples earning $509,300, individuals earning $452,700 and heads of households earning $481,000 would be affected by the increases.The proposal was met with criticism from Republicans who said now is not the time to raise taxes. Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Biden’s plan would “strangle the economy with regulations and red tape.”The Greenbook proposal assumes the capital gains increase would take effect on the date it was announced, a Treasury official said on a call with reporters. That proposal was announced in late April.The reason for doing that is to prevent acceleration of gains during a temporarily low tax rate, another official said. But the Treasury will work with Congress to determine the appropriate effective date, the person said. The large majority of the other tax increases are slated to go into effect in 2022.The retroactive tax increase on capital gains will be difficult to get through Congress in its current form given Democrats’ thin majorities and lawmakers’ rare history for raising taxes without giving people a fair warning, said John Gimigliano, who leads federal tax legislative services at KPMG LLP.Tax CreditsThe Greenbook also includes key tax-credit proposals that Democratic lawmakers see as crucial to campaign on during the 2022 midterm elections. The administration is calling for an extension of an expanded child tax credit through 2025, as well as benefits for green energy and electric vehicles.While Congress is unlikely to enact Biden’s tax ideas wholesale, the Greenbook has political significance by detailing the proposals that have the support of the White House.“This gives Congress room to run. Congress is going to have to develop the policy and find the votes,” Gimigliano said. Congressional leadership “is going to have to figure this out themselves to a certain extent.”Democrats will likely have to scale back some of the ideas to be able to pass them through their razor-thin majorities in Congress. Some Senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, have expressed concerns about Biden’s corporate tax rate and capital gains plans.The document will serve as a starting point for congressional Democrats to begin turning Biden’s agenda into legislation. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden have already begun sifting through Biden’s broad outlines and preparing to move legislation later this year.Pressure from moderates to pare down the tax proposals, along with procedural rules in the Senate, could both prove to be stumbling blocks as Democrats negotiate.SALT DeductionOn the flip side, the Treasury outline omits a key priority for some House Democrats: an expansion of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. More than 20 lawmakers from high-tax states have said they would oppose Biden’s economic agenda unless it also included an expansion of that write-off, which is currently capped at $10,000.The Greenbook also details other previously announced proposals, including one to impose taxes at death on inherited property for large gains accrued during the previous owner’s lifetime. The proposal would also prevent private-equity and hedge fund managers from applying the long-term capital gains tax rate to their portion of the fund’s profits, known as carried interest, if their overall taxable income exceeds $400,000.Biden’s proposals also call for $2 trillion in additional business-tax revenue over the next 10 years from changes like boosting the corporate tax rate, raising the minimum taxes paid by US companies on their foreign income and revamping efforts to combat companies’ attempts to shift profits offshore.A Treasury official said the administration plans to work with Congress on proposals to create a new research-and-development tax incentive to replace one created under President Donald Trump, but declined to give details on what that could look like.Another idea omitted from the Greenbook was something Biden campaigned on: repealing a 20% small business deduction created in the 2017 Republican tax law for high earners. Some plans didn’t appear in the Greenbook because they require more policy development, a Treasury official said. Others will likely show up in future budgets, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-tax-plan-forecast-to-bring-in-3-6-trillion-over-the-next-decade-101622246246402.html
29-05-2021||World||US aviation administration tells airlines to use extreme caution when flying over Belarus||The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday advised airlines to exercise "extreme caution" while flying over Belarus following the incident with grounding of a Ryanair jet in Minsk."The FAA's Notice to Airmen says airlines should continue to exercise extreme caution until the agency can better assess Belarus' actions surrounding the May 23 diversion of a passenger jet and the potential for Belarus to repeat similar actions in the future," the FAA said in a statement.The FAA said that it is working closely with other US agencies to determine whether any additional measures may be necessary and promised to evaluate an international investigation report to determine the risks for US airlines flying in that area.On Sunday, an Irish airline Ryanair traveling from Greece to Lithuania made an emergency landing in Minsk over a bomb threat, which turned out to be fake. One of its passengers, Roman Protasevich, the founder of a Telegram channel that Belarus has designated as extremist, was detained during the stopover at the airport.On Monday, the European Union suspended the flights of Belarussian airplanes and recommended European carriers to avoid flights over Belarus as well as urging new sanctions on the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aviation-administration-tells-airlines-to-use-extreme-caution-when-flying-over-belarus-101622244741429.html

"If you are not fully vaccinated, we ask that you continue to wear a mask throughout the theater unless actively enjoying food or drinks."Similar updates to mask policy were made on Regal and Cinemark websites. All three chains said they would follow state and local mandates on mask wearing, which may be different from the CDC guidelines.The changes for movie theaters come two weeks after the CDC said that fully vaccinated people need not wear masks in any setting.Movie-going has begun ramping up in the United States after lengthy pandemic-related closures and a lack of new film releases.Movie studios and theater chains last week launched a "big screen is back" campaign, previewing a summer filled with blockbusters including the new "Fast & Furious" movie and the superhero film "Black Widow."Hollywood studios are closely watching box office receipts for two major films being released this weekend - "Cruella," a prequel story about the villain in "101 Dalmatians," and the thriller "A Quiet Place Part II."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-movie-theaters-remove-mask-mandate-for-vaccinated-people-101622240572412.html
29-05-2021||World||Senate confirms geneticist Lander as Biden's science adviser||The Senate has confirmed geneticist Eric Lander to be President Joe Biden's chief science adviser, one of the last unfilled Cabinet posts in the Biden administration.Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, was approved by a voice vote Saturday to serve as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position Biden has elevated to Cabinet rank.Lander, who also is a mathematician and molecular biologist, was lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome, the so-called “book of life.”His nomination was delayed for months as senators sought more information about meetings he had with the late Jeffrey Epstein, a disgraced financier who was charged with sex trafficking before his apparent suicide. Lander also was criticized for downplaying the contributions of two Nobel Prize-winning female scientists.At his confirmation hearing last month, Lander apologized for a 2016 article he wrote that downplayed the work of the female scientists. At the hearing, he also called Epstein “an abhorrent individual.''Lander said he "understated the importance of those key advances'' by biochemists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna. The two were later awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.“I felt terrible about it, I made a mistake. And when I make a mistake, I own it and try to do better,'' Lander said.“I should have written those paragraphs differently to make my intention crystal clear. I have enormous respect for Doctors Doudna and Charpentier and the important work they've done throughout their careers.''He only met with Epstein twice, in 2012, Lander said, and never requested or received funds from Epstein or his foundation.Sen Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said at a May 20 committee meeting that she wished Biden had named a woman as science adviser, but that Lander had pledged to work to elevate women and minorities in science.Lander said in a statement Saturday that Biden's elevation of the science post “made clear that science and technology will be central to solving the nation's most urgent challenges,” including health, environmental quality "and justice for all Americans.''Lander's confirmation leaves Biden's Cabinet nearly complete. The only remaining unfilled Cabinet post is that of Office of Management and Budget director. Shalanda Young has been serving as acting OMB director after her confirmation as deputy director. Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination for OMB head after several senators said they would not vote for her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-geneticist-lander-as-biden-s-science-adviser-101622238264252.html

"At this time, we have more questions than answers."Canada's residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, constituted "cultural genocide," a six-year investigation into the now-defunct system found in 2015.The report documented horrific physical abuse, rape, malnutrition and other atrocities suffered by many of the 150,000 children who attended the schools, typically run by Christian churches on behalf of Ottawa from the 1840s to the 1990s.It found more than 4,100 children died while attending residential school. The deaths of the 215 children buried in the grounds of what was once Canada's largest residential school are believed to not have been included in that figure and appear to have been undocumented until the discovery.Trudeau wrote in a tweet that the news "breaks my heart - it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country's history."In 2008, the Canadian government formally apologized for the system.The Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc Nation said it was engaging with the coroner and reaching out to the home communities whose children attended the school. They expect to have preliminary findings by mid-June.In a statement, British Columbia Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief Terry Teegee called finding such grave sites "urgent work" that "refreshes the grief and loss for all First Nations in British Columbia."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remains-of-215-children-found-at-former-indigenous-school-site-in-canada-101622233018803.html
29-05-2021||World||Joe Biden unveils $6 trillion US budget in mega spending drive||President Joe Biden will unveil a $6 trillion budget proposal on Friday to make the United States more competitive by investing in education, climate change and transportation, in an ambitious plan that will mark the highest level of sustained federal government spending in America since World War II.Citing leaked budget documents, the New York Times reported that the spending plan for 2022 calls for investments in roads, water pipes, broadband internet, electric vehicle charging stations and research in order to make the economy more competitive, and provides for an expanded social safety net with affordable childcare, universal pre-kindergarten and a paid leave program. The proposals are likely to run into opposition from the Republicans.The two-part agenda, contained in the US president’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, will push up deficit and keep it above $1 trillion for a decade. The president plans to pay for it with increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy (those earning less than $400,000 annually will be spared), administration officials have said, while adding that the additional revenue will take time to trickle in.“We must be number one in the world to lead the world in the 21st century,” Biden said in Cleveland, Ohio on Thursday after listing out investments being made by China, Japan and the European Union to shore up their economies.“Now is the time to build the foundation that we’ve laid -- to make bold investments in our families, in our communities, in our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling of the economy for everybody.”President Biden’s plan seeks to take an economy emerging from recession and expand it through massive federal spending, taking advantage of interest rates being at a historic low, and make it competitive, especially against China. This will create “a new paradigm -- one that rewards work, the working people in this nation, not just those at the top”, as Biden said.The proposal fulfils some of Biden’s campaign promises, including more money for schools in high-poverty areas, free community colleges, cancer research and climate change. But leaves out a key element — public option, which will give Americans the choice to opt for government-run healthcare programme, Medicare, or private insurance. The White House expects lawmakers to introduce it into the legislation when it is being considered by congress.The budget is only the administration’s spending proposal. It must be passed by congress to become effective. But with Democrats in control of both -- the House of Representatives and the Senate -- Biden is positioned to get his ambitious plan through, most parts of it at least.Republicans will push back, as has been the pattern. No Republican voted for Biden’s Rescue Plan and have given a counteroffer of $928 billion to his $1.7 trillion infrastructure investment proposal (down from the $2.2 billion originally).“This is the latest example of President Biden abandoning his lofty promise that he can fund trillions of dollars in new spending simply by taxing the wealthy or corporations alone,” Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has oversight on budget, said in a statement.President Biden will also face some pushback from within his party. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, who has emerged as a key swing vote in the evenly divided senate, publicly said he does not support the president’s proposed tax rate on corporations of 28%, up from 21%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-propose-6-trillion-budget-to-make-us-competitive-101622216063585.html
