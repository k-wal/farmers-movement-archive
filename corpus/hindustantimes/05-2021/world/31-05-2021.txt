Grossi had hoped to report progress before the board meets again next week."The Director General is concerned that the technical discussions between the Agency and Iran have not yielded the expected results," the report said."The lack of progress in clarifying the Agency's questions concerning the correctness and completeness of Iran's safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the Agency to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-fails-to-explain-uranium-traces-found-at-several-sites-iaea-report-101622483802184.html
31-05-2021||World||Explained: China’s family planning laws over the years||China on Monday announced a new relaxation to its family planning rules allowing couples in the country to have upto three children now, an increase from the two children allowed previously. The new measures were announced after the latest data in this month from the National Bureau of Statistic in Beijing showed that the annual births plummeted to historic low of 12 million in the year 2020, news agency AFP reported.The fertility rate in the world’s populous nation currently stands at 1.3 which is beneath the levels needed to maintain a stable population, the latest data showed. The decision was announced after a meeting by the Political Bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), headed by President Xi Jinping.Also, many supporting measures for families such as improving maternity leaves, universal childcare and lowering education costs were promised by the meeting in the wake of the new measures.As China relaxes its family planning rules, here is a look at the previous laws in place regarding the issue and how they have changed over the years.One-child policyChina’s well-known one child policy was implemented initially in the year 1979 and the government had it in effect for decades before eventually relaxing it in the year 2016 (when the changes came into effect). Since then, the government allowed for couples to have up to two kids.The one-child policy was widely criticised for the fact that it was a violation of fundamental human rights and reproductive freedom, the BBC reported back in 2015, citing experts in China and the West. Also, many rich families circumvented the rule by paying fines, the BBC report said.Relaxations and changes made furtherGrowing concerns regarding the issues with one-child policy pushed the Chinese government to announce that couples, where at least one partner is an only child, would be allowed to have two children, in the year 2013, according to a report by China-based CGTN.In the year 2016, the government replaced the one-child policy with the two-child policy, a relaxation to the existing decades-old law. Despite a growth in the number of births in 2016, the count has fallen from 2017 to 2020 for four years in a row, the report showed.Also, many have criticised the new reforms in Chinese social media platforms, saying that it is only possible for the rich people and others are already facing many challenges such as longer working hours and increasing housing prices.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-china-s-family-planning-laws-over-the-years-101622482863752.html

So far, an estimated 6% of the Japanese population has taken at least one shot of a vaccine, which is lower when compared to other developed nations.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has promised to speed up the effort and ensure complete vaccination of the elderly before the commencement of the Tokyo Olympics in July.In a parallel development, Japan has approved the storage guidelines for the Pfizer vaccine that will allow for month-long storage at 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) after removal from the freezer, instead of five days.The US pharmaceutical company had advised that 12 to 15 year olds be made eligible after a successful clinical trial including 2,260 children revealed a 100% efficacy rate, with none developing any symptom except for 18 who were given a placebo.Earlier in the month, the United States and the European Union approved this vaccine for use within this age group.Japan approved the Pfizer dose for persons aged 16 and above in February and has agreements for enough shots for 97 million people, while also entering supply deals with British drug maker AstraZeneca and US biotechnology firm Moderna, which have also passed the clinical test indicating its safe usage for age 12 and above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-approved-for-minors-aged-12-15-in-japan-report-101622482448708.html
31-05-2021||World||WHO chief calls for international treaty for pandemic preparedness as part of bold reforms||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) called on Monday for launching negotiations this year on an international treaty to boost pandemic preparedness, as part of sweeping reforms envisioned by member states.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told its annual ministerial assembly that the UN agency faced a "serious challenge" to maintain its Covid-19 response at the current level and required sustainable and flexible funding.Earlier in the day - the last of the week-long assembly - health ministers agreed to study recommendations for ambitious reforms made by independent experts to strengthen the capacity of both the WHO and countries to contain new viruses.The ministers from the WHO's 194 member states are to meet from Nov. 29 to decide whether to launch negotiations on the pandemic treaty."The one recommendation that I believe will do most to strengthen both WHO and global health security is the recommendation for a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response," Tedros said. "This is an idea whose time has come."It could be a long road ahead if such a treaty is to be reached. The WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - the world's first public health treaty - was clinched in 2003 after four years of negotiations.The WHO, which has been at the heart of the world's sluggish response to the Covid-19 pandemic, faces a potential shake-up to prevent future outbreaks.Under the resolution submitted by the European Union, and adopted by consensus, member states are to be firmly in the driver's seat of the reforms through a year-long process."It's essential that we strengthen global (disease) surveillance and provide the World Health Organization with the authority and the capacity to do this important job for all the peoples of the world," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told the talks."If we are to deliver on this ambitious reform agenda, then we must work together and put other issues aside," he said.The new virus has infected more than 170 million people and killed nearly 3.7 million since emerging in China in late 2019, according to a Reuters tally of official national figures."PATHOGENS HAVE THE UPPER HAND"WHO's emergencies director, Mike Ryan, welcomed the decisions, saying: "Right now the pathogens have the upper hand, they are emerging more frequently and often silently in a planet that is out of balance."We need to turn that very thing that has exposed us in this pandemic, our interconnectedness, we need to turn that into a strength," he said.Chile's ambassador Frank Tressler Zamorano said on behalf of 60 countries that a pandemic treaty would help "heed the call by so many experts to reset the system".One panel, headed by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, said a new global system should be set up to respond faster to disease outbreaks to help ensure no future virus causes a pandemic as devastating as Covid-19.The experts, who found crucial failures in the global response in early 2020, said the WHO should be given the power to send investigators swiftly to chase down new disease outbreaks and to publish their full findings without delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-calls-for-international-treaty-for-pandemic-preparedness-as-part-of-bold-reforms-101622479475091.html
31-05-2021||World||Sinovac vaccine 'controlled' Covid-19 in Brazil town, study finds||The vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. was effective in controlling Covid-19 in a mass-inoculation study in a small Brazilian town after 75% of adults were covered with a second shot.The study carried out by the Sao Paulo state government in the small town of Serrana -- population 45,000 -- may offer clues for other developing nations on how much of the public needs to be vaccinated in order to begin moving past the pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in Latin America and beyond.The full results will be released during a press conference later on Monday with initial data broadcast on Sunday evening during TV Globo’s “Fantastico” program which interviewed researchers leading the project. While infection rates improved after first doses were administered, Covid-19 wasn’t properly controlled in the town until after a second shot was given, the researchers said.The study was led by the Butantan Institute, which produces Sinovac’s so-called CoronaVac in Brazil. Almost two thirds of Serrana’s 45,000 inhabitants got the vaccine between February and April with another third ineligible to receive the shot if they were under 18 years old or pregnant. About 95% of the targeted adult population received the required two doses in the study.While neighboring cities were being hit hard by the pandemic, Serrana saw deaths fall by 95% right after the mass-vaccination, symptomatic cases dropped by 80% and hospitalizations decreased by 86%, the report said. They didn’t say what time period was being used for the data.Serrana mayor Leo Capitalize said in an interview that 40 days ago, 160-180 people were seeking a hospital bed on a daily basis and that test positivity rates were at 69%. Now, the number of people seeking attention in the hospital due to Covid is down to 30 to 35 people and positivity is down to 20%.At the time the project was announced in February, Butantan researchers said the study aimed to show the effectiveness of CoronaVac to control cases, deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 in the real world, and if the shot is able to reduce transmission, not only symptomatic cases.Sinovac’s vaccine is being used widely in the developing world including Chile, Turkey, Indonesia and the Philippines.The findings also underline the importance of people returning for a second shot. In Brazil, some 66 million vaccines have been administered, covering 21.4% of the population with a single dose. About 10.5% of the country is now considered to be fully inoculated, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-vaccine-controlled-covid-19-in-brazil-town-study-finds-101622479316860.html
31-05-2021||World||France, other European countries demand answers after US-Danish spying claims||France warned Monday that alleged US spying on European allies using Danish underwater cables would be "extremely serious" if confirmed, as questions mounted over whether Denmark knew what the US was doing.In an investigative report on Sunday, Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR) and other European media outlets said the US National Security Agency (NSA) had eavesdropped on Danish underwater internet cables from 2012 to 2014 to spy on top politicians in Germany, Sweden, Norway and France.The NSA was able to access text messages, telephone calls and internet traffic including searches, chats and messaging services -- including those of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, then-foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and then-opposition leader Peer Steinbruck, DR said."It is extremely serious," France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France Info radio."We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors or faults in their cooperation with American services," he said."Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation, so these potential facts are serious," said the minister.He said the facts must first "be verified" and then "conclusions drawn in terms of cooperation".'Unacceptable' Denmark's neighbours also demanded explanations."It's unacceptable if countries which have close allied cooperation feel the need to spy on one another," Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told public broadcaster NRK.She said Norway had asked Denmark "for all the information they have".Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said he had been "in contact with Denmark's defence minister to ask if Danish platforms have been used to spy on Swedish politicians."A German government spokesman said Monday that Berlin was "in contact with all relevant national and international interlocutors to get clarification".DR said the NSA had taken advantage of a surveillance collaboration with Denmark's military intelligence unit FE to eavesdrop.But it was unclear whether Denmark knew at the time that the US was using the cables to spy on Denmark's neighbours.Contacted by AFP, Denmark's military intelligence unit refused to comment on the revelations.Defence Minister Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, has neither confirmed nor denied DR's report, telling AFP only that "systematic eavesdropping of close allies is unacceptable".US eavesdropping on European leaders is, however, not new.In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed thousands of classified documents exposing the vast US surveillance put in place after the September 11, 2001 attacks.Among other things, the documents showed the US government was spying on its own citizens and carrying out widespread tapping worldwide, including of Merkel's mobile phone.However, if the Danish-US spying is confirmed, it went on during and after the 2013 Snowden affair.In 2014, following the Snowden scandal, a secret internal working group at FE began looking into whether the NSA had used the Danish-US spying collaboration -- called XKeyscore -- to spy on Denmark's allies, DR said.The group's report, codenamed Operation Dunhammer, was presented to top FE management in May 2015.What happened after that is not yet known.New pieces of the puzzleBramsen was however informed of the spying in August 2020, according to DR.Shortly after that, FE director Lars Findsen, his predecessor who was in the post until 2015 Thomas Ahrenkiel, and three other FE employees were removed from their positions but no full explanation was made public.At the time, the government said an audit had raised suspicions that FE was conducting illegal surveillance between 2014 and 2020.In November 2020, DR revealed that the US had used the Danish cables to spy on the Danish and European defence industries from 2012 to 2015.A month later, Denmark's justice ministry ordered a commission of inquiry into FE's operations. Its conclusions are due at the end of 2021.Snowden, who now lives in Russia, called on Twitter for "full public disclosure" from Denmark and the US.The latest revelations are "new pieces of the puzzle," Thomas Wegener Friis, an intelligence expert and professor at the University of Southern Denmark, told AFP."It's exactly the same kind of scandal as the one with German services helping the Americans to spy a few years ago," he added.Denmark is one of the United States' closest European allies and sent troops to fight in Iraq.It is the only Nordic country that is both a member of NATO and the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-other-european-countries-demand-answers-after-us-danish-spying-claims-101622479035868.html
31-05-2021||World||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny asks court to end prison security checks||Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny asked a court Monday to halt the hourly night-time checks he has been subjected to in his penal colony.Speaking to the court in a video link from prison, Navalny charged that he has done nothing that would warrant the authorities' decision to designate him as a flight risk that has resulted in checks.“I just want them to stop coming to me and waking me up at night-time,” he told the judge in remarks that were broadcast by the independent Dozhd TV. “What did I do: Did I climb the fence? Did I dig up an underpass? Or was I wringing a pistol from someone? Just explain why they named me a flight risk!"He argued that the hourly night-time checks “effectively amount to torture,” telling the judge that “you would go mad in a week” if subjected to such regular wake-ups.The court later adjourned the hearing until Wednesday.Navalny, the most determined political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.In February, he was handed a 2 1/2-year sentence for violating terms of a suspended sentence stemming from a 2014 embezzlement conviction, which he says was politically motivated.He went on a 24-day hunger strike in prison to protest the lack of medical treatment for severe back pain and numbness in his legs, ending it last month after getting the medical attention he demanded.While he still was on hunger strike, Navalny was moved from a penal colony east of Moscow where he was serving his sentence to the hospital ward of another prison in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers (110 miles) east of the capital. He still remains at that prison, where he said the night-time checks continued, although they were less intrusive.With Navalny in prison, prosecutors have asked a Moscow court to designate his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist groups. A bill, which has sailed quickly through the Kremlin-controlled lower house of Russian parliament, bars members, donors and supporters of extremist groups from seeking public office.The parallel moves have been widely seen as an attempt to keep any of Navalny's associates from running in September's parliamentary election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-asks-court-to-end-prison-security-checks-101622478248868.html
31-05-2021||World||BRICS foreign ministers to discuss Covid-19, countering terror at virtual meet||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi are set to come face to face, albeit in a virtual format, on Tuesday during a meeting of foreign ministers of the BRICS grouping that is expected to focus on the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and global and regional issues.India is hosting the virtual meeting of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa group (BRICS) as its current chair. It will also be joined by Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco França, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor. The rotating BRICS chair will pass to China in 2022.The meeting is being held against the backdrop of a dragging military standoff between India and China in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has severely strained ties between the two countries.The foreign ministers are expected to exchange views on the Covid-19 pandemic, the need to reform the multilateral system to enhance its capacity to effectively address contemporary challenges, countering terrorism, sustainable development, global and regional issues, and ways to enhance intra-BRICS cooperation, the external affairs ministry said on Monday.The meeting will also prepare the grounds for the BRICS Summit to be hosted by India later this year, though the members of the grouping are yet to decide if it will be in-person or virtual.This is the third time India is holding the position of chair of BRICS after 2012 and 2016, and this has coincided with the 15th anniversary of the grouping. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that meetings such as the one bringing together the foreign ministers on Tuesday are also an opportunity to review the work of BRICS to ensure greater efficiency and relevance.The theme for India’s chairmanship of BRICS is “BRICS@15: Intra-Brics cooperation for continuity, consolidation and consensus,” and the country’s priorities include reforming the multilateral system, counter-terror cooperation, and digital and technological tools for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The BRICS’ foreign ministers first met in 2006, and over the past 15 years, the scope of the grouping has expanded to include strategic issues such as counter-terror and cyber security, and new areas of cooperation such as healthcare, and disaster management.The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) has so far approved 76 projects worth more than $28 billion in the BRICS countries. A total of 18 projects worth $6.9 billion have been approved in India, including a loan of $2 billion under the emergency assistance programme in combating Covid-19.With the pandemic pushing millions into poverty and disrupting progress in achieving the SDGs, India will use its chairmanship of BRICS to frame practical measures with members of the grouping to harness digital and technological tools and solutions to achieve goals in healthcare, poverty, hunger, education and infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-foreign-ministers-to-discuss-covid-19-countering-terror-at-virtual-meeting-101622478231857.html

Later, he called on Americans to commemorate their fallen heroes by remembering their fight for the nation's ideals.“This nation was built on an idea," Biden said in an address at Arlington. “We were built on an idea, the idea of liberty and opportunity for all. We’ve never fully realized that aspiration of our founders, but every generation has opened the door a little wider.”He focused much of his speech on the importance of democracy, saying that it thrives when citizens can vote, when there is a free press and when there are equal rights for all.“Generation after generation of American heroes are signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every American heart: that liberation, opportunity, justice are far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than in an autocracy," Biden said.The Bidens stopped by a row of gravestones after the ceremony, holding hands and speaking with a family whose relative died during World War II.Other dignitaries at the Arlington event included Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.On Sunday, Biden addressed a crowd of Gold Star military families and other veterans in a ceremony at War Memorial Plaza in New Castle, Delaware. Earlier in the day, he and other family members attended a memorial Mass for his son Beau Biden, a veteran who died of brain cancer six years ago to the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-commemorates-war-dead-at-arlington-national-cemetery-101622476963795.html
31-05-2021||World||In Israel, PM Netanyahu's rivals try to seal the deal on coalition to unseat him||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals on Monday sought to finalise a unity coalition that would unseat the veteran Israeli leader, but political commentators saw a bitter fight ahead.Centrist opposition chief Yair Lapid secured support on Sunday from ultranationalist Naftali Bennett for a "change" government of ideologically disparate rivals.The deal, in which Bennett would serve first as prime minister under a rotation with Lapid, must be finalised by a deadline of midnight (2200GMT) on Wednesday.Netanyahu, 71, is the dominant political figure of his generation and his challengers have little in common - save a desire to emerge from his divisive shadow and from unprecedented turmoil which has seen four deadlocked elections in two years.Hoping to discredit Bennett and other rightists now negotiating with Lapid, Netanyahu has cast them as committing "the fraud of the century" which would, he said, imperil Israel.Lapid's riposte was restrained."A week from now, the State of Israel can be in a new era. Suddenly it will be quieter. Ministers will go to work without inciting, without lying, without trying to instil fear all of the time," he said in a televised address.Though he described Bennett as "my friend, the prime minister-designate" and voiced hope of a deal before Wednesday, Lapid cautioned: "There are still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government."Israelis were divided about everything except the folly of writing Netanyahu off."An event took place yesterday whose importance cannot be overstated. A real possibility was created ... an alternative government in every sense of the word," wrote Sima Kadmon in the best-selling Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.Not over yetBut she added: "It’s not over yet. Long days loom in which Netanyahu will do absolutely everything to shift the momentum."Netanyahu faces other troubles, chiefly a corruption trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies all charges.The veteran Likud Party leader is a survivor: he was first elected prime minister in 1996 and he returned to power in 2009, holding the top office for more than a decade.Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu daily, described Bennett and Gideon Saar, another rightist in talks with Lapid, as being "in service of the left". Netanyahu has kept the door open to them, maintaining he is still capable of forming the next government.If Bennett and Lapid miss Wednesday's deadline, parliament can choose a candidate to for a new coalition. Should that fail, the country goes to a fifth election.However, a source briefed on the Bennett-Lapid power-sharing talks, which also include liberal and centre-left parties, said there had been "significant progress" toward a final deal, adding: "There's a lot more that unites than separates."Bennett, a former defence minister, and Lapid, a former finance minister, both want to invest in education and health, and to head off economic malaise from the Covid-19 pandemic.However the new coalition will likely mean a stalemate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with marked policy differences between the coalition partners.Bennett has favoured Israel annexing parts of the occupied West Bank, while his prospective left-leaning allies may argue for ceding territory to the Palestinians.The source briefed on the talks indicated that Bennett and Lapid had agreed to sidestep the issue: "There's not going to be annexation, there's not going to be final-status withdrawals.""Final status" is a diplomatic term for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, negotiations on which stalled in 2014.Israel's financial markets were mostly unchanged on Monday with the shekel holding steady at 3.25 per dollar.Once a coalition is formed, investors will expect passage of a 2021 state budget. Because of the two-year political stalemate, Israel is using a pro-rated version of the 2019 budget, which was approved in mid-2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-israel-pm-netanyahu-s-rivals-try-to-seal-the-deal-on-coalition-to-unseat-him-101622473394870.html
31-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Not enough data to decide if travel curbs should be lifted, says Singapore||Singapore wants to resume regular international travel, but there is not enough data to decide whether lifting travel restrictions is possible for now, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday.If Singapore residents are vaccinated and the country is safe, "we hope Singaporeans can gain the freedom to travel," the Channel News Asia quoted Ong as saying.This could mean travelling for business reasons or visiting relatives who are living overseas without having to serve a 21-day stay-home notice, he said.Ong was responding to a question at a COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Task Force press conference on whether Singapore would wait for neighbouring countries to achieve higher vaccination levels before lifting travel restrictions."Of course, we hope to resume that normalcy, but I think the truth is we don't have enough data to... decide whether lifting all those restrictions is possible as of now," Ong said.Singapore is "heading in the right direction," said the health minister. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation on the status of COVID-19 and measures being taken to manage the disease spread."If we can get ourselves substantially vaccinated, protected, certainly travel restrictions will have to be reviewed with a view to restore our ability to travel and become a business hub," he said.Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force, said the government has "always taken a risk-based approach" towards travel restrictions."If you look at our border measures, we already differentiate countries by risk and based on the infection levels in these countries. So, if a country is safe, we already allow Singaporeans to go there and come back without any quarantine in Singapore," he added."And we even allow travellers from these places to come to Singapore without quarantine."On the other hand, if a country is not so safe, there are high incidence rates that are prevalent in these places, then we have tighter border control measures where travellers coming in will have to serve a quarantine in a dedicated facility," he said.Singapore will continue with this approach "in the coming months", said Wong.“If more countries become safe, infection rates come down, vaccination rates are high, then potentially, we will be able to open up more with these places," he added.“On the other hand, if there are places where the incidence rates will remain high, and there are concerns (that) they are high-risk areas, then the border measures will remain and the quarantine measures will remain," the minister said.If all goes to plan, there may be a chance for some easing of measures after June 13, said Wong. Singapore has been on 'Heightened Alert' for the last three weeks and will have to continue till June 13.These restrictions include reducing the size of group gatherings from five people (under Phase III) to two people and banning dining-in at food and beverage outlets. "We will have to do this gradually and in a controlled manner. So, there is some chance of relaxation but in a controlled and calibrated manner," said Wong."On the other hand, if we monitor over time and ... we see new risks emerging, new clusters emerging, more unlinked cases that we are not able to track down and pin down, then it may suggest that this is continuing a little bit more than (what) we are comfortable with and therefore we may have to take additional restrictions or precautions and safeguards based on the data."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-not-enough-data-to-decide-if-travel-curbs-should-be-lifted-says-singapore-101622470125821.html

In an Instagram post, earlier in the week, Givaty had briefed the event that led to the creation of the cartoon of Iron Dome. She said that she used the idea of a superhero to explain to her children about the conflict between Israel and Hamas.While Iron Dome, Israel’s multi-tiered missile defense system, was active in intercepting the rockets fired by the Hamas, she told her children that the loud noises actually came from the superhero smashing the missiles. She also said that the artwork was made by two illustrators and artists named Yehuda Devir and Maya Devir after she explained the story to them.

The list will be put on display and public opinions solicited until June 4 before the final decision is made, the report said. “The list covered candidates from several fields, including war heroes, scientists, community workers, artists, diplomats, pioneers in national unity, educators and police.”Among those nominated is Wang Shumao, called the “guardian of the South China Sea”, for participating in the construction on the disputed Nansha Islands.As a member of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, Wang has advocated that China should send more militia missions to “…safeguard territorial sovereignty and the marine rights and interests in the South China Sea (SCS)”.Beijing claims almost the entire SCS and is locked in dispute with several countries over the ownership of islands in the region.The July 1 Medal, established by the CPC Central Committee earlier this year, is the highest honour in the party, said Fu Xingguo, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee’s Organisation Department, in March.This year, the CPC Central Committee will hold a grand gathering to award the medal ahead of July 1, the birthday of the CPC, Fu said.President Xi Jinping will present the July 1 medal as part of the celebrations to mark CPC’s 100th year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-soldier-killed-at-galwan-valley-up-for-top-medal-101622469949408.html

Hundreds are believed to have died in the riots.A hundred years later, Tulsans commemorated the 100th anniversary of a two-day assault Greenwood on Monday. They called attention to an era of deadly mob assaults on Black communities that official history long suppressed.The thriving Greenwood community - dubbed Black Wall Street because of the number of Black-owned businesses - was decimated in the two-day attack by a white mob.Among other Black-owned properties which were levelled in the violence include grocery stores, soda fountains, cafes, barbershops, a movie theater, music venues, cigar and billiard parlors, tailors and dry cleaners.Here is a look at what all was destroyed in the 1921 incident:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-was-the-1921-tulsa-massacre-and-what-it-destroyed-101622469088663.html

He’s also been clashing with the EU’s executive arm after its auditors found him in conflict of interest over ties to his chemical, agriculture and media empire.Babis told the CTK newswire on Monday that the fraud cause is a fabrication and that “nothing illegal has ever happened.” As he tries to halt a slide in popularity before general elections in October, he has repeatedly denounced the investigation at home and the conflict of interest audit as attacks staged by his rivals to force him out of politics.Police completed a probe into the fraud case and handed a file containing more than 34,000 pages of evidence to the state prosecutors’ office, Ales Cimbala, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement on Monday. The prosecutor on the case, which focuses on whether one of Babis’s companies illegally obtained an EU subsidy of about $2.4 million more than a decade ago, will now study the file and decide whether to bring charges.This is the second time police have recommended charging Babis after a first instance in 2019. The prosecutor then decided against taking Babis to court, but the decision was overturned and the case was returned to police for further investigation.The country’s chief prosecutor Pavel Zeman, who reopened the probe into Babis two years ago, resigned this month and said he could no longer bear dealing with pressure from Justice Minister Marie Benesova, who has faced public protests and calls for her dismissal.Top Czech Prosecutor Quits, Citing Attacks From Justice MinisterThe prosecutors office has an internal two-month deadline to decide on whether to press charges, although that can be extended. A spokesman for Babis’s ANO party didn’t answer the phone when contacted for comments.Babis, whose wealth amounts to about $3.6 billion, according to Forbes, had for years enjoyed strong popularity among voters despite his legal tussles. But a stumbling approach to a resurgence in the coronavirus earlier this year, which led to the world’s second-highest death toll per capita, has since erased his wide lead in opinion polls.The minority government may face an opposition-led no-confidence motion as soon as June, but President Milos Zeman, Babis’s ally, has pledged to keep him in power until the October election. Zeman has also promised to pardon Babis if prosecutors charge him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-pm-babis-country-s-fourth-richest-man-faces-possible-fraud-charge-101622466822090.html

Prior to this, the UK had not surpassed that number since April 12.Gupta also called on Prime Minister Johnson to delay the planned June 21 reopening of the country by “a few weeks”.The UK's overall Covid-19 caseload and death toll currently stood at 4,499,939 and 128,043, respectively.Prof Gupta said the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least three-quarters of cases were the new variant first discovered in India."Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave," he said.However, he said the number of people who have been vaccinated in the UK meant this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones."There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."More than 38.8 million people, or more than 70 per cent of adults in Britain, have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest official figures.Gupta also said ending restrictions on June 21 should be delayed "by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"."If you look at the costs and benefits of getting it wrong, I think it is heavily in favour of delay, so I think that's the key thing," he added.Prof Adam Finn, another leading scientific adviser to the government, also urged caution over the June 21 date for easing restrictions.Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government could not rule out a delay to the planned lockdown easing.Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things "one step at a time"."We can't rule anything out. We know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before."It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on May 17."A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on June 14.Prof Tim Gowers, who is with the Mathematics department of Cambridge University, last week said that the UK's fight against coronavirus could turn bad "very, very quickly" unless the government acts cautiously on easing lockdown further.The B.1.617 strain could cause big problems if not taken care of properly, Gowers said.The B.1.617 variant cases doubled in a week in England to almost 7,000, prompting concerns that the government's lockdown roadmap will be derailed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-scientists-warns-uk-in-early-stages-of-third-wave-of-covid-19-urges-pm-johnson-to-delay-june-21-reopening-by-few-weeks-101622466508912.html
31-05-2021||World||EU executive urges reopening in summer to tourists immunised against Covid-19||The European Commission proposed on Monday that vaccinated people should be exempt from testing or quarantines when travelling from one EU country to another, and urged a gradual easing of travel measures as Covid-19 inoculations accelerate.The EU reached a deal earlier this month on Covid-19 certificates that will show, via a QR code, whether a person is vaccinated, immune based on recovery from infection or has had a recent negative test. The scheme should be ready by July 1.The European Union executive, which is seeking to end a current patchwork of travel measures across the bloc, said on Monday that testing or quarantines should not apply to people who have been fully vaccinated 14 days prior to travel.About half of EU adults have received a first vaccine dose.People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days. The Commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours.Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests.The Commission has also included an "emergency brake" to re-impose measures for travellers from areas where there is a surge of infections or many cases of a particular virus variant.Travel from "dark red" areas, with more than 150 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people over 14 days, would be "strongly discouraged", while for green areas, with fewer than 25 cases, no restrictions would apply, the Commission proposal said.Only Malta is currently green.The proposal, which will is being put to EU member states, is similar to that already agreed for travel from outside the bloc for vaccinated travellers and those coming from "safe" countries, although tests can still apply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-executive-urges-reopening-in-summer-to-tourists-immunised-against-covid19-101622465880002.html

"There's definitely no quick resolution for this."The waiver's main backers are due to present the new draft in Monday's private WTO meeting, where other key players such as the United States and the European Union are set to give their first official feedback on its contents.The meeting is critical because it will determine if the talks, ongoing since October, will advance to "text-based negotiations" as sought by director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.For an Explainer on the talks so far, see:Two key aspects of the waiver draft that may discourage reluctant countries are its expansive scope and the duration it would be in effect.While US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has previously said she is only focused on increasing vaccine access and equity, the scope of the new draft is much broader and includes not only vaccines but also diagnostics, therapeutics and medical devices among others."When you have a big bomb like the US saying we will support the waiver, people were expecting the revised proposal would narrow the scope," said a Geneva-based trade source.The new draft text also sets a time span for the temporary waiver of "at least three years" and gives the WTO's top-decision making body scope to determine its final termination date.But because of the need for the WTO's 164 members to agree by consensus, any one country could block a lifting of the waiver, creating what one delegate called a "forever waiver"."If the proponents insist on it (the duration), there will almost certainly be no consensus agreement on the waiver," said Peter Ungphakorn, a former WTO staff member who now writes blogs on trade.An EU diplomat told Reuters that the revised text "will likely call the US bluff". The European Union is set to present an alternative plan for boosting production and availability of Covid-19 vaccines to the WTO in early June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chances-of-patent-waiver-for-covid-19-vaccines-seen-as-remote-as-wto-talks-resume-101622461007520.html

Two asymptomatic cases were reported in the neighbouring city of Foshan,According to the SCMP, the Guangdong outbreak has been traced to a 75-year-old woman who had dined with friends at a restaurant in the Liwan district of Guangzhou.Local media has described the rate of spread as "alarming" as the Guangzhou city government is expanding its scope to launch viral screening to cover residents in several key districts and areas of concern.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in China to date stands at 91,099 with 4,636 deaths, according to the latest figures from the National Health Commission.On May 30, China reported 27 new cases of confirmed infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/travel-ban-restrictions-in-china-s-guangzhou-after-mini-covid-outbreak-101622459837948.html
31-05-2021||World||Democrats walk, stop Texas GOP's sweeping voting restrictions||Texas Democrats pulled off a dramatic, last-ditch walkout in the state House of Representatives on Sunday night to block passage of one of the most restrictive voting bills in the US, leaving Republicans with no choice but to abandon a midnight deadline and declare the legislative session essentially over.The revolt is one of Democrats' biggest protests to date against GOP efforts nationwide to impose stricter election laws, and they used the spotlight to urge President Joe Biden to act on voting rights.But the victory may be fleeting: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who had declared new voting laws a priority in Texas, quickly announced that he would order a special session to finish the job. He called the failure of the bill “deeply disappointing” but did not say when he would drag lawmakers back to work.“We’ve said for so many years that we want more people to participate in our democracy. And it just seems that’s not the case,” Democratic state Rep. Carl Sherman said.One by one, Democrats left the House chamber until there was no longer the 100-member quorum needed to pass Senate Bill 7, which would have reduced polling hours, empowered poll watchers and scaled back ways to vote in Texas, which already has some of the nation’s strictest voting laws.They gathered later outside a Black church, driving home their anger over a last-minute change to the Texas bill that would have prohibited Sunday voting before 1 p.m., when many Black worshippers go to the polls. Democrats said they did not go into the House vote intending to break quorum, but instead became fed-up after Republicans repeatedly refused to take their questions while racing to pass the bill.It was an stunning turnabout from just 24 hours earlier, when the bill seemed all but guaranteed to reach Abbott's desk. The Texas Senate had signed off before sunrise earlier Sunday after Republicans, who hold an 18-13 majority in the chamber, used a bare-knuckle procedural move to suspend the rules and take up the measure in the middle of the night.But as the day wore on in the House, the GOP's chances wobbled. State Rep. Chris Turner, the Democratic House leader, said he sent a text message to members of his caucus at 10:35 p.m. telling them to leave the chamber. But even by that point, the exodus had already been well underway.“We knew today, with the eyes of the nation watching actions in Austin, that we needed to send a message, and that message is very, very clear: Mr. President, we need a national response to federal voting rights,” Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said.Republicans showed restraint in criticizing Democrats for the move.“I am disappointed that some members decided to break quorum,” said Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who carried the bill in the House. “We all know what that meant. I understand why they were doing it, but we all took an oath to Texans that we would be here to do our jobs.”Texas is the last big battleground in Republicans’ campaign to tighten voting laws, driven by former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Georgia and Florida have also passed new voting restrictions, and Biden on Saturday had unfavorably compared Texas’ bill to election changes in those states as “an assault on democracy.”Under revisions during closed-door negotiations, Republicans added language to the 67-page measure that could have made it easier for a judge to overturn an election. The bill would have also eliminated drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling centers, both of which Harris County, the state’s largest Democratic stronghold, introduced last year.Major corporations joined the backlash, including Texas-based American Airlines and Dell, warning that the efforts could harm democracy and the economic climate. But Republicans shrugged off their objections, and in some cases, ripped business leaders for speaking out. By the time the Texas bill was poised to pass over the Memorial Day weekend, the opposition from businesses had grown faint.Since Trump’s defeat, at least 14 states have enacted more restrictive voting laws, according to the New York-based Brennan Center for Justice. It has also counted nearly 400 bills filed this year nationwide that would restrict voting.It was not the first time Texas Democrats — who have been out of power in the state Capitol for decades — have been able to block contentious legislation despite being outnumbered.They twice broke quorum in 2003 to stop Republican efforts to redraw voting maps, at one point leaving the state for Oklahoma. A decade later, former state Sen. Wendy Davis ran out the clock on a sweeping anti-abortion bill with a filibuster that lasted more than 11 hours, propelling her to a failed run for governor.But in each instance, Republicans ultimately prevailed.“We may have won the war tonight but the battle is not over,” Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier said. “We will continue to fight and speak out against those measures that attempt to silence our voices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-walk-stop-texas-gop-s-sweeping-voting-restrictions-101622459156323.html
31-05-2021||World||'We are one': After 100 years remembering, last survivors mark race massacre in Tulsa||Lessie Benningfield Randle, 106, can still remember a house engulfed in flames and the bodies stacked in truckbeds, one hundred years later."I was quite a little kid but I remember running and the soldiers were coming in," Randle said in an interview with Reuters as her hometown of Tulsa prepared to mark one of the darkest chapters in its history.Monday is the centenary of a massacre targeting Tulsa's prosperous African-American community in the district of Greenwood that bore the nickname "Black Wall Street."After a Black man was accused of assaulting a white woman, an allegation that was never proven, white rioters gunned down Blacks, looted homes and set fire to buildings block by block. More than 1,000 buildings were destroyed.An estimated 300 people were killed, thousands were left homeless and an entire community that had been seen as a symbol of what Black Americans could achieve was devastated."This was the Mecca. Tulsa's considerably what Atlanta is today," said Duke Durant, 30, a comedian, actor and Tulsa native, referring to one of the US cities noted for its large, thriving Black community.Events related to the massacre commemoration began ahead of the anniversary.Friday's Black Wall Street Legacy Festival included a parade led by Randle and two other centenarian survivors, Viola Fletcher and Hughes Van Ellis. The three were joined by community organizations and about 450 students from George Washington Carver Middle School, where the parade began.At the parade's start, members of the African Ancestral Society surrounded a horse-drawn carriage holding the three survivors and sang blessings, before marchers headed past tidy homes toward the heart of Greenwood."We are one," Van Ellis, 100, said from inside the carriage.The commemoration is slated to include a visit by President Joe Biden on Tuesday and the unveiling of the $20 million Greenwood Rising museum.The museum, which is devoted to telling the story of Greenwood, will not be completed in time for the centennial but there will be a "limited preview," a Tulsa commission formed to commemorate the anniversary said on its website.An event scheduled for Monday that was to feature a performance by award-winning musician John Legend and a speech by politician and activist Stacey Abrams was canceled following a dispute with lawyers for the three survivors, organizers said.Organizers said they hoped to reschedule. A candlelight vigil is among the commemoration events still to take place Monday.This year's attention is a departure from the past. For decades, newspapers rarely mentioned the events of May 31 and June 1, 1921. The state's historians largely ignored the massacre and children did not learn about it in school, according to a 2001 report written by a commission created by the state legislature.Tulsans attribute the silence to a number of factors. Black Tulsans were traumatized, feared it could happen again and did not want to pass on the information to their children, while white Tulsans would not have wanted to believe respected members of their community participated, according to Phil Armstrong, the project director of the centennial commission, and Michelle Place, executive director of the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.Place said the 2001 report was written before it was too late."Many of those survivors of the race massacre were dying or had died so it was an effort to tell their stories and to remember that part of our history and not let it go to the grave, if you will," Place said.The history is also recorded in court records. Randle described the bodies and burning house she saw in a deposition in a lawsuit filed in February by survivors and descendants seeking justice for victims. Calls for reparations have long gone unanswered.Greg Robinson, 31, a community activist and 2020 mayoral candidate, said he was pleased with the increased attention on Tulsa during the anniversary, but added that more work needed to be done to repair the damage."I'm glad to see people from across the country coming to understand the story of Greenwood," he said. "But make no mistake about it, we have a very clear message that until justice is done, we have work to do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-100-years-remembering-last-survivors-mark-race-massacre-in-tulsa-101622458985992.html
31-05-2021||World||Denmark helped US spy on European politicians, claims report; Snowden says Biden was 'deeply involved'||The National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States used a partnership with Denmark's foreign intelligence unit to spy on senior officials of many countries, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Danish state broadcaster DR said.The report cited an investigation between 2012 and 2014, and quoted inputs from nine people aware of the development.After the report surfaced, former NSA employee Edward Snowden posted a cryptic tweet in Danish language. "If only there had been some reason to investigate many years ago. Oh why didn't anyone warn us?" he said in the tweet.Snowden also said that US President Joe Biden is well-prepared to answer for this. "Biden is well-prepared to answer for this when he soon visits Europe since, of course, he was deeply involved in this scandal the first time around. There should be an explicit requirement for full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well," the whistleblower said in a subsequent tweet.Biden is well-prepared to answer for this when he soon visits Europe since, of course, he was deeply involved in this scandal the first time around.There should be an explicit requirement for full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well. https://t.co/TJL7gr6dy8The internal investigation in the Danish Defence Intelligence Service was launched in 2014 following concerns about former Snowden's leaks the previous year revealing how the NSA works, according to DR.Snowden fled the United States after leaking secret NSA files in 2013 and was given asylum in Russia.Denmark, a close ally of the United States, hosts several key landing stations for sub-sea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, Holland and Britain.Through targeted retrievals and the use of NSA-developed analysis software known as Xkeyscore, NSA intercepted both calls, texts and chat messages to and from telephones of officials in the neighbouring countries, according to DR report.Danish Defence Minister Trine Bramsen declined to comment on "speculation" about intelligence matters in the media."I can more generally say that this government has the same attitude as the former Prime Minister expressed in 2013 and 2014 - systematic wiretapping of close allies is unacceptable," Bramsen told Reuters in a statement.Denmark said last year it would initiate an investigation into the case based on information from a whistleblower report. That investigation is expected to be concluded later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-helped-us-spy-on-european-politicians-claims-report-101622457609460.html
31-05-2021||World||Hong Kong to ease Covid-19 quarantine norms for vaccinated business executives||Hong Kong is allowing vaccinated directors and senior executives of major listed companies to travel globally more easily, a significant relaxation of its onerous border curbs that’s drawing backlash from the wider population for being elitist.Vaccinated senior executives from about 500 companies included in indexes like the Hang Seng and Hang Seng China Enterprises can seek permission to travel in and out of the city without needing to follow the current quarantine requirement, Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said in a statement Monday.The clarification of a wider policy of exemption for vaccinated executives comes in the wake of a Friday announcement that some vaccinated senior bankers can skip quarantine. However, the move is likely to deepen public ire over the special treatment, as Hong Kong’s traveler quarantine requirements are some of the strictest in the world and require people to pay for hotel room stays -- the supply of which is rapidly drying up for the summer months.The current rules stipulate that everyone arriving in Hong Kong from outside China must isolate in a hotel for up to 21 days. Pressure is building on the government to drastically relax quarantine and other social restrictions for vaccinated people as incentives to re-open borders and to boost Hong Kong’s low vaccination rate.Senior Bankers Can Now Skip Hong Kong’s Three-Week Quarantine“It’s a step in the right direction. Is that enough? We believe it is by far not enough,” said Frederick Gollob, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. “With the combination of vaccination and ongoing testing, the Hong Kong government should further, on a broader scale, reduce the quarantine requirement on the way to reopening the city.”‘Back to Normal’The latest quarantine exemption is available to other firms from financial industries like banking, mobile payments, insurance, securities and futures intermediaries. Companies are allowed a limited quota of exemptions and the government will review applications based on criteria like where the executive is traveling from. The executives must undergo testing and are required to stick to pre-approved itineraries.An earlier version of the quarantine exemption policy has existed since last year for executives coming from mainland China. Singapore, Asia’s other major financial hub, does not grant exemptions from travel quarantine for business executives.Banks lauded the new announcement.“We welcome the new measure providing more convenience to vaccinated senior executives when traveling to Hong Kong. This helps encourage resumption of necessary business travel and brings business activities gradually back to normal, which is particularly important to Hong Kong as an international financial center,” said a Standard Chartered Plc spokeswoman in a statement.HSBC Holdings Plc said in a statement, “While the pandemic has showed how much could be accomplished virtually, a measured approach to facilitate business travels to and from Hong Kong could help stimulate more economic activities across a range of sectors.Even within the business community however, some think that the exemptions are not being rolled out widely enough. The American Chamber of Commerce, for example, said that the exemption should be “extended across sectors.”“All businesses have suffered, and all are keen to get safely back on the road again,” said the chamber’s president Tara Joseph in a statement.However, the government has not signaled that it plans to significantly relax social-distancing rules for vaccinated people, such as mandatory outdoor masking, citing the low vaccination uptake. Some medical experts also continue to recommend social restriction remain in place in order to prevent another wave of Covid-19, particularly as the vaccination rate is low, though local infection numbers have hovered at or near zero for weeks.Public AngerSome critics argue, however, that it’s precisely the lack of privileges for vaccinated people that is keeping the inoculation rate depressed -- just 13.4% of Hong Kong’s population of 7.5 million has been fully inoculated, according to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker, far behind other finance centers like London and Singapore.Chief Executive Carrie Lam separately announced on the same day a new campaign to boost the city’s slow inoculation rate by September, with measures such as paid leave for vaccinated civil servants and possible additional restrictions for unvaccinated citizens. The government said it aims to announce further relaxations of rules for vaccinated people by June 10.Now that the door has been open for quarantine exemption for some vaccinated people, the policy should be expanded to all fully inoculated people, said Ben Cowling, Professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong.Exemption is “an evidence-based measure given that vaccinated people are substantially less likely to be infected. Such a measure could also encourage greater vaccination uptake,” he said.The government has instead been leaning on businesses and institutions to encourage injections.Hong Kong Turns to Businesses to Fix Foundering Vaccine PushStill, the special treatment meted out to a small elite of executives is likely to further stoke public anger, already at high levels following more than a year of strict social restrictions and quarantine policies that have seen thousands forced from their homes to isolate in government-run camps. The continuing quarantine policies for travelers also means that as vaccinated people in the U.S. and European countries plan their summer travel, almost no one will be able to travel into Hong Kong without shouldering the prohibitive time and cost of quarantine.Ally, a Hong Kong citizen who currently lives in Canada, said she’s extremely upset that “as long as you are rich and powerful” you can skip the requirements that most people must observe. Ally, who asked that only her English name be used, said she has been unable to return to Hong Kong after her father died last year. A single mother, she can’t afford the cost of a 21-day quarantine, which would require her to be away from work without pay.“You can imagine how infuriating it is that someone else is exempt because of money and I have lost my only remaining parent,” she said.The issue isn’t just the time and cost of quarantine.As the length of hotel isolation for those traveling from some countries, including the U.S., has dropped to two weeks for vaccinated people, demand for rooms has skyrocketed. Numerous accommodations, especially those at lower price points, are fully booked through the end of the current quarantine period, which runs until June 19.The Food and Health Bureau said Monday that the supply of rooms would be increased from the current 8,300 to 10,000. Some hotels will open up more rooms for booking, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-ease-covid-19-norms-quarantine-for-vaccinated-business-executives-101622452436771.html

The KDCA reported 430 new coronavirus cases as of Sunday, for a total of 140,340 cases with 1,959 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-first-case-of-blood-clot-linked-to-astrazeneca-s-covid-vaccine-101622451354245.html

But now, even those without underlying medical conditions will be able to get their jab upon receiving the voucher next month."if we wait until everyone (with underlying conditions) has been vaccinated, we don't know when it will be completed," health, labour and welfare minister Norihisa Tamura said on a program aired by public broadcaster NHK World.Those who qualify to receive priority vaccinations will need to report to municipalities independently, as the government has no data available as to exactly how many people are eligible.Kyodo News reported that Japan's vaccination programme was launched in February for front-line health workers and expanded to those 65 and older in April. The government planned to vaccinate those with underlying conditions, those working for nursing homes and finally, the general public after finishing vaccinating the elderly by July 31.But the government is looking to speed up the country's vaccine rollout, which has lagged behind other countries, with just six per cent of its population having received at least one dose.With the medical system remaining strained, the Covid-19 state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and seven other prefectures was extended on Friday by three weeks to June 20, just over a month before the Olympics begin in the capital.Large-scale Covid-19 vaccination centers run by Self-Defense Forces personnel have begin their full-scale operations from today, a week after opening.The centers, which currently target those 65 and older, are available to about 9 million people in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area and about 4.7 million people in the three western Japanese prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo.The Covid-19 state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and seven other prefectures was extended on May 28 by three weeks to June 20 -- just over a month before the Olympics begin in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-japan-to-vaccinate-all-citizens-below-65-years-says-health-minister-101622450814849.html
31-05-2021||World||Chinese couples can now have three children||China on Monday relaxed its family planning policy allowing couples to have three children.For the majority of Chinese couples, it will be the first time that they will be legally allowed to have three children.During the period when China strictly implemented the one-child policy - from the late 1970s to 2016 - only couples from minority ethnicities were allowed more than one child.The decision to allow three children every family is a response to China’s deepening ageing problem and aims to improve the country’s population structure in the future.It was taken at a meeting of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) Central Committee’s powerful Politburo, chaired by President and party general secretary, Xi Jinping, on Monday.According to state media reports, the meeting decided that it was necessary to allow couples to have three children to help improve China’s population structure, implement the strategy to actively respond to an ageing population and maintain the country’s population dividend.It was emphasised at the meeting that party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen planning and policy coordination to implement the three-child-birth policy in accordance with the law, state media reports said.Authorities at all levels should promote the coordination of birth policies and related economic and social policies and improve the population impact assessment mechanism of major economic and social policies.The decision was implemented five years after Beijing implemented the two-child policy in 2016 - which, according to experts, did not have the desired effect to counter the problem of China’s ageing society.China had introduced a strict one-child policy for the majority of its citizens in the late 1970s to keep its population under check.Instead in the following four decades, it led to an ageing society and an impending economic burden.The latest census data made public earlier in May had revealed that China’s population is growing at its most sluggish pace in decades, with the country adding only 72 million in the past decade.The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, down from a rate of 0.57% between 2000 and 2010 - bringing the population to 1.41bn.The total population figure on the mainland stood at 1.41178 billion on November 1, 2020.The rate is the slowest since 1953 when the first census was carried out.The slump in population growth rate - despite Beijing withdrawing the one-child policy in 2016 - will add pressure on Beijing to incentivise child-bearing as the most populous country deals with a rapidly ageing population and the added economic burden.The census result showed that China’s “…population is not just declining but also its demographic structure is deteriorating with a growing ageing population, will serve as an important reference for China’s population and economic policy adjustment as well as plans to put off retirement, which may come in the next year or two”, a state media report said on the census data..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-couples-can-now-have-three-children-101622449608604.html
31-05-2021||World||China allows couples to have 3 children, up from 2: Report||China has relaxed its family planning policy to allow couples to have a maximum of three children after a census showed its population is rapidly ageing, state media Xinhua reported Monday.For almost 40 years, China enforced a controversial "one-child policy" -- one of the strictest family planning regulations worldwide -- which was lifted in 2016 due to widespread concerns over an ageing workforce and economic stagnation."To actively respond to the ageing of the population ... a couple can have three children," Xinhua said, citing a Monday meeting of China's elite Politburo leadership committee hosted by President Xi Jinping.Despite government efforts to encourage childbirths, China's annual births have continued to plummet to a record low of 12 million in 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics said last month.China's fertility rate stands at 1.3 -- below the level needed to maintain a stable population, the bureau revealed.The once-in-a-decade 2020 census results published last month also showed that China's population grew at its slowest rate since the 1960s, reaching 1.41 billion.It comes alongside a sharp drop in the number of working-age people, once again raising fears of a looming demographic crisis.China's gender balance has also been skewed by decades of the one-child policy, and a traditional social preference for boys which prompted a generation of sex-selective abortions and abandoned baby girls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-allows-couples-to-have-three-children-report-101622447548980.html
31-05-2021||World||China to send 3 male astronauts for 3-month stay in its new space station||China on Monday announced plans to send three male astronauts to its space station next month for a three-month stay, a day after the successful docking of a cargo spacecraft with it, hoping to achieve yet another milestone in its ambitious space programme.The country launched cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-2 on Saturday, carrying supplies, equipment and propellant which had successfully docked with the space station core module Tianhe, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).Combined with Tianhe, Tianzhou-2 will replenish Tianhe's propellant, it said.China, which launched its space station core module Tianhe on April 29, now plans to complete the verification of key technologies and the in-orbit construction of the space station through multiple launches within two years, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Yang Liwei, director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office and the country's first astronaut, said that the three astronauts are getting ready to travel by manned spacecraft Shenzhou-12 in June to dock with Tianhe and stay there for three months.Yang, who went into space in the Shenzhou-5 craft on October 15, 2003, told the state-run China Central Television (CCTV) during the weekend that the three astronauts of the Shenzhou-12 mission will stay in space for three months, during which they will conduct tasks, including repair and maintenance, appliance switch and scientific tasks.The three astronauts, who will take the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft to the space station core cabin in June, are now under Level-2 quarantine, with all related work having entered a final sprint stage, according to a report by the state-run Global Times.Although there will not be any female astronauts in the upcoming Shenzhou-12 crewed mission, they will basically participate in every following flight mission, Yang said.The three astronauts will take on command and engineering roles, he said.With the successful launch of the Tianzhou-2 cargo ship, China has completed its first two launch missions out of the total 11 of the intensive space station construction phase, scheduled from April 29, 2021 to 2022.Three will be for modules, four for cargo spaceships and four for manned spaceships, the report said.Four flight crews have been selected from the first and second batch of astronauts for the four Shenzhou missions. Astronauts will conduct multiple tasks outside the cabin, carrying out repair and maintenance on the spacecraft, and other construction missions, Yang said."Astronauts coming out of the cabin will become a new routine, and the duration of such activities will be greatly expanded," he said.China's space station has also been equipped with the robotic arm over which the US has raised concerns for its possible military applications.The arm can be stretched to 15 meters long, which will also play a vital role in building the space station in orbit, Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space engineering project, said previously.Astronauts will team up with the robotic arm to make in-orbit space station construction and maintenance possible, Yang noted.China in the past has launched several scavenger satellites fitted with robotic arms to gather and steer space debris so it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere.James Dickinson, commander of the US Space Command, told a congressional hearing last month that the technology “could be used in a future system for grappling other satellites” and was therefore a concern to the US military, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.The Chinese space station was expected to be a competitor to the aging International Space Station (ISS) which is a modular space station in low Earth orbit.It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies, including America’s NASA, Russia’s Roscomos, Japan’s JAXA, ESA of Europe and CSA of Canada. China's Tiangong is expected to be the sole space station once the ISS retires.A major space power, China launched its first Mars probe last year. The Chinese rover is currently exploring the red planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-3-male-astronauts-for-3-month-stay-in-its-new-space-station-101622443019941.html

He said efforts also were focused on examining a half mile-wide debris field in the lake.County officials identified the victims in a news release late Saturday as Brandon Hannah, Gwen S Lara, William J Lara, David L. Martin, Jennifer J Martin, Jessica Walters and Jonathan Walters, all of Brentwood, Tennessee. Their names were released after family members had been notified.Gwen Shamblin Lara founded the Remnant Fellowship Church in Brentwood in 1999 and wrote a faith-based weight loss book. Her husband of nearly three years, known as Joe Lara, was an actor featured in the TV series “Tarzan: The Epic Adventures.”The Federal Aviation Administration said the Cessna C501 plane was heading from nearby Smyrna Rutherford County Airport to Palm Beach International Airport when it crashed Saturday morning. Authorities did not release registration information for the plane.Smyrna is located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Nashville. Percy Priest Lake is a reservoir created by the J. Percy Priest Dam. It is a popular spot for boating and fishing.“With dive teams in the water, we are strongly urging civilian boaters to stay away from the public safety boats,” Ingle said.The National Transportation Safety Board had a lead investigator at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tarzan-actor-joe-lara-wife-among-7-plane-crash-victims-in-tennessee-101622438832943.html
31-05-2021||World||Australia's Victoria Covid-19 outbreak grows to 51, next few days 'critical'||Australia's second most populous state of Victoria, the epicentre of the country's latest coronavirus hotspot, reported 11 new cases of community transmission on Monday, taking the current cluster to 51.Victoria went into a strict seven-day lockdown on Friday after new Covid-19 infections in the state capital Melbourne ended its three-month run of zero community cases.The state reported five new cases in the 24 hours to midnight. At a press conference in Melbourne on Monday, authorities announced a further six cases were recorded after the late night cut-off which will reflect in Tuesday's data.The swelling numbers have raised questions over whether the lockdown will be extended beyond the seven days announced initially."The challenge ahead of us is a very, very significant one," Victorian acting Premier James Merlino told reporters. "We are seeing a small number of cases infecting a large number of contacts."The situation was "incredibly serious" and the next few days will be critical, Merlino added."I want to be really clear with everyone that this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better."Medical officials have said the latest Covid-19 variant, first detected in India, was likely to be more virulent than the original strains, taking just one day to infect another person compared with earlier strains which can take about five or six.Authorities are also concerned about the prospect of a larger outbreak in aged care homes after two workers and one resident at the Arcare facility in Melbourne tested positive, the home operator said in a statement.Hundreds of elderly Victorians in residential aged care facilities died of Covid-19 last year.Victoria endured one of the world's strictest and longest lockdowns last year to suppress a second wave of Covid-19 that killed more than 800 people in the state, accounting for 90% of Australia's total deaths since the pandemic began.Swift contact tracing, snap lockdowns and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low, with 22,275 local cases and 910 deaths. The country has ranked among the top 10 in a Covid-19 performance index for its successful handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-covid-19-outbreak-grows-to-51-next-few-days-critical-101622436725569.html
31-05-2021||World||Vietnam to test 9 million residents after hybrid variant from UK, India strain found||Vietnam plans to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and imposed more restrictions Monday to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak.People in Ho Chi Minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, the government announced. Prior to the order, the city, also Vietnam's economic hub, shut down non-essential business last Thursday when cases started to increase.State newspaper Vietnam News said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 100,000 samples a day.The newspaper also said police had filed a case Sunday against the head of a Protestant church mission for “spreading dangerous infectious diseases” citing poor health protocols applied at the premises.At least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the church, and Go Vap district, where the church is based, has been locked down. Vietnam has since ordered a nationwide ban on all religious events.The newspaper said church followers gathered in small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing.Since the end of April, a surge in Covid-19 has spread to 31 municipalities and provinces in Vietnam with over 4,000 cases, almost double the total number that the country reported since the beginning of the pandemic.Some recent patients in Vietnam were infected with a hybrid of the virus variants first found in India and the UK, the health minister said Saturday. Nguyen Thanh Long said the hybrid might spread more easily and could be responsible for Vietnam's recent surge.Viruses often develop small genetic changes as they reproduce, and new variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China in late 2019. The World Health Organization categorized the UK. and the Indian variants, along with two others first found in South Africa and Brazil, as “variants of concern” because they appear to be more contagious.Vietnam has vaccinated 1 million people with AstraZeneca shots. It has a deal with Pfizer for 30 million doses to be delivered later this year. It is also in talks with Moderna that would give it enough shots to fully vaccinate 80% of its 96 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-to-test-9-million-after-hybrid-variant-from-uk-india-strain-found-101622434875884.html

The pair have until Wednesday to complete a deal in which they are expected to each serve two years as prime minister in a rotation deal.“It’s my intention to do my utmost in order to form a national unity government along with my friend Yair Lapid, so that, god willing, together we can save the country from a tailspin,” Bennett said.A unity government would end the cycle of deadlock that has plunged the country into four elections over the past two years. It also would end the record-setting tenure of Netanyahu, the most dominant figure in Israeli politics over the past three decades.In another development, Israeli and Egyptian officials held talks in both countries on Sunday aimed at bolstering the ceasefire that ended the latest round of violence between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-nears-deal-to-oust-bibi-101622429148683.html

31-05-2021||World||Covid-19 origin: 'Wuhan lab was engaged in military activity...' says Pompeo||Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was engaged in military activity alongside its civilian research -- amid renewed scrutiny of the theory that the Covid-19 pandemic emerged from the secretive lab."What I can say for sure is this: we know that they were engaged in efforts connected to the People's Liberation Army inside of that laboratory, so military activity being performed alongside what they claimed was just good old civilian research," Pompeo said, as per Fox News.Also Read: Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsHe further mentioned: "They refuse to tell us what it was, they refuse to describe the nature of either of those, they refused to allow access to the World Health Organization when it tried to get in there."China is coming under increasing pressure over probe into the origins of the Covid-19, even as scientists are demanding more clarity to go into the roots of the global pandemic.Sky News Australia host Andrew Bolt on May 26 spoke to Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, Director of Endocrinology at Flinders Medical Centre, who said that the world's scientific community had been "tricked by China", reported New York Times Post.Andrew Bolt said on his show The Bolt Report: "Finally a lot of experts are now saying well actually it does now look like this virus maybe did escape from that Chinese lab and China is feeling the heat."Professor Petrovsky told him that although some Chinese scientists have suggested that Covid-19 originated from pangolins, this is unlikely to be the case, reported New York Times Post.WHO team investigating the origins of Covid-19 in China found no evidence that the virus leaked from the Wuhan lab.However, the team was closely monitored by Chinese authorities during its investigation, and one of its members told UK news agency news that China refused to hand over key data from the initial outbreak, reported New York Times Post.This week, the Biden administration pushed China for a further probe into a possible leak from the Wuhan lab. However, China state media rejected the idea that Covid-19 had originated there and said that it is "a conspiracy created by US intelligence agencies", reported New York Times Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-wuhan-lab-was-engaged-in-military-activity-says-pompeo-101622420358112.html
31-05-2021||World||Israel, Egypt hold high level talks on truce with Hamas, rebuilding Gaza Strip||Egypt and Israel held high-level talks in both countries Sunday to shore up a fragile truce between Israel and the Hamas militant group and rebuild the Gaza Strip after a punishing 11-day war that left parts of the seaside enclave in ruins.Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry received his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in Cairo. The meeting is part of an effort to build on an Israel-Hamas cease-fire reached May 21 and to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which have been dormant for more than a decade, Shukry's office said. Egypt has not said how it would be able to restart talks.The hours-long visit was the first public one by an Israeli foreign minister to Egypt since 2008, according to the Israeli Embassy in Cairo.Spokesman Ahmed Hafez said Shukry called for establishing an atmosphere to relaunch “serious and constructive” negotiations between the two sides. He also urged both sides to refrain from “any measures” that could hamper efforts to revive peace talks.They also discussed the release of Israeli soldiers and citizens being held by Hamas, Israel's top diplomat said."We all need to act to prevent strengthening extremist elements that threaten regional stability, and to ensure the return home of the missing persons and prisoners held by Hamas," Ashkenazi said.He also criticized the Palestinian Authority over its moves at the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Human Rights Council, saying such activity damages the chances of future cooperation.Ashkenazi alleged that Palestinian war crimes complaints against Israel —filed over its military conduct since a 2014 war with Hamas and ongoing settlement construction — are an obstacle to political dialogue. The ICC is investigating both Israel and Hamas for possible war crimes. Hamas is under investigation for random rocket fire toward Israeli communities.Despite cease-fire talks, Hamas and the smaller militant group Islamic Jihad have staged weapons parades in a show of force. On Sunday, thousands attended a Hamas rally in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, where masked militants displayed rockets, launchers and drones.Hamas is holding the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in a 2014 war. It also is holding two Israeli civilians who were captured after entering Gaza.As part of the cease-fire efforts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosted Abbas Kamel, Egypt's intelligence chief, in Jerusalem. Netanyahu said he had raised the issue of returning the remains of soldiers and the two civilians as well as Israeli demands to prevent Hamas from gaining strength or diverting resources meant for the civilian population.An Egyptian official said Kamel would also meet with Palestinian officials in the West Bank before heading to Gaza for talks with Hamas leaders. The intelligence agency, which is Egypt’s equivalent of the CIA, usually handles Egypt's ties with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza.Egypt's state-run MENA news agency said Kamel would convey a message from el-Sissi to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, affirming “Egypt's full support to the Palestinian people.”It said Cairo would host talks among Palestinian factions to achieve unity between those in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied areas of the West Bank. The report did not provide further details.During a visit to the region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was seeking to bolster Abbas and weaken Hamas as part of the cease-fire efforts.Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas' forces in 2007, leaving the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in charge of administering autonomous zones in some 40% of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas, which refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, is branded a terrorist group by Israel, the U.S. and other Western countries.Discussions with Israeli officials have touched on a set of measures that would allow materials, electricity and fuel into the territory, as well as the possible expansion of maritime space allowed for Gaza fishermen, the Egyptian official said.“The role of the Palestinian Authority is central in the talks,” he said. “Egypt is seeking to have it deeply involved in the reconstruction process.”The Egyptian official, who had close knowledge of the proceedings that led to the cease-fire, spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t allowed to brief reporters.The 11-day war killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused heavy destruction in the impoverished coastal territory. Preliminary estimates have put the damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Egypt was key in mediating a deal between the two sides.The official said Egypt has offered guarantees that rebuilding funds will not find its way to Hamas, possibly going through an international committee led by Egypt or the United Nations that would oversee the spending.Kamel has also discussed the situation in Jerusalem and ways to ease tensions in the holy city. That would include understandings at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, where Israeli police repeatedly clashed with Palestinian demonstrators, and how to prevent the planned eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem, the official said.Egypt last week invited Israel, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority for separate talks in Cairo to consolidate the Cairo-mediated cease-fire and accelerate the reconstruction process in Gaza.Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is expected to visit Cairo this week, according to the group's spokesman Abdelatif al-Qanou, who also said Hamas is open to discussing a prisoner swap with Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-egypt-hold-high-level-talks-on-truce-with-hamas-rebuilding-gaza-strip-101622419863562.html

In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also signaled the ethical issues posed by Covid-19 vaccine certification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vaccine-passport-plans-to-be-scrapped-report-101622419382895.html
31-05-2021||World||Coalition govt 'danger' for Israel's security: Netanyahu as rivals attempt to join forces||A former ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he would seek to form a coalition government with the Israeli leader's opponents, taking a major step toward ending the rule of the longtime premier.The dramatic announcement by Naftali Bennett, leader of the small hardline Yamina party, set the stage for a series of steps that could push Netanyahu and his dominant Likud party into the opposition in the coming week.While Bennett and his new partners, headed by opposition leader Yair Lapid, still face some obstacles, the sides appeared to be serious about reaching a deal and ending the deadlock that has plunged the country into four elections in the past two years.“It’s my intention to do my utmost in order to form a national unity government along with my friend Yair Lapid, so that, God willing, together we can save the country from a tailspin and return Israel to its course,” Bennett said.The pair have until Wednesday to complete a deal in which each is expected to serve two years as prime minister in a rotation deal, with Bennett holding the job first. Lapid's Yesh Atid party said negotiating teams were to meet later Sunday.Bennett, a former top aide to Netanyahu who has held senior Cabinet posts, shares the prime minister's hard-line ideology. He is a former leader of the West Bank settlement movement and heads a small party whose base includes religious and nationalist Jews. Yet he has had a strained and complicated relationship with his one-time mentor due to personal differences.Bennett said there was no feasible way after the deadlocked March 23 election to form a right-wing government favored by Netanyahu. He said another election would yield the same results and said it was time to end the cycle.“A government like this will succeed only if we work together as a group,” he said. He said everyone “will need to postpone fulfilling part of their dreams. We will focus on what can be done, instead of fighting all day on what’s impossible.”If Bennett and Lapid and their other partners can wrap up a deal, it would end, at least for the time being, the record-setting tenure of Netanyahu, the most dominant figure in Israeli politics over the past three decades. Netanyahu has served as prime minister for the past 12 years and also held an earlier term in the late 1990s.In his own televised statement, Netanyahu accused Bennett of betraying the Israeli right wing and urged nationalist politicians not to join what he called a “leftist government.”“A government like this is a danger to the security of Israel, and is also a danger to the future of the state,” he said.Despite his electoral dominance, Netanyahu has become a polarizing figure since he was indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in late 2019. Each of the past four elections was seen as a referendum on Netanyahu's fitness to rule, and each ended in deadlock.Netanyahu is desperate to stay in power while he is on trial. He has used his office as a stage to rally his base and lash out against police, prosecutors and the media.In order to form a government, a party leader must secure the support of a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament. Because no single party controls a majority on its own, coalitions are usually built with smaller partners. Thirteen parties of various sizes are in the current parliament.As leader of the largest party, Netanyahu was given the first opportunity by the country’s figurehead president to form a coalition. But he was unable to secure a majority with his traditional religious and nationalist allies.Netanyahu even attempted to court a small Islamist Arab party but was thwarted by a small ultranationalist party with a racist anti-Arab agenda. Although Arabs make up some 20% of Israel’s population, an Arab party has never before sat in an Israeli coalition government.After Netanyahu’s failure to form a government, Lapid was then given four weeks to cobble together a coalition. He has until Wednesday to complete the task.While Bennett's Yamina party controls just seven seats in parliament, he has emerged as a kingmaker of sorts by providing the necessary support to secure a majority. If he is successful, his party would be the smallest to lead an Israeli government.Lapid already faced a difficult challenge, given the broad range of parties in the anti-Netanyahu bloc that have little in common. They include dovish left-wing parties, a pair of right-wing nationalist parties, including Bennett’s Yamina, and most likely the Islamist United Arab List.Lapid’s task was made even more difficult after war broke out with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip on May 10. His coalition talks were put on hold during the 11 days of fighting.But with Wednesday’s deadline looming, negotiations have kicked into high gear. Lapid has reached coalition deals with three other parties so far. If he finalizes a deal with Bennett, the remaining partners are expected to quickly fall into place.They would then have roughly one week to present their coalition to parliament for a formal vote of confidence allowing it to take office.Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said Netanyahu will try to undermine those efforts until the end.Netanyahu’s main strategy, he said, would be to try to appeal to hard-liners in both Bennett’s party and New Hope, another hard-line party led by a former Netanyahu confidant, to withdraw their support for the new coalition. A defection of just one or two lawmakers could prevent Lapid from mustering a majority and force another election.“Anything might happen,” Plesner said. “I would wait for the final vote to go through.”Even if Lapid and Bennett manage to put together a government, Netanyahu is unlikely to disappear, Plesner said.Netanyahu could remain as opposition leader, working to exploit the deep ideological differences among his opponents to cause the coalition to fracture.“History teaches us it would be unwise to write him off," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coalition-govt-danger-for-israel-s-security-netanyahu-as-rivals-attempt-to-join-forces-101622414389980.html
31-05-2021||World||Texas GOP's strict voting bill on the verge of final vote||The Texas Legislature was on the verge Sunday of signing off on some of the most restrictive voting measures in the U.S., putting the GOP on the brink of a major victory in their nationwide effort to tighten voting access following the 2020 election.A vote in the state House expected later Sunday is the last barrier to sending Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a raft of election changes that would eliminate drive-thru voting, empower partisan poll watchers and impose new requirements in order to cast a ballot by mail in Texas, which already has some of toughest voting laws in the nation.Democrats dug in for one last and longshot challenge on the House floor but had little means of stopping the bill. Hours earlier on Sunday, the Texas Senate muscled the bill through shortly after sunrise after bringing it up for a vote in the middle of the night on a Memorial Day weekend, when the state Capitol was all but empty.Even before the final House vote, Democrats said they would try to block the measure in court.“It's an awful bill," said Democratic state Rep. Jessica Gonzalez, the vice chairwoman of the House Elections Committee. ”But I'm hopeful that this underhanded behavior, the way they undercut the process, will help us when we litigate this."Under revisions during closed-door negotiations, Republicans added language that could make it easier for a judge to overturn an election and pushed back the start of Sunday voting, when many Black churchgoers head to the polls. The 67-page measure would also eliminate drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling centers, both of which Harris County, the state’s largest Democratic stronghold, introduced last year.Texas is the last big battleground in the GOP's nationwide efforts to tighten voting laws, driven by former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Georgia and Florida have also passed new voting restrictions, and President Joe Biden on Saturday unfavorably compared Texas' bill to election changes in those states as “an assault on democracy.”The vote in the Texas Senate came just a short time after a final version of the bill had been made public Saturday. Around midnight, Republicans wielded their majority to suspend rules that would normally prohibit taking a vote on a bill that had not been posted for 24 hours, which Democrats protested as a breach of protocol that denied them and the public time to review the language first.The bill would newly empower partisan poll watchers by allowing them more access inside polling places and threatening criminal penalties against elections officials who restrict their movement. Republicans originally proposed giving poll watchers the right to take photos, but that language was removed from the final bill that lawmakers were set to vote on this weekend.Another new provision could also make it easier to overturn an election in Texas, allowing for a judge to void an outcome if the number of fraudulent votes cast could change the result, regardless of whether it was proved that fraud affected the outcome.Election officials would also face new criminal penalties, including felony charges for sending mail voting applications to people who did not request one. The Texas District and County Attorneys Association tweeted that it had counted in the bill at least 16 new, expanded or enhanced crimes related to elections.GOP legislators are also moving to prohibit Sunday voting before 1 p.m., which critics called an attack on what is commonly known as “souls to the polls” — a get-out-the-vote campaign used by Black church congregations nationwide. The idea traces back to the civil rights movement. Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier, chairwoman of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, said the change is “going to disengage, disenfranchise those who use the souls to the polls opportunity.”Pressed on the Senate floor over why Sunday voting couldn't begin sooner, Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes said, “Election workers want to go to church, too.”Collier was one of three Democrats picked to negotiate the final version, none of whom signed their name to it. She said she saw a draft of the bill around 11 p.m. Friday — which was different than one she had received earlier that day — and was asked for her signature the next morning.Major corporations, including Texas-based American Airlines and Dell, have warned that the measures could harm democracy and the economic climate. But Republicans shrugged off their objections, and in some cases, ripped business leaders for speaking out.Texas already has some of the country’s tightest voting restrictions and is regularly cited by nonpartisan groups as a state where it is especially hard to vote. It was one of the few states that did not make it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic.The top Republican negotiators, Hughes and state Rep. Briscoe Cain, called the bill “one of the most comprehensive and sensible election reform bills” in Texas’ history.“Even as the national media minimizes the importance of election integrity, the Texas Legislature has not bent to headlines or corporate virtue signaling,” they said in a joint statement.Since Trump’s defeat, at least 14 states have enacted more restrictive voting laws, according to the New York-based Brennan Center for Justice. It has also counted nearly 400 bills filed this year nationwide that would restrict voting.Republican lawmakers in Texas have insisted that the changes are not a response to Trump’s false claims of widespread fraud but are needed to restore confidence in the voting process. But doubts about the election’s outcome have been fanned by some of the state’s top GOP leaders, including Attorney General Ken Paxton, who led a failed lawsuit at the U.S. Supreme Court to try to overturn the election.Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who chaired Trump’s presidential campaign in Texas, offered a $1 million reward to anyone who could produce evidence of voter fraud. Nonpartisan investigations of previous elections have found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare. State officials from both parties, including in Texas, as well as international observers have also said the 2020 election went well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-gop-s-strict-voting-bill-on-the-verge-of-final-vote-101622410786572.html
31-05-2021||World||China feels Covid heat as study backs lab theory||Amid calls for a fresh probe into the origins of Covid-19, a new study has claimed that Chinese scientists created the virus in a laboratory in Wuhan and then tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering versions of the virus to make it look like it evolved naturally from bats.The virus has no “credible natural ancestor” and was created by Chinese scientists who were working on a gain-of-function research in a Wuhan lab, The Daily Mail reported on Sunday, citing a research paper compiled by British expert Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Birger Sorensen.Incidentally, gain-of-function projects, which involve tweaking natural viruses to make them more infectious, were banned in the US during the Obama years.The research claims scientists took a natural coronavirus “backbone” found in China’s cave bats and spliced onto it a new “spike”, turning it into the Covid-19 virus. The researchers also claim to have found “unique fingerprints” in Covid-19 samples that they say could have arisen from manipulation in a laboratory.The authors claim they had prima facie evidence of retro-engineering in China for a year. The study alleged “deliberate destruction, concealment or contamination of data” at Chinese labs. In the paper that is likely to be published in the journal Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, Dalgleish and Sorensen claim to have concluded how Chinese scientists built the tools to create the coronavirus.British intel believes lab theory ‘feasible’: ReportBritish intelligence agencies believe it is “feasible” that the pandemic began with a virus leak from the Chinese lab, The Sunday Times reported on Sunday, prompting vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi to demand that the World Health Organization must fully investigate the origins of the deadly virus.B.1.617 can hit easing of UK’s lockdown: ExpertThe B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 could become a big problem in the UK’s plans to ease lockdown restrictions, an academician with Cambridge University has warned. Tim Gowers told The Guardian on Saturday that the UK’s fight against the virus could turn bad “very, very quickly” unless the government acts cautiously on easing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-feels-covid-heat-as-study-backs-lab-theory-101622408382783.html
31-05-2021||World||UK PM Boris marries partner in secret ceremony||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has married his fiancée, Carrie Symonds, in a small private ceremony that came at the end of a tumultuous week during which a former top aide said he was unfit for office.The couple wed on Saturday at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral in front of a small group of friends and family, Johnson’s office said on Sunday, confirming newspaper reports that were published overnight.“The Prime Minister and Ms. Symonds were married yesterday afternoon in a small ceremony at Westminster Cathedral,’’ Downing Street said. “The couple will celebrate their wedding with family and friends next summer,” the statement said.The couple have reportedly sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for a celebration on July 30, 2022. Under current coronavirus restrictions in England, no more than 30 people can attend a wedding.Johnson, 56, and Symonds, a 33-year-old Conservative Party insider and environmental advocate, announced their engagement in February 2020. Their son, Wilfred, was born in April last year.The marriage is Johnson’s third. He has at least five other children from previous relationships.Johnson’s previous marriages would not have stopped him from having a Catholic wedding because they didn’t take place in the Catholic church, Matt Chinery, an ecclesiastical and canon lawyer, told Times Radio.The wedding followed a difficult political week for Johnson. His former top aide, Dominic Cummings, told lawmakers that Johnson had bungled the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and said he was “unfit for the job”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-marries-partner-in-secret-ceremony-101622406975645.html
