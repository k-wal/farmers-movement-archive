Japan is providing 25 portable ultrasound image diagnostic systems to hospitals in Nepal and has plans to send 160 oxygen concentrators and six ambulances.The Indian government’s decision to curtail vaccine exports had a major impact on vaccination drives in countries such as Nepal and Bhutan, which used doses supplied by India to provide the first shots to hundreds of thousands of people. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that close to three months had elapsed since many people received the first shot in Nepal. During a phone conversation on Monday, the Nepalese foreign minister requested US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman to “accord due priority” to his country in the distribution of surplus vaccines among developing nations. Cooperation in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic was a key part of the conversation, according to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry.With vaccine exports from India unlikely to resume any time in the immediate future, the US is looking at the possibility of sourcing AstraZeneca doses from other parts of the world so that people in Bhutan and Nepal can be provided with the second doses. “Some countries may even resort to starting over with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but obviously if we could solve this by providing a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, that would be the simplest and best solution,” US chargé d’affaires Daniel Smith told a news briefing earlier this month.Acknowledging the risk to the second round of vaccination in countries such as Nepal, Smith said the US is looking to partner with other countries and boost vaccine production in India to make up the shortfall.Australia is providing emergency funding to countries in the neighbourhood for support to be delivered by on-the-ground partners. This will include oxygen and ventilators and improving contact tracing.In Bangladesh, Australia will provide $5 million to partners such as the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society for purchasing essential supplies, including oxygen and related equipment. This is in addition to $5.7 million provided earlier for equipment and training.In Nepal, Australia will provide $7 million for purchasing essential equipment through the UN and NGO partners. Australia is already providing equipment to hospitals in Nepal’s most severely affected areas bordering India, as well as testing kits and training for health workers.Australia will provide $5.5 million to the UN SDG Fund in Sri Lanka for critical supplies and health systems. It already provided more than $6.2 million in Covid-19-related support to Sri Lanka during 2020-21. Australia has also delivered oxygen and related supplies through the UNICEF, including 291 oxygen cylinders and 342 oxygen regulators.India and its partners in the Quad have been keeping a close eye on China’s moves in the neighbourhood, including the supply of vaccines as grants. Bangladesh received 500,000 doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine as a gift on May 12 and the Chinese embassy in Dhaka has announced that the second batch of doses will be donated soon. On Monday, China’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Wang Yu, announced on Twitter that Beijing will donate 700,000 doses of vaccines to Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-members-step-up-covid-19-support-for-countries-in-neighbourhood-101621878428149.html
24-05-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden doubling spending to prepare for hurricanes, storms||President Joe Biden is doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impacts of climate change.The $1 billion in spending being announced Monday is a small fraction of what the US spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.2021 has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states and underscore the damage caused by climate change.Forecasters predict the Atlantic hurricane season will be busier than normal, but is unlikely to be as severe as 2020’s record-shattering year.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the hurricane season, which runs from June through November, will likely see 13 to 20 named storms, including at least six that will become hurricanes and three to five categorized as major hurricanes with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kilometers per hour).Biden will make the funding announcement during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s headquarters Monday afternoon, where he will receive a briefing on this year’s outlook for the Atlantic hurricane season.As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events such as increased floods, sea level rise and intensifying droughts and wildfires, the White House said it is the government's responsibility to better prepare and support communities before disasters occur, rather than simply respond afterward.Under Biden's announcement, FEMA will provide $1 billion for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which helps states, local communities, tribes and territories to develop projects to prepare for and reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards.Officials pledged to increase investment in climate research to improve understanding of extreme weather events and hone decision-making on climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation. The new funding should help ensure that communities have the resources they need to build resilience prior to these crises, the White House said.The steps being announced Monday are part of Biden's pledge to elevate the importance of climate change as a major priority. Biden has set a target to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by up to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economywide by 2050.Just last week, Biden directed federal agencies to develop a comprehensive strategy to identify and manage financial risks to government and the private sector posed by climate change. An executive order he issued Thursday calls for concrete steps to mitigate climate risks and could result in new regulations on the banking, housing and agriculture sectors, among others.“Extreme weather related to climate change can disrupt entire supply chains and deprive communities of food, water or emergency supplies,″ the White House said. Snowstorms can knock power grids offline, while floods made worse by rising sea levels can destroy homes and businesses.The executive order directs White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and economic adviser Brian Deese to develop a government-wide strategy within four months to identify and disclose climate-related financial risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-doubling-spending-to-prepare-for-hurricanes-storms-101621877197196.html

The protests soon turned violent and exposed the grim security situation in Pakistan.During the violent protests, hundreds of protesters and police personnel were injured and thousands of TLP activists and supporters were arrested and booked for attacking law enforcement personnel and blocking main roads and highways.Several police vehicles were torched, buildings were attacked and policemen were kidnapped and tortured by the activists of the TLP across the Punjab province, with at least six policemen killed and over 800 injured.The banned party, led by cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi gained popularity over the issue of blasphemy among the masses, specifically concerning Mumtaz Qadri, the killer of former Punjab governor Salman Taseer over blasphemy accusations, writes Sulman Ali in an opinion piece for Pakistan Daily."They have presented themselves as the sole flag bearers of the blasphemy issue... Violence is a currency which sells in today's times. They have proven that they can also kill and be killed for their cause," said columnist Khurshid Nadeem.Surprisingly emerging as the fifth largest party of the 2018 general elections, the party even defeated the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the recently held National Assembly elections in Karachi, thus showing its immense popularity in Pakistan.According to Pakistan Daily, the TLP is weaponised the Barelvi sect, which was presented as an example to the world as the face of Islam, a sect that believes in love, tolerance, and peace. Khadim Rizvi, has since changed that whole out look and now the sect has emerged as radical, as it has blocked roads, halted daily life, broken citizens' cars, destroyed property and causing the loss of millions of rupees.The party successfully disrupted life in twin cities in 2016, then again in 2017, protesting against a change in Election Act in 2017.Experts note that the recent anti-France protests led by the TLP are not a good sign for Pakistan, which is already on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey-list over terror financing.The international body has kept Pakistan on the grey list, and with the incidents and violent protests by TLP, experts say it will be again hard for Islamabad to fight its case, wrote Sulman Ali."There is still an absence of authenticity in Pakistan wanting to make a clean break with religious extremism. The action, somehow, feels insufficient to shut down the massive jihadi infrastructure and to limit the radical Islamist sentiment that backs it," noted Pakistan's former ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani.Pakistan government's mishandling of the anti-France protests, as well as the initial tacit support of Prime Minister Imran Khan and other members of his cabinet to the blasphemy charges levelled by the TLP against French President Emmanuel Macron, has not gone down well in Paris, said Roland Jacquard, Chairman of Roland Jacquard Global Security Consulting (RJGSC) in an opinion piece last month.With anti-French sentiments running high, Jacquard said that french diplomats should not expect the Pakistan government to take a rational stand on the issue.

The crash occurred in a section of tunnel about 100 metres (330 feet) away from the KLCC station outside the Petronas towers."We are still investigating the incident..., but we suspect that perhaps there was a miscommunication from the trains' operations control center," Mohamad Zainal said.Videos and photos of the incident posted on social media showed several bleeding commuters and broken glass panels inside the trains, operated by Prasarana Malaysia Berhad.Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong said the collision was the first major accident in the metro system's 23 years of operation, and he pledged a thorough investigation.The 88-storey Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin towers in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-200-injured-when-two-trains-collide-in-malaysian-capital-101621871515888.html

Geneva is now expected to be the choice for Biden first face-to-face meeting with Putin as president, according to a second official.An official announcement was expected in the coming days.The summit would come at the end of Biden’s first foreign trip as president, a week-long swing through Europe that includes a stop in the United Kingdom for a Group of Seven summit of leaders of the world’s richest nations, and then a visit to the Brussels headquarters of NATO, the longstanding military alliance built as a bulwark to Russian aggression.A spokeswoman for the National Security Council declined to comment on the summit logistics.But, in a statement, the NSC said this week's meeting between Sullivan and the Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, “was an important step in the preparation for a planned US-Russia summit” and deemed the discussions “constructive” despite “outstanding differences.”The Biden first administration called for the summit last month after Russia engaged in a series of confrontational actions: temporarily amassing troops on the Ukrainian border, the SolarWinds hacking, reports of bounties placed on US troops in Afghanistan and the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-and-kremlin-working-to-arrange-biden-putin-summit-in-geneva-101621869327971.html

24-05-2021||World||China denies WSJ story on researchers falling sick at Wuhan lab||China on Monday accused the US of hyping the theory that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in the central city of Wuhan after a new report said three researchers from the facility sought hospital treatment for fever in November, 2019.Citing US intelligence, a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were admitted to a hospital a month before Beijing reported the first cases of Covid-19.The WSJ report came on the eve of a meeting of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision-making body, which is expected to discuss the next stage of a probe into the Covid-19 origins. “The report that you mentioned about three people getting sick, that is not true,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a briefing on Monday in Beijing when asked to comment about the WSJ story.Saying the report was “completely untrue”, Zhao said: “The United States continues to hype up the lab leak theory. Does it care about traceability or is it just trying to distract attention?”Separately, Yuan Zhiming, director of the lab, also told Chinese state media that the report was not correct. “I’ve read it, it’s a complete lie,” Yuan told Global Times on Monday about the WSJ story, which was published on Sunday titled “Intelligence on Sick Staff at Wuhan Lab Fuels Debate on COVID-19 Origin”.“Those claims are groundless. The lab has not been aware of this situation [sick researchers in autumn 2019], and I don’t even know where such information came from,” Yuan said.China has consistently denied the lab leak theory and has accused the US of using it as a distraction from its own handling of the pandemic.The WHO-led investigation into the origins of Covid-19 said it was “extremely unlikely” the coronavirus came from a laboratory leak.At the same time, international scientists have sought more data from China on early cases.The WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said following the probe that it didn’t adequately analyse the possibility of a lab accident. “As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table. This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,” he said after the report was published.Earlier this month, a group of 18 prominent scientists called for further investigations into the origins of the SARS-CoV2 virus, including that it could have been created in the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab.The letter, which was published in the journal Science, was helmed by David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford University, and Jesse Bloom, virologist at the University of Washington, gave weight to growing calls to include all hypotheses about natural and laboratory spillovers.“Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable. Knowing how Covid-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks,” the scientists wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-wsj-story-on-researchers-falling-sick-at-wuhan-lab-101621857067547.html
24-05-2021||World||France, Germany back efforts to improve WHO as meeting opens||French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday were among leaders rallying around efforts to strengthen the World Health Organization and the world’s ability to prepare for and defend against pandemics.It came as the UN health agency opened its annual assembly, with a draft resolution in the works that acknowledges missteps in the response to Covid-19. The sweeping proposal would seek to boost pandemic response, stabilize WHO's funding and ensure greater access to health care — including to vaccines, tests and treatments linked to the coronavirus.The European Union and Vanuatu were behind the resolution, which was to be considered during the eight-day assembly. It would create a working group on strengthening WHO’s readiness and response to health emergencies.“We have to have institutions that are up to the task, that meet our ambitions,” Macron said by video during the mostly virtual meeting. WHO, he said, must be “robust” and “flexible” in times of emergency and crisis. “And it must be completely transparent to make sure that people trust the organization.""There must not be any political pressure and there must not be any suspicion of pressure that has been exerted,” he added.Merkel threw her backing behind the idea of a “global health threat council” and said leaders should provide WHO with “lasting financial and personal support.”“We have been talking about this for years, but now it is all the more important to act,” she said.The resolution — a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press — cites Covid-19 two dozen times. It breaks little new ground and aims mostly to garner consensus and commonality of purpose in the aftermath of the economic and human devastation wreaked by the pandemic.The resolution, which would set up a six-person working group to report to the assembly next year, acknowledged “serious shortcomings” in the world’s ability to prepare, prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies.The text, if approved, would ask WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to make “concrete suggestions” for levels of alert in times of health emergencies, “with clear criteria and practical implications for countries.”Diplomats behind the measure said they hoped it could garner consensus among WHO's 194 member states.The WHO chief, after leading a round of applause for health care workers who have battled the pandemic in often-agonizing conditions, said the world remains in a “very dangerous situation” — and that while he was speaking 400 people would die of Covid-19.He reiterated his concerns about unequal access to vaccines, saying that over 75 percent of vaccines have been administered in 10 countries. He called for a “massive push” to ensure the vaccination of 10% of the population of all countries by the end of September — and at least 30% percent by year end.“There is no diplomatic way to say it: A small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the world’s vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-germany-back-efforts-to-improve-who-as-meeting-opens-101621851983171.html
24-05-2021||World||Myanmar junta leader casts doubt on return of Rohingya refugees||Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing cast doubt on the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled to Bangladesh in comments made in his first interview since taking power in a Feb. 1 coup.Min Aung Hlaing was asked by Chinese-language Phoenix television whether the Muslims could be allowed back to Rakhine State - from where most fled an army crackdown in 2017 that UN investigators said had "genocidal intent"."If it doesn't comply with Myanmar's laws, what else is there to consider? I don't believe there is any country in the world that would go beyond their own country's refugee laws to accept refugees," Min Aung Hlaing responded, according to a transcript of the interview.When asked whether that meant vocal international appeals on behalf of the Rohingya were to no avail, he nodded.Min Aung Hlaing, who headed the army in 2017 when some 700,000 Rohingya fled from advancing troops, reiterated the view of nationalists in Buddhist-majority Myanmar that the Rohingya are not one of its ethnic groups.He said the term Rohingya had only emerged since independence from Britain in 1948."After we gained our independence, the census also registered the words 'Bengali', 'Pakistani' and 'Chittagong', but never the word 'Rohingya', thus we never accepted it," Min Aung Hlaing said.Rohingya have been widely referred to as Bengali by Myanmar authorities - implying that they are outsiders from Bangladesh, although some can trace their roots in Myanmar back for centuries.Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was overthrown by Min Aung Hlaing on Feb. 1, had also come under international criticism for defending the army against charges of genocide relating to the Rohingya.She and the military rejected accusations of genocide saying the security forces were engaged in legitimate operations against Rohingya insurgents when the refugees fled to Bangladesh.Not long after the coup, Min Aung Hlaing said efforts to repatriate refugees from Bangladesh would continue, but there has been no sign of progress while the junta has struggled to impose control in Myanmar.Bangladesh is keen to see the Rohingya go back to Myanmar from the huge camps in which most of them are living in southeastern Bangladeshi border districts.Bangladesh's Dhaka Tribune journal reported on Monday that efforts were underway to restart talks on the repatriation between Bangladesh and Myanmar with the help of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-leader-casts-doubt-on-return-of-rohingya-refugees-101621852146124.html
24-05-2021||World||Minutes to touchdown: The moment a Belarusian dissident knew his time was up||Ryanair Flight 4978 had already begun its descent into the Lithuanian capital when the pilot announced that the plane would be suddenly diverting to Minsk, capital of neighbouring Belarus.There was no explanation.But one of the passengers aboard the Boeing 737 reacted immediately, standing up from his seat, reaching into the overhead locker, pulling a laptop computer from his hand luggage and passing it to a female companion along with his mobile phone.Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who is wanted in Belarus for his role in broadcasting huge opposition protests in Minsk last year, did not have much time. Minsk is less than 200 km (125 miles) from Vilnius. The diversion would take minutes."When it was announced they were going to land in Minsk, Roman stood up, opened the luggage compartment, took luggage and was trying to split things," said a Lithuanian passenger, who gave his name only as Mantas."I think he made a mistake. There were plenty of people so he could give the things to me or other passengers and not the girlfriend, who was also I think arrested."Outside the plane - although not visible to Mantas - was a Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jet, on orders from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to force the plane to Minsk.Mantas was speaking to Reuters after a day-long ordeal that began in Athens and finally ended late in the evening in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, after a stopover of more than seven hours in Minsk.Another exhausted passenger, speaking to reporters without giving her name, said Protasevich looked "super scared"."I looked directly into his eyes and he was very sad," she said.Belarusian authorities had diverted the flight as it passed over the country because of a suspected bomb alert, state news agency BelTA said. The alert later turned out to be false.'STANDING ALONE'Protasevich, 26 was immediately separated on arrival in Minsk and checks of luggage using sniffer dogs turned up nothing."We saw that Roman was stopped due to some things in the luggage," Mantas said, adding that the other passengers also had their luggage checked and were taken by bus to the terminal where they spent several hours waiting to reboard the plane."We saw from the window that Roman is standing alone, and one policeman with dog was trying to find something (in his luggage)."Another passenger, who also did not give his name, told Lithuanian media that Protasevich had identified himself to Belarusian security officials on arrival. "I saw how his passport was taken away. He took off his mask and said: 'I'm so-and-so and I'm the reason why all this is going on.'"The European Union called for Protasevich's immediate release, with the head of the EU's executive European Commission and the Polish prime minister describing the incident as a hijacking.The other passengers looked weary on arrival in Vilnius, with Mantas saying they had spent hours in queues for luggage and passport checks in Minsk before being allowed into a lounge to await takeoff.He said he could not be sure if Protasevich's companion, who took the laptop and phone, had also been detained in Minsk, but there appeared to be more empty seats on the final Minsk-Vilnius journey than when it took off from Athens."It means that more than one person was (taken) out of the plane - but (it's) difficult to say exactly."Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told a news conference late on Sunday that Protasevich's female companion had also not re-embarked the flight from Minsk to Vilnius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minutes-to-touchdown-the-moment-a-belarusian-dissident-knew-his-time-was-up-101621832297542.html
24-05-2021||World||China accuses US of hyping theory Coronavirus escaped from lab in Wuhan||China accused the US of promoting theories that the coronavirus escaped from a high-security lab in Wuhan, as a fresh report about sick workers at the facility prompted Beijing to reaffirm denials.“The report that you mentioned about three people getting sick, that is not true,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing Monday in Beijing. Zhao was responding to a Wall Street Journal report that a trio of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology -- a lab in the city where the first Covid-19 outbreak was identified -- had fallen ill and sought hospital care in November 2019.The facility has previously denied claims of workers getting sick, including a US State Department fact sheet publish in January that asserts that several researchers from the institute became sick in autumn 2019. Zhao said the US has been hyping the lab-leak theory.China has sought to frame the claims as conspiracy theories created to divert attention from the US government’s own handling of the coronavirus, and suggested that the Fort Detrick military base in Maryland should be investigated.While the World Health Organization-led investigation in China earlier this year found it was “extremely unlikely” the coronavirus came from a laboratory leak, scientists have sought more data from China on early cases. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said following the probe that it didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab accident, adding that he is ready to deploy additional resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-hyping-theory-coronavirus-escaped-from-lab-in-wuhan-101621845683204.html
24-05-2021||World||Pressure to accept China vaccines intensifies as Taiwan battles Covid-19 surge||A surge in domestic Covid-19 cases in Taiwan after months of relative safety is intensifying pressure on the government to accept vaccines from China, as the island has vaccinated just 1% of the population with no immediate sign of new shots arriving.The Chinese-claimed island and Beijing have repeatedly sparred over the pandemic since it began.Taipei accuses Beijing of spreading fake news and preventing its full participation at the World Health Organization, while Beijing says Taipei is playing political games with its people's lives by refusing Chinese vaccines.Taiwan has only received about 700,000 vaccine doses to date, all from AstraZeneca Plc, which are rapidly running out. It has millions more on order, including from Moderna Inc.Over the weekend, Hung Hsiu-chu, a former head of Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said the government should allow in Chinese vaccines as soon as possible, saying that they are internationally accepted and that Taiwan cannot wait."At this moment, lives are at stake, and we respectfully tell the Tsai government: the real enemy is the virus, not the mainland," she said, referring to President Tsai Ing-wen.The KMT, always wary of being painted as pro-China, has not explicitly backed or rejected the idea, but has called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) not to tar as Communist Party sympathisers those who are trying to obtain more vaccines.Pressure is growing from industry too to address the issue, especially after China's Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said on Saturday it was willing to provide Taiwan with BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccines.A source familiar with the situation said major Apple Inc supplier Foxconn was exploring directly approaching Fosun for the shots to vaccinate its employees and their families, though the company had not formally started discussions with the Chinese firm or Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre.Fosun has 10 million shots that are expiring in August and is anxious to offload them, the source added. Fosun did not respond to requests for comment.Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, told Reuters that information on vaccines should come from the command centre."If we can do what we can to prevent the epidemic in Taiwan, then our company is willing to assist," it added.Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said on Sunday that if companies wanted to buy vaccines they had to talk to his ministry.Chen has said that China has not provided enough evidence that its vaccines are safe, and that most Taiwanese would not want to take them anyway. Chen has also said the law prohibiting the imports of any Chinese vaccine would need to be revised.Beijing has called on Taiwan to cast aside political prejudices."Most Taiwanese compatriots are eagerly anticipating the use of mainland vaccines," China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement to Reuters, without offering evidence.

The WHA may also consider a global pandemic treaty to plug the gaps found by the three reports and make it legally binding on nations to prevent any future pandemic outbreak.According to diplomats based in Geneva, not much is expected out of the WHA except for a resolution and asking the WHO instituted group of experts to launch the second phase of investigation into the origins of the virus as the experts in its report had given a clean pass to Wuhan laboratory for possible leakage of the deadly virus. The group of experts had pointed fingers towards a zoonotic origin and possible leakage through food packaging. "Under the Presidentship of Bhutan, the WHA will meet at 10am today (1.30pm IST). Not much is expected from the deliberations despite 1.6 billion people have been affected and 3.4 million people have lost their lives to the disease," said a diplomat.The WHA meeting comes at a time when Wall Street Journal has reported that three researchers of the China’s Wuhan Institute became so sick that they had to be admitted to the hospital in November 2019. A State Department fact sheet had earlier said that several researchers at the lab developed symptoms "consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness," WSJ reported.The report further provides fresh details on the number of researchers affected, the timing of their illnesses, and their hospital visits.The Wall Street Journal reported that the current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment.One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration.Another person described the intelligence as stronger. "The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn't tell you was exactly why they got sick," he said, referring to the researchers, according to the report.The WHO report on the origins of coronavirus was released in March and concluded it is "extremely unlikely that coronavirus, which has killed millions across the world, originated in a lab in China".The report found that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario."Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover (from animals to humans) both remain viable, more investigation is needed to determine the origins of the pandemic," the letter from the WHO scientists who visited Wuhan in February read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wha-under-lens-as-demands-for-fuller-probe-into-china-link-to-covid-19-grows-101621840459052.html

The vaccination programme also came as a ray of hope for many," Lyonchhen said adding "But look where we are today."He said that it was inevitable that Bhutan too felt the impact of the worsening situation in the region, adding that despite all the preparations, there was no guarantee that the country would not experience what India was going through."The threat from the southern borders has now reached the east. If we are not careful, we will suffer the same fate as our neighbours." he said during his address.Lyonchhen said that this was because the SARS-CoV-2 virus was fast mutating and it was becoming more transmissible and overwhelming. He said that the country was being slowly surrounded from all corners and if adequate control measures were not put in place and if people did not adhere to the preventive measures, the country would be overwhelmed within no time."We will be wiped out in no time if we cannot control the spread now," the prime minister said.Meanwhile, Trashigang town was put under a lockdown starting at 7 pm on May 21. All flights to the Yonphula domestic airport were also suspended.The country reported 1,392 positive Covid-19 cases with one death so far, as per World Health Organisation on Sunday. A total of 482,038 vaccine doses have been administered during the said period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/well-be-wiped-out-if-we-can-t-control-covid-now-bhutan-pm-101621833604006.html
24-05-2021||World||Viral video drew hundreds to California party; 149 arrested||A birthday party invitation that went viral on TikTok brought hundreds of people to a raucous celebration on a Southern California beach Saturday night, prompting police to declare an unlawful assembly and arrest nearly 150 people after they refused orders to disperse.The massive gathering began with a now-deleted video posted on the popular social media app from a user named adrian.lopez517, who invited anyone to his birthday party by Huntington Beach's fire pits Saturday night, The Orange County Register reported Sunday. The hashtag “AdriansKickBack” received more than 180 million views on TikTok.One partygoer told a New York Times reporter: “It's the first lit party since Covid.”At least 400 people showed up to a pre-party Friday evening around a lifeguard tower, police Lt. Brian Smith said. When people in the crowd began to launch fireworks near the fire pits, he said, officers declared an unlawful assembly and the partygoers scattered.Huntington Beach's police department announced the next day that they were preparing for a surge of visitors due to the promoted party and warned that they will enforce local rules, including no alcohol or drug use on the beach and no fireworks.But an even larger crowd overtook the beach Saturday evening. Police estimated that at least 2,500 people gathered at the beach before moving to the downtown area. Videos posted on social media showed fistfights breaking out, people jumping from the Huntington Beach Pier's pedestrian bridge to a cheering crowd below, people jumping atop slow-moving cars and shooting more fireworks.Officers again ordered the crowd to disperse and issued an overnight curfew as they received backup from other law enforcement agencies. Video footage shows officers dressed in riot helmets shutting streets to control the crowd and, in some instances, firing less-lethal rounds. Police said some people threw bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers.A woman dining at Duke's Hawaiian restaurant by the pier said she heard fireworks while she was eating, and when she went to the window to see what was happening she saw hundreds of people running away from the beach.“People climbing walls and screaming, more and more fireworks, mobs running. They were asking us to let them in the restaurant, banging on the windows,” Sonya Gronning said. “When we went to leave there was a wall of police protecting the restaurant.”The people arrested included 121 adults and 28 juveniles who were booked for vandalism, illegally setting fireworks, failing to disperse and violating curfews, said police spokeswoman Jennifer Carey.A number of downtown businesses, police vehicles and a lifeguard tower were damaged, but no significant injuries were reported, she said.Huntington Beach, which connects a vibrant business district to an 8-mile (13-kilometer) stretch of sand, has been the site of large gatherings in the last year as pandemic-related restrictions, the 2020 presidential election and the Black Lives Matter movement drew protesters who sometimes clashed with police in the downtown area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/viral-video-drew-hundreds-to-california-party-149-arrested-101621832660596.html

Hundreds died then and more than 100,000 people were left homeless. But in outlying villages closer to the volcano, Sunday was marked by grief and uncertainty.Also Read | Indian peacekeepers help civilians evacuate after volcano erupts in CongoAline Bichikwebo and her baby managed to escape when the lava flow reached her village, but said both her mother and father were among those who perished. Community members gave a provisional toll of 10 dead in Bugamba alone, though provincial authorities said it was too soon to know how many lives were lost.Bichikwebo says she tried to rescue her father but wasn't strong enough to move him to safety before the family's home was ignited by lava.“I am asking for help because everything we had is gone,” she said, clutching her baby. “We don’t even have a pot. We are now orphans and we have nothing.”The air remained thick with smoke because of how many homes had caught fire when the lava came.“People are still panicking and are hungry,” resident Alumba Sutoye said. “They don’t even know where they are going to spend the night.”Elsewhere, authorities said at least five other people had died in a truck crash while they were trying to evacuate Goma, but the scale of the loss had yet to be determined in some of the hardest-hit communities.Residents said there was little warning before the dark sky turned a fiery red, sending people running for their lives in all directions. One woman went into labor and gave birth while fleeing the eruption to Rwanda, the national broadcaster there said.Smoke rose from smoldering heaps of lava in the Buhene area near the city Sunday.“We have seen the loss of almost an entire neighborhood," Innocent Bahala Shamavu said. “All the houses in Buhene neighborhood were burned and that’s why we are asking all the provincial authorities and authorities at the national level as well as all the partners, all the people of good faith in the world, to come to the aid of this population.”Elsewhere, witnesses said lava had engulfed one highway connecting Goma with the city of Beni. However, the airport appeared to be spared the same fate as 2002 when lava flowed onto the runways.Goma is a regional hub for many humanitarian agencies in the region, as well as the U.N. peacekeeping mission. While Goma is home to many U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers, much of surrounding eastern Congo is under threat from myriad armed groups vying for control of the region’s mineral resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-15-killed-in-volcanic-eruption-in-congo-over-500-homes-destroyed-101621831892775.html
24-05-2021||World||Police and soldiers killed in eastern Myanmar amid heavy fighting||Dozens of Myanmar security force members were killed Sunday, rebel fighters said, after heavy fighting in the coup-hit country's eastern fringe.Myanmar has been in chaos since the February putsch, as the military uses lethal force to crack down on dissent.The civilian death toll has climbed to at least 815 people, according to a local monitoring group.The violence has pushed some in the anti-junta movement to form a so-called "People's Defence Force" (PDF) in their own townships -- made up of civilians who fight back against security forces with homemade weapons.There were clashes in eastern Myanmar over the weekend, particularly in Kayah state's Demoso town, and in neighbouring Shan state.People's Defence Force member Thet Wai -- not his real name -- said at least 20 police officers died Sunday and his side seized a police station in Moebyel town, Shan state, east of the capital Naypyidaw.The police station was burnt down and rebel fighters also took four security force members into custody, local media reported."I thought today is a day of conquest," Thet Wai, 29, told AFP."But I am also worried because we have seen air strikes and tanks today. They have much better weapons than us."He said the Myanmar military had launched helicopter air strikes in the evening at Demoso, a town in Kayah state about 40 kilometres south.Another civilian fighter at Demoso said at least 13 Myanmar soldiers had been killed Sunday, while four of his men were wounded."We intended to seize their police station, but they used air strikes and we could not stop their reinforcement trucks getting into the town," he said."We had to withdraw our troops from fighting."The fighting continued through Sunday night, according to a senior leader of the Karenni National Progressive Party -- an ethnic armed group with a stronghold in Kayah state.He confirmed that the military was using tanks, helicopters and mortar attacks in Demoso and Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state.Meanwhile, military chief Min Aun Hlaing, who removed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi from power in the coup, gave a two-hour interview to Hong Kong's Phoenix Television, with the full programme yet to air.In a snippet released Sunday, he offered reassurances to Chinese investors after a spate of arson attacks at factories in the commercial capital Yangon."Our citizens don't hate China," he said. "It happened for political reasons."Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since she was placed under house arrest.She has been hit with a string of criminal charges including flouting coronavirus restrictions during last year's election campaign and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies.Suu Kyi is expected to appear in person in court on Monday for the first time, after weeks of delays to her legal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-and-soldiers-killed-in-eastern-myanmar-amid-heavy-fighting-101621825320326.html
24-05-2021||World||George Floyd's family holds rally, march in brother's memory||Members of George Floyd’s family, and others who lost loved ones to police encounters, joined activists and citizens in Minneapolis on Sunday for a march that was one of several events planned nationwide to mark the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death.Hundreds of people gathered for the rally in front of the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis where the Chauvin trial concluded a month ago, many carrying signs with pictures of Floyd, Philando Castile and other Black men killed by police.Amid chants of “no justice, no peace!” and “Say his name,” Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter watched alongside a dozen of Floyd's family members as speakers called for justice for families of Black men slain by police.“It has been a long year. It has been a painful year,” Floyd's sister Bridgett told the crowd on Sunday. “It has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye — I still don't know why.”Tuesday will mark one year since Floyd, who was Black, died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Chauvin, who is white, has since been convicted of murder and manslaughter for Floyd’s death, which sparked worldwide protests and calls for change in policing in the U.S.Speakers at the event included several local activists, Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who called on the U.S. Senate to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation, which would bring about the most significant changes to policing on the federal level, would ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.“We want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law,” Sharpton said. “There's been an adjournment on justice for too long. It's time for them to vote and make this the law.”The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit based in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where Floyd was born, is hosting a series of events in Minneapolis this weekend and early next week to honor Floyd on the anniversary. Those events include the rally and a march downtown on Sunday that will be led by Floyd’s family and other families of victims of police violence.The nonprofit was launched by Floyd’s siblings in September 2020 to help combat racial inequities in Black and brown communities in their brother’s honor.Other events in Minneapolis ahead of the anniversary include a virtual “day of action” that encourages people to organize remotely and two panels with the families and other activists on Monday, followed by a community festival and candlelight vigil on Tuesday.In New York on Sunday, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, attended a Brooklyn gathering in his brother’s memory organized by Sharpton and told supporters not to forget his brother or victims of racist violence.“If you keep my brother’s name ringing, you’re going to keep everybody else’s name ringing,” Terrence Floyd said. “Breonna Taylor, Sean Bell, Ahmaud Arbery, you could go through the whole list. There’s a lot of them.”Executive director Jacari Harris said the group has received donations from the Minneapolis Foundation, Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation and athletic shoe and apparel retailer Finish Line, among others. Despite large grants from corporations and other organizations, Harris the average donation to the nonprofit was $47.Harris said the group has also funded an initiative in Fayetteville to help reduce homelessness, a scholarship program for law school students and an internship program at Texas A&M University, where Floyd went to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-george-floyd-s-family-holds-rally-march-in-brother-s-memory-101621817657320.html
24-05-2021||World||Michigan governor Whitmer 'sorry' for violating social distancing guidelines||Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer apologized Sunday after apparently violating state-mandated social distancing guidelines at an East Lansing bar and grill.It was the latest pandemic-related misstep for the Democratic governor, who waited weeks to disclose partial details of a private jet trip she took to visit her father in Florida after two of her top aides headed south as coronavirus cases surged in in Michigan and residents were cautioned against traveling south for spring break.A photo circulated on social media of Whitmer with a large group of unmasked people at an East Lansing bar-restaurant, The Landshark Bar & Grill, the Detroit Free Pres s reported Sunday. The Free Press reported that photo, which shows Whitmer seated with about a dozen, was posted on social media by one of the attendees, but later deleted.“Throughout the pandemic, I’ve been committed to following public health protocols,” Whitmer said in a statement Sunday. “Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant. As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together. Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it. In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.”Michigan restaurants and bars remain subject to capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Current orders require six people or fewer at tables and distances of 6 feet (1.83 meters) between tables.Whitmer, who received her second vaccination dose April 29, is considered fully vaccinated. But she is not the first public official to draw criticism for defying pandemic-related rules.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who won plaudits for issuing the first statewide stay-at-home order in the U.S. back in March, 2020, later drew criticism after he broke the state rules. Newsom and his wife were caught dining with 10 others at the posh French Laundry restaurant in Napa in early November with lobbyists and others from numerous different households, sitting close together, mask-less.Newsom quickly apologized, saying he “made a bad mistake” but noting the gathering was outdoors. Within days, photos emerged showing the group in a room that was enclosed on three sides with a sliding glass door on the other, maybe meeting the technical definition of outdoors, but perhaps not the spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-governor-whitmer-sorry-for-violating-social-distancing-guidelines-101621816176895.html
24-05-2021||World||Outrage as Belarus forces plane to land, arrests journalist on board||The U.S. and Europe reacted with outrage after Belarus ordered a Ryanair Holdings Plc flight transiting its airspace to land and arrested a journalist on board, an unprecedented violation of European air travel protocols.“The United States strongly condemns the forced diversion of a flight between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Roman Pratasevich,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.“Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation.”The forced landing drew sharp and unified condemnation from across the European Union, with France and Greece, Poland and Germany among those rushing to express their anger. Further sanctions on Minsk may result. EU leaders due to meet in Brussels for a two-day summit starting Monday will discuss the consequences of what EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called an “unacceptable” action.Europe’s fury was triggered after a Boeing Co. 737-800 carrying scores of passengers from Athens to Vilnius was diverted to the Belarusian capital on Sunday under the escort of a Mig-29 fighter jet. The plane’s crew was notified by authorities in Minsk of a “potential security threat on board,” a Ryanair spokeswoman said. Once in Minsk, authorities arrested a journalist who covered protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, whose election to a sixth term last year was internationally disputed.Authorities boarded the plane and arrested Pratasevich, the former editor-in-chief of one the most popular Telegram news channels in Belarus. Pratasevich wasn’t on the plane when it was allowed to take off again for Vilnius, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said in a recorded statement.“This is a serious and dangerous incident, which requires international investigation,” NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter.A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry in Minsk declined to comment.Potential measures when EU leaders meet could include sanctions against individuals and entities, suspending all flights by EU airlines over Belarus, banning Minsk’s carrier Belavia from landing at airports in the bloc, and the suspension of all transit, including ground travel, between Belarus and the EU, according to an official familiar with the discussions. The steps would be on top of a sanctions package Brussels was already working on and was aiming to present next month.A post-election crackdown by Lukashenko’s administration on the opposition already resulted in U.S. and EU sanctions and pushed the president, in office since 1994, closer to Russia. Sunday’s events risk deepening the international isolation of a country that former U.S. Secretary State of Condoleezza Rice referred to in 2006 during a visit to Lithuania as the last dictatorship in Europe.The latest incident has the potential to influence already strained ties between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as the two leaders move toward a potential first summit as soon as next month.Lukashenko is slated to meet with Putin this week in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Rossiya-1 television reported Sunday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t respond to a request for comment after hours in Moscow.U.S. State Department officials have been talking to Brussels, Vilnius and Athens all day long, according to a person familiar with the diplomacy who asked not to be named talking about internal discussions.Lukashenko gave an unconditional order to turn the plane around, the state news service Belta said, citing the unofficial Pool Pervogo telegram channel, which is widely seen as run by people close to the presidential press service.An adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Pratasevich, 26, had been bundled off the flight in Minsk by police. “At first he panicked, then calmed down a bit, but still was trembling,” Franak Viacorka said on Twitter, citing passengers. “He said he’ll face the death penalty here. He was taken aside, his belongings dumped on the runway.”Pratasevich and his NEXTA colleague Stsiapan Putsila were accused of organizing mass unrest and group actions severely violating public order, the Investigative Committee said on Nov. 5. They were also accused of stirring “social hatred” against law enforcers via their Telegram channels.Nauseda called the Ryanair forced landing an unprecedented “kidnapping of a person by use of military force” and urged NATO and the EU to react to the threat posed by the Belarusian leadership to civil aviation.Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Belarus’s neighbor Poland, urged sanctions against Lukashenko for committing an “act of state terrorism.” Greece called it a “state hijacking.”German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass denounced Belarus’s actions, saying that forcing a plane to land under the pretext of a bomb threat was a “severe interference into civil aviation travel.”“Such an act cannot remain without consequences from the side of the European Union,“ Maas said.There were conflicting reports of the number of people who were on board. The foreign ministries of Greece and Lithuania said there were 171 passengers from at least 18 countries. The Belarusian state news agency Belta reported that there were 123 passengers.Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte arrived at the airport in Vilnius with a prosecutor to question the arriving passengers, and the prime minister announced an investigation.U.S. lawmakers joined with counterparts from seven other countries in calling for an inquiry by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization into a “clear violation of free transit between states and the threats to the aircraft.”“Until ICAO has reported, we call for Belarus to be suspended from the organization and a ban on all overflight of Belarus including flights to and from the country,” Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.Blinken said the Biden administration supports the earliest possible meeting of the ICAO to review Sunday’s events.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-as-belarus-forces-plane-to-land-arrests-journalist-on-board-101621815603291.html
24-05-2021||World||12 killed, 49 injured in weekend spate of US shootings||A dozen people were killed and about 50 injured in shootings across the United States over the weekend, after President Joe Biden last month branded the country's gun violence an "epidemic."The spate of shooting incidents included deaths in New Jersey, South Carolina, Georgia, Ohio and Minnesota.In total, the attacks claimed 12 lives and wounded at least 49 others.Two people died when gunfire broke out at a house party in Camden, New Jersey on Saturday night, and at least 12 people were injured, according to police.In South Carolina, one 14-year-old girl was killed and 14 people wounded at a concert.Police in Atlanta, Georgia, found three gunshot victims early Sunday after responding to a call about shots fired. All three victims were pronounced dead at the scene, US media reported.Three others were killed and eight injured outside a bar in Youngstown, Ohio, early Sunday morning, while a 16-year-old girl was killed and seven people injured in a park in Columbus.A deadly shooting also occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the night before supporters and relatives of George Floyd, the Black man killed by a white former police officer last spring, held a march Sunday on the first anniversary of his death.One person was killed and eight injured, with one victim in critical condition.Minneapolis police told AFP that one suspect in the shooting had been arrested, while a second suspect had died.The United States has suffered a series of mass shootings in recent months, including at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, an office building in California, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado -- as well as a birthday party in the same city a few weeks later -- and at several spas in Atlanta.Biden has introduced six executive measures aimed at tamping down the crisis, including a proposed rule to halt "ghost guns," as firearms built from home kits are known, and boosting support for agencies involved in tackling community violence.In addition to mass shootings, gun violence in general -- including less-publicized incidents often involving family members or acquaintances -- has surged across the United States last year.Gun sales jumped at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, 2020 was one of the most violent years in the United States in decades.So far this year, there have been at least 200 mass shootings in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-killed-in-weekend-spate-of-us-shootings-101621815208053.html
24-05-2021||World||National Guard mission to provide security at Capitol set to conclude||Nearly five months after being deployed to the U.S. Capitol to help quell the Jan. 6 insurrection, National Guard troops were set to leave and turn over security of the area to Capitol Police.Guard troops, their mission ending Sunday, were expected to be leaving on Monday, a person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss the plan by name and requested anonymity.The Pentagon announced earlier in the week that an extension of the Guard presence — 2,149 troops — had not been requested.The planned departure came as Democrats and Republicans sparred over how to fund fortifications of the Capitol and whether to form an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the attack that sought to overturn former President Donald Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Some Republican lawmakers have begun downplaying the event despite the handful of deaths, injuries to scores of police officers, hundreds of arrests, damages to the building and shouted threats against lawmakers from many of those who stormed the building. Much of the violence was caught on camera.Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who oversaw a security review in the wake of the rioting, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the Capitol itself will be secured by Capitol Police but that the complex will remain closed to the general public because of the strain on the police force.“God bless the National Guard,” Honore said. “They've done significant work.”The House on Thursday approved — by a single vote largely along party lines — a $1.9 billion measure to fortify the Capitol. The next day the House approved with 35 Republican votes the formation of an investigative commission. Both measures face an uncertain future in the evenly divided Senate.Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he opposes the commission proposal, which would need significant Republican support to advance under Senate rules. Republican opponents say the commission would become a political tool as midterms elections approach, though the proposal requires its work to be concluded by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-mission-to-provide-security-at-capitol-set-to-conclude-101621814522572.html
24-05-2021||World||Suez Canal ship fiasco: Court decision stalled as dispute over fault continues||An Egyptian appeals court on Sunday said it lacks jurisdiction to look into the Suez Canal Authority’s demands to uphold financial claims that led to the the seizure of the massive Ever Given ship after it blocked the waterway in March.The authority and the ship's owner are in dispute as to whose fault it was that the ship ran aground in the canal linking the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea - and how much compensation should be paid.The appeals chamber of the Ismailia Economic Court referred the case to a lower court to decide on the legality of the seizure of the Ever Given until the settlement of compensation claim between the the Suez Canal Authority and Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the ship’s Japanese owner, according to Hazem Barakat, a lawyer representing the vessel’s owner.The Ever Given was on its way to the Dutch port of Rotterdam on March 23 when it slammed into the bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.A massive effort by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, freed the skyscraper-sized ship six days later, ending the crisis and allowing hundreds of waiting vessels to pass through the canal. The Suez Canal Authority on Sunday revealed for the first time that a salvage boat capsized during the operation, leaving one worker dead.Since it was freed, the Panama-flagged vessel, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, has been ordered by authorities to remain in a holding lake mid-canal as its owner and the canal authority try to settle the compensation dispute.At first, the Suez Canal Authority demanded $916 million in compensation, which was later lowered to $550 million, the head of the canal authority, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, said in comments on a television program on Sunday.The compensation amount would account for the salvage operation, costs of stalled canal traffic and lost transit fees for the week the Ever Given blocked the canal.The ship’s technical management company, Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement, said in April the Suez Canal Authority had not provided a detailed justification for the compensation claim, calling it “extraordinarily large.”The Suez Canal Authority said it provided documents detailing the compensation amount. It did not provide additional details.Barakat, the lawyer, said the next court hearing on the case will take place on May 29.In a separate lawsuit, the appeals chamber rejected Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd.' appeal against a lower court decision to bound the vessel until solving the financial dispute.On Saturday, lawyers representing the ship's owners blamed the canal authority for the vessel’s grounding, claiming that the canal authorities did not provide evidence faulting the ship’s crew. They also argued that the canal authority should not have allowed the he vessel to sail in the waterway amid bad weather.Evergreen Marine Corp., a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, had said that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea.Barakat said the Voyage Data Recorder, also known as a vessel’s black box, had recorded a debate between canal pilots and its control center over whether it should allowed to transit the canal. There were two pilots from the canal authority aboard the vessel to guide it when the grounding happened.Barakat also confirmed that the vessel’s owners, had, for their part, demanded $100,000 in initial compensation for losses related to its seizure.The canal has repeatedly denied wrongdoings. It said in a statement Sunday that that while its pilots typically board ships to guide them through the waterway, the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel and that the pilots' role is an advisory one.The six-day blockage disrupted global shipment. Some ships were forced to take the long alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, requiring additional fuel and other costs. Hundreds of other ships waited in place for the blockage to end.About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, a pivotal source of foreign currency to Egypt. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-ship-fiasco-court-decision-stalled-as-dispute-over-fault-continues-101621800337882.html
24-05-2021||World||UN urges 'political process' amid Gaza reconstruction||A UN official in war-battered Gaza Sunday called for a "genuine political process" to avert further bloodshed, after the military conflict between Israel and Islamist group Hamas that ravaged the Palestinian enclave.As thousands of Gazans slowly tried to piece back together their lives, top UN staff visited the territory after an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire Friday halted 11 days of mutual bombardment, where they warned of the deep psychological trauma of the violence.On Sunday, in a badly-damaged district of Gaza city, volunteers swept up clouds of dust at the feet of collapsed buildings, while others shovelled debris onto the back of a donkey-drawn cart.Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip since May 10 have killed more than 200 Palestinians, rendered thousands homeless and laid waste to buildings and key infrastructure across the blockaded territory.It was the latest such bombardment to hit the crowded coastal strip of some two million people, after three previous wars with Israel since 2008.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the reconstruction needed to go hand in hand with efforts to create "a different political environment"."We need to have a genuine focus on human development," on proper access to education, jobs and livelihoods, he said."But this needs to be accompanied by a genuine political process".Speaking earlier to a group of journalists, he said "the layers of hardship in Gaza keep getting thicker", because the root causes of the conflict have not been addressed.- 'No pause to breathe' -US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking ahead of an imminent trip to the region, reaffirmed Washington's support for a two-state solution so Israelis and Palestinians can live "with equal measures of security, of peace and dignity".Israeli strikes on Gaza killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and have wounded over 1,900 people, the Gaza health ministry says.Rockets from Gaza claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, an Israeli soldier, one Indian, and two Thai nationals, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel have been wounded.There is controversy about how many of those killed in Gaza were combatants, and how many were civilians. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the bombing campaign had killed "more than 200 terrorists" in Gaza.Lynn Hastings, of the UN aid agency OCHA, said the intense bombing had devastated people's mental health.During the last war in 2014, "we had humanitarian pauses, where people were able to get out," she said."That really speaks to the amount of trauma that was experienced this time, where there was absolutely no pause for people to breathe."The comments that I have heard are not 'I need access to water' -- even though there are 800,000 people who don't have access to clean water right now -- but about the impacts on their lives overall and how they are ever going to recover from this," she said.- 'Here is my home' -Sitting drinking coffee under an olive tree near his destroyed house in Gaza, Abou Yahya was furious."If I had 50 sons, I would tell them to go and fight Israel," he said.An Israeli air strike hit his home last week, reducing it to rubble, and he has vowed to sleep on top of the debris."My family has asked me to leave it, not to sleep here, but I won't budge," he said. "Here is my home".Authorities have begun distributing tents and mattresses in the Gaza Strip, as the UN said at least 6,000 people had been made homeless by the bombardment.Lorries bringing much-needed medicine, food and fuel entered Gaza Friday through the Kerem Shalom crossing after Israel reopened it.Peace talks have stalled since 2014, including over the status of occupied east Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.The latest military escalation started after violent clashes in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, which is also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.Israeli forces had moved in on Palestinian worshippers at the site, toward the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.They had also sought to quell protests against the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, to make way for Jewish settlers.The clashes prompted Hamas to launch rockets from Gaza towards Israel on May 10, and Israel responded with air strikes.On Sunday, Jewish visitors entered the Al-Aqsa compound for the first time in about three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-political-process-amid-gaza-reconstruction-101621800360433.html

Yet in the quiet of the night, these thoughts woke her up," the duke told Oprah.Harry also admitted that he did not go to his family to seek help because he was ashamed of the situation and felt the royals would likely not be able to help."That was one of the biggest reasons to leave, feeling trapped and feeling controlled through fear, both by the media and by the system itself, which never encouraged the talking about this kind of trauma.

24-05-2021||World||Israel reopens borders to small groups of foreign tourists||Israel reopened its borders to foreign tourists on Sunday after a fall in Covid-19 infections but said it would take time for visitors to start arriving and to revive the tourism industry.Under an easing of coronavirus restrictions, the government went ahead with a plan to start letting in small groups of tourists from countries using vaccines it has approved.Foreign airlines are also resuming flights they suspended when Palestinian militants began rocket attacks on Israel this month. A ceasefire has now halted the fighting, helping the government meet Sunday's target date for starting the plan.But registration for the Tourism Ministry's plan opened only last week, so the number of visitors will initially be limited."It is unlikely that the first groups will arrive before the beginning of June," a Tourism Ministry spokeswoman said.Tourism in 2019 hit a record high of 4.55 million visitors, contributing 23 billion shekels ($7.1 billion) to Israel's economy, mainly via small and mid-sized businesses.Under a pilot programme due to continue until June 15, Israel gave the green light to visits by 20 groups of between 5 and 30 tourists from countries including the United States, Britain and Germany.Another 20 groups were chosen to be on standby if any of the first 20 tour operators did not meet Israel's conditions.Tourism Minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen said the ministry was working to allow more tourists to enter to "rehabilitate the tourism industry and bring hundreds of thousands of people back into the workforce".Israeli authorities believe that initially limiting tourism to small groups is the best way to monitor and contain the spread of Covid-19, especially new variants. The plan is to boost the number of groups in June and allow individual tourists to start visiting in July.Visitors will need to show negative PCR tests before flying and to undergo further tests on arrival.Israel has fully vaccinated about 55% of its population and Covid-19 cases have dropped sharply.El Al Israel Airlines Chairman David Brodet said separately on Sunday that he would step down. The government approved a $210 million bailout package for El Al this month that was conditional on steep spending cuts and the airline's owners injecting more cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reopens-borders-to-small-groups-of-foreign-tourists-101621768314400.html
