Negotiations on the MMP, crucial for ensuring greater access to the UK for skilled Indian professionals, had been underway for some time and the memorandum of understanding was signed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and UK home secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday, coinciding with the India-UK Summit. The MMP will facilitate legal movement of students and professionals and enhance bilateral cooperation to combat illegal migration. It also created a new scheme whereby up to 3,000 young Indian professionals can avail employment opportunities in the UK every year for a period of two years. The agreement was a “good step forward” to address an “irritant” in bilateral ties, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The British side had been insisting in the past on the return of illegal migrants to India, while the Indian side had said adequate time was needed to comprehensively confirm the identity and nationality of such persons, the people said. “Now, a compromise or a process solution has been found, and this will address certain misunderstandings, such as a perception that the Indian side didn’t want to take back the illegal migrants,” said one of the people cited above. British high commissioner Alex Ellis told a virtual news briefing on Wednesday that the MMP has mechanisms and timelines for the return of illegal migrants and doesn’t set any targets. “You need to have efficient mechanisms...If you look at the MMP, it sets timelines by which you have to achieve some parts of the processes,” he said. The MMP also specifies the documentation that can be used to prove the Indian nationality of the illegal migrants, he said. The British side wants to address the return of illegal migrants “as swiftly as is legally correct and possible to do”, he added. “Our aim is to have a flow of talented people between the two countries and...India is by far the biggest user of work visas, of any country in the world, for the UK. Nearly 50% of all work visas go to Indian nationals,” Ellis said. Referring to the MMP facilitating the entry of up to 3,000 young professionals every year, Ellis said: “India is the first visa national country with whom we have offered that partnership.” Under the agreement, Indian nationals who are undocumented, in distress abroad or are not being given nationality or residence permits have to be taken back. A joint statement issued after the virtual summit said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson welcomed the signing of the MMP and expressed confidence in the benefits it will have in facilitating legal movement of professionals and combating “organised immigration crime”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiauk-mobility-agreement-addresses-issue-of-illegal-migrants-101620237338069.html

A warmer world could mean more snowfall, but it could also mean more melt at the side of the icesheet."The calculations showed a 95 percent chance that Antarctica would contribute less than 56 centimetres to sea level rise by 2100.But under a "pessimistic scenario", the study showed, Antarctica could raise global oceans by more than that even if humanity manages to cap warming at 1.5°C.'Irreversible' meltA second study, also published Wednesday in Nature, found that limiting warming to 2C above industrial levels was likely to maintain the current rate of ice melt in Antarctica.However, if current emissions-cutting pledges are not intensified by 2060, the models showed that the continent could contribute half a centimetre to sea levels every year by 2100.Furthermore, the study warned that if emissions continue at their current levels, a tipping point will be reached around 2060 which would lead to Antarctic melt that would be "irreversible on multi-century timescales".The research, led by a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, modelled how the ice shelves that keep the Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing into the sea were likely to respond to temperature changes this century.With greater warming, the ice shelves thin and become more fragile, the models showed, risking accelerated melt from the ice sheet, as well as "calving", which is when large chunks of ice break off into the sea, as has happened already in parts of the Arctic."Global warming above 2C increases risk of exceeding a tipping point- where ice shelves thin or collapse, allowing a major acceleration in ice loss- and sea level rise," lead author Robert DeConto told AFP."Once set in motion, the ice retreat is unstoppable, because the buttressing ice shelves don't easily regrow in a warming ocean."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-may-halve-rising-sea-levels-101620235659359.html

The disagreement was resolved after a meeting between Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab and Josep Borrell, the bloc’s top diplomat, on the sidelines of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in London."We are pleased to have reached an agreement together, based on goodwill and pragmatism," Raab said in a statement on Wednesday. "The EU Ambassador will have a status consistent with heads of missions of states, including agrément and presentation of the credentials to the Head of State."Under the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations, envoys representing countries have certain privileges such as immunity from detention and, in some cases prosecution, as well as tax exemptions.Representatives of international organisations whose status is not covered by the convention tend to have limited and less clearly defined privileges.The European Commission, the 27-member bloc’s executive body, said the EU’s 143 delegations around the world had all been granted a status equivalent to that of diplomatic missions of states.(Reporting by William James and Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Alistair Smout)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-grants-full-diplomatic-status-to-eu-ambassador-to-london-101620235298048.html

While the bilateral was originally supposed to be in person, the detection of Covid-19 infection within the Indian delegation caused that to be cancelled.Canada will send up to 350 ventilators in total, including this consignment of 50, “to help respond to the critical situation across India”, a statement from Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, said.The Canadian Government is also providing support through UNICEF’s response to the pandemic in India with the urgent provision of 1,450 oxygen concentrators. This support is in addition to Canada’s $10 million donation to the Canadian Red Cross Society, which is supporting the Indian Red Cross Society’s procurement of essential supplies and medicines.Marc Garneau, Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said, “Canada continues to stand in solidarity with the people of India. We must all unite in this hour of need and work together in the global fight against this virus that is devastating lives across the globe.”Those sentiments were echoed by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan, as he said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is a global challenge and has reminded countries around the world that we are better off with each other’s help. That’s why the Canadian Armed Forces will support and transfer supplies to our friends in India to help defeat Covid-19. Throughout this pandemic and into the future, Canada will continue to be there for our allies in the Indo-Pacific region.”The province of Ontario is also sending 3,000 ventilators to India, and another province Saskatchewan has announced it will dispatch 100 ventilators. “Saskatchewan has a close and growing friendship with India, so it is incumbent on us to assist them where we can during this challenging time in their country,” the province’s Premier Scott Moe said.The Federal package was prepared after “identifying the needs and requirements on the ground and how best Canada can assist, these requested medical supplies have been made available to help bring some relief to those affected by Covid-19 in India,” the country’s Minister of Health Patty Hajdu, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sending-covid-19-relief-supplies-to-india-101620235238135.html

A punitive slowdown on the service has been extended until May 15.TASS said six reports concerning Twitter, each carrying a possible fine of up to 4 million roubles over a failure to remove content, had been lodged with a Moscow court under Russia's Administrative Offences Code.No date for the hearing has been set, TASS said. Roskomnadzor, Twitter and the court did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In April, a court issued three separate fines against Twitter, totalling 8.9 million roubles, over accusations it had failed to delete banned content.Roskomnadzor has said it wants Twitter to delete content that contains child pornography, drug abuse information or calls for minors to commit suicide.Twitter denies allowing its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour, says it has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation, and prohibits the promotion of suicide or self-harm.Russia has in recent months taken steps to exert more control over the operations of foreign social media platforms and tech companies. Russian authorities are suing Google, Facebook and others for allegedly failing to delete posts urging children to take part in illegal protests.The cases were opened after protests nationwide over the jailing in February of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin.Separately, Apple was last week fined $12 million for alleged abuse of its dominance in the mobile applications market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-extra-fines-against-twitter-over-banned-content-reports-101620208437558.html

The money from the winning bid will be donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which promotes math and science education.The plans signal progress for Blue Origin as it vies with Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. to create a market for tourism rides into space. While Bezos’s rocket maker has yet to carry people, Bezos hinted on social media after an April test flight that the time for such a milestone was nearing.Details of the first crewed trip are unknown, but Blue Origin eventually plans to carry six astronauts on 11-minute flights that will cross the Karman line, an oft-cited space border at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles). A crew capsule separates during flight, then lands with parachutes a few miles from the reusable New Shepard rocket. The 60-foot New Shepard landed successfully at Blue Origin’s West Texas launch area last month in its 15th test flight.Virgin Galactic has about 600 customers who have paid as much as $250,000 apiece for a future ride to space. The company stopped taking reservations in late 2018 but plans to resume later this year after it ferries Branson to suborbital space on one of its first flights. Executives have said future pricing is likely to be higher, given the company’s assessment of demand.SpaceX is also preparing for paying customers. As soon as September, Musk’s company will fly technology entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and three others on a multiday mission to low-Earth orbit. The trip was designed to raise money and awareness for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Musk’s rocket maker also will fly four men to the International Space Station next year on a private mission for Axiom Space Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-s-blue-origin-sets-july-20-for-first-human-spaceflight-mission-101620234408444.html
05-05-2021||World||Meghan Markle wins UK copyright claim over letter to father||A British court on Wednesday upheld Meghan Markle's copyright claim against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over its publication of a letter to her father.The ruling by judge Mark Warby means the Duchess of Sussex, as Markle is formally known, has now won every part of her legal claim against the newspaper group, which published a handwritten letter she wrote to her father Thomas Markle.Warby said on Wednesday at a remote hearing lawyers acting for Queen Elizabeth II had assured him the copyright did not belong to the Crown so he was granting "summary judgement" over that remaining aspect of the case, too.In February the High Court issued Meghan with a "summary judgement", meaning she won her privacy and data protection rights claims against Associated Newspapers over the letter's publication without having to go to trial.Warby also ordered the Mail on Sunday to print a front-page statement acknowledging her legal victory.But the judge said at the time her copyright claim needed further scrutiny because the newspaper group suggested Meghan did not fully own the letter's copyright and members of the royal communications team helped her draft it.Meghan's solicitor, Ian Mill QC, said on Wednesday lawyers for the Keeper of the Privy Purse -- the official responsible for the monarch's private funds -- had written "disclaiming any claim to copyright on behalf of the crown".Mill said he also received a letter from lawyers for Jason Knauf, previously communications secretary to the Sussexes, saying he did not write or help draft the letter.The newspaper group's lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, said it was "a matter of regret" that Knauf had not clarified this earlier.Meghan's letter to her estranged father was written a few months after she married Queen Elizabeth II's grandson, Prince Harry, and asked him to stop talking to tabloids and making false claims about her in interviews.Meghan and her husband, the Duke of Sussex, have successfully mounted further legal action over media breaches of their privacy since moving to the United States last year.At the same time the couple have engaged with media on their own terms, giving an explosive interview in March to US chat show host Oprah Winfrey, in which they said unnamed royals had made racist remarks about how dark their son's skin would be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wins-uk-copyright-claim-over-letter-to-father-101620233920501.html

05-05-2021||World||CDC says that Covid-19 cases in US could see sharp decline by July||US US Covid-19 cases could see a sharp decline by July if nationwide vaccination efforts continue to be successful, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Researchers used scenario modeling techniques to show long-term projections of potential trends in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in data released Wednesday in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.As expected, a decline in adherence to anti-pandemic measures, such as social distancing and mask wearing, together with increased transmissability of new variants, led to surges in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, high vaccination rates and compliance with public-health prevention measures showed a sharp decline expected by July.In all four scenarios researchers examined, Covid-19 cases were projected to increase through May nationally. Increases in deaths were also predicted this month, peaking at 11,100 weekly across the US, because of the prevalence of a fast-spreading variant initially seen in the UK and a decline in anti-pandemic mandates.The models also considered age-specific vaccinations, and found that higher coverage in older adults helped to reduce hospitalizations and deaths.Researchers warned the findings should not be considered forecasts of the most likely outcomes, yet instead are intended to help with planning and guiding public-health efforts.In a White House briefing on Wednesday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the models are a reminder that there is a path out of the pandemic. She said the data that once contained grim predictions now offers reasons to be hopeful for what the summer may bring, she said.‘Wild Card’However, Walensky also warned that although the U.S. is seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the variants are a “wild card” that could put states at risk for increasing caseloads, especially if vaccination rates drop and anti-pandemic measures are lifted.“We need to keep vaccinating people but we also need to keep practicing certain prevention interventions to help us get to the predicted good outcomes,” she added.The findings were published a day after President Joe Biden set a target of 70% of U.S. adults receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by July 4, and for 160 million adults to be fully vaccinated by Independence Day.However, data shows that the number of Americans getting their first dose of a vaccine is declining in at least 47 states.Health officials and the White House say the vaccine campaign has moved into a new phase, aimed at people who either haven’t been able to sign up, haven’t made it a priority, or who have hesitations.“We’re going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager,” Biden said during a White House briefing on Tuesday. “We’re going to make it easier than ever to get vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-says-that-covid-19-cases-in-us-could-see-sharp-decline-by-july-101620233589658.html
05-05-2021||World||Israel's president picks Netanyahu opponent Lapid to form government||Israel's president on Wednesday chose Yair Lapid, a centrist politician and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's strongest rival, to try to form a new government, but his path to success was still uncertain.Israel's longest serving leader, Netanyahu, 71, has been fighting to hold onto office through four inconclusive elections since 2019 and corruption allegations that he denies.President Reuven Rivlin, in a televised address announcing his choice of Lapid, said the former finance minister had the pledged support of 56 of parliament's 120 members, still short of a majority."It is clear that parliament member Yair Lapid could form a government that has the confidence of the Knesset, despite there being many difficulties," Rivlin said.In a statement accepting the nomination, Lapid, who heads the Yesh Atid party, said he aimed to establish a government of the left, right and centre "that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one another".But Lapid has ruled out serving in a government with Netanyahu, citing the criminal indictment against the prime minister.The most recent vote on March 23, held while Netanyahu is also on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, yielded no majority for the incumbent or for a loose alliance of rivals from across the political spectrum aiming to topple him.A 28-day mandate to put together a coalition ran out at midnight after Netanyahu failed to agree terms with potential right-wing partners, opening the way for Rivlin to assign the task to another member of parliament.Lapid, 57, also has 28 days to try to form a coalition.Netanyahu, who last lost an election before the turn of the century, was due to make his own address later in the day.POWER SHARINGA power-sharing agreement to end the political stalemate has been widely mooted, in which Lapid would rotate in office with ultranationalist Naftali Bennett, 49, of the Yamina party.Rivlin met the two separately on Wednesday, and each put his own name forward to lead coalition talks, the president said."I have just spoken to Yair Lapid and informed him that I am entrusting him with forming a government, whether this is a government that he will head at the beginning, or a government headed by someone else first in which he will serve as alternate prime minister," Rivlin said in his address.Lapid's party finished second with 17 parliamentary seats to 30 for Netanyahu's Likud in the March election.Netanyahu and his opponents have both courted the support of parties representing Israel's 21% Arab minority, potentially giving them a say over a cabinet for the first time in decades.Five of the Joint Arab List's six legislators threw their support behind Lapid in a letter which the party sent to Rivlin on Wednesday, backing which the president noted in his speech.Failure to break the deadlock would lead to a new election, adding to political turmoil while Israel faces challenges from Iran's nuclear programme and pursues economic recovery after a swift rollout of COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-president-picks-netanyahu-opponent-lapid-to-form-government-101620232729784.html
05-05-2021||World||Boris Johnson makes last pitch to voters before UK ‘super Thursday’ polls||Boris Johnson made a final push for votes ahead of “Super Thursday” elections, a major test of support for his U.K. premiership and the ruling Conservative Party amid a slew of allegations of ‘sleaze’ and cronyism that have undermined the government for months.After the coronavirus outbreak forced one set of local elections to be pushed back by 12 months, two years’ of polls will be held across Britain on Thursday, including for 143 English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and the mayor of London. The parliamentary district of Hartlepool, won by the opposition Labour Party since the 1970s, is also up for grabs.“It’s a very tough set of elections,” Johnson told reporters while campaigning in the West Midlands, where the region’s Conservative mayor Andy Street is bidding for a second term. “We’ll be fighting for absolutely every vote.”Johnson’s Tories have been fighting off allegations of “sleaze” -- British political shorthand for scandals of corruption or other shady dealings -- following revelations about the lobbying of ministers by the now insolvent lender Greensill Capital, and amid accusations of cronyism over how health equipment contracts were awarded at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.In recent weeks the attention has focused on Johnson, who was forced to deny he broke the law over the refurbishment of his apartment in Downing Street. The Tory party faces an inquiry from the Electoral Commission over the affair, while other probes are looking at the role of Johnson and his officials.Poll LeadStill, several recent opinion polls have Johnson’s Tories holding a double-digit lead over Keir Starmer’s Labour Party, bolstered by a significant drop in recent coronavirus cases and a vaccine rollout that has delivered more than 50 million doses.If the polls prove correct, the political focus may shift quickly to Labour and Starmer, especially if the party suffers what would be a humiliating defeat in Hartlepool -- a seat represented by Labour since its inception in 1974.If the Tories take the district, it will only be the third time since World War II that the ruling party has gained a seat from the opposition at a by-election.That would likely increase pressure on Starmer, for whom Thursday’s votes represent his first electoral test as leader as he tries to rebuild the party following its worst drubbing in a general election in nearly 90 years in 2019.Critics say Starmer’s style as a forensic former public prosecutor does not connect with voters, especially pitched against the flamboyant Johnson.On Wednesday, his message was one of managing expectations.“This is the first test and we go into that test fighting for every vote,” Starmer told reporters in Pontefract, northern England on Wednesday. “But I never thought we would climb the mountain we have to climb in just one year -- it is going to take longer than that.”Even if the votes in England go Johnson’s way on Thursday, polls show a very different picture in Scotland. A Scottish National Party majority -- or what would be a pro-independence majority in conjunction with the Greens -- would put the British prime minister under intense pressure to grant another referendum on Scotland breaking away from the U.K., following the first one in 2014.On Wednesday, Johnson gave no ground.“I think that most people in Scotland, most people around the whole of the U.K., feel that this is not the time, as we’re coming forward out of a pandemic together, this is not the time to have a reckless, and I think irresponsible, second referendum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-makes-last-pitch-to-voters-before-uk-super-thursday-polls-101620222702115.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi Arabia, Iran held talks more than once in Iraq: Iraq's president||Iraq has hosted more than one round of talks between regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia, Iraqi President Barham Salih said on Wednesday.Salih made his remarks during an interview broadcast live online with the Beirut Institute think tank. He gave no more details.Diplomats hope the opening of direct channels between Iran and Saudi Arabia will signal a calming of tensions across the Middle East after years of hostilities that have brought the region close to a full-scale conflict.Baghdad hosted talks between officials from its two neighbours and mutual adversaries on April 9 in the only round of talks to have been previously reported.Asked how many rounds of Saudi-Iranian talks Iraq had hosted, Salih replied: "More than once.""It is ongoing, and it is important and it is significant, and for Iraq to be able to play that convening role between these regional actors is important," he added, although he gave no further details on the talks.Washington and Tehran have engaged in indirect talks in Vienna that seek to revive an international pact reached in 2015 that constrained Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for sanctions relief.Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out the deal in 2018 and imposed harsh sanctions on Iran and its regional allies, increasing tension as Iran-backed militias attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and a series of attacks hit oil installations and tankers in the Gulf, where Washington counts Arab states such as Saudi among its close allies.The killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. air strike in Baghdad in January 2020 brought the region close to war. Iran responded with limited missile strikes against a U.S. base in Iraq, the first such direct attack, but took no further action.Iraqis hope for a general regional detente that would allow their country to rebuild instead of being used as an arena for U.S., Gulf Arab and Iranian score-settling.Iraq is trying to rein in powerful Iran-backed militias and deal with a resurgent Islamic State - the Sunni hardline Islamist group that took over a third of Iraq in 2014 and was beaten militarily in 2017 by U.S. forces, the Iraqi military, Kurdish fighters and Iran-aligned paramilitaries."The war against ISIS (Islamic State) and terrorism cannot be won by (only) military means," Salih said. "We have succeeded in liberating our land with the help of our friends but terrorism remains."He added that he wished to see a solution to the Iran-U.S. rivalry that has fuelled violence in Iraq."The Middle East has been condemned to a cycle of conflict and instability over the last few decades... It's time to move beyond," Salih said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-iran-held-talks-more-than-once-in-iraq-iraq-s-president-101620232675358.html

The department of telecommunications on Tuesday gave permission to mobile service operators Bharti Airtel, Reliance JioInfocomm, Vodafone Idea and MTNL and network providers such as state-run C-DOT, Sweden’s Ericsson, Finland’s Nokia and South Korea’s Samsung to conduct trials across the country for six months. Against the backdrop of the year-long military standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE didn’t find a place in the trials. The Indian side has repeatedly said complete disengagement and de-escalation at friction points along the LAC will be the basis for taking forward relations in other spheres, including business. Responding to the department of telecommunications’ decision not to include Chinese firms in the trials, Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian expressed “concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian telecom service providers”. He said, “Relevant Chinese companies have been operating in India for years, providing mass job opportunities and making contribution to India’s infrastructure construction in telecommunications.” Excluding Chinese telecommunications firms from the trials “will not only harm their legitimate rights and interests, but also hinder the improvement of the Indian business environment, which is not conducive to the innovation and development of related Indian industries”, Wang said. “The Chinese side hopes that India could do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory investment and business environment for market entities from all countries, including China, to operate and invest in India,” he added. Since the start of the border standoff in May last year, India banned more than 260 Chinese-origin mobile phone apps and curbed foreign direct investments from China. There have been long-standing security concerns regarding the participation of Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE in India’s 5G trials. Former US president Donald Trump had also pressured India not to allow these firms to participate in the trials. India and China agreed to withdraw their forces from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, but the process of disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points on the LAC has been stalled. The Chinese side’s suggestion that the border issue be delinked from other aspects of bilateral ties such as trade and investment has been rebuffed by New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-at-chinese-firms-being-kept-out-of-india-s-5g-trials-china-101620232237070.html
05-05-2021||World||US births drop to the lowest level since the 1970s||The years-long U.S. baby drought worsened last year, with births dropping 4% from 2019 to the lowest level since 1979.The provisional data for 2020, at 3.6 million births, marks the sixth annual drop in a row. The decline will likely continue in 2021, when the brunt of the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic will be recorded -- with a nine-month delay.Fears of contracting the virus while pregnant, or while in hospital to give birth, combined with job insecurity and government measures limiting social contact and business activity, dissuaded Americans from having babies, according to surveys by Ovia Health, a women’s health technology company.“There are several factors that go into family planning, and an entire ecosystem of support that enables and empowers parents and parents-to-be,” said Paris Wallace, chief executive of Ovia Health. “In 2020, nearly all of those factors were turned on their head, and many of those support systems came crashing down.”Births fell for women in all age groups between 15 and 40 in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The declines were steeper in states where Covid-19 hit the hardest, such as California and New York. And the exodus from crowded urban centers exacerbated declines in places such as New York City.Here are some of the other key findings from the national CDC data released Wednesday:A separate report from the CDC helps assess the impact from people moving out of big metropolitan areas.The percentage of births to New York City residents that occurred outside of the city increased for all months from March through November, the report found. Non-Hispanic White residents were 2.5 times more likely to give birth outside of the city in April and May 2020 than in the same period a year earlier.Almost one-third of women decided to stop or delay trying to getting pregnant because of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a survey of users of Ovia Health’s fertility tracker app. The company polled about 20,000 users regularly since the start of the pandemic.“The chief concerns derailing conception plans centered around health,” said CEO Wallace. Still, “one particularly telling statistic for us at Ovia was that nearly a quarter of couples stopped or delayed trying to conceive because of concerns over finances and job security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-births-drop-to-the-lowest-level-since-the-1970s-101620217184828.html

Jaishankar tweeted he had become aware of “exposure to possible Covid-19 positive cases” and would conduct all his engagements in London virtually, including participation in the G7 meet on Wednesday. Public Health England, which deals with issues such as infectious diseases, asked the entire Indian delegation to self-isolate, according to BBC. A British official confirmed two positive tests among the delegation. British rules require a 10-day self-isolation period. “Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid-19 positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” said a tweet by Jaishankar, who is on his first foreign trip after India was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. Jaishankar subsequently tweeted an image of himself holding a virtual meeting with his Canadian counterpart Marc Garneau. The report of the Indian delegates testing positive immediately triggered a Covid-19 scare at the G7 meeting. There were also questions as to whether members of other delegations had been exposed in any manner. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that all members of the delegation in London had tested negative on Sunday. The Indian side is working with UK health authorities to ascertain the level of exposure and what needs to be done regarding the delegation’s travel plans, the people said. British high commissioner Alex Ellis said in New Delhi that UK authorities have protocols in place for the G7 meeting which will determine how such an incident is handled. “Our approach will be guided by the advice given to us by Public Health England,” he said. While participating in a live virtual event with the theme “Does India have a plan? From survival to revival”, Jaishankar described the second wave of infections as an “all consuming” challenge and contended India’s health system “stands exposed”. Asked if the government took its eye off the ball with regard to the pandemic, he said: “There were repeated advisories going out and public health teams sent out. There was a move to ramp up oxygen production. The reality unfortunately was, as the numbers came down there was an amount of public confidence. This is genuinely not a blame game, but I don’t think anyone in the country can say we kept our guard up all the time.” Jaishankar added, “With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to say we shouldn’t have allowed gatherings of any kind. But there are times when we need to pull up our socks and put the blame game aside. We are a deeply democratic and political country and in a democracy, you can’t not have elections. Elections are sacrosanct.” India is not a member of the G7 and was invited to the meeting as a guest along with Australia, South Korea, South Africa and the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. British authorities put in place strict Covid-secure measures for the meeting, which was billed by the UK as a chance to restart in-person diplomacy. There are daily Covid-19 tests throughout the meeting, including self-test kits and an on-site testing facility, strict guidelines on social distancing, and the size of delegations were limited. The delegates are separated by Perspex screens during talks. Those at the top of the external affairs ministry have all been vaccinated and undergo regular tests for Covid-19 every week. However, there have been several cases of Coronavirus infections among junior and middle-ranking officials of the ministry in New Delhi in recent weeks. The G7 foreign ministers meeting is a precursor to the main summit to be held at the rural English resort of Cornwall in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the summit as a guest by his UK counterpart Boris Johnson. The Indian delegation had not attended any event at the main venue at Lancaster House, and meetings scheduled for Wednesday went ahead as planned. British foreign minister Dominic Raab fist-bumped other G7 members as they arrived at the venue. “We deeply regret that Jaishankar will be unable to attend the meeting today in person,” a senior UK diplomat was quoted as saying by Reuters. “This is exactly why we have put in place strict Covid-19 protocols and daily testing.” Jaishankar met British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday and they signed the Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement to facilitate legal travel. Patel didn’t have to self-isolate because the meeting was held in line with existing rules, and both ministers were wearing masks. Jaishankar held bilateral meetings in London with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and a trilateral meeting with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-scare-at-g7-meet-in-london-as-2-members-of-indian-delegation-test-positive-101620229416707.html
05-05-2021||World||US prez undecided on TRIPS waiver at World Trade Organization||US President Joe Biden is yet to make a decision on a proposal before the WTO to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines as supporters and opponents, newly joined by Republican lawmakers, mount pressure on him in anticipation of a resolution of the issue at the world body’s general council meetings.“We’re going to decide that as we go along. I haven’t made that decision yet,” Biden said of the WTO proposal moved by India and South Africa last October.A group of Democratic lawmakers pressed him hours later, saying it was past time for him to take a call. “Mr President, stop deciding and start acting,” said Lloyd Doggett, one of the 108 Democratic members of congress who have jointly written to the president asking him to put people before pharmaceutical companies, who are opposing the waiver proposal.“Even tomorrow, the administration can act,” he added, referring to the two-day meeting of the general council of the WTO starting on Wednesday in Geneva. “Fight this pandemic by expanding global vaccine manufacturing capacity.” Doggett and some other signatories of the joint letter spoke to reporters on Tuesday, to dial up pressure on the eve of the WTO meet.Also on Tuesday, 12 Republicans urged the Biden administration to continue US opposition to the waiver proposal, which was a decision of the administration of former president Donald Trump.They said in a letter to US trade representative Katherine Tai that the United States should “continue” to oppose the waiver request calling it “extraordinarily broad and unnecessary to accomplish the goal” of ensuring widespread access to Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics to as many people as possible. This group of Republicans is led by Congressmen Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump loyalist and ally, and Darrell Issa.India and South Africa moved the proposal before the WTO last October, when Trump was still in office, calling for temporarily waiver of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to ensure easy and affordable access globally, and specially to developing countries, to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies till the pandemic had been curbed.Supporters of the proposal, which include more than 100 members countries at the WTO and large number of Democratic lawmakers and rights groups in the United States, have called it a “moral imperative”, arguing, as noted by a group of senators in a letter to Biden, for the need to “prioritise people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position”.Opponents of the request - the US, the EU, the UK, Japan and Switzerland at the WTO and pharma companies - argue that intellectual property rights are not a barrier to equitable distribution but scaling up production. They have also argued that the waiver threatens the model of on which medicine research and manufacturing is based, and that many of the developing countries that are intended to benefit from the waiver do not have the capability to manufacture them; and there is a national security wrench thrown in as well, the fear of these patents falling into Chinese into Russian hands.Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to Biden, has jumped into the debate arguing, the waiver will be challenged in courts and the ensuing legal battle hold up supplies for a long time. “Going back and forth, consuming time and lawyers in a legal argument about waivers - that is not the end game,” he told Financial Times. “People are dying around the world, and we have to get vaccines into their arms in the fastest and most efficient way possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-undecided-on-trips-waiver-at-world-trade-organization-101620226476161.html

05-05-2021||World||Suspect held after 2 Asian American women stabbed in San Francisco||Police arrested a man who they said is suspected of stabbing two Asian American women without warning Tuesday afternoon in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood.Officers sent to the scene shortly before 5 p.m. found the wounded women, who were taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on the condition of the women, who were 65 and 85.Witnesses told KPIX-TV that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women and then walked away.A 54-year-old San Francisco man was arrested on suspicion of committing the attack several hours later, police told the station.Police didn't immediately indicate whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime.Asian Americans have been the targets of unprovoked attacks in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the nation in recent months.California prosecutors have filed assault and hate crime charges against a man accused of an attack last week in which he allegedly yelled racial slurs before knocking down Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.In separate San Francisco attacks in March, an 83-year-old Vietnamese man was knocked down and broke his neck in the fall, and a 77-year-old woman was similarly attacked. Police arrested a man on charges of assault and elder abuse in both cases.Another 83-year-old San Francisco Bay Area man was pushed down in February, broke a hip and spent weeks in the hospital and in rehabilitation.In New York, a man was arrested last month on hate crimes charges in connection with last month’s attack on a Chinese immigrant in East Harlem.The 61-year-old victim was collecting cans when he was attacked from behind, knocked to the ground and kicked in the head.That attack echoed an earlier assault on a Filipina American woman near Times Square. A parolee who had been convicted of killing his mother two decades ago was arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspect-held-after-2-asian-american-women-stabbed-in-san-francisco-101620224365310.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi lowers oil prices for Asia as India faces second wave of Covid-19||Saudi Arabia lowered prices for oil shipments to customers in its main market of Asia as a surge in coronavirus cases crimps energy demand in India, the world’s third-largest crude importer.The kingdom’s state energy firm, Saudi Aramco, reduced pricing for June shipments to the continent by between 10 and 30 cents per barrel.The key Arab Light grade for Asia was cut to $1.70 a barrel above the benchmark from $1.80 for May. That’s the first reduction in official selling prices for the grade since December, signaling weakness in Asian oil markets.The reductions had been anticipated in the market. Aramco had been expected to lower Arab Light’s premium by 20 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of seven traders and refiners.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has urged fellow members of OPEC+ to be cautious as the group eases supply cuts started last year when the pandemic was hammering energy markets. The 23-nation cartel plans to increase daily output by just over 2 million barrels through to July, beginning with 600,000 this month. That would still leave production roughly 5 million barrels a day below pre-pandemic levels.Aramco raised pricing to the US by 20 cents a barrel for all grades. The nation is adding jobs amid economic growth and a push for widespread vaccinations. The company cut pricing for all shipments to Northwestern Europe and the Mediterranean, where efforts to bolster the economy and ease lockdowns have met with mixed results.Brent crude has climbed almost 35% this year, closing in on $70 a barrel as vaccination rollouts enable the US, Europe and some other major economies to reopen. Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on Tuesday he’s more optimistic about the outlook for oil.Still, the pandemic has rapidly worsened in India since the start of April. The country is now reporting around 400,000 cases every day.Most Middle Eastern coutries set monthly oil prices as a premium or discount to a benchmark. Aramco’s OSPs serve as a bellwether for oil markets and often lead the pricing trend in the region. Abu Dhabi issued its first OSP based on trading in crude futures this month, a step in its efforts to establish its crude as the regional benchmark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-lowers-oil-prices-for-asia-as-india-faces-second-wave-of-covid19-101620223233525.html
05-05-2021||World||North Korea says Covid-19 vaccines are 'no panacea', warns of lengthy battle||North Korea's state media warned of the prospect of a lengthy battle against the coronavirus and said vaccines developed by global drugmakers were proving to be "no universal panacea".The country has not officially confirmed any infections, although South Korean officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out, as the North had trade and people-to-people links with China before shutting its border early last year.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, said on Tuesday the global pandemic was only worsening, despite the development of vaccines."Novel coronavirus vaccines introduced competitively by various countries were once regarded as a glimmer of hope for humanity that could end the fight against this frightening disease," Rodong Sinmun said."But the situations in many countries are clearly proving that the vaccines are never a universal panacea," it said, citing news reports of rising numbers of new cases overseas and safety concerns surrounding some vaccines.It urged people to brace for a protracted pandemic, describing it as an "inevitable reality" that called for efforts to toughen anti-virus measures and foster loyalty to leader Kim Jong Un and his party.North Korea was expected to receive nearly two million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine by the first half of this year, via the global COVAX sharing programme.But last month Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative for North Korea, said the shipment was delayed due to supply shortages, citing the GAVI alliance, according to South Korean media.In a comment to Reuters, Salvador said North Korea was completing technical requirements to receive the vaccines, but did not elaborate.The GAVI alliance, which co-leads COVAX with the WHO, told Reuters that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of "technical preparedness" and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year."(North Korea) remains eligible for COVAX support. Depending on the supply situation, a Covid-19 vaccine introduction could be envisaged in the second half of 2021," a GAVI official said, adding that concrete dates cannot be defined at this point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-covid-19-vaccines-are-no-panacea-warns-of-lengthy-battle-101620220037238.html
05-05-2021||World||Malaysia tightens restrictions on movement in Kuala Lumpur amid Covid-19 surge||Malaysia tightened restrictions on movements in capital Kuala Lumpur to stem the rise in new Covid infections, a day after imposing similar curbs in Selangor, its richest state.The movement control order, or MCO, will stay in force from May 7 to May 20, Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the protocols already in place for other areas under MCO will apply.Malaysia is facing a surge in Covid infections with the onset of Ramadan -- daily cases topped 3,000 last week for the first time since February -- prompting the government to review movement curbs. The country posted 3,744 new cases on Wednesday, and Selangor topped the list with 1,548 infections followed by Kuala Lumpur at 313. The detection of the Indian Covid-19 variant last week has added to the risk.The country is also struggling with the pace of its vaccination program. Just 2% of Malaysia’s population have completed their vaccination series as of May 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That tally trails neighbors Indonesia and Singapore, and puts Malaysia at risk of falling well short of its vaccination goals for the year.At the current weekly pace of inoculations, the number of single shots given by year-end would cover 21% of the population, according to Tamara Henderson, Asean economist for Bloomberg Economics. That compares with the government’s aim to have 80% of its people vaccinated by February 2022.Measures announced on Wednesday include:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-tightens-restrictions-on-movement-in-kuala-lumpur-amid-covid-19-surge-101620220457019.html
05-05-2021||World||Facebook oversight board upholds Trump suspension||Former President Donald Trump won’t return to Facebook — for now.The social network’s quasi-independent Oversight Board voted to uphold his ban from the platform after his account was suspended four months ago for inciting violence that led to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.While uploading the suspension, the board faulted Facebook for the way it made the decision.“It was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension,” it said.The board says Facebook has six months to reexamine the “arbitrary penalty” it imposed on Jan. 7 and decide on another penalty that reflects the “gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.”The board says the new penalty must be “clear, necessary and proportionate” and consistent with Facebook’s rules for severe violations.The board says if Facebook decides to restore Trump’s accounts, the company must be able to promptly address further violations.Trump has also been permanently banned from Twitter.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.Since the day after the deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, former President Donald Trump's social media accounts have been silent — muzzled for inciting violence using the platforms as online megaphones.On Wednesday, his fate on Facebook, the biggest social platform around, will be decided. The company's quasi-independent Oversight Board will announce its ruling around 9 a.m. ET. If it rules in Trump's favor, Facebook has seven days to reinstate the account. If the board upholds Facebook's decision, Trump will remain “indefinitely” suspended.Politicians, free speech experts and activists around the world are watching the decision closely. It has implications not only for Trump but for tech companies, world leaders and people across the political spectrum — many of whom have wildly conflicting views of the proper role for technology companies when it comes to regulating online speech and protecting people from abuse and misinformation.After years of handling Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram took the drastic step of silencing his accounts in January. In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing Trump to continue using the platform was too great.“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page on Jan. 7.A day before the announcement, Trump unveiled a new blog on his personal website, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.” While the page includes a dramatic video claiming, “A BEACON OF FREEDOM ARISES” and hailing “A PLACE TO SPEAK FREELY AND SAFELY,” the page is little more than a display of Trump’s recent statements — available elsewhere on the website — that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter, the platforms that banished him after the riot.While Trump aides have spent months teasing his plans to launch his own social media platform, his spokesman Jason Miller said the blog was something separate.“President Trump’s website is a great resource to find his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office, but this is not a new social media platform,” he tweeted. “We’ll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.”Barred from social media, Trump has embraced other platforms for getting his message out. He does frequent interviews with friendly news outlets and has emailed a flurry of statements to reporters through his official office and political group.Trump has even said he prefers the statements to his old tweets, often describing them as more “elegant.”Facebook created the oversight panel to rule on thorny content on its platforms following widespread criticism of its difficulty responding swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns. Its decisions so far — all nine of them — have tended to favor free expression over the restriction of content.In its first rulings, the panel overturned four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable material. It ordered Facebook to restore posts by users that the company said broke standards on adult nudity, hate speech, or dangerous individuals.Critics of Facebook, however, worry that the Oversight Board is a mere distraction from the company's deeper problems — ones that can't be addressed in a handful of high-profile cases by a semi-independent body of experts.“Facebook set the rules, are judge, jury and executioner and control their own appeals court and their own Supreme Court. The decisions they make have an impact on our democracies, national security and biosecurity and cannot be left to their own in house theatre of the absurd,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit critical of Facebook. “Whatever the judgement tomorrow, this whole fiasco shows why we need democratic regulation of Big Tech."Gautam Hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at Vanderbilt University, said he finds the Oversight Board structure to be “frustrating and a bit of a sideshow from the larger policy and social questions that we have about these companies."“To some degree, Facebook is trying to create an accountability mechanism that I think undermines efforts to have government regulation and legislation,” Hans said. “If any other company decided, well, we’re just going to outsource our decision-making to some quasi-independent body, that would be thought of as ridiculous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-suspension-101620220639108.html
05-05-2021||World||Election day: What are Scotland, England, Wales voting for?||Voters in England, Scotland and Wales head to the polls on Thursday in a series of different elections, with a vote for the Scottish parliament and one for a seat in Westminster in focus for clues to Britain's future political landscape.Following is a rundown of all the elections which are taking place on Thursday and what they might tell us:SCOTTISH ELECTIONSAll 129 members of the Scottish parliament will be elected on Thursday under a mixed system which allows voters to first vote for an area or constituency member of the Scottish parliament and then another vote for a political party.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said if the Scottish National Party wins a majority it will give her a mandate to demand a second referendum on independence, after one in 2014 when Scots voted by 55% to 45% to stay in the United Kingdom.Sturgeon could still call for another referendum if there is a majority of pro-independence parties in the Scottish parliament. The Greens, which back a new referendum, have supported the SNP in government and could provide Sturgeon will the fire-power to argue for another poll. [L4N2MR2UH]Opinion polls are predicting very different results, from the SNP failing to win a majority to other showing the party winning a narrow or larger majority. HARTLEPOOL BY-ELECTIONVoters in the northern English town of Hartlepool will elect a new member of the Westminster parliament after the member of parliament, Mike Hill, resigned over facing an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment.Hartlepool has voted for the main opposition Labour Party since 1974, a pattern the governing Conservative Party is hoping to break by trying to capitalise on the government's COVID-19 vaccination programme and promises of more jobs.A Conservative victory would also suggest that the public are not overly concerned by a series of scandals buffeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, including one over the financing of the renovation of his flat at No. 11 Downing Street.Labour leader Keir Starmer will also want to hold onto the parliamentary seat after he was elected to take the helm of the party after leftist former leader Jeremy Corbyn failed to win victory in a 2019 national election.It is Starmer's first test as Labour leader and if the seat is won by the Conservatives, he could face questions from leftist members of his party.MAYORSLondon will vote in elections for the mayor of London, a post which has outsized influence over government even though it does not run the City of London financial district.Incumbent Sadiq Khan of Labour, London's first Muslim mayor, is expected to win again on Thursday. Londoners will also elect 25 members of the London Assembly.There are also elections for mayors in different regions and cities across England, with the Conservatives hoping to hold onto the West Midlands post among others.WALESWelsh voters will elect the 60 members of the Welsh parliament, called Senedd Cymru, under a mixed system when they are offered two ballots - one for the constituency and another for a party for the region.Labour has won the biggest share of the vote in every parliamentary election since 1999 and faces its biggest challenge from the Conservatives, which are still behind in the opinion polls.ENGLAND'S LOCAL ELECTIONSElections will be held for 143 English local councils, or more than 5,000 seats. The Conservatives want to increase their numbers of local councils, especially in areas in northern and central England, which voted, often for the first time, for Johnson's party in 2019.There will also be elections for Police and Crime Commissioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/election-day-what-are-scotland-england-wales-voting-for-101620219453392.html

Tedros has said repeatedly that the U.N. agency is open to reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-who-to-set-up-global-data-hub-to-fight-pandemics-101620219090433.html
05-05-2021||World||Citizens in several nations keen to get Covid-19 shots but governments fail to cater to demands: Report||Governments of several countries where people have shown extreme willingness to get inoculated if vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are given for free have only achieved limited success in their vaccination drive, the data released by Gallup, an American analytics and advisory company, on Tuesday showed.The study conducted before the vaccination drive against Covid-19 was launched in several countries, listed more than 30 nations where at least more than 70% of its population wanted to get the vaccines but only a handful of those nations are on track to achieve those targets.In Myanmar, 96% of the respondents said that they would take the shots if provided for free. The study also found that if Myanmar does achieve this target, it would achieve the higher end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 90%. But the nation which continues to witness endless violence following the February coup has only been able to fully vaccinate 0.1% of its population, according to a vaccination dashboard compiled by news agency the New York Times.People in many countries also showed willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 but only a few of those nations have been able to cater to its citizens’ demand of vaccination. Among the top 10 nations listed below where citizens expressed extreme willingness to get vaccinated, barring Iceland (10% of the target population fully vaccinated) and Denmark (11%), the rest have achieved very less success in vaccinating its citizens.Percentage of people who agreed to get vaccinated if a vaccine to prevent coronavirus was available right now at no costIndia, which ranks 11th in the table, where 82% of the people want to get vaccinated, has been able to administer the vaccine to only 8% of the population with only the first dose of the vaccine.On the other hand, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom were among the countries where the vaccination rates corroborated to the percentage of people who wanted to get the shots. In Israel, at least 61% people wanted to get vaccinated and the nation has administered 60% of its target population with one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The UAE, where 68% of the population wished to get vaccinated, administered the entire population with at least one dose of the vaccine. In the United Kingdom 75% of the population wished to get the vaccine while the British government has been able to vaccinate 49% of the population with at least one dose of the vaccine.Vaccine scepticism could impact the target of achieving herd immunity in most countries, the research conducted by Gallup shows. It surveyed 117 countries and areas found out that despite the pandemic continuing to claim lives across the world and few nations facing a severe second wave of coronavirus disease, nearly three in ten adults refused to be vaccinated. This number translates roughly to 1.3 billion people.The study also pointed out that if people who are keen to take the vaccine against Covid-19, do actually get their shots, only 38 out of the 117 countries surveyed would achieve the lower end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 70%. Herd immunity is achieved when most of the population in an area is immune to a certain disease which then provides immunity to those who are not immune to the disease.Attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccine vary across nations. The study highlighted that Myanmar would be among the countries to achieve the higher end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 90%, as 96% of the people surveyed in the nation said that they would take the shots if provided for free.Several nations have also expressed severe unwillingness towards getting vaccinated. Russia, whose Sputnik V vaccine is being considered as one of the most effective vaccines against Covid-19 in many nations, has failed to generate enough enthusiasm among Russians as only 61% of the respondents say that they will take the vaccine.Until mid-April, Russia has fully vaccinated at least 5.3% of its target population and has administered one dose to at 8.5% of its target population.A section of citizens of Bulgaria (61%) and Czech Republic (53%) surveyed also disagreed to take the vaccine, which could be a cause of concern, as Czech Republic, which leads the globe in overall deaths per capita from the virus, rushes towards reopening the country. Bulgaria, who as of mid-April reported the second-highest 14-day Covid-19 death rate in the European Union is also reopening at a quicker pace despite rise in number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizens-in-several-nations-keen-to-get-shots-but-govts-fail-to-cater-to-demands-101620216220710.html

Well, we're ready to use them," Girardin told France's National Assembly on Tuesday."Regarding Jersey, I remind you of the delivery of electricity along underwater cables ... Even if it would be regrettable if we had to do it, we'll do it if we have to."With a population of 108,000, Jersey imports 95% of its electricity from France, with diesel generators and gas turbines providing backup, according to energy news agency S&P Global Platts.Jersey's government said that France and the European Union had expressed their unhappiness with the conditions placed on the issuance of fishing licenses.Jersey’s external relations minister, Ian Gorst, said the island had issued permits in accordance with the post-Brexit trade terms, and that they stipulated any new license must reflect how much time a vessel spent in Jersey's waters before Brexit."We are entering a new era and it takes time for all to adjust. Jersey has consistently shown its commitment to finding a smooth transition to the new regime," Horst said in a statement.The rocky island sits just 14 miles (23 km) off the northern French coast and 85 miles (137 km) south of Britain's shores.The French threat is the latest flare up over fishing rights between the two countries.Last month, French trawlermen angered by delays to licences to fish inside British waters blocked lorries carrying UK-landed fish with burning barricades as they arrived in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Europe's largest seafood processing centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-threatens-to-turn-lights-off-in-jersey-over-brexit-fish-row-101620215044777.html
05-05-2021||World||Ousted Myanmar lawmakers announce 'people's defence force'||A shadow government of ousted Myanmar lawmakers said Wednesday it has set up a "people's defence force" to protect civilians, as the police and military deploy deadly arms against anti-coup protesters.The country has been in turmoil since the military deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering a mass uprising of daily protests and a nationwide boycott from civil servants.So far, nearly 770 people have been killed in deadly crackdowns, according to a local monitoring group -- though the junta has a far lower death toll which it blames on "rioters".A group of ousted lawmakers who call themselves the "National Unity Government" (NUG) and are working underground to oppose the junta announced their own "people's defence force" to "stop the use of violence against people".It is intended as a precursor to a "Federal Union Army", the NUG said in a statement -- referring to a long-touted idea of bringing anti-coup dissidents together with Myanmar's ethnic rebel fighters into an army.Some in the anti-coup movement have called for unity among Myanmar's myriad rebel armed groups to defeat the military's well-trained soldiers.A few of the groups have condemned the military coup and the use of violence against unarmed civilians. Some are also providing shelter and even training to dissidents who flee into their territories.But the more than 20 groups -- made up of disparate ethnic minorities agitating for more autonomy -- have long distrusted the ethnic Bamar majority, including lawmakers affiliated with Suu Kyi's government.An official of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) -- which has said it is sheltering anti-coup dissidents -- expressed scepticism at the NUG announcement."As far as I know, it is the people themselves who walk into the jungle and receive the training from the (ethnic armed organisations)... it is not decided by the NUG," said KNPP vice-chair Khu Oo Reh.He added that while the NUG has spoken with many rebel groups about a militia made up of civilians, "I have no idea what their intentions are."Another group along Myanmar's eastern border, which declined to be named, said the statement was "confusing".Before the NUG's announcement Wednesday, some communities across Myanmar -- especially in townships that have seen a high death toll at the hands of police -- have announced local "defence forces" for their areas.State media reported Tuesday night that five protesters -- including a former MP with Suu Kyi's party -- were killed when they tried to plant a bomb in the southern region of Bago.Bombs have exploded sporadically across the country in recent weeks, especially in Yangon. Authorities have blamed some of the blasts on "instigators".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-myanmar-lawmakers-announce-people-s-defence-force-101620211903843.html
05-05-2021||World||Thailand fights to contain Covid-19 surge in Bangkok||Health officials rushed to vaccinate thousands of people in Bangkok's biggest slum on Wednesday as new Covid-19 cases spread through densely populated low-income areas in the capital's central business district.The government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha is facing mounting criticism for its handling of a surge that began in early April.Thailand recorded 2,112 new cases and 15 deaths on Wednesday. The country has been reporting about 2,000 cases a day recently, often with double-digit deaths in the third mass outbreak since the pandemic started.More than half of the 74,900 cases reported by the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration, or 46,037, have been confirmed since April 1. A total of 318 people are known to have died from the virus.The CCSA said about 30,000 people were being treated in hospitals and in field hospitals constructed to make up for the lack of enough hospital beds and intensive care units, especially in Bangkok.Thailand had managed to control the spread of the virus by closing its borders to almost all travelers and then imposing lengthy mandatory quarantines. Apart from that, life had largely returned to normal before the latest surge, which began in nightclubs and bars in Bangkok.Health officials warned that caseloads were bound to jump after millions traveled around the country during Songkran national holidays in mid-April, even as authorities were urging people to stay home and take more precautions against the virus.The country has vaccinated only 2% of its 60 million people in a faltering, delayed inoculation program as the government initially chose to use only two vaccines, China's Sinovac and one made by AstraZeneca.Officials say they will begin supplying millions of vaccines in June with the aim of vaccinating 70% of the population in 2021.The current outbreak spread from night entertainment spots to the Klong Toey area, Bangkok's largest slum with about 100,000 people living in a 1 square mile area. There, health workers are trying to vaccinate up to 3,000 people per day, hoping to have at least 50,000 people inoculated within two weeks. They are also testing intensively to try to identify and isolate those who are infected.But that may not be enough, local leaders say.“There are all kinds of people in Klong Toey, from day laborers and taxi drivers to business owners. They travel to work in different areas, not only in Bangkok but also other provinces. We cannot seal the area and cannot stop them from moving around,” Sittichat Angkhasittisiri, chairman of the Klong Toey Block 1-2-3 community, told The Associated Press.On Wednesday, many newly reported cases were in the nearby Lumphini district, which is home to nearly 30,000 people, most of them also living in crowded old houses in narrow alleys squeezed between massive construction projects, canals, factories, expressways and embassies.“We found a confirmed case on April 20. He tried to get a (hospital) bed but could not, so finally he had to isolate himself in his car . . . because he was afraid of spreading it to family members,” Angkhasittisiri said. “After that, more cases were found. “The cluster in Klong Toey has brought added misfortune to some of Bangkok's most vulnerable residents, said Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, founder of Klong Toey-based charity Duang Prateep Foundation.“Many of them are told to stop working when people know they are from Klong Toey. Plus, it is not easy at all when those high risk people have to keep themselves in very small places for two weeks. I am very worried about their mental health,” she said.“If we had gotten vaccines since the beginning of this year, we would not face a situation like this.”The local AstraZeneca producer hopes to start distributing its first batch of locally made vaccines in June — and about 16 million people have registered. Inoculations will prioritize people over 60 or those with pre-existing medical conditions.The tens of thousands of foreigners legally living in Thailand do not know if there will be any way to be vaccinated anytime soon.“The vaccines right now are only reserved for Thai people who are now at a high-risk level or living in the severe outbreak areas. Expats should wait for a clear policy from the government," the newspaper Bangkok Post quoted Rungrueng Kitphati, spokesperson for the Public Health Ministry, as saying. ″There will soon be a surplus of vaccines so it will not be difficult to get them.”Thailand had begun moving to revive its devastated tourism industry in July by allowing vaccinated foreigners to visit tourist resorts such as Phuket. It's unclear if those plans will go ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-fights-to-contain-covid-19-surge-in-bangkok-101620205784455.html
05-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Australian citizen sues PM Morrison over flight ban from India||A 73-year-old Australian, who is stranded in India since March last year, has filed a lawsuit before a Sydney court against the federal government for banning flights from India and threatening to prosecute those attempting to enter the country with the possibility of a jail term and a penalty, saying the move is “unconstitutional”.The lawyers of Gary Newman, who is stranded in Bengaluru since March last year, have argued in the federal court in Sydney that the ban was “unconstitutional”.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home, if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).Michael Bradley and Chris Ward lodged the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon.The application firstly said that the Commonwealth was acting outside its powers and secondly, Health Minister Greg Hunt's declaration was in breach of an implied freedom to return home, ABC news reported.Newman is represented by Bradley and Ward who would work as pro bono to overturn the temporary ban. Pro bono generally refers to services that are rendered by a professional for free or at a lower cost for the public good.At a brief directions hearing, Ward said Newman was in Bengaluru and "wishes" to return home, but had been "prevented" from doing so by Hunt's declaration.Burley ordered that the proceedings be expedited and a formal hearing date be determined within the next 24 to 48 hours.On Saturday, Hunt issued a statement on the travel ban for Australians returning from India.The statement said: ''the Government will implement a temporary pause on travellers from India entering Australian territory if the passenger has been in India within 14 days of the person’s time of departure”.The temporary pause, announced after the National Cabinet, was based on advice about the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.The pause came into effect on Monday and will be reviewed on May 15.Hunt said the risk assessment that informed the decision was based on the proportion of overseas travellers in quarantine in Australia who have acquired a COVID-19 infection in India.The move triggered a backlash with several lawmakers, doctors, civil societies and businessmen criticising the government for "abandoning" Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a hefty penalty and a jail term.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, while speaking to reporters, defended the decision and said that the pause “is working” which means it will enable the government to get Australian residents and their immediate families back on repatriation flights.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past one week.According to Indian health ministry data on Wednesday, a record 3,780 fresh COVID-19 fatalities were registered in a single day in India, taking the death toll to 2,26,188, while 3,82,315 new coronavirus infections were recorded.With the fresh cases, the total tally of COVID-19 cases in the country climbed to 2,06,65,148.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australian-citizen-sues-pm-morrison-over-flight-ban-from-india-101620208131215.html

05-05-2021||World||Covid: 155 mn across the world suffer from food crisis, global hunger rates rise||The world faced its worst hunger problem in at least five years in 2020 on the back of the coronavirus crisis, and the outlook remains grim again this year.Some 155 million people across 55 countries -- more than the population of Russia -- suffered from issues ranging from a food crisis to famine, according to a report with data from more than a dozen agencies. That’s up 20 million from 2019, with economic shocks overtaking extreme weather as the No. 2 cause.The worsening situation highlights how the pandemic has exacerbated food inequalities around the world, on top of extreme weather and political conflicts that are stifling access to key staples. Consumers are now also contending with rising food costs as rampant Chinese demand stretches global crop supplies.“Covid-19 has been exacerbating fragilities,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies and resilience at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. “Its restrictions, for example, on the movement of goods and people, has resulted in widespread income losses, especially for those people who rely on informal work in urban households.”Conflict and insecurity remain the largest causes of hunger, responsible for almost two-thirds of those facing food crises, according to the report created with help from agencies including the European Commission and United Nations’ World Food Programme. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen and Afghanistan are some of the most-affected nations.The number of people facing hunger primarily from economic shocks, including those related to the pandemic that cut jobs and incomes, jumped nearly 70% last year to 40.5 million.Supply chain disruptions also caused spikes in food prices, while higher inflation or weaker currencies in import-dependent nations made food less affordable, according to the report. Women have been particularly hard hit, as they’ve been more vulnerable to losing jobs.Global hunger is expected to hold above pre-pandemic levels this year, affecting more than 142 million across 40 countries, the report showed. Conflicts remain a problem and economic hardship could intensify due to the coronavirus crisis, the agencies said.Last year, about 28 million people were in an “emergency” state of food insecurity, or worse.“We are extremely concerned,” Burgeon said. “When we look at the early data we have from 2021, we see that this number has already increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-155-mn-across-the-world-suffer-from-food-crisis-global-hunger-rates-rise-101620207754991.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi Arabia considers barring overseas haj pilgrims for second year due to Covid-19: Reports||Saudi Arabia is considering barring overseas pilgrims from the annual haj for the second year running as COVID-19 cases rise globally and worries grow about the emergence of new variants, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Such a move would restrict the pilgrimage to Mecca, a once in a lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, to Saudi nationals and residents of the kingdom who were vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 at least months prior to attending.While discussions about a possible ban have taken place, there has been no final decision on whether to pursue it, they said.Before the pandemic enforced social distancing globally, some 2.5 million pilgrims used to visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long haj, and the lesser, year-round umrah pilgrimage, which altogether earned the kingdom about $12 billion a year, according to official data.As part of economic reform plans pursued by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom was hoping to raise the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and aimed to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030. It aims to earn 50 billion riyals ($13.32 billion) of revenues from the haj alone by 2030.Two sources familiar with the matter said authorities have suspended earlier plans to host pilgrims from overseas, and will only allow domestic pilgrims who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 at least six months before the pilgrimage.Restrictions will be applied on the age of participants as well, one of the sources said.A second source said the plans were initially to allow some numbers of vaccinated pilgrims from abroad, but confusion over types of vaccines, their efficacy and the emergence of new variants has pushed officials to reconsider.The government media office did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam’s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, barred foreigners from the haj last year due to the pandemic for the first time in the kingdom's modern history, allowing it only to a limited number of Saudi citizens and residents.COVID-19 infections are still rising in 35 countries globally. There have been at least 153,508,000 reported infections and 3,351,000 reported deaths caused by the new coronavirus so far.India leads the world in the daily average number of new deaths reported, accounting for one in every four deaths reported worldwide each day.Crowds of millions of pilgrims from around the world could be a hotbed for virus transmission, and in the past some worshippers have returned to their countries with respiratory and other diseases.In February, the government suspended entry to the kingdom from 20 countries, with the exception of diplomats, Saudi citizens, medical practitioners and their families, to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.The ban, which is still in place to date, includes people arriving from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, the United States, Britain, South Africa, France, Egypt, Lebanon, India and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-considers-barring-overseas-haj-pilgrims-for-second-year-due-to-covid-19-reports-101620207741230.html

The curbs are similar to those last imposed at the end of 2020.“Despite of all the exceptional efforts we are making, the Covid-19 situation in our country is critical right now with many daily cases reported last week,” Peggy Vidot, the nation’s health minister, said at a press conference Tuesday.The Indian Ocean archipelago, which has a population of about 98,000, is dependent on tourism for much of its foreign exchange and acted quickly to begin vaccinations in January using a donation of Chinese vaccines from the United Arab Emirates. It has procured other vaccines since.By April 12, 59% of the doses administered were Sinopharm vaccines and the rest were Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made under license in India.To date 62.2% of its eligible population is fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. That compares with 55.9% for Israel, the next most vaccinated nation.Officials at the press conference gave little detail on what could be behind the infection surge other than to say people were taking fewer precautions against the virus than before and the surge may be due to celebrations after Easter.The number of active cases in the nation rose to 1,068 on May 3 from 612 on April 28, according to health ministry announcements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seychelles-world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-reinforces-curbs-as-covid-cases-rise-101620206992202.html
05-05-2021||World||French journalist says kidnapped by jihadists in Mali, in video||A French journalist, in a video circulating on social media Wednesday, said he had been kidnapped in Mali in early April by a jihadist group with links to Al-Qaeda.The brief video could not be independently verified, although an official at the French foreign ministry confirmed that Olivier Dubois, who worked for several media, including the international TV channel France 24 and Liberation daily, was missing.In the video, which lasts about 20 seconds, Dubois said he was abducted on April 8 in the central region of Gao by the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), the biggest jihadist alliance in the Sahel.He is seen seated on the ground, on a green sheet that could be a tent, dressed in a light pink traditional gown, with his beard trimmed.The foreign ministry official said, "We are in contact with his family and the Malian authorities. We are carrying out the usual technical verifications" of the video.Liberation, for which Dubois had been writing regularly since April last year, declined to make any immediate comment.Mali has been struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency which first broke out in the north of the country in 2012 before spreading to the centre and neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes, while the economic impact on one of the world's poorest countries has been devastating.Abductions have been frequent, both of Malians and foreigners.The last French hostage was Sophie Petronin, a 75-year-old aid worker, who was freed in October last year along with Malian politician Soumaila Cisse, who has since died, and Italians Nicola Chiacchio and Pier Luigi Maccalli.There has been consistent speculation that a ransom was paid for the four hostages, something that has never been confirmed by the Malian government, along with the release of 200 prisoners, some of whom were jihadists.In October, Switzerland was informed that the GSIM had killed an evangelical missionary who had been kidnapped in Timbuktu in January 2016.In March, the Swiss foreign ministry said the woman's body had been recovered and formally identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-journalist-says-kidnapped-by-jihadists-in-mali-in-video-101620205913486.html
05-05-2021||World||Iraq pushes Covid-19 vaccine rollout amid widespread apathy, rumors||Iraq’s vaccine roll-out had been faltering for weeks. Apathy, fear and rumors kept many from getting vaccinated despite a serious surge in coronavirus infections and calls by the government for people to register for shots.It took a populist Shiite cleric’s public endorsement of vaccinations — and images of him getting the shot last week — to turn things around.Hundreds of followers of Muqtada al-Sadr are now heading to clinics to follow his example, underscoring the power of sectarian loyalties in Iraq and deep mistrust of the state.“I was against the idea of being vaccinated. I was afraid, I didn’t believe in it,” said Manhil Alshabli, a 30-year-old Iraqi from the holy city of Najaf. “But all this has changed now.”“Seeing him getting the vaccine has motivated me,” said Alshabli, speaking by phone from Najaf where he and many other al-Sadr loyalists got their shots, Alshabli compared it to soldiers being energized when they see their leader on the front line.Iraq has grappled with a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. New case numbers spiked to over 8,000 per day last month, the highest they have ever been. The surge was driven largely by public apathy toward the virus. Many routinely flout virus-related restrictions, refusing to wear face masks and continuing to hold large public gatherings.Daily rates have decreased in the last week, with 5,068 new cases reported on Monday.Iraq’s Health Ministry has repeatedly tried to reassure Iraqis that the vaccines are not harmful, but this has not convinced many who harbor long-standing distrust of the health care system.Iraq’s centralized system, largely unchanged since the 1970s, has been ground down by decades of war, sanctions and prolonged unrest since the 2003 U.S. invasion. Successive governments have invested little in the sector.Many avoid going to public hospitals altogether. Last month, a massive blaze tore through the coronavirus ward in a Baghdad hospital, killing more than 80 people and injuring dozens. Iraq’s Health Minister Hasan al-Tamimi was suspended for alleged negligence, and resigned Tuesday over the incident.So far, fewer than than 380,000 people have been fully vaccinated in the country of 40 million.Last week, as sluggish vaccination efforts continued, pictures of the black-turbaned al-Sadr, wearing a black mask and getting jabbed in the arm, began circulating on social media.Shortly after, his followers launched a vaccination campaign, calling on supporters to join them and posting photos of themselves carrying his posters while seated at medical centers receiving the vaccine.The Health Ministry has cashed in on the campaign, publishing on its Facebook page the photo of al-Sadr getting the shot, saying his vaccination was meant to encourage all citizens to do the same.Faris Al-Lami, assistant professor of community medicine at the University of Baghdad, said the government is widely viewed as corrupt and that its actions since the start of the pandemic only deepened the public's mistrust.He cited certain early practices, such as using security forces to take patients from their homes as if they were criminals, and holding up the burials of those who died of the virus for several weeks.Al-Lami also pointed to what he said are current problematic policies. For example, he said high-risk patients, such as those with chronic or immunodeficiency diseases, have to wait inside hospitals to get their shots, putting them at high risk of infection. Meanwhile, people with personal connections can get them easily.He said it's a positive development when the vaccination of a political or religious figure encourages people to get their shots. “But the ideology that is based upon blindly following anyone’s decision is a disaster in itself,” he said.Iraq received 336,000 new doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in late March and Iraqis above the age of 18 are qualified to get the jab. Last month, the first shipment of Pfizer doses arrived in the country, with 49,000 shots.“All the vaccines that arrived in Iraq are safe and effective ... but until this moment, there are some citizens who are afraid of taking the vaccine as a result of malicious rumors,” said Ruba Hassan, a Health Ministry official.The Health Ministry has introduced measures to push Iraqis to get the shots. They include travel restrictions for those unable to produce a vaccination card and dismissals of employees at shops, malls and restaurants. While the measures have led more people to seek out vaccinations, they have also confused and angered a still largely reticent public.Restaurant owners said they were blindsided by the measures, uncertain if it meant they would face closure if they refused them.“There is no clear law to follow,” said Rami Amir, 30, who owns a fast food restaurant in Baghdad. “I don’t want all my staff to be vaccinated because they might have severe side effects or complications,” he said, echoing widespread skepticism.Omer Mohammed, another restaurant owner, said applicants for a new job at his eatery dropped out when he said vaccination cards were a necessary prerequisite.Medical professionals were prioritized to receive the vaccine and were able to pre-register in January when Iraq received its first shipment of 50,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine.When recent medical school graduate Mohammed al-Sudani, 24, went to get vaccinated this month he said the process was “bittersweet.” He showed up with no previous registration for the AstraZeneca vaccine. He didn’t need it. There was barely anyone there.The next week he brought two of his aunts to the same center. There were only two other people in the waiting room.“The nurse came in and asked them to call their relatives and friends to come to raise the number to at least 10 people because the jabs inside the vaccine kits were only valid for 6 hours,” he said.It was a different scene in hospitals that carry Pfizer shots. Tabark Rashad, 27, headed to Baghdad’s al-Kindi hospital last week.

Aiming to make it easier to get shots, Biden on Tuesday called for states to make vaccines available on a walk-in basis and he will direct many pharmacies to do likewise.His administration for the first time also is moving to shift doses from states with weaker demand to areas with stronger interest in the shots."You do need to get vaccinated,” Biden said from the White House. “Even if your chance of getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk? It could save your life or the lives of somebody you love.”Biden’s goal equates to delivering at least the first shot to 181 million adults and fully vaccinating 160 million. It's a tacit acknowledgment of the declining interest in shots.Already more than 56% of American adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and nearly 105 million are fully vaccinated. The US is currently administering first doses at a rate of about 965,000 per day — half the rate of three weeks ago, but almost twice as fast as needed to meet Biden's target.“I’d like to get it 100%, but I think realistically we can get to that place between now and July Fourth," Biden said of his new goal.He said the administration would focus on three areas as it tries to ramp up the pace of vaccinations:— Adults who need more convincing to take the vaccine.— Those who have struggled or are in no hurry to obtain a shot.— Adolescents aged 12-15, once federal authorities approve vaccination for that age group.Acknowledging that “the pace of vaccination is slowing,” Biden predicted the inoculation effort is “going to be harder” when it comes to convincing “doubters” of the need to get their shots.He said the most effective argument to those people would be to protect those they love. “This is your choice: It’s life and death.”Biden's push comes as his administration has shifted away from setting a target for the US to reach “herd immunity," instead focusing on delivering as many shots into arms as possible. Officials said Biden's vaccination target would result in a significant reduction in Covid-19 cases heading into the summer.To that end, the Biden administration is shifting the government's focus toward expanding smaller and mobile vaccination clinics to deliver doses to harder-to-reach communities. It is also spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to boost interest in vaccines through education campaigns and greater access to shots through community organizations that can help bring people to clinics.Biden touted creative efforts to make it “easier and more fun” to get vaccinated, such as grocery stores offering discounts to shoppers who come to get shots and sports leagues that hold promotions to gets shots for their fans.Ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's expected authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for kids aged 12-15, the White House is developing plans to speed vaccinations for that age group. Biden urged states to administer at least one dose to adolescents by July Fourth and work to deliver doses to pediatricians' offices and other trusted locations, with the aim of getting many of them fully vaccinated by the start of the next school year.While younger people are at dramatically lower risk of serious complications from Covid-19, they have made up a larger share of new virus cases as a majority of US adults have been at least partially vaccinated and as higher-risk activities like indoor dining and contact sports have resumed in most of the country.Officials hope that extending vaccinations to teens — who could get the first dose in one location and the second elsewhere, if necessary — will further accelerate the nation’s reduced virus caseload and allow schools to reopen with minimal disruptions this fall.The urgency to expand the pool of those getting the shots is rooted in hopes of stamping out the development of new variants that could emerge from unchecked outbreaks and helping the country further reopen by the symbolic moment of Independence Day, exactly two months away. Though White House officials privately acknowledge the steep challenge, Biden sounded an optimistic note.“The light at the end of the tunnel is actually growing brighter and brighter,” Biden said.Biden's speech comes as the White House announced a shift away from a strict allocation of vaccines by state population. The administration says that when states decline to take all the vaccine they have been allocated, that surplus will shift to states still awaiting doses to meet demand.Governors were informed of the change by the White House on Tuesday morning.This week, Iowa turned down nearly three quarters of the vaccine doses available to the state for next week from the federal government because demand for the shots remains weak. Louisiana, meanwhile, hasn’t drawn down its full vaccine allocation from the federal government for the last few weeks.Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows Louisiana’s coronavirus vaccination rate is well behind most states. About 27% of state residents are fully vaccinated while 32% have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the state health department.The White House previously resisted efforts to distribute vaccine by metrics other than population. Biden rebuffed Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month when she requested more doses as her state was experiencing a surge in virus cases. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at the time nearly all states were ordering at or near their population allocations, which is no longer the case.Individual states have made similar shifts internally to account for changing demand. Last week, Washington state changed the way it allocates coronavirus vaccine to its counties. Previously the state doled out supplies to counties proportionate to their populations. But now amounts will be based on requests from health care providers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-united-states-prez-biden-aims-to-vaccinate-70-of-adults-by-july-4-101620204218926.html

It was India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, but unfortunately, an unexpected situation came out and I had to postpone the India part to a later stage. But I will absolutely make sure that I'll go to India as well,” the UN General Assembly President said, referring to India’s Covid-19 crisis.Asked whether the UN will be able to host a regular General Assembly session in September, he said: “It would be wrong if we make a decision now for September on how the participation will be. Will it be a hybrid format? Or will we have again 10,000 people at UN Headquarters? What happens to civil society? What happens to the bilaterals? These are all questions we have in our minds.”He said June will be a proper time to discuss with the US, the host country of the UN, and local authorities on the Covid-19 situation and feasibility of holding the UN General Assembly.With New York City aiming to "fully reopen" on July 1, Bozkir said it will “give us a signal on whether we can have a different type of a high-level week than we had last September”, when all meetings were mostly virtual with minimal in-person presence in the UN premises.“The important thing is not to risk any people's health… we must absolutely go along with the mitigation measures, we must listen to what science is saying to us and we must not really open everything without any precaution.“If I were the host country, I wouldn't have made any plans for September as of now – because with this pandemic, unfortunately, we are living day by day or week by week. We suddenly see something happening, like what happens in India. Nobody was expecting this suddenly to happen. It changes all the plans. So, I think it's better to start talking about it, to start discussing it, and then leave it to the science and to the local authorities,” he added.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-general-assembly-president-postpones-india-trip-due-to-covid19-101620197004711.html

"We need new steps."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/activist-greta-thunberg-says-global-leaders-still-in-denial-over-climate-101620196552094.html

"Genocide is the gravest of international crimes and a formal legal determination should only be reached following a rigorous assessment on the basis of international law."She added that New Zealand in concert with other governments would keep up its calls for China to provide meaningful and unfettered access to the United Nations and other independent observers to ascertain the situation.Nations such as the United States and Canada have declared China’s actions in far western Xinjiang as genocide, but Australia's parliament stopped short of a similar move this year.In a speech in Auckland this week, Chinese ambassador Wu Xi said accusations of forced labour or genocide in Xinjiang were lies and rumours fabricated by anti-China forces without any evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-calls-out-uyghur-rights-abuse-in-china-doesn-t-label-it-genocide-101620191136498.html
05-05-2021||World||US prez considering political ally as ambassador to India||US President Joe Biden is considering Los Angeles mayor and a former co-chair of his presidential campaign Eric Garcetti as ambassador to India, according to a report.Garcetti, 50, completes two terms as LA mayor in 2022 and cannot seek a third. He had once mulled a presidential run himself and then opted out.Axios news publication reported the possibility of Garcetti being sent to India, citing people familiar with the matter.Biden is expected to start rolling out his nominees for ambassadorships later this month. Presidents tend to pick political and campaign donors and allies, along with career foreign service officers. Ken Juster, who was the last US ambassador to India, was a political appointee for instance.Among other names that have figured in the speculation is former Congressman Joe Crowley, a one-time star of the Democratic party with a lock on the speakership of the House of Representative, to succeed Nancy Pelosi. But he was unexpectedly defeated in 2018 by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising star.Garcetti was co-chair of the Biden campaign, and he was also part of the committee that Biden had appointed to look for his running mate. After the election, Garcetti was named one of the co-chairs of the inauguration committee. He was widely expected to get a cabinet berth and reports have suggested he was being considered for secretary housing.Like all host countries, India would like a US ambassador to be someone with an open line of communications with the White House, which Garcetti is likely to have, according to people familiar with these matters. It’s just more efficient and less time-consuming to not having to go through the usual state department bureaucracy, said someone familiar with these conversations, specially at sensitive times.Biden’s ambassadorial nominee for India will be one of the more high-profile announcements for the administration given the focus the US president has brought on the ties with India, bilaterally and as part of the Quad with Japan and Australia.President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken four time already in 100 days since the American leader took office. And, they have met virtually as part of the Quad and the summit of 40 world leaders that Biden hosted in April.Last weekend, President Biden announced an assistance package of $100 million containing oxygen and oxygen supplies, personal protective equipment, rapid diagnostic tests, therapeutics such as remdesivir. Five planeloads of these supplies have already reached India, as the White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday, summing up the aid thus far. A sixth flight carrying supplies will reach on Wednesday. The United States has also diverted its supplies of raw material for AstraZeneca vaccine to India.After his BA and MA from Columbia University, Garcetti went to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and went on to the London School of Economics. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-considering-political-ally-as-ambassador-to-india-101620190401602.html
05-05-2021||World||Scientists find dangerous chemical pollutants in disposable face masks||Scientists at Swansea University have uncovered potentially dangerous chemical pollutants that are released from disposable face masks when submerged in water.The research reveals high levels of pollutants, including lead, antimony, and copper, within the silicon-based and plastic fibres of common disposable face masks.The work is supported by the Institute for Innovative Materials, Processing and Numerical Technologies (IMPACT) and the SPECIFIC Innovation & Knowledge Centre.Project lead Dr Sarper Sarp of Swansea University College of Engineering said: "All of us need to keep wearing masks as they are essential in ending the pandemic. But we also urgently need more research and regulation on mask production, so we can reduce any risks to the environment and human health."Outlined in a recent paper, the tests carried out by the research team used a variety of masks -- from standard plain face masks to novelty and festive masks for children with many currently being sold in UK retail outlets.The rise in single-use masks, and the associated waste, due to the Covid-19 pandemic has been documented as a new cause of pollution. The study aimed to explore this direct link -- with investigations to identify the level of toxic substances present.The findings reveal significant levels of pollutants in all the masks tested -- with micro/nanoparticles and heavy metals released into the water during all tests. Researchers conclude this will have a substantial environmental impact and, in addition, raise the question of the potential damage to public health -- warning that repeated exposure could be hazardous as the substances found have known links to cell death, genotoxicity and cancer formation.To combat this, the team advise further research and subsequent regulations be put in place in the manufacturing and testing process.Dr Sarper Sarp continued: "The production of disposable plastic face masks (DPFs) in China alone has reached approximately 200 million a day, in a global effort to tackle the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, improper and unregulated disposal of these DPFs is a plastic pollution problem we are already facing and will only continue to intensify."There is a concerning amount of evidence that suggests that DPFs waste can potentially have a substantial environmental impact by releasing pollutants simply by exposing them to water. Many of the toxic pollutants found in our research have bio-accumulative properties when released into the environment and our findings show that DPFs could be one of the main sources of these environmental contaminants during and after the Covid-19 pandemic."It is, therefore, imperative that stricter regulations need to be enforced during manufacturing and disposal/recycling of DPFs to minimise the environmental impact."There is also a need to understand the impact of such particle leaching on public health. One of the main concerns with these particles is that they were easily detached from face masks and leached into the water with no agitation, which suggests that these particles are mechanically unstable and readily available to be detached."Therefore, a full investigation is necessary to determine the quantities and potential impacts of these particles leaching into the environment, and the levels being inhaled by users during normal breathing. This is a significant concern, especially for health care professionals, key workers, and children who are required to wear masks for large proportions of the working or school day."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-find-dangerous-chemical-pollutants-in-disposable-face-masks-101620189597016.html

This was for the first time that a top Indian government official had a meeting with Fauci, who is the top advisor to President Joe Biden on the pandemic.During the meeting, Fauci expressed his solidarity and support with India in this hour of crisis.The meeting came a day after he termed the situation in India “very desperate” and suggested that the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.During his talks with Ambassador Sandhu, the virus strains and variants in India, and the efficacy of vaccines against these came up for discussion.Fauci, who is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, offered American assistance, including in research and development.“Discussed virus variants, vaccines, response mechanisms and joint efforts incl in R & D. Thanked him for his insights and solidarity (sic),” Sandhu said in a tweet.Fauci recalled the severe Covid-19 situation that the US has faced and the various policy responses adopted to tackle it. Strengthening joint research in healthcare, particularly in the context of the pandemic, was also discussed.Earlier in the day, America’s Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas spoke with Sindhu and reiterated the Biden administration’s full support in India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“Deeply appreciate the strong solidarity and offer of support of” Department of Homeland Security,” the Indian envoy said on Twitter after the phone call.Two Indian-American congressmen Ro Khanna and Raja Krishnamoorthi issued another plea for more US aid to India.“It might not be on the front page anymore but make no mistake: the crisis in India has not ended. Many have stepped up to send help, but nothing can match the resources of our government. We need to mobilise our resources to quell the surge in India and prevent spikes elsewhere,” Khanna said.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.According to Indian health ministry data on Tuesday, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases crossed the 2-crore mark with 3,57,229 infections being reported in a day, while the death toll increased to 2,22,408 with 3,449 new fatalities.The total tally of Covid-19 cases in the country has climbed to 2,02,82,833, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-us-envoy-discusses-covid-19-crisis-new-strains-with-dr-fauci-101620189788906.html

05-05-2021||World||12 Republican lawmakers urge Biden admin to not support India's proposal at WTO||Twelve Republican lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to not support a proposal by India and South Africa before the World Trade Organisation to temporarily waive some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules amid the coronavirus pandemic.If the US gives up intellectual property rights, it will harm innovation and production, and result in fewer people getting vaccinated, the 12 influential Congressmen said in a letter to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Tuesday.The letter is in response to the proposal in this regard by 60 developing countries, led by India and South Africa.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"The United States should continue to oppose the request by India, South Africa, and other nations to waive certain portions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)," the letter said.Spearheaded by Congressmen Jim Jordan and Darrell Issa, the lawmakers said the requested waiver is extraordinarily broad and unnecessary to accomplish the goal of giving as many people as possible access to vaccines and treatment for COVID-19.They claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressed US President Joe Biden to support the waiver during a phone call in early May.Among other signatories to the letter are Steve Chabot, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Mike Johnson, Tom Tiffany, Thomas Massie, Dan Bishop, Michelle Fischbach, Scott Fitzgerald and Cliff Bentz."The justification for the waiver rests on an incorrect assumption that IP rights are a significant bottleneck to the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments,” the letter said.Also Read: In phone call with Modi, Biden discusses sending Covid vaccines, other supplies"The waiver's sponsors have presented no convincing evidence to support this assertion. Instead, the sponsors mainly just point out that relevant IP rights exist and speculate that those rights could serve as a barrier to access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments - not that IP rights have actually blocked or significantly hindered their availability,” it added.If anything, the examples of IP 'disputes' cited by the waiver sponsors generally demonstrate that IP rights have not prevented the involved parties from supplying vaccines and other medicines, the letter said.Respect for intellectual property rights has been a cornerstone of the US trade policy for decades and should not be set aside lightly, the Republican Congressmen said."Although some flexibility may be warranted in emergency situations, the waiver of TRIPS IP protections requested by India, South Africa, and other countries would do little to improve public health during this critical period in the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope of the requested waiver is overbroad and unjustified in light of the economic harm it would cause and the negligible benefits it would provide,” they said in the letter."Existing aspects of TRIPS and global public health initiatives, along with the existing actions of key IP rights holders and innovators, make the waiver unnecessary. While considerable work can still be done to improve access to COVID-19 medicines and other innovations, that work can be done without the drastic step of suspending IP rights, and significant progress has already been made to address the real obstacles hampering the global COVID-19 response,” they said.The lawmakers argued that relevant intellectual property rights have been successfully licensed to expand access to COVID-19 innovations while maintaining IP protections. For example, the Serum Institute of India has secured licenses to produce multiple vaccines, including Astrazeneca and Novavax vaccines.South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare has secured a license to produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Several vaccine makers have licensed direct competitors to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity.Moderna has announced that it would not seek to enforce any of its COVID-related patents against other vaccine makers for the rest of the pandemic and has pledged to license its COVID-19 vaccine patents.Gilead has licensed nine generic pharmaceutical manufacturers (including in India) to produce its COVID-19 therapeutic drug remdesivir for 127 countries, most of which are developing nations.Moreover, TRIPS already allows countries to impose compulsory licenses to access vital IP rights, and no country has availed itself of that capability to date for COVID-19 vaccines or treatments, the lawmakers noted.The proposed waiver is not limited to patents on vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 - the waiver would also gut protections for copyrights, industrial designs (e.g., textile patterns or other ornamental designs), and trade secrets. The waiver’s supporters have only offered vague, unsubstantiated explanations for how waiving IP protections for copyrights or industrial designs would lead to improved vaccine or therapeutics availability, they said.It is also unclear how a waiver of TRIPS obligations would provide more access to trade secrets and proprietary technologies, which are confidential by definition and typically closely guarded, they said."Gifting away our technological leadership and competitive advantage at a time when the US economy remains vulnerable would be irresponsible and send the wrong message to millions of American taxpayers. The damage would extend beyond even the considerable value of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, also endangering the far greater value of the jobs and economic growth promised by these IP rights and the advanced technologies they represent," the Republican Congressmen said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-republican-lawmakers-urge-biden-admin-to-not-support-india-s-proposal-at-wto-101620173891988.html

The attack took place in the village of Hantoukoura near the border with Niger in Est region, an area hit by rising insecurity as jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State seek to gain control over once peaceful territories.In a statement, Est Governor Saidou Sanou said more than 10 civilians and two members of a civilian defence militia were killed by the unidentified attackers, who also torched a number of shops and ransacked the health centre.But the four sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll stood at around 30, making it one of the deadliest single attacks in Burkina Faso in the past year or more.It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack.Jihadist groups have also fuelled religious and ethnic tensions between farming and herding communities in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in order to boost recruitment among marginalised communities.The worsening violence in the wider Sahel region has led to one of the world's most acute humanitarian crises, U.N. agencies said last week. Twenty-nine million Sahelians are in need of aid and protection - an all-time high and 5 million more than last year, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/around-30-killed-in-attack-on-village-in-eastern-burkina-faso-security-sources-101620173557928.html
05-05-2021||World||US to give Covid-19 shot to low-risk teens as virus rages globally||President Joe Biden wants 70 percent of American adults to have received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine by the July 4 holiday, and has made vaccinating adolescents a key part of the next phase of the country's immunization campaign.But targeting US teens is a controversial move among many experts, who argue it is a serious mistake to use the world's limited supply of doses on a low-risk population while the pandemic surges in countries like India and Brazil.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said in March their two-dose regimen was shown to be safe and highly effective in a trial of 2,260 12-to-15-year-olds.An emergency use authorization is expected in the coming days, and Biden told White House reporters Tuesday that "if that announcement comes, we are ready to move immediately."The president's address comes as the nation's immunization campaign is stalling after hitting a peak in early April.More than 56 percent of adults have received one or more shots, but as the rate of uptake falls, officials are devising new ways to reach vaccine hold-outs.These will include discounts to shoppers who get vaccinated at grocery stores, promotions for fans at sports stadiums, and more vaccines at rural health clinics, said Biden.The federal government is also working on a program with pharmacies and pediatricians nationwide to reach the country's estimated 17 million 12-to-15-year-olds ahead of school reopening in fall.- 'Terrible error' - Many experts have, however, voiced concern whether now is the right moment to reach this group as the global situation deteriorates.The issue of vaccine disparity has been brought into sharp focus by India, which reported 350,000 new cases Tuesday and recorded nearly 3,500 deaths -- more than anywhere in the world."The overwhelming majority of 15-year-olds, we know are not at high risk of severe complications from COVID," ER doctor Craig Spencer, director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at Columbia University, told AFP."It is absolutely raging around the world and we're talking about how we're going to vaccinate an incredibly low-risk population, when the overwhelming majority of health care workers around the world have zero protection," he said.Priya Sampathkumar, chair of Infection Prevention & Control at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, added that beyond being an ethics issue, exporting more vaccines was in America's own best interest."Vaccinating more people in the US is not going to help us if the variants in India, Nepal and South Asia get out of control and hit our shores," she told AFP.The US has pledged to release up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the experts believe much more can be done."I think if you vaccinate 12-to-15-year-olds in the United States before you vaccinate 70 year olds globally, you're making a terrible error," UCSF physician and epidemiologist Vinay Prasad told AFP.Israel's experience had shown that it is possible to achieve a "remarkable reduction" in cases without targeting teens, he added.- Low risk - Sampathkumar explained that the main reason to vaccinate teens is to drive down transmission -- a goal which she agreed with, though with US cases declining, it is a question of timing.Statistics show children are at extremely low risk from severe Covid.In the United States, under-18s have accounted for 277 deaths in total, according to the latest official data, a miniscule fraction of the total of 574,000.There have been a further 36 deaths from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious post-viral disease.Still, low risk isn't no risk, and pediatrician Lee Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, welcomed the arrival of a vaccine for children.She called vaccinating teens "an important tool in our toolbox for safe return to schools," saying it may "increase the comfort for many families and school staff."Figures aggregated by the data company Burbio shows 67.1 percent of US school students are attending schools in-person, while 29.6 percent are in a "hybrid" set-up combining in-person and remote classes, and 3.3 percent are learning virtually.But Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said that the government's own research had shown it is entirely possible to reopen schools safely without vaccines."It's just another barrier that's been falsely erected to stand in the way of returning kids to education," she stressed.Nuzzo added global hotspots should be the priority."It's not good for kids in the long run if we just let this virus spread unchecked across the globe," she said.ia/bfm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-give-covid-19-shot-to-low-risk-teens-as-virus-rages-globally-101620172823607.html
05-05-2021||World||Netanyahu loses mandate to form Israel govt, opening door for rivals||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's mandate to form a government following an inconclusive election expired on Wednesday, giving his rivals a chance to take power and end the divisive premier's record tenure.Netanyahu, on trial over corruption charges he denies, had a 28-day window to secure a coalition following the March 23 vote, Israel's fourth in less than two years.The 71-year-old's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in the vote, but he and his allies came up short of an absolute majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel's parliament.The results delivered by a deeply fractured electorate left Netanyahu with a daunting path towards 61 seats, as voters broadly chose not to reward him for a successful coronavirus vaccination campaign.President Reuven Rivlin's office said in a statement that Netanyahu had "informed (the presidency) that he was unable to form a government and so returned the mandate to the president."In power from 1996 to 1999 and again since 2009, Netanyahu has acquired a reputation as a master political survivor and Israeli media had over the past four weeks feverishly speculated about deals he was hatching to stay in power.But the obstacles that faced Netanyahu the morning after the vote remained largely unchanged.A Netanyahu-led coalition likely would have required tacit cooperation between the conservative Islamic Raam party and the far-right Religious Zionism alliance, whose leaders have hurled incendiary anti-Arab rhetoric during their political careers.Raam's leader Mansour Abbas had said he was open to any arrangement that improved living standards for Israel's 20 percent Arab minority.But Religious Zionism's leader Bezalel Smotrich has repeatedly called Raam "terror supporters" who he refused to work with.Netanyahu also could have made up the numbers by making peace with his estranged former protégé, the religious nationalist Naftali Bennett, and convincing Likud defectors in the New Hope party to return home.New Hope's leader Gideon Saar maintained that his party was committed to ousting Netanyahu.Bennett, a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur, said Monday he could have endorsed Netanyahu to preserve right-wing governance but saw no path for the prime minister to clinch a viable coalition.Likud on Wednesday blasted Bennett for what it called "his refusal to form a right-wing government."Bennett has long been viewed as a hardliner and enthusiastic supporter of Jewish settlement expansion on occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank.But he sought to highlight his business and management credentials as pandemic closures ravaged Israel's economy.Bennett has said his top priority is avoiding a fifth election and that he would work towards a unity government if Netanyahu could not form a coalition.Bennett may end up leading such a unity government, despite his Yamina party only controlling seven seats.'Historic opportunity' Rivlin said he would contact political leaders on Wednesday morning "regarding the continuation of the process of forming a government."He can assign a new 28-day mandate to another lawmaker, with opposition leader Yair Lapid the most likely choice after his centrist Yesh Atid party finished second in the vote.Lapid has confirmed that he offered Bennett the chance to serve first as premier in a rotational coalition, in the interest of ending Netanyahu's tenure."There is an historic opportunity. To break down the barriers at the heart of Israeli society. To unite religious and secular, left and right and center," Lapid said Monday."It's time to choose. Between a unity government or ongoing division."The former television presenter said last week's stampede that killed 45 mainly ultra-Orthodox Jews at a religious festival was a consequence of Israel lacking a "functioning government."He conceded that an ideologically divided coalition forged mainly through shared opposition against Netanyahu "won't be perfect", but would prioritise national interests.Parliament optionsRather than tap another lawmaker to form a government, the president could ask the Knesset to select a name, a move unlikely to break the deadlock that could accelerate Israel's return to the polls.In a widely-criticised manouevre, Netanyahu and his allies have flirted with legislation to create a direct vote for prime minister, hoping he would emerge victorious in a divided field.Likud members made moves to advance such legislation as the prime minister's mandate was expiring on Tuesday, but with little sign of success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-loses-mandate-to-form-israel-govt-opening-door-for-rivals-101620172829697.html
05-05-2021||World||Australia faces ire, backtracks on ban||Australia’s prime minister fended off accusations of racism and having blood on his hands on Tuesday, as he retreated from a threat to jail Australians trying to escape Covid-hit India.PM Scott Morrison’s government moved to ban travellers from India from entering Australia until May 15, threatening rule-breakers - including Australian citizens - with prison time.Amid a widespread backlash, Morrison has said it was “highly unlikely” that Australians who skirted a ban would be jailed. “I think the likelihood of any of that occurring is pretty much zero,” Morrison said in a breakfast-time media blitz.Around 9,000 Australians are believed to be in India, where hundreds of thousands of new coronavirus cases are being detected every day and the death toll is soaring.Among those trapped are some of Australia’s most high profile sporting stars - cricketers playing in the Indian Premier League. Commentator and former Test cricket star Michael Slater was among those who pilloried Morrison’s decision, saying it was a “disgrace”.“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this,” he had tweeted. Morrison later said the idea he had blood on his hands was “absurd”.“The buck stops here when it comes to these decisions, and I’m going to take decisions that I believe are going to protect Australia from a third wave,” he said. “I’m working to bring them home safely,” he added, indicating that repatriation flights could begin soon after May 15.20 countries set to back vaccine passport effortsThe world’s 20 major economies backed efforts to introduce vaccine passports to boost travel, stressing that a resumption is crucial for a global economic recovery, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg.Singapore steps up curbs as infection clusters growSingapore has announced new curbs including a ban on spectators at sporting events amid reports of growing clusters. There was alarm after a cluster at a major hospital grew to 40 Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-faces-ire-backtracks-on-ban-101620155150876.html
05-05-2021||World||G7 nations seek to unite in bid to rein in China||The G7 democracies on Tuesday discussed how to form a common front towards an increasingly assertive China in the foreign ministers’ first in-person talks in two years.Backing US President Joe Biden’s calls for a deeper alliance of democracies, host Britain invited guests including India, South Korea and Australia for talks in central London stretched out over three days.After a welcome dinner on Monday focused on the nuclear programmes of Iran and North Korea, the foreign ministers opened formal talks at Lancaster House, a West End mansion, welcoming one another with elbow-bumps.The G7 devoted its first session on Tuesday to China, whose growing military and economic clout, and willingness to exert its influence at home and abroad have increasingly unnerved Western democracies.US secretary of state Antony Blinken had said on Monday, “What we are trying to do is to uphold the international rules-based order that our countries have invested so much in over so many decades to the benefit not just of our own citizens, but of people around the world - including, by the way, China.”British foreign secretary Dominic Raab has called for “holding Beijing to the commitments that they’ve made”, including on Hong Kong, which was promised a separate system before London handed over the colony in 1997.G7 finance ministers to meet in-person in JuneFinance ministers from the G7 nations will meet in London next month for their first major face-to-face talks in over a year, with pandemic recovery plans high on the agenda, Britain has said. The ministers will meet at Lancaster House on June 4-5, a week before the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Cornwall, England.Blinken set to join UN event led by ChinaBlinken will participate in a UN Security Council meeting on Friday chaired by China’s foreign minister on strengthening global cooperation and the key role of the UN in harnessing international action to tackle conflicts and crises, China’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun has said. It will be the first encounter, though virtually, for Blinken and China’s top diplomat Wang Yi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-seek-to-unite-in-bid-to-rein-in-china-101620154680073.html
05-05-2021||World||Canadian experts release first molecular images of B.1.1.7 variant of Covid-19||Canadian researchers have published the first structural images of a mutation in the B.1.1.7 variant of the Covid-19 virus that may explain why it has proved far more infectious than the previous strain, causing a rapid rise in cases.The B.1.1.7 variant, first reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in mid-December last year, has an unusually large number of mutations.“The pictures, taken at near-atomic resolution, provide critical insight as to why the B.1.1.7 variant... is more infectious,” University of British Columbia (UBC) said in a statement.The research team, led by Dr Sriram Subramaniam, professor in UBC’s department of biochemistry and molecular biology, found of “particular interest” a mutation known as “N501Y” located on the coronavirus’s spike protein. “The images we captured provide the first structural glimpse of the N501Y mutant and show that the changes resulting from the mutation are localised,” he said.To “visualise the detailed shapes of viruses and proteins”, the research team used cryo-electron microscopes called cryo-EM that can be up to 12 feet high, and the imaging technology uses beams of electrons to picture the samples at liquid nitrogen temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-experts-release-first-molecular-images-of-b-1-1-7-variant-of-covid19-101620106276221.html
