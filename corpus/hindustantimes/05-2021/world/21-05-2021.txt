California’s workforce regulators are separately developing safety rules that will continue to apply to employers, he noted.The state will still recommend that organizers of outdoor events with more than 10,000 people require that attendees provide verification that they have been vaccinated or have tested negative for the coronavirus. Those who can’t or don’t provide the verification should be encouraged to wear masks, Ghaly said.The state will require vaccine verification or negative test results for indoor events with more than 5,000 attendees, but Ghaly said that can be “by self-attestation” with details to come from health officials on how that process will work.State officials do not anticipate that they will create or require a vaccination “passport” or other formal verification, he said.He said California plans to follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on wearing masks and traveling domestically and overseas.That means no more discouraging travel unless there are certain countries where visiting is not advised, and no more voluntary quarantines when people return to California.California was the first state to issue a statewide shutdown as the virus emerged in March 2020 and at the start of 2021 it was the nation’s epicenter for the disease. Nearly 63,000 people have died from the virus in California, the most in any state in the nation.Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state health officials have said for weeks they expected to generally lift most business and social restrictions by June 15. Ghaly said the state remains on track to do so just months after the worse surge abated.The state of 40 million people has administered nearly 35.5 million vaccine doses, and more than three-quarters of residents over age 65 have received at least one dose, he said.“Vaccines are widely available and we’re proud of where we are,” Ghaly said.On some days, newly reported infection cases have fallen below 1,000 and there currently are just over 1,300 people in hospitals with the virus.“We haven’t enjoyed that level since the very early months and weeks of the pandemic,” Ghaly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-california-to-drop-social-distancing-requirements-in-june-101621620532800.html

But top officials stressed the need to remain vigilant.“We can be glad that (infection rates) have declined so far in recent days and in the last two weeks that we can think about opening steps,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.“I hope that, after the long time with closures and opportunities they didn't have, that people will treat these opportunities very responsibly,” she added. “The virus has not disappeared.”The country’s disease control agency reported 8,769 newly confirmed Covid-19 cases Thursday and 226 deaths. The country has reported 87,128 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.State authorities have pushed vigorously to reopen hospitality and tourism for the three-day weekend, despite misgivings from federal officials.“It feels good to finally get a bit of freedom back,” said Christian Klimpke, 48, an account manager who was joined by friends at Berlin's Cafe am Neuen See beer garden.“I lived here now exactly six months. I came here the day that bars closed, said Luke Siglmans, 29, who is originally from Amsterdam. ”So it’s amazing to finally drink a real draft German beer on a terrace. So I am really happy.”Merkel said continuing to wear masks and observe social distancing is essential. “We must take care,” she said.But “I believe that, with the necessary responsibility and care that hopefully many — most people — will take, we won't have to talk about having to shut down again.”Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday the government was closely watching the spread in Britain of a virus variant first detected in India, and would decide during the day whether to impose further travel restrictions for the UK. By early evening, though, there was no word of any changes.About 40% of the population in Germany has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine so far. About one in eight — more than 10 million people — have been fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-lifts-more-covid-19-restrictions-chancellor-merkel-urges-caution-101621618438705.html

21-05-2021||World||Canada extends suspension of flights from India till June 21||Canada has extended its suspension of direct flights from India for an additional 30 days, till June 21.This was announced by Canadian minister of transport Omar Alghabra on Friday, a day prior to the original suspension period ending. “Until June 21, we are suspending all commercial and private passenger flights arriving in Canada from India and Pakistan for an additional 30 days,” he said.He tweeted that the “temporary flight restrictions on India and Pakistan have significantly reduced the risk of importing cases and new variants. We are extending these temporary measures to protect the health and safety of Canadians”.The suspension was originally announced on April 22 and was to expire on Saturday, May 22. The move by the Canadian government was precipitated by increasing pressure upon it to act on this matter after multiple cases of the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India were reported in Canada.Transport Canada had issued its directive last month and elaborated that passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey. Those conditions continue to apply with regard to extension.In a statement released by Transport Canada in April, the ministry responsible for aviation stated, “These measures will help manage the elevated risk of imported cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern into Canada during a time of increasing pressure on our health care system.”Air Canada had already announced last week that it only accepting bookings for its direct flights from India beginning in late June, in anticipation of a possible extension of the air travel suspension.Prior to the suspension of flights, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi in an air corridor arrangement that came into effect last summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-suspension-of-flights-from-india-till-june-21-101621619512244.html

Biden referred to his six calls with Netanyahu during the 11-day conflict, and “intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour, literally” that US officials had with Egypt and the Palestinian Authority with the goal of “avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we’ve seen in previous years”.The United States did not talk to Hamas, which controls Gaza, as it considers it a terrorist organisation. Egypt engaged Hamas.“I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy,” Biden said, adding, “My administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy towards that end. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I’m committed to working for it.”But, Biden was clear he is standing with a long-time ally, by reiterating US support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said he had assured Netanyahu all necessary help in upgrading the Iron Dome defence system, which has been jointly developed by the US and Israel.The American president also pledged to work with the United Nations and other international organisations to provide “ rapid humanitarian assistance”.“We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority - not Hamas, the Authority - in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-ceasefire-presents-genuine-opportunity-for-progress-biden-101621617230945.html
21-05-2021||World||Canada extends ban on passenger flights from India, Pakistan by 30 days||Canada has extended its ban on passenger flights from India and Pakistan by 30 days to June 21 as part of a campaign to fight Covid-19, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Friday.Alghabra said Canada had seen "a significant reduction" in coronavirus infections among arriving airline passengers since Ottawa first announced the bans on April 22 as the number of cases in India soared. The move does not affect cargo flights."These ongoing measures will remain in place to help protect Canadians and to manage the elevated risk of imported cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern," he told a briefing.As vaccinations pick up across Canada, the number of daily new cases has dropped by 25% since last week and it now averages around 5,000, deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo told the briefing.Canada has so far recorded a total of 25,111 deaths from Covid-19 and more than 1.3 million cases overall.The ban on Indian and Pakistani flights is part of a series of restrictions Canada has imposed to lower the transmission of the virus, including curbs on non-essential travel across the long land border with the United States.Canada said on Thursday that the measure, first applied in March 2020, would be extended by another month to June 21. Government officials said they were in no hurry to open up travel across the border, citing the need to protect public health.Ontario, the most populous of the 10 provinces, announced on Friday that it would begin administering second doses of AstraZeneca Inc's Covid-19 vaccine after earlier halting roll out due to concerns about rare blood clots.The province has tens of thousands of AstraZeneca doses set to expire at the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-ban-on-passenger-flights-from-india-pakistan-by-30-days-report-101621614170348.html
21-05-2021||World||Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau 'badly wounded': What we know||In the 12 years since Nigeria's jihadist insurgency erupted in the northeast, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has been reported dead several times, only to reappear.On Wednesday, intelligence sources say, rival Islamic State-allied jihadists launched an attack on Shekau's faction in their stronghold in the Sambisa forest in Borno state.Shekau was seriously wounded after trying to kill himself to evade capture by the IS jihadists who surrounded him after a series of battles, the sources said.Nigerian media was filled with speculation that the man who made international headlines for kidnapping nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014 might finally be dead.But 24 hours after the news broke, the army was still investigating and details about what happened and where Shekau may be remain unclear.Here is what we know.- Who are the factions? -More than 40,000 people have been killed and over two million displaced from their homes by the conflict in northeast Nigeria since 2009, and fighting has spread to parts of neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.Since 2016, two rival factions emerged from the Boko Haram movement after disagreements over Shekau's indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and use of children and women as suicide bombers.On one side, Shekau's Boko Haram faction, known formally as Jama'tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad or JAS, was based in the Sambisa forest. It also operates in the far northern border of neighbouring Cameroon as well as frontier areas of Chad and Niger.The other was Islamic State in West Africa Province or ISWAP with its stronghold in Alagarno forest and areas of Lake Chad, a vast body of water with scattered islands.Both groups target Nigeria's armed forces and those from states bordering northeast Nigeria. But sporadic clashes have also erupted between the two factions over influence and territory.According to the local intelligence sources, a new round of infighting erupted in April during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Boko Haram fighters ambushed an ISWAP brigade as they transported weapons to one of their main camps, sources said. Several ISWAP men were killed.In retaliation, ISWAP launched an attack on a Boko Haram camp located on Lake Chad. Both sides suffered losses. But, the sources said, ISWAP took the fight to Boko Haram directly in Sambisa forest located further south.- What happened in Sambisa? -According to details from two intelligence sources, on Monday a convoy of ISWAP trucks mounted with machine guns entered the Sambisa forest area.One group headed directly to the Boko Haram camp in Sabilul Huda, where Shekau had sought refuge. His faction had recently been weakened by air strikes by the military.ISWAP fighters managed to neutralise his guards and surrounded the house where Shekau had been holed up, the sources said.What happened next is not fully clear, but Shekau was seriously wounded when he tried to kill himself to avoid being taken alive.Intelligence sources said Shekau shot himself in the chest and was later rescued unconscious by some of his men and taken to an unknown location."The truth is he may hardly survive his wounds," one source said.- Dead or wounded? -If sources are unclear about whether Shekau survived, the jihadist commander has surprised analysts before after multiple reports of his death over the years.The Nigerian army spokesman could not confirm any of the details and said an investigation was still ongoing.Neither ISWAP or Boko Haram have released any communique about the attack on Sambisa or the whereabouts of Shekau.- What happens next? -Whether he is seriously wounded or dead, the loss of Shekau would be a huge blow to his Boko Haram faction where he was a central figure for years, analysts said.ISWAP had already became the more dominant force in Nigeria's northeast showing its capacity to carry out complex attacks on the armed forces.Its fighters have recently overrun several army bases.Taking Shekau's Sambisa forest stronghold would allow ISWAP to consolidate territory it already holds in Alagarno forest and southern Lake Chad, potentially allowing the group to control roads leading to the Borno state capital Maiduguri.While some pro-Shekau brigades along the Cameroon border and in Niger and Chad may want autonomy, ISWAP may now access a pool of Shekau's fighters and a partial reunification may be in the works, said Vincent Foucher, a fellow at French National Centre for Science Research."Surely it is under discussion, all these guys are connected, they know each other and there must be negotiations going on. There are still some unknowns but what is clear is that it is a big win for ISWAP," he said."A lot of people are happy to see Shekau dead, but it is not very good news if ISWAP becomes the single jihadist force in the area."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boko-haram-chief-abubakar-shekau-badly-wounded-what-we-know-101621609593178.html
21-05-2021||World||UK's Covid-19 cases from variant found in India rise to 3,424||The number of U.K. cases of a worrying coronavirus variant from India more than doubled for a second week as authorities also monitor a new mutation of the virus, adding fresh doubt to U.K. plans to fully unlock the economy.Health officials have now detected 3,424 cases of the B1.617.2 variant, also known as VOC-21APR-02, Public Health England said Thursday in a statement. That’s up from 1,313 last week, and 520 a week earlier. They’re also investigating a mutation called VUI-21MAY-01, with 49 cases logged so far.Scientists at PHE say there is currently no evidence to suggest vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness from the India variant, but believe it could be more transmissible than the fast-spreading Kent variant that led to the country’s third lockdown in January.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that he was “anxious” about the Indian variant, and warned that it could affect the country’s plans to reopen the remaining bits of the economy from lockdown on June 21.Those concerns prompted authorities to alter the country’s vaccination program, shortening the interval between doses. And even though stage 3 of the government’s reopening plan went ahead Monday, the fast spread of the new variant remain a cause for concern.“As we start to get back to normal life, it is very important that we do not become complacent,” Health Security Agency Chief Executive Officer Jenny Harries said in PHE’s statement. “All of us need to remain responsible and vigilant.”Nevertheless, ministers and officials this week have struck an increasingly optimistic tone, with the premier saying Wednesday that he has “increasing confidence” vaccines are working against all coronavirus variants. More than 70% of U.K. adults have now had at least one dose of vaccine, making the country’s program one of the most advanced in the world.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told Sky News on Friday that caution was the “watchword” when it came to reopening the economy further. He said that even if social distancing rules were lifted as planned, he would continue to wear a mask if he had signs of a cold.Most of the 49 cases of the new variant under investigation are in Yorkshire and the Humber, in Northern England, according to PHE. “There is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective,” it said.On Monday, international holidays were allowed again, and pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors. The government has said the final stage of reopening -- which will be June 21 at the earliest, is dependent on the evolution of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-covid-19-cases-from-variant-found-in-india-rise-to-3424-101621608166771.html
21-05-2021||World||Covid-19 herd immunity may be unrealistic: South African experts||Achieving herd immunity against the Covid-19 may be unrealistic due to the mutations of the virus that causes it, South African experts have said, as they called for long-term vaccination strategies amid uncertainty about current vaccine efficacy.“Many governments are targeting herd immunity, but it is unachievable in the same way it is unachievable for flu,” said Professor Alex van den Heever, health and social security systems specialist of the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) School of Governance.Van den Heever was speaking on an expert panel hosted by leading managed care provider and medical scheme administrator Agility Health.The other panellists were virology expert Prof Sim Mayaphi and clinical pharmacology expert Dr Jacques Snyman.“If we are vaccinated this year, this could mean we don’t necessarily have immunity for the strains that emerge next year,” said Snyman.“Various vaccines are targeting various sites of the virus. That particular antibody will only be effective as long as that part of the virus has not mutated.“The Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines are only partially effective, but they reduce the likelihood and severity of illness,” he added.Snyman said nobody knew whether the current vaccines would protect in the future.“The next strain may not be affected by the antibodies we have vaccinated for. It is therefore likely that long-term vaccination strategies will be required,” Snyman said.Mayaphi, who is head of the Department of Medical Virology at the University of Pretoria, said the pandemic had caught everyone by surprise, as he called for better planning to prevent the next pandemic.“Surveillance programmes are needed to look at the animal-human interface of viruses and the prevalence of viruses in animal hosts to see if we can predict these viruses being transmitted from host animals to humans. We already have many examples of this, including Covid-19,” Mayaphi said.Van der Heever also expressed concern about the late discovery that Covid-19 was an airborne virus.“This poses the most extreme risk for a pandemic (as) it is the fastest (way in which) it could be transmitted.“That is the one that is going to overrun testing and tracing - it’s going to overrun border controls,” he said.Data by Johns Hopkins University on Friday showed 3,431,904 deaths and 139,963,964 cases globally due to the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-herd-immunity-may-be-unrealistic-south-african-experts-101621607693806.html
21-05-2021||World||China built villages near LAC, boosted military infra to keep up pressure on India||China has combined a policy of building villages close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) from Xinjiang to Bhutan with simultaneously bolstering military facilities and dual-use infrastructure such as airports to keep up the pressure on India, people familiar with developments have said. Details of the way in which China systematically pumped in money for almost a decade to build “villages of moderate prosperity” along the 4,000-km border of Tibet, most of which aligns with the LAC, emerged in a new policy paper on Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) released by the State Council Information Office on Friday. By the end of 2020, many border villages in the remote region were better connected to highways, and all had access to mobile communication, according to the policy paper titled Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity. Indian security agencies too have gathered extensive information on the campaign to speed up building of border villages along the LAC, ranging from Xinjiang to Arunachal Pradesh. Work on houses and roads to these villages is being completed at a rapid pace even during the pandemic, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “Residents are moved into the villages, mostly located in disputed regions, from other areas. Some are at a short distance from strategic features on the Indian side of the LAC,” one of the people cited above said. “We have received inputs on such villages coming up on the western sector of the LAC in Xinjiang and Tibet and the eastern sector in Arunachal Pradesh. The worrying aspect is the new pressure on Bhutan in the eastern sector of its border with China, which appears to be aimed at making Bhutan give up territory in the Doklam region,” the person added. The pressure on Bhutan is being mounted apparently with an eye on the planned 25th round of boundary talks with China, dates for which are yet to be decided, the people said. Several villages have come up in the tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China, and a new village is said to have come up close to Longju, near Arunachal Pradesh, which witnessed the first clash between India and China in 1959, according to India-based Tibet expert Claude Arpi. The policy paper said 118,800 km of highways were built to provide access to all administrative villages in TAR. Ninety-four per cent of towns and 76% of administrative villages have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads. “A number of feeder airports have been built, including Bamda Airport in Qamdo, Mainling Airport in Nyingchi, Peace Airport in Xigaze, and Gunsa Airport in Ngari,” the paper said. Many new airports are located close to border areas, especially with India. The people cited above said Chinese authorities also have plans to build three more airports in Lhunze, Tingri and Burang counties as part of an expansion project that will involve the construction of a second runway at Lhasa Gonggar airport. “These are all dual-use infrastructure and can be used by the military in contingencies,” said a second person. At the same time, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) air force is retiring its ageing Chengdu J-7 jets at an air brigade in Lintao under the Western Theatre Command, which covers Tibet and Xinjiang, and replacing them with Shenyang J-16 and Chengdu J-20 jets. “This will bring in more capable aircraft for operations along the LAC, where the older jets can’t perform very well,” the second person said. There are also reports of China developing a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) specifically for use in Tibet. The UAV reportedly completed its first flight at Gar Gunsa in TAR. “The UAV took off from an elevation of 4,700 metres and completed its task of patrolling, control and search in the Kailash mountain region,” the second person said. The policy paper’s statement on border villages matches recent reports, many based on independent satellite imagery, that show China is building villages along the LAC to bolster its contested territorial claims. “Under the guidance of the (Communist Party of China) Party Central Committee, financial input has been increasing year by year for border development in Tibet. Particularly since 2012, border villages, townships and counties in Tibet have been granted more preferential state policies on infrastructure construction...,” the paper said. The paper didn’t give details on the number of new villages or how many received financial and infrastructure help. However, a 2019 report in the official TAR news portal said the government plans to build 624 “well off” villages and farms on Tibet’s borders. The policy clearly tallies with what President Xi Jinping had said in 2013. On March 9, 2013, when joining a delegation from Tibet in a panel discussion at the National People’s Congress, Xi had said: “To govern the country well we must first govern the frontiers well, and to govern the frontiers well we must first ensure stability in Tibet.” In 2017, Xi also wrote a letter to Tibetan herdsmen living near the Arunachal Pradesh border to “set down roots” and safeguard “Chinese territory”. TAR has the longest international border with India, besides shorter frontiers with Nepal and Bhutan, and the shortest with Myanmar. China has land boundary disputes with India and Bhutan that haven’t been resolved despite protracted negotiations over decades. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “China had the first mover advantage by beefing up border infrastructure on its side some years ago. Then the Indian side began strengthening infrastructure on its side. The Chinese side’s thinking appears to be that they were losing the advantage and they’re now undertaking a host of measures retain that advantage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-built-villages-near-lac-boosted-military-infra-to-keep-up-pressure-on-india-101621607030306.html
21-05-2021||World||'Share dollars and doses': Richer nations try to tackle vaccine inequalities||Major drugmakers and rich nation leaders faced up on Friday to the startling global imbalance in fighting COVID-19 and made big pledges to up supplies of cut-price vaccines to poorer regions.Lavishly-funded mass inoculation campaigns are helping the West and others slash infections, but few shots have reached poorer nations where the virus is still raging, sometimes uncontrollably, drawing accusations of "vaccine apartheid".More than 80% of the first billion shots went to wealthy countries, compared to just 0.2% for low-income nations, US philanthropist Bill Gates told a special Group of 20 summit focussing on the global health crisis."If we do not close this immense gap, more people will die needlessly. There are two immediate actions countries can take: share dollars and doses," he said.The summit was to call for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production, but will sidestep a push from the United States and other nations to waive valuable patents, a joint declaration showed.The European Union promised to invest 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to set up vaccination manufacturing hubs in Africa.At the Italian- and EU-hosted virtual summit, Pfizer and BioNTech also pledged to make available 1 billion cut-price doses this year to poorer nations. Another 1 billion vaccines would be provided next year, Pfizer boss Albert Bourla told the summit.Johnson & Johnson promised 200 million doses of its vaccine to COVAX, a vaccine-sharing programme co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO)."As we prepare for the next pandemic, our priority must be to ensure that we all overcome the current one together. We must vaccinate the world, and do it fast," Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said.CHINA PLEDGES BILLIONSChina's President Xi Jinping pledged $3 billion in aid over the next three years to help developing countries recover from the pandemic and proposed setting up an international forum to promote fair distribution of vaccines.US President Joe Biden was not among the speakers, organisers said. His administration has backed calls from many developing countries for a waiver of patents for COVID-19 vaccines, in the hope that would boost production and allow for more equitable distribution.However, the final declaration seen by Reuters did not mention such a mechanism. It has been contested by some European nations, who have instead called for the removal of US trade barriers that they consider the main bottleneck preventing a ramping up of vaccine production.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said existing global agreements already allowed countries to force companies to share their licences in an emergency.She added that the EU will make a proposal to facilitate the use of those clauses and added that Europe would donate at least 100 million doses to poorer nations by the end of the year, including 30 million each from France and Germany.In their declaration, the world leaders noted the importance of the so-called ACT-Accelerator, a tool of the WHO to distribute COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests across the world.However, dashing initial expectations, the declaration did not include a clear commitment to fully fund the programme, which is still $19 billion short.Leaders agreed that one option to help poorer nations was sharing vaccines that wealthy countries have already purchased, but there were no firm commitments on this in the final text.The COVAX program, which is dedicated to equitable global vaccine distribution, was mentioned as one option for providing donated doses to countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/share-dollars-and-doses-richer-nations-try-to-tackle-vaccine-inequalities-101621605546378.html

"It is imperative for us to reject vaccine nationalism and make vaccines more accessible and affordable for developing countries."China has already supplied 300 million vaccine doses to the rest of the world and will provide more to the best of its ability, he added.Furthermore, Beijing supports the transfer of technologies from its vaccine companies to other developing countries and trying out joint production with them, Xi said.The forum on cooperation would be "for vaccine-developing and producing countries, companies and other stakeholders to explore ways of promoting fair and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world," Xi said.He called on major countries to take up the responsibility to provide more vaccines to developing nations in urgent need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-pledges-3-bn-covid-aid-for-poor-nations-proposes-vaccine-cooperation-forum-101621605554427.html

21-05-2021||World||Study finds Iran using crypto mining to reduce impact of sanctions||Around 4.5% of all bitcoin mining takes place in Iran, allowing the country to earn hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies that can be used to buy imports and lessen the impact of sanctions, a new study has found.At its current level of mining, Iran's bitcoin production would amount to revenues close $1 billion a year, according to figures from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The United States imposes an almost total economic embargo on Iran, including a ban on all imports including those from the country's oil, banking and shipping sectors.While, exact figures are "very challenging to determine", Elliptic estimates are based on data collected from bitcoin miners by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance up to April 2020, and statements from Iran's state-controlled power generation company in January that up to 600 MW of electricity was being consumed by miners.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as mining, where powerful computers compete with each other to solve complex mathematical problems. The process is energy intensive, often relying electricity generated by fossil fuels which Iran is rich in.The country's central bank prohibits the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mined overseas, although the currencies are widely available on the black market, according to local media reports.Iran officially recognized crypto mining as an industry in recent years, offering it cheap power and requiring miners to sell their mined bitcoins to the central bank. The prospect of cheap power has attracted more miners, particularly from China, into the country. Teheran allows cryptocurrencies mined in Iran to pay for imports of authorised goods."Iran has recognised that bitcoin mining represents an attractive opportunity for a sanctions-hit economy suffering from a shortage of hard cash, but with a surplus of oil and natural gas," the study finds.The electricity being used by miners in Iran would require the equivalent of around 10 million barrels of crude oil each year to generate, around 4% of total Iranian oil exports in 2020, according to the study."The Iranian state is therefore effectively selling its energy reserves on the global markets, using the Bitcoin mining process to bypass trade embargoes," the study reads."Iran-based miners are paid directly in Bitcoin, which can then be used to pay for imports - allowing sanctions on payments through Iranian financial institutions to be circumvented."Financial firms that have started offering cryptocurrency services, particularly in the United States, should consider potential sanctions they are exposed to due to Iranian bitcoin mining, Elliptic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-iran-using-crypto-mining-to-reduce-impact-of-sanctions-101621601475889.html
21-05-2021||World||UK govt mulls action against BBC after Princess Diana cover-up||The British government on Friday warned of potential action against the BBC, after unprecedented criticism from the royal family about its use of deception to secure a 1995 interview with princess Diana, piling pressure on the corporation as it fights attacks on several fronts.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose brief includes media, said an independent inquiry into the affair highlighted "damning failings at the heart of the BBC", which is publicly funded.Ministers would now "consider whether further governance reforms at the BBC are needed", as talks approach for renewal of its royal charter covering its running and regulation, he added.Diana's interview with journalist Martin Bashir was a global scoop, and saw the princess detail her crumbling marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as well as admitting to adultery.But a retired senior judge on Thursday concluded Bashir had faked documents to falsely claim Diana was being kept tabs on by her closest aides, which persuaded her to take part.Diana and Charles' eldest son and second-in-line to the throne, Prince William, was scathing in his criticism on Thursday, accusing the BBC of failing his mother and the public -- and worsening his parents' relationship.William's younger brother Harry also waded in, adding: "The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life."Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a former journalist who was once sacked from The Times for making up a quote, said: "I hope very much the BBC will be taking every possible step to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again."- BBC under pressure -The revelations could not have come at a worse time for the BBC, as its annual licence fee funding model comes under ever closer scrutiny.Newer, subscription-based platforms and streaming services have prompted mounting calls for the charge -- currently set at £159 ($226) -- to be scrapped.The BBC is also fighting regular complaints of political bias from all sides, and jealously guards its editorial independence from attempts at government influence.Johnson's government has sought to load BBC senior management with politically sympathetic allies.BBC director-general Tim Davie, who issued a full apology for Bashir's underhand tactics and the corporation's cover-up, once ran for election as a councillor for Johnson's Conservative party.He has reportedly planned to axe some "left-leaning" comedy shows that are said to be biased on issues such as Brexit.GB News, a new 24-hour television news channel soon to launch, is promising to appeal to BBC viewers turned off by claims it is too London-focused and liberal.The report's findings dominated British newspapers on Friday, condemning the BBC for breaking journalistic standards then covering up, as well as "rogue reporter" Bashir, who quit as religion editor last week citing ill health.The BBC's own media editor Amol Rajan on Thursday night said blanket criticism from government ministers to the future king and his brother left the BBC "severely injured, probably scarred"."For an organisation that exists on the whim of public affection and respect, that is a dreadful place for the BBC to be," he said.London's Metropolitan Police, which has previously ruled out a criminal investigation into alleged unlawful activity surrounding the interview, said it would now assess the report "to ensure there is no significant new evidence".William and Harry's criticisms claimed Bashir's deception played into their mother's fears and paranoia in the years leading up to her death in a high-speed car crash while being chased by paparazzi photographers in 1997.- Need for change -Former culture minister Ed Vaizey told Times Radio the BBC had to prove it had changed after a series of scandals, including wrongly implicating a former Tory lawmaker in child sex abuse claims.The Daily Mail suggested the BBC "could face millions of pounds in compensation claims" from those smeared by Bashir, who went on to have a high-profile career on US TV networks.In meetings with Diana's brother Charles Spencer, Bashir showed fake bank statements implying royal staff took money for information on Diana, influencing her words and future choices.Spencer said he could "draw a line" from the interview to her death, suggesting it led her to reject security protection.Prince William said the way the interview was solicited meant the show gave a "false narrative" and the BBC should not air it again.But the Evening Standard's royal editor, Robert Jobson, questioned this, however, telling Sky News Diana had a "very clear narrative" and "wanted to get her point of view across".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-mulls-action-against-bbc-after-princess-diana-coverup-101621599063219.html

They are dealing with these disturbances in order to contain the situation," he added.A Reuters eyewitness said Palestinians threw stones and Molotov cocktails towards police near the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex, which sits atop the Old City plateau known to Muslims worldwide as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as Temple Mount. Police also hurled stun grenades at a group of Palestinians marching through the grounds.The site is one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East conflict and a buildup of clashes there earlier in May touched off the Israel-Hamas conflict when the militant group began firing rockets from Gaza in response and Israel countered with air strikes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-clash-with-israeli-police-in-jerusalem-hours-after-ceasefire-101621598901842.html
21-05-2021||World||Japan gives nod to more Covid-19 vaccines to speed up vaccination campaign||Japan expanded a state of emergency to cover the southern island of Okinawa on Friday, as authorities approved two more coronavirus vaccines to speed a lagging inoculation campaign.The newly approved vaccines, from Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca PLC, will join the one co-developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in a vaccination drive that began in mid-February.AstraZeneca's vaccine will not be used for the time being, the company said. Earlier media said the government would hold off on its use because of concerns over blood clots and bleeding in some."We'll do our utmost in working to ensure that all elderly people who seek vaccinations can get their two shots by the end of July," Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is leading the coronavirus response effort, told reporters.Japan has vaccinated just 4.1% of its population, according to Reuters' global tracker, the slowest rate among the world's larger, rich countries.In contrast to some other Group of Seven (G7) nations that are beginning to end pandemic-busting lockdown measures, much of Japan remains under emergency curbs amid a fourth wave of infections.On Friday, the government added Okinawa to its list of nine prefectures placed under the strictest emergency measures. They include Tokyo, where the Olympic Games are due to start in about two months.JAPAN INC, PUBLIC FEARS OVER OLYMPICSFears that the Olympics would turn into a super-spreader event have persisted, ensuring opposition by the majority of the public to holding the Games this year.A Reuters corporate survey https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-japan-companies-poll/fretting-about-covid-most-japan-firms-say-olympics-should-be-cancelled-or-postponed-reuters-poll-idUSKCN2D12SZ published on Friday showed nearly 70% of Japanese firms also want the Games either cancelled or postponed.The state of emergency for Okinawa would run for about a month, from Sunday through June 20, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said, beyond the May 31 end-point of the other nine.It is the third consecutive week that Japan is expanding the state of emergency. With about 695,000 infections and 12,000 deaths, Japan is finding its medical system increasingly strained by a spike in more infectious variants.With the Olympics starting on July 23, Tokyo is under particular pressure to cut infections and the strain on the medical system and emerge from the emergency on schedule this month.After a 30-minute meeting with Suga on Friday, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she sought vaccine supplies for the capital, which begins mass vaccinations next week.The two agreed to work towards a "safe and secure" Olympics this summer, they later told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-gives-nod-to-more-covid-19-vaccines-to-speed-up-vaccination-campaign-101621597476856.html
21-05-2021||World||How BBC used 'deceit' to interview Princess Diana? All you need to know about inquiry findings||The BBC has been facing scathing criticism from the British royal family after an inquiry found that the sensational 1995 interview with Princess Diana was obtained through deceit and the broadcaster covered up the deception. Prince William, Diana’s eldest son and second-in-line to the throne, called the inquiring findings “extremely concerning”, adding that the “lurid and false claims” about the royal family played on “her [Diana’s] fears and fuelled paranoia.”The interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, was aired as a part of the BBC documentary series ‘Panorama’ on November 20, 1995. During the interview, Diana shared details of her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, admitted to an affair, and said that there were "three of us" in her marriage, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, whom the Prince of Wales would later marry.It was a sensational triumph for the BBC and journalist Martin Bashir who took the interview.In 1997, two years after the interview, Princess Diana died in a car crash alongside her partner, Dodi Fayed, and driver, Henri Paul, while being chased by paparazzi on motorcycles.While Buckingham Palace was blindsided by the interview, Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, questioned the tactics of Bashir to win that interview. After 9th Earl Spencer went public with the allegations, the BBC last year commissioned an independent inquiry, headed by retired judge Lord Dyson.Also Read | 'I was afraid': Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey discuss mental healthAccording to the inquiry report, Bashir had shown fake bank statements to Spencer, falsely suggesting that two senior aides were being paid to keep her under surveillance. Dyson found that Bashir used fake documents to deceive Spencer into introducing the journalist to the princes."It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse and has since hurt countless others," William said in a statement after the findings of the inquiry were published on Thursday.However, Dyson also noted that Diana was keen on the idea of a television interview and she would “probably have agreed to be interviewed by any experienced and reputable reporter in whom she had confidence even without the intervention of Mr Bashir.”Here are some of the key findings of the inquiry:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-princess-diana-was-tricked-into-bbc-interview-all-you-need-to-know-101621596891202.html

And we pledge to deliver another 1 billion doses to these countries in 2022," Bourla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-make-huge-pledge-to-address-covid-vaccine-inequality-101621597367737.html
21-05-2021||World||'I was afraid': Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey discuss mental health||For Harry, returning to London to attend Prince Philip's funeral last month meant once more facing a place where he felt trapped and hunted by cameras. It would be a test of his ability to cope with the anxiety that was bubbling up again.“I was worried about it, I was afraid,” Harry told The Associated Press during a recent joint interview with Oprah Winfrey to promote a mental-health series they co-created and co-executive produced for Apple TV .He was able to work through any trepidation using coping skills learned in therapy.“It definitely made it a lot easier, but the heart still pounds,” said Harry, the Duke of Sussex and grandson of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband Philip.In “The Me You Can’t See,” which debuted Thursday night on Apple’s streaming service, Harry reveals that he first saw a therapist approximately four years ago at the encouragement of then-girlfriend Meghan. They'd had an argument and she recognized his anger seemed misplaced.The series is another chapter in the unprecedented openness that Harry has brought to his life and his royal family relationships since stepping away from his duties and moving with his wife to California. In March, he and Meghan gave a headline-making interview to Winfrey that elicited a rare public response from the palace.Harry's self-work may be relatively recent but he and older brother William, The Duke of Cambridge, have long championed the importance of mental health. In 2016, Harry, William and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, launched Heads Together, an initiative to speak up and not be ashamed to ask for help when mental well-being is at stake.Their collective work led to interactions with people across the globe, from all walks of life, and they recognized a common thread. “Sharing your story in order to be able to save a life or help others is absolutely critical," said Harry.Harry is practicing what he preaches and laying bare his own struggles with trauma and grief. He describes in “The Me You Can't See,” the instances of feeling helpless as a young boy while riding in the car with his mother, Princess Diana, who cried as they were surrounded by paparazzi and she struggled to drive.Years later, Diana was killed in Paris after the car she and friend Dodi Fayed were riding in, crashed during a high-speed chase to flee cameras. Harry was 12 and suppressed his own feelings to meet the mourning public gathered outside Kensington Palace.Cameras rolled and snapped away as he walked behind her casket to Diana's funeral, alongside William, father Prince Charles, Philip and Diana’s brother Charles Spencer.Harry’s revelations coincide with Queen Elizabeth's official confirmation a few months ago that he and Meghan will not return to their senior royal positions within the family, following a one-year trial period.The couple now lives about 90 minutes north of Los Angeles in an exclusive area near Santa Barbara called Montecito. They count Winfrey, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom as neighbors. The paparazzi still lurks but it's less intense than in Los Angeles.This new, outspoken prince who shares his emotions is a contrast to the “never complain, never explain," “keep calm and carry on” mantras that are part of the prototypical British way.The British tabloids have had a field day picking apart his statements. Some royal commentators have also cried foul over a contradiction between seeking a private life yet granting interviews and revealing family strife.Harry appears to be cautious in choosing what he wants to speak about, and neither he nor Meghan seem interested in sharing their every move with the world. They do not operate a social media account.He is undeterred by naysayers, he says, because there's a greater good in being honest about his struggles. “I see it as a responsibility. I don’t find it hard to open up," he said. "Knowing the impacts and the positive reaction that it has for so many people that also suffer, I do believe it’s a responsibility.”Winfrey was already working with Apple to develop a series on mental health when a conversation with Harry sparked the idea to join forces.“We were having a conversation and I asked him, ‘What are the two most important issues you think facing the world today?’ And he said immediately, ‘climate change and mental health.’ She mentioned the project and Winfrey recalls him later saying , ‘Oh, by the way, if you ever need any help with that … give me a call.’ And I went and turned around and said, ‘What’s your number?’”Winfrey's existing partnership with Apple created a rare opportunity to reach the vast number of people who use the company’s devices, Harry said.“If that’s in a billion pockets on a billion screens, then maybe we can really start a global conversation about this,” he said.Winfrey recalls some of her own childhood traumas in “The Me You Can’t See.” In addition to her and Harry’s stories, the series also features accounts from both regular people and celebrities including Lady Gaga and Glenn Close, who speak candidly about their own experiences with mental illness.Winfrey said Harry pushed to present a global perspective. “This has got to be a world thing and not just a US thing,’” she recounted him saying, adding: "I think we’ve accomplished that really well.”Harry jokes he's “slowly catching up” to Winfrey's decades of inner-work and encouragement of others to do the same whether on “The Oprah Winfrey Show" or her “Super Soul Sunday" interviews on OWN. Even Winfrey said she's had a lot to learn.“I have dealt personally with one of the girls from my school (Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa), who had schizophrenia," Winfrey said. “Only after hearing the doctor say that ‘it’s a diagnosis. It’s not your life, it’s not who you are,’ that I had my great awakening about it. … ‘That is not you. You are a person who has a diagnosis of schizophrenia.’ That is powerful."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-afraid-prince-harry-oprah-winfrey-discuss-mental-health-101621594081573.html
21-05-2021||World||Palestinians claim victory as Gaza truce faces early test||Palestinians rallied by the thousands early Friday after a cease-fire took effect in the latest Gaza war, with many viewing it as costly but clear victory for the Islamic militant group Hamas over a far more powerful Israel.The 11-day war left more than 200 dead — the vast majority Palestinians — and brought widespread devastation to the already impoverished Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. But the rocket barrages that brought life to a standstill in much of Israel were seen by many Palestinians as a bold response to perceived Israeli abuses in Jerusalem, the emotional heart of the conflict.The truce faces an early test on Friday, when tens of thousands of Palestinians attend weekly prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, a flashpoint holy site revered by Jews and Muslims. Celebratory protests could spark confrontations with Israeli police, setting in motion another cycle of escalation like the one that led to the war.Thousands took to the streets of Gaza as the cease-fire took hold at 2 a.m. Young men waved Palestinian and Hamas flags, passed out sweets, honked horns and set off fireworks. Spontaneous celebrations also broke out in east Jerusalem and across the occupied West Bank.An open-air market in Gaza City that was closed throughout the war reopened and shoppers could be seen stocking up on fresh tomatoes, cabbage and watermelons. Workers in orange traffic vests swept up rubble from the surrounding roads.“Life will return, because this is not the first war, and it will not be the last war,” said shop owner Ashraf Abu Mohammad. “The heart is in pain, there have been disasters, families wiped from the civil registry, and this saddens us. But this is our fate in this land, to remain patient.”There was little to celebrate in the hard-hit northern town of Beit Hanoun, where residents, many of whom had lost loved ones, surveyed the wreckage of their homes.“We see such huge destruction here, it’s the first time in history we’ve seen this," said Azhar Nsair. “The cease-fire is for people who didn’t suffer, who didn’t lose their loved ones, whose homes were not bombed.”The mood was also somber in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced angry accusations from his right-wing base that he had halted the war too soon.Like the three previous wars between the bitter enemies, the latest round of fighting ended inconclusively. Israel claimed to have inflicted heavy damage on Hamas with hundreds of bruising airstrikes but once again was unable to halt the rockets.Hamas also claimed victory, despite the horrifying toll the war took on countless Palestinian families who lost loved ones, homes and businesses. It now faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding in a territory already suffering from high unemployment and a coronavirus outbreak.At least 243 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children and 39 women, with 1,910 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians. Twelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl, were killed.In Gaza, rescue workers were still recovering bodies from areas that had been too dangerous to enter. The Red Crescent emergency service said it recovered five bodies in the southern town of Khan Younis on Friday, including the body of a three-year-old child.The fighting began on May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem. The barrage came after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at Al-Aqsa. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound, and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.The competing claims to Jerusalem lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have repeatedly triggered bouts of violence in the past.The cease-fire was brokered by neighboring Egypt after the U.S. pressed Israel to wind down the offensive. Netanyahu announced that Israel had accepted the proposal late Thursday, while emphasizing that “the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to visit the region in the coming days “to discuss recovery efforts and working together to build better futures for Israelis and Palestinians.” the State Department said.Hamas and other militant groups fired over 4,000 rockets at Israel throughout the fighting, launching the projectiles from civilian areas at Israeli cities. Dozens of projectiles flew as far north as Tel Aviv, the country’s bustling commercial capital.Israel, meanwhile, carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting what it said was Hamas’ military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel network.The United States, Israel’s closest and most important ally, initially backed what it said was Israel’s right to self-defense against indiscriminate rocket fire. But as the fighting dragged on and the death toll mounted, the Americans increasingly pressured Israel to stop the offensive.Biden welcomed the cease-fire. He said the U.S. was committed to helping Israel replenish its supply of interceptor missiles and to working with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority — not Hamas — to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza.Netanyahu faced heavy criticism from members of his hawkish, nationalist base. Gideon Saar, a former ally who now leads a small party opposed to the prime minister, called the cease-fire “embarrassing.” Itamar Ben Gvir, head of the far-right Jewish Power party, tweeted that the cease-fire was “a grave surrender to terrorism and the dictates of Hamas.”In a potentially damaging development for the Israeli leader, the Palestinian militants claimed Netanyahu had agreed to halt further Israeli actions at the Al Aqsa Mosque and to call off the planned evictions of Palestinians in the nearby Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.An Egyptian official said only that tensions in Jerusalem “will be addressed.” He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations and provided no details.Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group both appear to have suffered significant losses. The two groups said at least 20 of their fighters were killed, while Israel said the number was at least 160 and probably higher.Some 58,000 Palestinians sought shelter in crowded United Nations schools at a time of a coronavirus outbreak. Thousands returned to their homes as the truce took hold.Since the fighting began, Gaza’s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, has rapidly deteriorated, and airstrikes have damaged schools and health centers.Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in the territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas seized power from the Palestinian Authority in 2007. Since then, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has governed autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has limited influence in Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-claim-victory-as-gaza-truce-faces-early-test-101621592765708.html
21-05-2021||World||Moon Jae-in- Joe Biden to discuss North Korean strategy on Friday meet||South Korean President Moon Jae-in is set to make a last-ditch attempt to bring the US and North Korea together under his watch when he meets Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, trying to revive dormant nuclear talks in his final year in office.But Pyongyang, which has displayed disdain for both leaders, has shown no interest in their diplomacy. That raises the stakes for the Friday summit as Moon tries to find fresh enticements to lure his neighbor back to table and the Biden administration undertakes a new strategy to end a nuclear program it sees as a serious threat to America and the world.A key part of Biden’s foreign policy has been turning to allies for support in addressing the security risks posed by the likes of China and North Korea, trying to mend relations strained by his predecessor Donald Trump and placing a greater emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region. The summit with Moon is emblematic of that, being Biden’s second White House meeting with a foreign leader since coming to office, after an April summit with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.But persistent troubles in the Middle East have flared up and the violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip could be a distraction for the summit where the focus is supposed to be on North Korea.Moon left Wednesday for the five-day visit and was expected to seek US cooperation on Covid-19 vaccines, aiming to step up production at home. Biden has been looking for help from South Korea’s advanced semiconductor industry for chips as Washington seeks to secure supply chains in its trade battles with China. Biden and Moon will hold a joint press briefing on Friday.Moon is likely to visit an SK Innovation plant in Atlanta on Saturday, according to his office, while the chairman of the SK Group, Chey Tae-won, was part of the contingent accompanying Moon. Ford Motor Co. and SK Innovation Co. are poised to announce Thursday they’ve reached an agreement to jointly build electric-vehicle batteries in the US, according to people familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified.In what might be a conciliatory gesture, the Biden administration appears willing to accede to a denuclearization agreement reached between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a historic 2018 summit in Singapore. Moon helped bring the two leaders together and has been looking for Biden’s backing of the pact that Seoul sees as a launching point for future discussions.The Singapore summit resulted in a bare-bones declaration that included a call for the two sides “to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But the US and North Korea never agreed on what they meant by “denuclearization” and the accord resulted in no tangible steps for Kim to wind down his arsenal, which only became larger and more lethal.A senior US official told reporters that the Biden administration was looking to build on not only the Singapore agreement, but other agreements made by previous administrations. The official said the US believed nuclear negotiations would be challenging and Biden -- in contrast to his predecessor -- wasn’t orienting his diplomatic effort around achieving a grand bargain.The official, who asked not to be identified as a condition of participation in the briefing, sought to play down the likelihood the meeting would result in a splashy new North Korea announcement. While the leaders would consult on the best path forward, the White House doesn’t expect to publicly detail changes to its diplomatic strategy, the official said.Instead, the US looks eager to highlight other elements, including a push for better collaboration amid a global semiconductor shortage, the official said. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is expected to hold a meeting with South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Moon Sung-wook on supply chain issues.Moon is slated to attend the Medal of Honor ceremony for Korean War veteran Ralph Puckett, Jr., becoming the first foreign head of state to participate in the awarding of the highest decoration for US service members.The Biden administration has indicated it may be ready to ease some sanctions in exchange for steps by Kim to freeze, cap and wind down his nuclear arsenal. That could help the North Korean leader fix an economy that has only shrunk since he took power about a decade ago.Moon has said he wants to use the final year of his single, five-year term to reach an “irreversible peace” on the Korean Peninsula, but his role as a bridge between the US and North Korea has waned.North Korea froze out Moon as talks with Trump faltered. This month it released a 151-page photo book of Kim’s diplomatic achievements where Moon was conspicuously absent, despite three summits with Kim.“From Kim Jong Un’s point of view, while Moon may not be able to play a pivotal role in US-North Korea diplomacy, he may be able to steer the Biden administration in a direction that would be more palatable to Kim,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a nonresident fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center.Kim has turned up pressure early on Biden, starting 2021 by saying he wanted to develop more advanced nuclear technologies. In March, he test-fired ballistic missiles for the first time in a year and more launches could be coming soon.“Kim Jong Un continues to rebuff South Korea and perceives a new US administration as an opportunity to negotiate, but is prepared to take provocative and coercive steps with long-range missile tests or possibly even demonstrate its nuclear capability,” General Paul LaCamera, the nominee to lead US Forces Korea, said in his written response to questions from Senate Armed Services Committee members this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-jae-in-joe-biden-to-discuss-north-korean-strategy-on-friday-meet-101621591151908.html

The interview was a major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse and has since hurt countless others," William, 38, said in a statement."It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC's failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her."In a separate statement issued at the same time, William's brother Harry did not mention the BBC by name, but drew broader aim at the media and the "ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices (which) ultimately took her life.""To those who have taken some form of accountability, thank you for owning it. That is the first step towards justice and truth," Harry, 36, said."Yet what deeply concerns me is that practices like these - and even worse - are still widespread today. Then, and now, it's bigger than one outlet, one network, or one publication."Harry and his wife Meghan quit their duties as members of the royal family and moved to California last year. Harry, who has sued several British tabloids, has spoken out previously about his worries that his mother's experience of the intense glare of the press would be repeated with his wife.'LET MY MOTHER DOWN'The BBC set up the investigation, headed by former senior judge John Dyson, in November following allegations from Diana's brother Charles Spencer that he had been tricked into introducing her to Bashir.Dyson's report found that Bashir, then a little-known reporter, had shown Spencer fake bank statements suggesting that Diana was being bugged by the security services and that two senior aides were being paid to provide information about her.After it was aired, Bashir repeatedly lied to his bosses about how the interview was obtained, the report said. As questions continued, BBC managers failed to scrutinise his version of events properly and covered up facts about how Bashir had secured the interview.The inquiry found that the BBC had fallen short of the "high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark," and the BBC has written to Buckingham Palace to apologise.Bashir apologised for the fake statements, but said he stood by his evidence from 25 years ago and he did not believe they had prompted Diana to give the interview.William said that the BBC should have properly investigated when concerns were first raised in 1995."(Diana) was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions," he said."These failings, identified by investigative journalists, not only let my mother down, and my family down; they let the public down too."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indescribable-sadness-royals-condemn-bbc-deceit-over-diana-interview-101621588955069.html
21-05-2021||World||China says it will approve Dalai Lama’s successor||China on Friday indicated that it would choose the successor to the India-based Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party China (CPC)-ruled central government.A new policy paper released on Tibet on Friday all but ruled out the 14th Dalai Lama himself choosing his successor.Citing historical precedence, the white paper said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of ‘drawing lots from the golden urn’, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China,” the white paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, said.The 14th Dalai Lama, who is 85 now, fled to India in 1959 following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet.The Tibetan leader was granted political asylum in India and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh since then.In 2017, the Chinese foreign ministry had told Hindustan Times about the process it would follow on the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be conducted according to religious rituals and historical conventions including drawing lots from the Golden Urn in front of the Shakyamuni (Buddha) statue at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, which embodies the Buddhist spirit,” the ministry had said, adding: “(and) not by what the 14th Dalai Lama has said.”The primary rules of naming the successor will follow the “Regulation on Religious Affairs and Management Rules of Tibetan Buddhism Reincarnation,” the ministry said.“Finally, the result must be reported to the central government for approval. This rule was established early in 1793,” said the ministry referring to the 29-Article Ordinance for More Effective Governance of Tibet, passed by the Qing dynasty, which ruled future Dalai Lamas would be chosen through a draw of lots of names inside the urn at the temple.China routinely blames the Dalai Lama for inciting separatism in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and has called him a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”.Beijing says the Dalai Lama seeks to use violent methods to establish an independent Tibet though the Tibetan leader, who has won the Nobel Peace Prize, says he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet and denies advocating independence or violence.The Dalai Lama’s succession issue has been in focus, especially in the last few years after the US has stepped up campaign, saying that the right relating to the reincarnation of Dalai Lama’s successor should be within the exclusive authority of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.The white paper slammed the Dalai Lama group for promoting “Tibetan independence”. “Over the years, the 14th Dalai Lama and his supporters have continued to try to promote ‘Tibetan independence’ by provoking incidents to jeopardise peace and stability in Tibet,” it said.After the failure of their armed rebellion in 1959, the reactionaries of Tibet’s ruling class fled to India and subsequently began to campaign for “Tibetan independence by force”, it said.No country or government in the world has ever acknowledged the “independence of Tibet”, it said.The white paper also said by 2020, a total of 92 reincarnated Living Buddhas had been identified and approved through traditional religious rituals and historical conventions for temples in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-will-approve-dalai-lama-s-successor-101621589028535.html

So I think safely about 6 to 8 million deaths could be an estimate on a cautionary note," said Samira Asma, WHO's Assistant Director-General in its data and analytics division at a virtual press briefing.WHO data analyst William Msemburi said that this estimate included both unreported Covid-19 deaths as well as indirect deaths due to the lack of hospital capacity and restrictions on movements among other factors."The challenge is that the reported Covid-19 [death toll figures] is an undercount of that full impact," Msemburi said.The WHO did not give a breakdown of the figure, referred to by health experts as ""excess mortality".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-death-tolls-are-likely-a-significant-undercount-says-who-101621588066615.html
21-05-2021||World||Nepal: Opposition mulls options to 'oust' PM Oli as political crisis deepens||Nepal's Opposition parties met on Friday to chalk out the future course of action to oust Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and resolve the current political crisis after the embattled premier expressed unwillingness to undergo another floor test to prove his government's majority in Parliament.Also Read | KP Sharma Oli sworn in as Prime Minister of NepalThe meeting came a day after Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari urged the political parties in the country to stake a claim to form a new government.The President has given parties a deadline until 5:00 pm on Friday to form a new government, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli.According to a press release issued by the president's office on Thursday, the government decided to pave the way for the formation of a new government as Prime Minister Oli, who is required to seek a vote of confidence within 30 days, thinks that the situation is no different from the one that existed on May 10 when the 69-year-old leader lost the trust vote in the House of Representatives.The meeting of the Opposition alliance was underway at the residence of Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba. Top leaders of Nepali Congress (NC), Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) and Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) were attending the meeting.A senior leader of the ruling CPN-UML, Madhav Kumar Nepal, has also reached Deuba's residence for the meeting.A senior NC leader said they are considering all possible options to oust Prime Minister KP Oli from power as he is involved in violating the constitutional norms and values, myrepublica.com reported."President Bhandari is also supporting all unconstitutional moves of Prime Minister Oli," the senior leader said. "Discussions are underway whether to file an impeachment motion against the President," he said.The Nepali Congress earlier said the decision of Prime Minister Oli not to seek a vote of confidence in parliament as per Article 76(4) and ask President Bhandari to pave the way for forming a new government as per Article 76(5) is 'unconstitutional'.The party has maintained that the Prime Minister must resign from his post if Article 76(5) is to come into effect.Prior to the meeting with other opposition party leaders, the NC had held a meeting of the party's office-bearers to forge new strategies.The meeting concluded that both Prime Minister Oli and President Bhandari were involved in unconstitutional moves and were seeking to sabotage the Constitution and derail the ongoing political course.Experts also say the Oli government and the President both have violated the Constitution.“If that is the recommendation, it goes beyond the norms of the parliamentary system. The prime minister should resign to complete the course before recommending the government formation under any other article of the Constitution,” Bipin Adhikari, former dean of Kathmandu University School of Law, told the Kathmandu Post.The president's latest call comes after the ruling party's candidate for Upper House in Bagmati Pradesh lost the election clearly indicating that Oli doesn't possess majority support in Parliament.Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa lost the election to the rival candidate of the ruling party Khim Lal Devkuta during Thursday's election.As per Article 76 (5) of the Constitution, any lawmaker who commands a majority in the Lower House can stake claim to form the government.At present, any lawmaker who stakes a claim to form the government will need the support of 136 lawmakers in the 275-member House of Representatives.Oli's CPN-UML is the largest party in the House with 121 seats. The NC has 61 and the CPN-MC 49 lawmakers in the House.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.As parliamentary politics is rife with number games, Nepal grapples with shortages of medical supplies, mismanagement of the situation by the state, spiking infections and fatalities amid the raging second wave of the pandemic.Nepal on Thursday reported 8,227 new coronavirus cases, taking the nationwide infection tally to 488,645.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-opposition-mulls-options-to-oust-pm-oli-as-political-crisis-deepens-101621588027627.html
21-05-2021||World||Internet Explorer to retire in June 2022: Microsoft||Microsoft has said that it is retiring its long-standing browser Internet Explorer on June 15 next year after serving the netizens for over 25 years.The veteran web browser was released with Windows 95, the tech giant said in a blog post on Wednesday.“The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022, for certain versions of Windows 10.” Sean Lyndersay, a Microsoft Edge programme manager said while commenting on the decision."The future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge. Not only is Microsoft Edge a faster, more secure and more modern browsing experience than Internet Explorer, but it is also able to address a key concern: compatibility for older, legacy websites and applications."Microsoft Edge has Internet Explorer mode (“IE mode”) built in, so you can access those legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications straight from Microsoft Edge," Lyndersay said.Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge will be supported through at least 2029, the blog post said.Internet Explorer debuted in 1995 as part of Windows 95 and became an instant hit. It successfully killed off Netscape Navigator, and it achieved a virtual monopoly in the early 2000s. At its 2002 peak, Internet Explorer commanded 95 per cent of the browser market, CNN reported.Once the most-used web browser, Internet Explorer had been on a steady downward trajectory for nearly two decades. Its share of the browser market fell below the 50 per cent threshold in 2010 and now sits at about 5 per cent, the report said.Google's Chrome is the browser leader, commanding a 69 per cent share of the market.The tech giant has been phasing out the old browser for several years - but in 2019 it had to issue an emergency patch for it, for security reasons, the BBC reported.At that point it was estimated that around 8 per cent of people were still using it. Between 2000 and 2005, Internet Explorer enjoyed a 90 per cent market share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internet-explorer-to-retire-in-june-2022-microsoft-101621587378098.html
21-05-2021||World||Myanmar junta-appointed electoral body to dissolve Suu Kyi party: Report||Myanmar's junta-appointed election commission will dissolve Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party (NLD) because of what it said was fraud in a November election, news outlet Myanmar Now said on Friday, citing a commissioner.Myanmar Now said the decision was made during a meeting with political parties that was boycotted by many parties including the NLD.Myanmar's army seized power on Feb.1, overthrowing and detaining the elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who fought for democracy for decades before tentative reforms began a decade ago.The military justified the coup by accusing Suu Kyi's NLD of obtaining landslide victory through a manipulated vote, though the electoral commission at that time had rejected its complaints.The election fraud conducted by the NLD in November was illegal "so we will have to dissolve the party's registration", the chairman of the junta-backed Union Election Commission (UEC), Thein Soe, was cited in the report as saying. Thein Soe said the people who committed the election fraud "will be considered as traitors" and action will be taken against them.A spokesman for the junta and for an underground pro-democracy national unity government, which includes ousted members of the NLD, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A spokesman for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party said it had representatives at the meeting, which was still going on, and he was unaware of the outcome.Security forces have killed more than 800 people since a wave of protests broke out after coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group says, though Reuters has been unable to verify the casualties due to a clamp down on media, with many journalists among the thousands of people detained.Fighting has also flared between the security forces and ethnic minority guerrilla groups.The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neigbours and the broader international community, but the generals have shown no sign of intention to seek a compromise with the pro-democracy movement.The NLD was formed around leading opponents of military rule during a student-led uprising in 1988 and has won every election it was allowed to contest.Co-founded by Suu Kyi, a figurehead of Myanmar’s struggle against dictatorship, the party won a majority of seats in a 1990 election, but the junta did not recognise the result and it took until 2015 for her to come to power with a landslide win.Nobel laureate Suu Kyi faces numerous charges filed in two courts, the most serious under a colonial-era official secrets act, punishable by 14 years in prison.Suu Kyi, 75, has been permitted to speak with lawyers only via a video link in the presence of security personnel. Her co-defendant is Win Myint, the ousted president.Japan, a major donor to Myanmar, will have to rethink its aid provision to Myanmar if the situation in the Southeast Asian nation does not improve, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-appointed-electoral-body-to-dissolve-suu-kyi-party-report-101621587389885.html
21-05-2021||World||New study says delayed shots could produce 300% more antibodies, bringing relief for vaccine-starved nations||Faced with a limited supply of shots and anxious populations waiting their turn, more countries are turning to an initially controversial strategy that’s now been vindicated by scientific studies: doubling or tripling the intervals between the first and second Covid vaccine dose.A delay in getting the second shot not only allows the existing supply of shots to be more widely distributed, it boosts their protective power by giving the immune system more time to respond to the first inoculation. Levels of antibodies produced to fight off the virus are 20% to 300% higher when the follow-up vaccine comes later, new research shows.That’s welcome news for places like Singapore, which is grappling with a rare, albeit small, rise in cases after strict mitigation measures contained the virus last year. The city-state is now extending dose intervals -- previously three to four weeks -- to six to eight weeks, in order to reach a goal of covering its entire adult population with at least one shot by the end of August. India, facing a catastrophic outbreak, is advising 12 to 16 weeks between shots.Other nations in similar straits - with few vaccine doses and antsy populations - are likely to follow.“If I could, I would push a button that says right now, this second, we give one dose to everybody we can reach,” Gregory Poland, a virologist and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. “We’ll get around to second doses later.”“In the midst of a world on fire, you put out as many fires as you can, as quickly as you can,” Poland said.The reassuring evidence on longer dosing intervals wasn’t available when the vaccine rollout first started at the end of 2020. Then, countries limited their use to the highest-risk people and guaranteed a second shot was waiting for those segments. The U.K. was the first to abandon those constraints amid a massive outbreak in late 2020 - a move that was initially criticized but has now proved prescient.More powerfulThe research suggests that the first shot primes the immune system, allowing it to start making protective antibodies against the virus. The longer that response is allowed to mature, the better the reaction to the second booster shot that comes weeks or months later.The benefits from longer dose intervals is being seen across all types of vaccines.People over 80 given a powerful mRNA vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE had an antibody response that was 3.5-fold higher if the second shot came after three months, rather than three weeks. Other studies concluded that delaying the final shot for nine to 15 weeks averted more hospitalizations, infections and deaths, while one from Canada suggested the biggest benefit came from a six month delay.There are drawbacks. The additional time between doses means it will take longer for countries to protect their populations. While one shot offers some level of benefit, people aren’t considered fully immunized until several weeks after their second dose.The interval is particularly dangerous when less potent vaccines are being used or more transmissible variants of the virus are circulating.Some countries are pushing the boundaries. India’s delay of three to four months between doses, among the longest in the world, means those scrambling to get vaccinated amid its current outbreak won’t be fully protected until the summer or the fall.While studies suggest the optimal spacing between AstraZeneca shots is 12 weeks, there is scant data on the impact of stretching that to 16 weeks. The British drugmaker’s shot accounts for the majority of inoculations in India now.The greater delay can also increase the logistical hurdles involved in getting millions of people to return to complete the series, especially if they feel they already have some coverage from the first shot. It’s already difficult to get people in developing countries to return given transportation and communication challenges.“When you have any kind of a two-dose schedule, it’s hard logistically,” said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “You worry about when people will come back for a second shot, or if you will lose them entirely.”It’s a tradeoff many places are willing to make, particularly given the limits on vaccine availability. With a new variant first identified in India already spreading in Singapore, officials want to administer a first dose to about 4.7 million people by the end of the summer.“We’re vaccinating 40,000 people a day at the moment, so you can do the math and work out how long that’ll last,” said Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases professor at the National University of Singapore. “And that’s a fairly rigid pipeline. It’s not like you can just order more.”By delaying the second dose, several hundred thousand people will get their first injection sooner, he said.“We’re comfortable that there’s no downside to this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-study-says-delayed-shots-could-produce-300-more-antibodies-101621585632083.html
21-05-2021||World||China building villages all along Tibet border, disputed with India, Bhutan||China has systematically pumped in money for nearly a decade to build “villages of moderate prosperity” all along the 4,000km border of Tibet, a large part of which aligns with the disputed boundary with India.A new policy paper on Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) released on Friday by the State Council Information Office said by the end of 2020 many border villages in the remote province were better connected to highways and all villages in such areas had access to mobile communication.The TAR has the longest international border with India besides having shorter ones with Nepal and Bhutan and the shortest with Myanmar.China has land boundary disputes with India and Bhutan, which have not been resolved despite protracted negotiations carried on over decades.The policy paper’s statement on border villages matches several recent reports, many based on independent satellite imagery, which say China is building new villages along the border with India to bolster its contested territorial claims, especially close to Arunachal Pradesh.The white paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, was released on Friday. “Developing border areas and improving people’s lives”, is a section in the paper.“Under the guidance of the (Communist Party of China) Party Central Committee, financial input has been increasing year-by-year for border development in Tibet. Particularly since 2012, border villages, townships and counties in Tibet have been granted more preferential state policies on infrastructure construction, covering water, electricity, roads, and housing.”In 2017, the “Plan of TAR on the Construction of Villages of Moderate Prosperity in Border Areas (2017-2020) was released”, which, the paper said, was designed to ensure better access to housing, water, electricity, roads, communications, and internet among other aspects.“Through all these efforts in the border areas in Tibet, infrastructure has seen remarkable improvements, all industries are flourishing, and the people enjoy better living and working conditions,” the white paper said.The paper said the inhabitants along the “4,000-km external border line” have harsh living and working conditions and a high incidence of poverty.The policy paper did not share details about the number of new villages that were built or how many received financial and infrastructure help.However, a 2019 report in the official TAR news portal had said the government had plans to build 624 “well off” villages and farms on Tibet’s borders.The policy clearly tallies with what President Xi Jinping had said in 2013.On March 9, 2013, when joining the delegation from Tibet in a panel discussion at the first session of the 12th National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, Xi said: “To govern the country well we must first govern the frontiers well, and to govern the frontiers well we must first ensure stability in Tibet.”In 2017, Chinese president Xi Jinping had also written a letter to Tibetan herdsmen living near the Arunachal Pradesh border to “set down roots” and safeguard “Chinese territory”.Last August, Chinese state media reported on how the government has improved infrastructure in villages close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.State-owned Global Times tabloid cited authorities in Yadong county of TAR as saying that 27 households with 124 people had “voluntarily moved from... Yadong county to Pangda village in September”.A December 6, 2020, Hindustan Times report said that several villages had come up in the tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China, and the move had followed the upgrading and construction of Chinese military facilities, including heliports and missile bases, all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the aftermath of the 2017 standoff at Doklam.A new village is also said to have come up near Longju, near Arunachal, which witnessed the first clash between India and China in 1959, according to India-based Tibet expert, Claude Arpi.The policy paper also detailed the overall infrastructure development in TAR.“Highways with a total length of 118,800km have been built, providing access to all administrative villages in the region. Ninety-four percent of towns and 76 percent of administrative villages have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads,” it said, adding that some 700km of expressways and grade-one highways are in service.“A number of feeder airports have been built, including Bamda Airport in Qamdo, Mainling Airport in Nyingchi, Peace Airport in Xigaze, and Gunsa Airport in Ngari. Tibet now has 140 domestic and international air routes in operation, reaching 66 cities.”Many of the new airports are located close to border areas, especially with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-building-villages-all-along-tibet-border-disputed-with-india-bhutan-101621583628346.html
21-05-2021||World||Dalai Lama's successor will be appointed only after govt approval: China||China on Friday said that any successor to the present Dalai Lama should be approved by it, ruling out recognition to any heir nominated by him or by his followers.The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), claimed an official white paper issued by the Chinese government here.The document has also asserted that Tibet was an inseparable part of China since ancient times."In 1793, after dispelling Gurkha invaders, the Qing government restored order in Tibet and promulgated the Imperially Approved Ordinance for Better Governance of Tibet, improving systems by which the central government-administered Tibet," the white paper titled 'Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity" said.The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of "drawing lots from the golden urn" and that the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China, the document said.The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.The Dalai Lama is 85 years old now and the issue of his successor has gained prominence in the last couple of years due to his advanced age.The Dalai Lama’s succession issue was in the limelight, especially in the last few years after the US has stepped up campaign that the right relating to the reincarnation of Dalai Lama’s successor should be within the exclusive authority of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (TPSA) passed by the US Congress makes it official United States policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people.Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have been asserting time and again that while the institution of reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been in existence for several hundred years, the 14th (present) Dalai Lama himself was found and recognised following religious rituals and historic conventions, and his succession was approved by China’s central government.The white paper said by 2020, a total of 92 reincarnated Living Buddhas had been identified and approved through traditional religious rituals and historical conventions for temples in Tibet.Traditional religious activities are carried out regularly in accordance with the law and examination on scriptures and subsequent promotion in academic degrees are also held in monasteries on a regular basis, it said.The white paper termed the demand for Tibetan independence as a product of imperialist aggression against China.In the middle of the 19th century, the UK-led imperialist powers began to cultivate the idea of "Tibet independence," intentionally undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it said.It slammed the Dalai Lama group for promoting "Tibetan independence".“Over the years, the 14th Dalai Lama and his supporters have continued to try to promote "Tibetan independence" by provoking incidents to jeopardise peace and stability in Tibet," it said.After the failure of their armed rebellion in 1959, the reactionaries of Tibet's ruling class fled to India and subsequently began to campaign for "Tibetan independence" by force”, it said.No country or government in the world has ever acknowledged the "independence of Tibet," it said.China makes it mandatory to adhere to the 'One China' policy, recognising Tibet and Taiwan as an integral part of the country.Beijing made the 'One-China' policy a prerequisite for countries to establish diplomatic ties with it.About the incidents of over 100 Tibetans setting themselves on fire since 2011 demanding the return of the Dalai Lama from his exile, the white paper said the Dalai Lama and his supporters have incited Tibetan lamas into self-immolations.It also blamed the western anti-China forces for continuing to interfere in Tibetan affairs in an attempt to sabotage its social stability.Justifying China’s taking over of Tibet in 1951, it said with the peaceful liberation of Tibet 70 years ago, the people of Tibet broke free from the fetters of invading imperialism for good and embarked on a bright road of unity, progress and development with all the other ethnic groups in China.China is a unified multi-ethnic country with a long history. The Chinese nation is a community of shared future. Tibet has developed through the combined efforts of all the ethnic groups in China, it said.Rejecting allegations of curbs on religion, it said the province has more than 1,700 sites for Tibetan Buddhist activities with 46,000 monks and nuns besides four mosques serving 12,000 native Muslims, and a Catholic church with more than 700 followers, it said."Following the peaceful liberation, all ethnic groups in Tibet, united under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, have worked together and stood firm in safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity," it said.China is building a new modern socialist Tibet, it said.It also refuted criticism that the Tibetan language is being undermined to promote the official Chinese language. The Tibetan spoken and written language is widely used in Tibet, the white paper said.The study and use of the Tibetan language are protected by law.Tibet now has 16 periodicals and 12 newspapers in the Tibetan language and has published more than 40 million copies of 7,185 Tibetan-language books, it said.Tibet is also economically thriving and prospering in the new era, it said.All those counties formerly classified as poor have risen out of poverty, and the people are leading better lives in every respect.The system of regional ethnic autonomy has been fully implemented in Tibet it said.The average life expectancy in Tibet has reached 71.1 years in 2019 from 35.5 years in 1951, due to the development of health infrastructure, it saidIt also said the number of Tibetans in the legislature has increased.Of the 439 deputies to the 11th People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, 289 -- or almost two-thirds -- are from the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-s-successor-will-be-appointed-only-after-govt-approval-china-101621580864246.html

The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America, and McDonald's is guilty of perpetuating this disparity," Allen added.McDonald's intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract, the lawsuit states.A McDonald's spokesperson told the Wall Street journal it would review the lawsuit.Earlier Thursday, McDonald's announced it would more than double the advertising money it pays to media companies owned by Blacks, Hispanics, women and other underrepresented groups over the next four years.Spending with Black-owned properties will increase from 2 percent to 5 percent of national advertising spend over this time period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-sued-for-spending-less-on-advertising-in-black-owned-media-companies-101621579216344.html

"They did not have an easily explainable pattern, and so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is," Obama also said.Without elaborating his own views on what these mysterious objects were, Obama concluded by saying, "I have nothing to report to you today."This comes as the American defence department and intelligence agencies are due to release a much-anticipated report on mysterious aerial sightings. The report will be released in June.Earlier on Sunday, a US government official on an American television acknowledged sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena (USP) and confirmed that the department posses recordings as well.One video was also leaked by a documentary filmmaker which captured an unidentified spherical object flying off the coast of San Diego. The video is claimed to be shot by the US Navy.The US Navy photographed & filmed “spherical” shaped UFOs & advanced transmedium vehicles; here is some of that footage. Filmed in the Combat Information Center of the USS Omaha / July 15th 2019 / warning area off San Diego @ 11pm PST. No wreckage found. No craft were recovered. pic.twitter.com/tK1YTG8sJ7Meanwhile, speaking on his life after the presidency, Obama said, he is very happy now as he not being blamed for "every single story" in the news.

21-05-2021||World||Hour-by-hour: Joe Biden's behind-the-scenes manoeuvring for Israel-Hamas cease-fire||The diplomatic flurry was over and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu was on the phone telling President Joe Biden that it appeared the furious fighting between Israel and Hamas was about to end.But Biden remained wary even after the afternoon phone call. Things still could go crosswise with hours to go before the cease-fire took effect, his team reasoned.Nervous White House aides dialed contacts in Tel Aviv and Cairo to suss out whether the truce would hold. Officials in both the US and Israel worried that another barrage of Hamas rockets still could sink the Egyptian-brokered agreement, according to an official familiar with the conversations.Then came another call from Netanyahu — his second to Biden in a matter of hours — with reassurances for the American president that the 11-day war really was halting.Biden's first extended foreign policy crisis — one he handled largely by avoiding the cameras and manoeuvring instead behind the scenes — had abated.The president went before cameras in the Cross Hall of the White House to describe “intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour, literally” by the US that involved Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and other Middle Eastern countries.All of it, he said, came "with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we’ve seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out.”Biden and Netanyahu’s talks were just a small sample of the furious diplomacy that the White House conducted. The president and senior aides had over 80 engagements -- by phone or in person -- as it looked for an endgame to the fighting, according to the White House.Biden's speech celebrating the cease-fire lasted just 3 ½ minutes — delivered just in time for evening news broadcasts. He reiterated his belief that Israel has a right to defend itself, expressed condolences for Palestinian civilians who died in the Israeli bombardment and promised that humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip was on its way.It was an enigmatic, and perhaps fitting, bookend to the sort of messy Middle East crisis he had hoped to avoid, particularly early in a presidency already oversubscribed with managing the public health and economic tumult caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The conflict had also exposed a rift between Biden and members of his own party. The president who over nearly 50 years in national politics has burnished a reputation for unwavering support of Israel leads a Democratic Party that has trended toward a far more divided outlook on the correct path to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. And Republicans, for their part, were all too eager to use the raging violence as ammunition against Biden's presidency.Biden had studiously avoided extensive public comment about the Israeli military strikes as the conflict raged. But as the days wore on, he was facing mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to speak out against the Israelis as the death toll climbed in Gaza and as tens of thousands of Palestinians were displaced by the aerial bombardment.When it was over, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut expressed relief at the cease-fire and commended Biden and his team for their work. But he also laid out ongoing worries, saying, "I am deeply concerned that without meaningful progress towards a two-state future, the conditions of despair will deepen, further fuel extremism and lead to a tragic renewal of the cycle of violence.”The cease-fire announcement came after Biden on Wednesday upped his pressure on Netanyahu, telling the Israeli leader in a phone call that he expected “significant de-escalation” of the fighting by day’s end, according to the White House. But the prime minister came right back with a public declaration that he was “determined to continue” the Gaza operation “until its objective is achieved."Biden's advisers were not overly concerned that Netanyahu’s comments seemed to reject the president's public call to ease off, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorised to publicly discuss private discussions.US officials believed Netanyahu did not want to telegraph to Hamas in advance that he was ready to accept terms to end the violence, and the Israeli leader also was sending a message to a domestic audience that had become traumatised by the barrage of rocket fire from Gaza.But pressure was building on Biden, and he, in turn, was making that known to Netanyahu.On Tuesday, while in Michigan to visit a Ford facility, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib confronted Biden on the airport tarmac and called on him to speak out forcefully against the Israeli strikes. Also this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced resolutions to block the sale of $735 million in military weaponry to Israel that had already been approved by the Biden administration.“Let us hope that the ceasefire in Gaza holds," Sanders tweeted Thursday evening. “But that’s not enough. Our job now is to support desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza’s people, and find a way to finally bring peace to the region.”Biden advisers had concluded in the first days of the crisis, as Hamas rained down hundreds of rockets on Israel, that a call from the president for Israeli restraint would have fallen flat. At the same time, early in the crisis, there was deep worry inside the White House that the fighting could morph into something that would take months to tamp down.As the outside calls for Biden to speak out more forcefully grew, the president and top aides privately made the case to Israeli officials that time wasn’t on their side.Biden and Netanyahu have known each other for more than 30 years and have frequently butted heads. Their conversations throughout the crisis probed one another as they tried to game out a path forward, according to officials.White House officials have pointed to some grim evidence to argue that Biden's attempts at behind-the-scenes diplomacy worked: The latest Israel-Hamas war — in which at least 230 people in Gaza and at least 12 in Israel died — was shorter and less blood was spilled than in some of the other recent major outbreaks of violence in the region.Biden, in his brief remarks about the ceasefire, noted that but for the Iron Dome, a missile defense system developed by the U.S. and Israel, the body count would have been far worse. The system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells. Biden said he assured Netanyahu that his administration would work to quickly replenish it.He also pledged that humanitarian aid would quickly flow through the Palestinian Authority, which is in control of the West Bank but not Gaza.“We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas ... and in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal,” Biden said.The details of missile system supplies and humanitarian aid, though, could wait for another day.Biden ended on a hopeful note: “I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I’m committed to working for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hourbyhour-joe-biden-s-behind-the-scenes-manoeuvring-for-israel-hamas-ceasefire-101621576018554.html

21-05-2021||World||Israel-Hamas truce takes hold, Palestinians celebrate||An Egyptian-mediated truce between Israel and Hamas began on Friday, but Hamas warned it still had its "hands on the trigger" and demanded Israel end the violence in Jerusalem and address the damages in Gaza Strip after the worst fighting in years.US President Joe Biden pledged to salve the devastated Gaza. Aerial bombardment of the densely populated area killed 232 Palestinians, while rocket attacks killed 12 people in Israel during the conflict.Palestinians, many of whom had spent 11 days huddled in fear of Israeli shelling, poured into Gaza's streets. Mosque loud-speakers feted "the victory of the resistance achieved over the Occupation (Israel)."Cars driving around East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah at dawn flew Palestinian flags and honked horns, echoing the celebratory scenes in Gaza.In the countdown to the 2 am (2300 GMT Thursday) cease-fire, Palestinian rocket salvoes continued and Israel carried out at least one air strike.Each side said it stood ready to retaliate for any truce violations by the other. Cairo said it would send two delegations to monitor the ceasefire.The violence erupted on May 10, triggered by Palestinians' anger at what they saw as Israeli curbs on their rights in Jerusalem, including during police confrontations with protesters at Al-Aqsa mosque during the Ramadan fasting month.The fighting meant many Palestinians in Gaza could not mark the Eid al-Fitr festival at Ramadan's conclusion. On Friday, throughout Gaza, postponed Eid al-Fitr meals were held instead.In Israel, radio stations that had carried around-the-clock news and commentary switched back to pop music and folk songs.Death tollGaza health officials said 232 Palestinians, including 65 children, had been killed and more than 1,900 wounded in aerial bombardments. Israel said it had killed at least 160 combatants.Authorities put the death toll in Israel at 12, with hundreds of people treated for injuries in rocket attacks that caused panic and sent people rushing into shelters.Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, cast the fighting as successful resistance of a militarily and economically stronger foe."It is true the battle ends today but (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our hands are on the trigger and we will continue to grow the capabilities of this resistance," said Ezzat El-Reshiq, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau.He told Reuters in Doha that the movement's demands also include protecting Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and ending the eviction of several Palestinians from their home in East Jerusalem which Reshiq described as "a red line"."What comes after the battle of 'Sword of Jerusalem' is not like what came before because the Palestinian people backed the resistance and know that the resistance is what will liberate their land and protect their holy sites," Reshiq said.In Israel, relief was bittersweet."It's good that the conflict will end, but unfortunately I don't feel like we have much time before the next escalation," Eiv Izyaev, a 30-year-old software engineer, said in Tel Aviv.Amid growing global alarm, Biden had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seek de-escalation, while Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations sought to mediate.In a televised address on Thursday, Biden extended condolences to bereaved Israelis and Palestinians and said Washington would work with the United Nations "and other international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance" for Gaza and its reconstruction.Biden said aid would be coordinated with the Palestinian Authority - run by Hamas' rival, President Mahmoud Abbas, and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - "in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal".Hamas is deemed a terrorist group in the West and by Israel, which it refuses to recognise.Power struggleAnalysts saw a key goal of Hamas's rocket campaign as being to marginalise Abbas by presenting itself as the guardian of Palestinians in Jerusalem, whose eastern sector they seek for a future state.Making the link explicit, Hamas named the rocket operation "Sword of Jerusalem".Abbas, 85, remained a marginal figure during the 11-day conflict. He secured a first telephone call with Biden during the crisis - four months after Biden took office - but his western-backed Palestinian Authority exerts little influence over Gaza, and he made no public comment after the truce was announced.Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, an Abbas appointee, said “We welcome the success of the international efforts led by Egypt to stop the Israeli aggression against our people in Gaza Strip,” in comments published by Palestinian media.In perhaps a worrying sign for Abbas in his West Bank heartland, some Palestinians waved green Hamas flags in Ramallah, the seat of his government.Hamas previously demanded that any halt to the Gaza fighting be accompanied by Israeli drawdowns in Jerusalem. An Israeli official told Reuters there was no such condition in the truce.The State Department said that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken planned to travel to the Middle East, where he would meet with Israeli, Palestinian, and regional leaders to discuss recovery efforts.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Israeli and Palestinian leaders had a responsibility beyond the restoration of calm to address the root causes of the conflict,” he told reporters with serious dialogue.“Gaza is an integral part of the future Palestinian state and no effort should be spared to bring about real national reconciliation that ends the division," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/israelhamas-truce-takes-hold-palestinians-celebrate-101621571723485.html

You're talking about history repeating itself? They're not going to stop until she dies," Harry says in the mental health documentary series "The Me You Can't See.""It's incredibly triggering to potentially lose another woman in my life," he added, referring to Meghan. The "Me You Can't See" series, which Harry produced with U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey, is released on Apple TV on Friday.Princess Diana died in 1997 at age 36 in a crash in Paris after the car in which she was traveling with her Egyptian-born boyfriend Dodi Fayed was chased by paparazzi. Harry was 12 years old.Harry, whose American wife Meghan is bi-racial, spoke of racist reporting in the mainstream British press about his wife, as well as abuse on social media. Meghan has said her experience in Britain drove her to thoughts of suicide when she was pregnant with their first son Archie.In the documentary, Harry spoke of walking behind Diana's coffin through the streets of London with his brother William, father Prince Charles and uncle Charles Spencer."The thing I remember most was the sound of the horses' hooves going along the Mall," he said. "It was like I was outside of my body, just walking along, doing what was expected of me, showing one tenth of the emotion that everyone was showing."Years earlier, he recalled sitting in the back of his mother's car while she, in tears, was pursued by photographers."One of the feelings that comes up for me always is the helplessness. Being a guy and being too young to help a woman, in this case your mother, and that happened every single day," he said.Harry said he buried his feelings, but drank heavily and suffered panic attacks and anxiety in his 20s, and still freaks out when he sees cameras."I was so angry with what happened to her (Diana) and the fact there was no justice at all... the same people that chased her through that tunnel photographed her dying on the back seat of that car," he said."The clicking of cameras, and the flash of cameras makes my blood boil. It makes me angry. It takes me back to what happened to my mum, what I experienced as a kid."Even now, at age 36, he said that returning to London makes him feel tense and hunted.Harry said he started serious therapy almost five years ago, when he met Meghan."I quickly established that if this relationship was going to work, I had to deal with my past," he said. The couple married in May 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haunted-by-diana-s-death-prince-harry-talks-of-how-he-feared-losing-meghan-too-101621571863348.html

In the spirit of that effort, I urge the federal government to assist the Indian Government in its Covid-19 vaccine distribution effort as soon as it has the capacity to do so,” he said in the letter, a copy of which is with the PTI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said in the recent weeks, India has become a global epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic.The past week was one of the deadliest phase of the pandemic in India, which recorded 4,205 deaths on Wednesday, carrying the total number of confirmed deaths due to Covid-19 to more than 250,000.India’s healthcare system is under tremendous pressure and doctors and patients alike are in urgent need of assistance, he said.“We know that increasing vaccination rates is one of the most important tools available to combat the pandemic. Unfortunately, less than 10 per cent of Indians have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at this time, As Covid-19 continues to spread through the unvaccinated Indian population, the risk of new variants greatly increases and thousands more will lose their lives,” Suozzi said.Welcoming the efforts of the Biden administration to provide USD 100 million worth of relief to India, Suozzi wrote that given the scope of the ongoing health crisis, the United States must continue to coordinate with the Indian Government to bolster and support vaccine distribution programme.“The United States has long played a crucial role in supporting other nations through health initiatives, and it is imperative that we do so again in the global Covid-19 vaccination effort,” Suozzi wrote in his letter to Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-urges-president-biden-to-assist-india-in-anti-covid-vaccination-101621558000522.html

21-05-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden praises Israel-Hamas deal, vowing continued US diplomacy||President Joe Biden praised a truce between Israel and Hamas after an 11-day conflict over the Gaza Strip killed more than 200 people and led to rising pressure in the US to distance itself from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.“I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy,” Biden said at the White House on Thursday. “My administration will continue our quiet relentless diplomacy toward that end.”Israel and Hamas agreed late Thursday to an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire designed to end their 11-day conflict. The announcement came amid growing pressure from the Biden administration to stop the fighting, which killed an estimated 232 Palestinians and 12 Israelis.Israel’s security cabinet unanimously voted to approve Egypt’s proposal for an unconditional truce with Hamas, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The cease-fire will take effect at 2 a.m. local time on Friday, Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen TV reported, citing senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.Biden on Wednesday urged Netanyahu to end the fighting, telling the Israeli leader during a phone call he expected a “significant de-escalation today” according to the White House.The president also faced pressure from some Democrats to take a harder line against the Israeli government and voice stronger support for the Palestinians, who suffered heavy losses in the fighting. But in a signal to Democrats who wanted to halt weapons sales to Israel, Biden said he is willing to help “replenish” the Iron Dome missile defense system Israel deployed to stop Hamas’ rockets from the Gaza Strip.Biden had been hesitant to publicly criticize the Israeli government, delaying for several days any public call for a cease-fire. And on Thursday he reiterated previous remarks that Israel has a right to defend itself.The conflict also showed the limits of the administration’s power to act as a mediator in matters related to Hamas, which runs Gaza and is designated a terrorist group by the US, European Union and others.Palestinians, including the rival Palestinian Authority that oversees the West Bank, are wary of the US government playing the role of peacemaker after four years of being sidelined by former President Donald Trump.In this conflict, the Egyptian government, which has ties with both Israel and Hamas, was called on to broker a truce. Biden spoke to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah El-Sisi earlier Thursday to discuss the cease-fire negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-praises-israel-hamas-deal-vowing-continued-us-diplomacy-101621550177408.html
21-05-2021||World||Israel approves unilateral cease-fire in Gaza offensive||Israel on Thursday announced a cease-fire in the bruising 11-day war against Hamas militants that caused widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip and brought life in much of Israel to a standstill.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced the cease-fire after a late-night meeting of his Security Cabinet. It said the group had unanimously accepted an Egyptian proposal, though the sides were still determining exactly when it was to take effect.Senior defense officials, including the military chief of staff and national security adviser, recommended accepting the proposal after claiming “great accomplishments” in the operation, the statement said.Defense Minister Benny Gantz wrote on Twitter that “the reality in the field will determine the continuation of operations.”One member of the Security Cabinet said the cease-fire would take effect at 2 a.m., roughly three hours after the announcement. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the closed-door talks.A Hamas official said the declaration of a truce was a defeat for Netanyahu and “a victory to the Palestinian people.”Ali Barakeh, a member of Hamas’ Arab and Islamic relations bureau, told The Associated Press that the militants will remain on alert until they hear from mediators. Once Hamas hears from mediators, the group's leadership will hold discussions and make an announcement, he said.Shortly after the announcement, air-raid sirens indicating incoming rocket fire sounded in southern Israel.The agreement would close the heaviest round of fighting between the bitter enemies since a 50-day war in 2014, and once again there was no clear winner. Israel inflicted heavy damage on Hamas but was unable to prevent the rocket fire that has disrupted life for millions of Israelis for more than a decade.The fighting began May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes during the operation, targeting what it said was Hamas’ military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel network. Hamas and other militant groups embedded in residential areas have fired over 4,000 rockets at Israeli cities, with hundreds falling short and most of the rest intercepted.At least 230 Palestinians were killed, including 65 children and 39 women, with 1,710 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians.Hamas and the militant group Islamic Jihad said at least 20 of their fighters have been killed, while Israel said the number is at least 130. Some 58,000 Palestinians have fled their homes, many of them seeking shelter in crowded UN schools at a time of a raging coronavirus outbreak.Twelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a soldier, were killed.Since the fighting began, Gaza’s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, has rapidly deteriorated.Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in the territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas seized power in 2007.Israel considers Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks its destruction, to be a terrorist group and Hamas’ government is not internationally recognized.Israeli bombing has damaged over 50 schools across the territory, according to advocacy group Save the Children, completely destroying at least six. While repairs are done, education will be disrupted for nearly 42,000 children.Israeli attacks have also damaged at least 18 hospitals and clinics and destroyed one health facility, the World Health Organization said. Nearly half of all essential drugs have run out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cabinet-approves-cease-fire-in-gaza-israeli-media-101621540033862.html
21-05-2021||World||Record 55 million internally displaced world over||A key group that monitors internal displacement is reporting Thursday that violence and disasters — often caused or worsened by the impact of climate change — forced people to relocate within their countries more than 40 million times last year, the highest such tally in over a decade.The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (DMC), in its latest annual global report, says a record 55 million people were living away from their homes but within their countries at the end of last year, as storms and floods, as well as both protracted and new conflicts, drove up the figures that have been growing for more than a decade. Sometimes people have moved two or three times.The Geneva-based centre, which is part of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the number of internally displaced was more than twice that of refugees — those who flee to another country — at the end of last year. The group cautioned that the figures were likely a “significant underestimate” because Covid-19 travel restrictions impeded the collection of data.“It’s shocking that someone was forced to flee their home inside their own country every single second last year,” said NRC secretary-general Jan Egeland. “We are failing to protect the world’s most vulnerable people from conflict and disasters.”Of those displaced at the end of the year, some 48 million people had fled conflict and violence and 7 million had escaped from disasters, the group said.The centre pointed to escalating violence and wider activity from extremist groups in countries like Ethiopia, Mozambique and Burkina Faso last year, and ongoing wars in places like Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.It also noted intense cyclone seasons in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and long rainy seasons in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, saying such weather woes uprooted millions.Overall, the highest number of internally displaced people last year was in China, which faces floods regularly and authorities encourage or require internal displacement to get out of the way of rising waters, followed by the Philippines and Bangladesh. More than 5 million people in China were forced into internal displacement last year.Numbers may riseIDMC director Alexandra Bilakk said it was “particularly concerning that these high figures were recorded against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic”.Pointing out that movement restrictions obstructed data collection and “fewer people sought out emergency shelters for fear of infection”, she suggested the true figures were higher.The pandemic had meanwhile exacerbated socioeconomic conditions for displaced people, she added.Climate impactExperts say that climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of such extreme weather events.“We can only expect with the future impacts of climate change for these disasters to become more frequent and more intense, and therefore for the numbers of internally displaced people to grow,” Bilak said. It also warned that a convergence of conflicts and natural disasters was making the problem worse, with 95% of last year’s new conflict displacements occurring in countries vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. “Climate change and the overexploitation of natural resources may aggravate instability and conflict, which in turn may trigger displacement,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-55-million-internally-displaced-world-over-101621538356876.html
21-05-2021||World||Develop vaccines against Covid-19 in Africa, Latin America: WTO||The head of the World Trade Organization says it's paramount to diversify vaccine manufacturing and develop production in Africa and Latin America to contain the coronavirus pandemic.On the eve of a global health summit in Rome, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told European Union legislators on Thursday that normal market forces for exports and imports can't apply when it comes to the life-or-death issue of Covid-19 vaccines. Many of the world's wealthiest nations were hoarding the shots for their own population.She says the world has the capacity to manufacture 5 billion vaccine doses overall but as the virus has spread “we require twice and three times that. So the capacity was not there.”A main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80% concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations. She says “Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 % of the manufacturing capacity of the world,” and Latin America has about 2% of global production capacity. “This has to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/develop-vaccines-against-covid-19-in-africa-latin-america-wto-101621534598548.html
