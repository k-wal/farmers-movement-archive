General Assembly in an effort to bypass the Security Council and the US’s veto power there.The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Egypt has been trying to broker a cease-fire between neighboring Israel and Hamas, as it is one of a handful of countries that maintains official ties with both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-awaits-israel-response-to-cease-fire-plan-101621446305930.html
19-05-2021||World||UK begins 'booster' shot trial of 7 different Covid-19 vaccines||Britain launched a nationwide study on Wednesday to explore whether giving a third dose "booster" shot of coronavirus vaccines would be safe and effective in extending immune protection against Covid-19.The trial, which aims to recruit nearly 3,000 participants, will look at seven different Covid-19 shots, some of which are already approved by regulators and in wide use and others that are still in development.British officials have been planning for the possibility of a booster vaccination campaign before the winter after initially targeting immunisation with a two-dose schedule for the whole adult population by the summer.Major vaccine makers, as well as some policymakers in the United States, have also suggested that booster or even annual Covid-19 shots might be needed. But some global health experts have questioned whether there is evidence to show such repeat vaccinations are necessary.Saul Faust, a professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at Britain's Southampton University who will co-lead the trial, said its findings would inform vaccination strategy planners and politicians "in their decision on whether to boost anybody with a third at all, or - if they are going to get a booster - which vaccine might be used".The vaccines being evaluated include the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna Covid-19 shots already being rolled out in Britain, as well as vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, Valneva and CureVac for which Britain has future supply deals.They will be given as third shots to people who have received two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca's vaccine already, with initial findings expected in September."The data from this world-first clinical trial will help shape the plans for our booster programme later this year," health minister Matt Hancock said.Hancock also said Britain would host an in-person G7 health ministers meeting in Oxford on June 3-4, ahead of a leaders meeting later in the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-booster-shot-trial-of-7-different-covid-19-vaccines-101621441240031.html
19-05-2021||World||De-escalate today, Biden tells Israeli PM||President Joe Biden on Wednesday told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he “expected significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire” in the Gaza conflict, setting a deadline amid growing calls for an end to hostilities, including from his political allies.Though still staunchly supportive of Israel, many Democratic lawmakers have called for a ceasefire and pressed the administration to do more.“The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,” the White House said in a readout of their call.The US president has not yet explicitly called for a ceasefire and has calibrated his comments from saying in his first remarks on the ongoing violence on May 13 - that “Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory”.By Monday, the US president had shifted his position significantly. In a phone call with Netanyahu, he “expressed his support for a ceasefire”.The United States has been “engaged in quiet, intensive diplomacy” in the West Asia conflict with conversations with Israel and the Palestinians, but not with Hamas, which controls Gaza. The United States has designated Hamas a terrorist group. Egypt and Qatar are dealing with Hamas.Senior US diplomat Hady Amr, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel and Palestinian affairs, has been in the region and conducted talks with both sides.But, Biden has seemed increasingly at odds with many Democrats. Last week 28 Democratic senators - more than half the party’s strength in the chamber - jointly called for a ceasefire, including majority leader Chuck Schumer, a staunch supporter of Israel. Other known backers have also expressed public unease with Israel’s actions.Progressive Democrats in the House of Representatives are also calling for the administration to do more. “The president needs to tell Netanyahu to stop,” Ro Khanna told the Washington Post. “While Biden’s ceasefire comments were a marginally positive step,” Khanna said, “I think it has to be much stronger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deescalate-today-biden-tells-israeli-pm-101621443155320.html
19-05-2021||World||Joe Biden tells Netanyahu he expects 'significant de-escalation' in Israel||President Joe Biden stepped up the pressure on Israel to end 10 days of violent skirmishes with Palestinians, making clear in a call Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he expected “significant de-escalation” by day's end.Biden asked Netanyahu to move “toward the path to a cease-fire,” according to a White House description of their conversation.There is pressure, too, on Biden to do more, with more than 200 people killed in the fighting. Until Wednesday, Biden had avoided pushing the American ally more directly and publicly for a cease-fire or conveyed such a level of urgency for ending Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas in the thickly populated Gaza Strip.The Biden administration had relied on what officials described as “quiet, intensive” diplomacy, including quashing a UN Security Council statement that would have addressed a cease-fire.The administration's handling opened a divide between Biden and Democratic lawmakers, dozens of whom have called for a cease-fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-tells-netanyahu-he-expects-significant-de-escalation-today-in-israel-101621433389235.html
19-05-2021||World||'Covid will be easier than Israeli missiles': Gaza's fear of bomb beats virus||Like thousands of others in Gaza, Umm Jihad Ghabayin fled home with her children from Israeli bombardment without taking any essentials -- let alone a facemask against the raging Covid-19 pandemic.In response to rocket fire from Gaza, Israeli strikes have pounded the crowded Palestinian enclave since May 10, killing at least 219 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.As entire tower blocks tumble, reduced to smoking rubble by bombs, the immediate danger of devastating air strikes has replaced for Gazans the less obvious -- but still deadly -- risk of Covid-19."Of course I'm afraid of catching coronavirus, but it will be easier (to cope with) than Israeli missiles," mother-of-six Ghabayin said."Missiles kill us," one of her children added, aged eight, his feet covered in dust.Israeli air strikes have obliterated key infrastructure including water and electricity in Gaza, an impoverished and densely packed enclave home to some two million Palestinians.After fleeing her home, Ghabayin has found shelter at a UN-supported school where she feels safer from strikes -- but acknowledges the risk of transmission of Covid-19 is high."Since we arrived on Friday, we haven't showered once," 34-year-old Ghabayin told AFP. "The water is cut off for hours, and there is a total lack of hygiene".- Covid 'epicentres' -In the schools-turned-shelters, and on Gaza's bomb-ravaged streets, few are thinking about wearing masks."Israel's continuing attacks are undermining our efforts against coronavirus," said Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza's health ministry spokesman.Gaza, under Israeli blockade since 2007, recorded few Covid-19 cases in the early months of the pandemic.Access to the territory is tightly controlled by Israel and Egypt, and measures imposed by the enclave's Hamas rulers initially slowed the spread of the virus.But in an impoverished society with poor health infrastructure, containing the virus proved difficult to control.Before the military escalation, the rate of positive tests was among the highest in the world, at 28 percent, and hospitals were overwhelmed by patients.The World Health Organisation says over 100,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Gaza, of whom over 930 have died.Adnan Abou Hasna, a spokesman UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said that the schools transformed into shelters for the more than 40,000 displaced Gazans could become coronavirus "epicentres".While hand-washing stations and other sanitary facilities had been set up, he admitted these measures were inadequate.- Unbearable -On Monday, Israeli strikes hit a clinic, the health ministry headquarters and the only laboratory in Gaza that was conducting Covid-19 tests.Two doctors were also killed.Before the military escalation between Hamas and Israel a week ago, authorities in Gaza tested an average of some 1,600 people per day.Protecting medical infrastructure and health workers is an "imperative in all circumstances", World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Monday."It is essential that international humanitarian standards are fully respected," he added.The conflict is also hampering the vaccine rollout, with Gazans relying primarily on procurements from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, which must deliver stocks through Israeli territory.The pandemic had already placed Gaza's health system under massive strain, now buckling as it tries to treat the more than 1,500 people injured by Israeli strikes, according to health ministry statistics.Units previously dedicated to coronavirus patients have had to reorganise to cope with the influx of casualties.Salem Al-Attar, 38, sheltering in a UNRWA school after his home was destroyed in a strike, said he feared the tightly-packed conditions could spread the virus swiftly."The situation is disastrous," he said, a father of six.On the other side of school courtyard, Umm Mansour al-Qurum cried after receiving a phone call from a neighbour that half of her house had been destroyed in a strike."The situation is unbearable -- coronavirus and the war at the same time," said the 65-year-old, who fled the bombing with 30 members of her extended family. "I can't take it anymore".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-will-be-easier-than-israeli-missiles-gaza-s-fear-of-bomb-beats-virus-101621432549176.html
19-05-2021||World||Substantial part of US donations of 80 mn Covid-19 vaccines to be allocated through COVAX||A substantial part of the 80 million Covid-19 vaccines to be donated by the United States will be rolled out through the WHO-backed COVAX facility though country-specific allocations are yet to be made, President Joe Biden’s point-person for the global pandemic response said on Wednesday.Gayle Smith, the coordinator for the global Covid-19 response at the state department, said the efforts of the US administration are focused on covering gaps in three areas – dose-sharing, increasing the supply of vaccines and financing for the COVAX facility.Biden announced on Monday the US will share 20 million doses from its surplus stocks of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by the end of June. This will be in addition to the earlier commitment to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. “We intend that the allocation of the vaccines will include a substantial portion though COVAX but we have not made final decisions,” Smith, a former USAID director, told a news briefing. The US is confident that COVAX, the largest vaccine delivery platform, will undertake fair and science and data-based allocation of vaccines, she added.“We’re going to be putting 80 million additional vaccines into the mix, making us the largest sharer of vaccines thus far,” she said. “I think as we all know, supply is a very big issue and we need many more vaccines for countries all over the world.”Asked specifically about plans to assist India with vaccines, she replied, “From the president on down, given the surge there, India has been a major priority for us. We have delivered $100 million in emergency assistance [and] mobilised with the American private sector a pretty amazing response.”As with other countries, she noted, the specific allocation of vaccines for India is yet to be decided.In response to a question on whether one billion doses to be made in India for the Quad Vaccine Partnership could be used within the country, Smith said the final allocation will depend on conditions existing when these shots are available by 2022.“On the Quad production, given the timeline for that production, I think its dispensation will depend to a great extent on the state of play around the world with vaccine coverage. That timeline is fairly extended,” she said. “I think... in principle, those doses are available for internal use but also for export to the rest of the world. I think the final allocation or plan for that will depend on what conditions we’re facing at the time they are available.”The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has launched a global initiative for investments in multiple regions, including the Quad Vaccine Partnership to supply a billion doses by the end of 2022.Smith said the US is working with producers around the world both to increase vaccine supplies and to bolster supply chains for ingredients, which too are in short supply. The DFC is making investments in manufacturing sites around the world and providing capital to increase supplies in the short and medium-term, she said.The US will also work closely with its partners, she said, noting that Biden had said “we can do a great deal but we cannot do it alone”. Collaboration with the G7 and European Union will help efforts “to get to the scale needed to bring this pandemic under control,” she added.The US is also hoping its decision to donate 80 million doses will encourage other countries to step up to share more doses so that there is maximum vaccine coverage. “Our view with respect to vaccine diplomacy... is that vaccines are tools for public health, they are the means for bringing this pandemic to an end. We do not see them, do not intend to use them as means for influence or pressure,” Smith said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/substantial-part-of-us-donations-of-80-mn-covid-19-vaccines-to-be-allocated-through-covax-101621431333311.html
19-05-2021||World||What Beijing's new crackdown means for cryptocurrency in China||Chinese regulators have tightened restrictions that ban financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrencies, marking a fresh crackdown on digital money.Compared with a previous ban issued in 2017, the new rules greatly expanded the scope of prohibited services, and judged that "virtual currencies are not supported by any real value".What are the new measures?Three financial industry associations on Tuesday directed their members, which include banks and online payment firms, not to offer any crypto-related services, such as account openings, registration, trading, clearing, settlement and insurance, reiterating the 2017 ban.But the new ban, which was posted by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), also covers services that were not previously mentioned.For example, it made clear that institutions must not accept virtual currencies, or use them as a means of payment and settlement. Nor can institutions provide exchange services between cryptocurrencies and the yuan or foreign currencies.Additionally, institutions were prohibited from providing cryptocurrency saving, trust or pledging services and issuing crypto-related financial products. And virtual currencies must not be used as investment targets by trust and fund products.Banks and payment companies were also urged to step up monitoring of money flows involved in cryptocurrency trading, and coordinate more closely in identifying such risks.The directives were made in a joint statement from the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China.What were earlier rules in China against cryptocurrencies?China does not recognise cryptocurrencies as legal tender and the banking system does not accept cryptocurrencies or provide relevant services.In 2013, the government defined bitcoin as a virtual commodity and said individuals were allowed to freely participate in its online trade.However, later that year, financial regulators, including the PBOC, banned banks and payment companies from providing bitcoin-related services.In September 2017, China banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in a bid to protect investors and curb financial risks.The ICO rules also banned cryptocurrency trading platforms from converting legal tender into cryptocurrencies and vice versa.The restrictions prompted most such trading platforms to shut down with many moving offshore.The ICO rules also barred financial firms and payment companies from providing services for ICOs and cryptocurrencies, including account openings, registration, trading, clearing or liquidation services.By July 2018, 88 virtual currency trading platforms and 85 ICO platforms had withdrawn from the market, the PBOC said.Why has China tightened regulation?The global bitcoin bull run has revived cryptocurrency trading in China.Tuesday's industry directive warned speculative bitcoin trading had rebounded, infringing "the safety of people's property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order."Many Chinese investors were now trading on platforms owned by Chinese exchanges that had relocated overseas, including Huobi and OKEx. Meanwhile, China's over-the-counter market for cryptocurrencies has become busy again, while once-dormant trading chartrooms on social media have revived.China-focused exchanges, which also include Binance and MXC, allow Chinese individuals to open accounts online, a process that takes just a few minutes. They also facilitate peer-to-peer deals in OTC markets that help convert Chinese yuan into cryptocurrencies. Such transactions are made through banks, or online payment channels such as Alipay or WeChat Pay.Retail investors also buy "computing power" from cryptocurrency miners, who design various investment schemes that promise quick and fat returns.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies' potential threat to China's fiat currency, the yuan, has spurred the PBOC to launch its own digital currency.What's the impact of the crackdown?The fresh crackdown makes it more difficult for individuals to buy cryptocurrencies using various payment channels, and could impact miners' business by making it harder for them to exchange cryptocurrencies for yuan.But banks and payment companies also face challenges of identifying money flows related to cryptocurrencies.Winston Ma, NYU Law School adjunct professor and author of the book "the Digital War", said the new rules were designed to completely cut crypto-related transactions out of China's financial systems, and expects the government to roll out new regulations targeting crypto assets.Hong Kong's Bitcoin Association said in a tweet in response to China's reiterated ban: "For those new to bitcoin, it is customary for the People's Bank of China to ban bitcoin at least once in a bull cycle."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-beijing-s-new-crackdown-means-for-cryptocurrency-in-china-101621430093291.html
19-05-2021||World||EU relaxes travel measures, to allow tourists fully vaccinated against Covid-19||The European Union on Wednesday took a step toward relaxing tourism travel for visitors from outside the bloc, with EU ambassadors agreeing on measures to allow fully vaccinated visitors in.They also agreed on easing the criteria for nations to be considered a safe country, from which all tourists can travel. Up to now, that list included only seven nations.The EU imposed strict measures last year to contain Covid-19 outbreaks but the bloc's 27 ambassadors now say many of those restrictions on non-essential travel should be eased. Specifically, tourists from outside the bloc who have been fully vaccinated should be allowed in.The EU “Council will now recommend that member states ease some of the current restrictions" for those who have been vaccinated, said EU Commission spokesman Christian Wigand.“The council should also soon expand the list of non-EU countries with a good epidemiological situation from where travel is permitted,” said Wigand. The EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is to give advice on the list.EU nations have been struggling throughout the pandemic to prop up their vital tourism industry and hope to recover some income over the peak summer season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-relaxes-travel-measures-to-allow-tourists-fully-vaccinated-against-covid19-101621425585402.html
19-05-2021||World||Bitcoin plunges to USD 38,000 as Elon Musk-fueled rally Collapses||The Elon Musk-propelled rally in Bitcoin just evaporated.The world’s largest cryptocurrency has erased all the gains it clocked up following Tesla Inc.’s Feb. 8 announcement that it would use corporate cash to buy the asset and accept it as a form of payment for its vehicles. Now traders are bracing for more pain as the token breaches a key technical level.Prices for the digital asset dropped 12% to about $38,000 as of 7:38 a.m. in New York. It’s now down around 40% from its record of almost $65,000 set in April. Other crypto tokens dropped in tandem on Wednesday, with Ether losing more than 20%.Fueling the volatility is Tesla CEO Musk himself, whose social-media utterances have whipsawed the crypto community. A statement from the People’s Bank of China on Tuesday reiterating that digital tokens can’t be used as a form of payment added to the selloff.Now, as Bitcoin takes out its 200-day moving average, chart-watchers are warning of more danger ahead.“From a technical standpoint, the indicators are flashing red,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote in Gland, Switzerland. “The next important support level stands near $37,000, then the $30,000 mark. There is a chance that we see a pullback to these levels and even below, at least in the short run.”Cryptocurrency-linked stocks also dropped, with Coinbase Global Inc. falling 5.2% in U.S. premarket trading and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. slumping 12%.Analysts have been warning of Bitcoin’s vulnerability, with recent predictions that it would fall back to $40,000. In addition to dropping below its 200-day moving average, other indicators -- like a bearish head and shoulders pattern in Bitcoin futures -- may also give backers cause for worry.Then there’s Musk.With his often cryptic Twitter posts moving millions, the Tesla chief has become a Svengali-like character in the world of crypto. Bitcoin embarked on a multi-month rally following Tesla’s February announcement, soaring to its $64,870 peak, in large part due to the company’s embrace.Wiped OutAt the time, Tesla’s acceptance was hailed as a watershed moment for the coin, with many in the crypto world seeing it as yet another step in its evolution.All that’s been wiped out after Musk sent investors into a tizzy following a mass of head-spinning tweets that started last week when he criticized Bitcoin’s energy use.Tesla would suspend car purchases using the token, he announced, calling recent energy-consumption trends “insane.” Over the weekend, after insinuating his EV company might have sold its Bitcoin holdings, he sent out tweets clarifying that it hadn’t. All of which had traders scrambling.“Realistically, it is not the first time Elon Musk’s tweets have been erratic and, frankly, wrong,” said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36. “The crypto markets are extremely emotionally driven and their participants are prone to overreacting to events they perceive as negative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-plunges-to-usd-38-000-as-elon-musk-fueled-rally-collapses-101621426031257.html

Confused users, initially unaware of the outage, complained of not being able to play videos and also of issues with logging in and user accounts.Data from Downdetector, a website that provides real-time status and outage information, showed that at least 10,000 users have complained of outages in YouTube services between 8am and 9am (IST), after which, the number of people reporting the outage fell drastically.Following the many complaints by users of the platform, #YouTubedown was found trending on Twitter earlier in the day. Noticing the reports, YouTube responded saying that the issue was fixed and thanked its users for reporting the outage. “We’re seeing reports around difficulties accessing YouTube services within the last hour. We can confirm that this is now fixed and you should be able to access our service without any issues. Thanks for your reports and do let us know if you’re still facing any problems!” the company tweeted via its official Twitter handle @TeamYouTube.Later on Wednesday evening, YouTube updated that few other users have complained that the issue has been repeating and again confirmed that it has been fixed. “Update - We received new reports about this issue. Our teams looked into it and now we can confirm it's resolved (again). We'll keep a close watch and let us know if you find any problems!” However, downdetector showed that not many users have reported an outage and as of 4pm, only 29 users had reported.In a separate incident earlier on Wednesday, YouTube also tweeted to creators saying, “If you were having issues uploading or watching videos on YouTube (including live streams) in the last ~45 mins – this issue has been fixed. Note: if your video is processing, it should complete now – otherwise you may need to reupload.

19-05-2021||World||China, US clash over Winter Olympics boycott call||China on Wednesday said the US House speaker Nancy Pelosi was “full of lies” after she called for a “diplomatic boycott” of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics over human rights abuses.US lawmakers are getting increasingly vocal about an Olympic boycott and have lashed out at American firms, arguing their silence about what the state department has termed “a genocide of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in China was abetting the Chinese government”.“What I propose - and join those who are proposing - is a diplomatic boycott,” Pelosi said, in which “lead countries of the world withhold their attendance at the Olympics”.Pelosi’s comments drew a strong response from China, which denies ill-treating Muslim minorities and has claimed that camps in Xinjiang, where an unknown number have been held, are vocational training centres, meant to deradicalise and train them for employment.“Some US individuals’ remarks are full of lies and disinformation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday.“US politicians should stop using the Olympic movement to play despicable political games,” Zhao said. “Some people in the US hype themselves up as moral authority. I don’t know where they get the nerve to say so.”Zhao said that the US’ intention of using human rights issues is to divert attention from its own historical and present human rights crimes, disclose the US’ motive of containing China’s development under the guise of so-called human rights issues, and expose the hypocrisy of the so-called democracy and human rights of the US.CHINA TARGETS US OVER TAIWAN STRAITBesides strongly criticising Pelosi’s statement, Beijing also accused Washington of threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait after a US warship sailed through the sensitive waterway that separates Taiwan from China.The US Navy’s 7th Fleet said the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur conducted a “routine Taiwan Strait transit” on Tuesday in accordance with international law. “The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows,” the US navy said.A spokesperson for China’s Eastern Theatre Command expressed strong opposition and condemned the move, which comes amid heightened tensions between the two powers.The spokesperson, Colonel Zhang Chunhui said that by sending the guided missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur through the Taiwan Strait and hyping the event publicly, the US sent the wrong signals to “Taiwan independence” forces; Beijing claims the self-ruled democracy as a breakaway region.Chunhui said the passage of the US warship deliberately disturbed and damaged the regional situation and harmed peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-clash-over-winter-olympics-boycott-call-101621425933575.html
19-05-2021||World||Israel says it has no 'timeframe' for an end to Gaza hostilities||Israel said on Wednesday it was not setting a timeframe for an end to hostilities with Gaza as its military pounded the Palestinian enclave with air strikes and Hamas militants unleashed new cross-border rocket attacks.Palestinian medical officials said 219 people had now been killed in 10 days of aerial bombardments which have destroyed roads, buildings and other infrastructure, and worsened the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.Israeli authorities put the death toll at 12 in Israel, where repeated rocket attacks have caused panic and sent people rushing into shelters. Regional and US-led diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire have intensified but so far failed.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of any halt to the fighting in public remarks at a briefing to foreign ambassadors to Israel, saying his country was engaged in "forceful deterrence" to prevent future conflict with Hamas.In remarks reported by Israeli media from a closed question-and-answer session, he was quoted as saying: "We're not standing with a stopwatch. We want to achieve the goals of the operation. Previous operations lasted a long time so it is not possible to set a timeframe."In a 25-minute attack overnight, Israel bombarded targets including what its military said were tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip used by Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza.Some 50 rockets were fired from the enclave, the Israeli military said, with sirens sounding in the coastal city of Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv, and in areas closer to the Gaza border. There were no reports of injuries or damage overnight but days of rocket fire have unsettled many Israelis.Nearly 450 buildings in densely populated Gaza have been destroyed or badly damaged, including six hospitals and nine primary-care health centres, and more than 52,000 Palestinians have been displaced, the UN humanitarian agency said.The damage has left large craters and piles of rubble across the coastal enclave, and deepened long-running concerns about living conditions in Gaza."Whoever wants to learn about the humanity of the (Israelis) should come to the Gaza Strip and look at the houses that got destroyed on top of those who lived in them," said university lecturer Ahmed al-Astal, standing by the rubble of his house in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.He said there had been no warning before his home was destroyed in an air strike before dawn.Israel, which blames the latest hostilities on Hamas, says it issues warnings to evacuate buildings that are to be fired on and that it attacks only what it regards as military targets."We try to target those who target us. With great precision," Netanyahu told the foreign envoys."As surgical an operation as it is, even in a surgical room in a hospital you don't have the ability to prevent collateral damage around effected tissues. Even then you can't. And certainly in a military operation you cannot."DiplomacyHamas began firing rockets nine days ago in retaliation for what it said were Israeli rights abuses against Palestinians in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The rocket attacks followed Israeli security police clashes with worshippers at al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and a court case by Israeli settlers to evict Palestinians from a neighbourhood in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.The hostilities are the most serious between Hamas and Israel in years, and, in a departure from previous Gaza conflicts, have helped fuel street violence in Israeli cities between Jews and Arabs.Hamas' leading role in confronting Israel over Jerusalem, an issue that resonates with many Palestinians, poses a challenge to its main rival, West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas, who last month cancelled a parliamentary election in which the group appeared likely to make gains.France called on Tuesday for a UN Security Council resolution on the violence. Diplomats said the United States told the Council a "public pronouncement right now" would not help calm the crisis."Our goal is to get to the end of this conflict. We are going to evaluate day by day what the right approach is. It continues to be that quiet, intensive behind-the-scenes discussions are tactically our approach at this time," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday.Egypt and U.N. mediators also stepped up diplomatic efforts, and the U.N. General Assembly will discuss the violence on Thursday.Israel's N12 TV news, quoting unidentified Palestinian sources, reported that Egypt, via "secret channels", had proposed that Israel-Gaza fighting end on Thursday morning.Ezzat El-Reshiq, a member of Hamas' political bureau who is based in Qatar, issued a statement on Tuesday saying reports that it had agreed to such a ceasefire were untrue.The latest deaths included three Palestinians killed in overnight air strikes, Gaza officials said, including a journalist with Hamas's Al-Aqsa radio station.Gaza medical officials say the Palestinian death toll includes 63 children, and that more than 1,500 people have been wound 500 wounded since fighting began on May 10. Israeli authorities say the death toll in Israel includes two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-says-it-has-no-timeframe-for-an-end-to-gaza-hostilities-101621423052073.html

"Everyone concerned is upset as this comes so soon after she lost her husband."The Queen lost her husband of 73 years in April and had found solace in walking five-month-old Fergus, who died unexpectedly, and Muick most days on the grounds of Windsor Castle, the newspaper said.Prince Andrew reportedly gave his mother the two dorgi puppies -- a cross between dachshunds and the queen's beloved corgis breed -- in February as a surprise to cheer her up after 99-year-old Philip went into hospital that month. He died on April 9.Buckingham Palace did not comment.The 95-year-old Queen used to be a keen breeder of corgis, a short-legged Welsh breed. She has given that up, citing her advancing age, but The Sun said she was thrilled by the new puppies.Fergus was named after the Queen's uncle, Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed in World War I, The Sun said.Muick is the name of a loch on the Scottish royal estate at Balmoral. The Queen still has one older dorgi called Candy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-absolutely-devastated-after-puppy-dies-report-101621421577905.html
19-05-2021||World||Malawi burns 20,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses that expired||Malawi has burned nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines because they had expired.The government incinerated 19,610 doses of the vaccine at Kamuzu Central Hospital in the capital Lilongwe on Wednesday morning.The vaccines were the remainder of 102,000 doses that arrived in Malawi on March 26 with just 18 days until they expired on April 13, according to Health Secretary Charles Mwansambo.All other doses of the shipment, donated by the African Union, were successfully administered, he said.Malawi’s burning of the vaccines defies calls not to do so by the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last month those organizations urged African countries not to destroy Covid-19 vaccines that passed their expiration dates, saying they were still safe to use.But the calls came too late for Malawi, a small southern African country of about 20 million people, ministry of health spokesman Joshua Malango told The Associated Press.“We had stopped observation of proper storage mechanisms and the vaccines would have still been damaged in one way or the other,” he said.The destruction of the vaccines was witnessed by several top officials from the auditor-general’s office, the treasury, and the anti-corruption bureau "in order to enhance transparency,” health official Mwansambo said.Malawi will still have adequate stocks of Covid-19 vaccines in both public and private health facilities, he said. Does Malawi expect deliveries of any more vaccines.Malawi's got its first consignment of 360,000 AstraZeneca doses in early March from the UN-backed COVAX initiative which is providing vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. The country received another batch of 50,000 AstraZeneca doses from the Indian government. With the AU donation, Malawi had a total of 512,000 AstraZeneca doses.So far 212,615 doses have been given in Malawi. 34,216 confirmed cases, including 1,153 deaths, according to the Africa CDC.Currently, the country is seeing a decrease in the disease, with the 7-day rolling average of daily new cases in Malawi dropping from 0.07 new cases per 100,000 people on May 4 to 0.04 new cases per 100,000 people on May 18. Official deaths from Covid-19 are also declining, according to statistics from Johns Hopkins University.Malawi, like many other African countries, has relied on the AstraZeneca vaccine that has been distributed by COVAX and the African Union. But now supplies of the vaccine have become more scarce because India, the main supplier of vaccines to COVAX, has stopped exports until it has adequately vaccinated large numbers of its population of 1.4 billion people.The Serum Institute of India says it hopes to start delivering coronavirus vaccines to COVAX and to other countries by the end of the year. The delay will significantly set back global efforts to immunize people against Covid-19. India’s Serum Institute is the world’s biggest vaccine-maker. The company said in March that it was postponing all exports of coronavirus vaccines to deal with the explosive surge of cases on the subcontinent. At the time, the World Health Organization said it expected Covid-19 vaccine deliveries from India to resume by June and the interruption would affect about 90 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malawi-burns-20-000-astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-that-expired-101621421903890.html
19-05-2021||World||Nepal, Bangladesh scramble to secure Covid-19 vaccines as India curbs exports||Nepal and Bangladesh are making frantic diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out and supply prospects have become clouded by a prolonged Indian curb on vaccine exports.Reuters reported on Tuesday that India was unlikely to resume major exports of Covid-19 vaccines until October at the earliest as it diverts shots for domestic use, a longer-than-expected delay set to worsen a shortage of supplies coming through the COVAX global vaccine sharing scheme, designed to help low-income countries.Bangladesh said it urgently needed 1.6 million doses of AstraZeneca Plc's Covid-19 vaccine to provide second doses and it had approached several countries for help, including the United States and Canada."Bangladesh foreign minister urged the Canadian High Commissioner to pursue with his government so that Bangladesh receives at least 2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine from Canada on an emergency basis," the foreign ministry said in a statement.The ministry said its diplomats were also hoping to secure 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the United States, which plans to share up to 60 million doses of the vaccine.Bangladesh has an agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures the AstraZeneca shot, for 30 million doses, but has received only 7 million.Bangladesh has also turned to China and Russia for supplies of China's Sinopharm and the Russian Sputnik V vaccines after India curbed vaccine exports in April.Bangladesh has been relying on the AstraZeneca vaccine but only 2% of its 170 million people are fully vaccinated.'BACK-DOOR DIPLOMACY'Nepal, which started its vaccination drive in January with 2.35 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot provided by India and COVAX, also said it has no stocks and more than 1.55 million people were waiting for their second dose."People above 65 and others in risk groups who received their first shots of the Indian vaccine are waiting for their second," Jhalak Gautam, head of the vaccine section of the Ministry of Health and Population, told Reuters."It's already overdue," he said, adding the SII had yet to deliver one million shots that Nepal bought.The SII said on Tuesday it hoped to start supplying COVAX and delivering to other countries by the end of the year.Nepal had asked Indian authorities for an early delivery of more shots, said Sewa Lamal, a spokesman for Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."Despite their own problems, we hope India can consider emergency requirements," she told Reuters.India's foreign ministry did not comment on Nepal's request.The head of the U.N. children's fund, which is helping supply Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX, on Monday asked G7 countries to donate supplies to COVAX as an emergency measure to address the severe shortfall caused by disruption to India's exports."There's a lot of back-door diplomacy happening to get extra doses from USA, EU and other 'rich' countries to make up for the backlog created by India," a source at UNICEF told Reuters.The source said a lot of efforts were underway to resolve the supply disruptions and it could be too early to gauge the long-term impact of India's export curbs.But the short-term impact of the reduced supply was already pronounced. UNICEF said this week that COVAX would deliver its 65 millionth vaccine dose this week, far behind its original target of 170 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-bangladesh-scramble-to-secure-covid-19-vaccines-as-india-curbs-exports-101621418975800.html

19-05-2021||World||'Children’s cries filling street': Israeli airstrikes kills 6 in Gaza||Israeli airstrikes killed at least six people across the Gaza Strip and destroyed the home of an extended family early Wednesday. Despite growing international pressure for a cease-fire, the military said it widened its strikes on militant targets in the Palestinian territory’s south to blunt continuing rocket fire from Hamas.Residents surveyed the piles of bricks, concrete and other debris that had once been the home of 40 members of al-Astal family. They said a warning missile struck the building in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis five minutes before the airstrike, allowing everyone to escape.Ahmed al-Astal, a university professor, described a scene of panic before the airstrike hit, with men, women and children racing out of the building. Some of the women didn't even have time to cover their hair with Muslim headscarves, he said.“We had just gotten down to the street, breathless, when the devastating bombardment came,” he said. “They left nothing but destruction, the children’s cries filling the street. ... This is happening, and there is no one to help us. We ask God to help us.”The Israeli military said it struck militant targets around the towns of Khan Younis and Rafah, with 52 aircraft hitting 40 underground targets. Gaza’s Health Ministry said a woman was killed and eight people were wounded in those strikes.Hamas-run Al-Aqsa radio said one of its reporters was killed in an airstrike in Gaza City. Among the six killed Wednesday were also two people who died when warning missiles crashed into their apartment.The latest strikes came as diplomatic efforts aimed at a cease-fire gathered strength and Gaza’s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, rapidly deteriorated. Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power in 2007.The Biden administration was privately encouraging Israel to wind down its bombardment of Gaza. Egyptian negotiators also were working to halt the fighting, and while they have not made progress with Israel, they were optimistic international pressure would force it to the table. Officials discussed the sensitive diplomacy on condition of anonymity.The fighting began May 10 when Hamas fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.At least 219 Palestinians have been killed in airstrikes, including 63 children and 36 women, with 1,530 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians. Hamas and Islamic Jihad say at least 20 of their fighters have been killed, while Israel says the number is at least 130. Some 58,000 Palestinians have fled their homes.Twelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier, have been killed in rocket attacks.The Israeli military has launched hundreds of airstrikes it says are targeting Hamas’ militant infrastructure, while Palestinian militants have fired more than 3,700 rockets at Israel, with hundreds falling short and most of the rest intercepted. The rockets have reached a number of Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, and have brought life to a standstill in areas near Gaza.Israeli attacks have damaged at least 18 hospitals and clinics and destroyed one health facility, the World Health Organization said. Nearly half of all essential drugs have run out.The Gaza Health Ministry said it had salvaged coronavirus vaccines after shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike damaged the territory's only testing facility, which also administered hundreds of vaccines. The operations were relocated to another clinic.The WHO said the bombing of key roads, including those leading to the main Shifa Hospital, has hindered ambulances and supply vehicles in Gaza, which was already struggling to cope with a coronavirus outbreak.Among the buildings leveled by Israeli airstrikes was one housing The Associated Press' Gaza office and those of other media outlets.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating in the building. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Israel had given the U.S. information about the bombing, without elaborating.The AP has called for an independent investigation of the attack. The news organization's president, Gary Pruitt, has said the AP had no indication Hamas was present in the building and that “this is something we check as best we can.”The fighting — the worst since a 2014 war between Israel and Hamas — has ignited protests around the world and inspired Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories to call a general strike Tuesday. It was a rare collective action that spanned boundaries central to decades of failed peace efforts. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state.Although the strike was peaceful in many places, with shops in east Jerusalem’s usually bustling Old City markets shuttered, violence erupted in the occupied West Bank.Hundreds of Palestinians burned tires in Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority is headquartered, and hurled stones at an Israeli military checkpoint. Three protesters were killed and more than 140 wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in several cities, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli army said two soldiers were wounded in Ramallah by gunshots to the leg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/childrens-cries-filling-street-israeli-airstrikes-kills-6-in-gaza-101621417382830.html
19-05-2021||World||'Boycott China's 2022 Olympics': Pelosi calls on US and world leaders||US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called for a US diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, criticizing China for human rights abuses and saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Pelosi's remarks were "full of lies" and that human rights were developing vigorously in China.US lawmakers have been increasingly vocal about an Olympic boycott or venue change, and have lashed out at American corporations, arguing their silence about what the State Department has deemed a genocide of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China was abetting the Chinese government.Pelosi, a Democrat, told a bipartisan congressional hearing on the issue that heads of state around the world should shun the Games, scheduled for February."What I propose - and join those who are proposing - is a diplomatic boycott," Pelosi said, in which "lead countries of the world withhold their attendance at the Olympics.""Let's not honor the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China," she added."For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?" she said.An independent United Nations panel said in 2018 it had received credible reports that at least 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims had been held in camps in China's Xinjiang region. Beijing describes them as vocational training centers to stamp out extremism, and strongly rejects accusations of abuse and genocide.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing that Pelosi's remarks were "full of lies and false information," and the United States was afraid visiting countries would see China's "vigorous development of human rights".In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu earlier told Reuters that U.S. attempts to interfere in China's domestic affairs over the Olympics were doomed to fail."I wonder what makes some US politicians think they actually have the so-called moral authority? On human rights issues, they are in no position, either historically or currently, to make wanton groundless criticism against China," Liu said.'HELD TO ACCOUNT'Republican Congressman Chris Smith, who led the hearing, said corporate sponsors should be called to testify before Congress and be "held to account"."Big business wants to make lots of money, and it doesn't seem to matter what cruelty - even genocide - that the host nation commits," Smith said.Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern added the Games should be postponed to give the International Olympic Committee (IOC) time to "relocate to a country whose government is not committing atrocities.""If we can postpone an Olympics by a year for a pandemic, we can surely postpone the Olympics for a year for a genocide," McGovern said, referring to the decision by Japan and the IOC to delay the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo due to Covid-19.Demands for some form of boycott of the Beijing Games are growing.Last month, Republican Senator Mitt Romney introduced an amendment to broader legislation to counter China that would implement a U.S. diplomatic boycott.And a coalition of human rights activists on Tuesday called for athletes to boycott the Games and put pressure on the IOC.US President Joe Biden's administration has said it hopes to develop a joint approach with allies to participation in Beijing's Olympics, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken has repeatedly said the issue has not yet been broached in discussions.Asked about Pelosi's comments, a senior US administration official told Reuters the administration's position on the 2022 Olympics had not changed.Biden, a Democrat, has said China is America's strategic competitor, and has vowed to not let the country surpass the United States as a world leader on his watch.Proponents of Americans competing in Beijing's Olympics say it would be unfair to punish athletes, and the Games would provide a platform for the United States, which has one of the highest Winter Olympic medal counts, to show its vitality on the global stage.Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive officer of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a written statement the committee was concerned about the "oppression of the Uyghur population," but barring US athletes from the Games was "certainly not the answer.""Past Olympic boycotts have failed to achieve political ends," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boycott-china-s-2022-olympics-pelosi-calls-on-us-and-world-leaders-101621416692967.html
19-05-2021||World||No longer silent, Gulf Arab citizens express anger at Israel||The ongoing bloodshed in the Gaza Strip has unleashed a chorus of voices across Gulf Arab states that are fiercely critical of Israel and emphatically supportive of Palestinians.The vocal opposition to Israel, expressed in street protests, on social media and in newspaper columns, comes just months after pacts were signed to establish ties with Israel — and complicates government efforts to rally Arab citizens around full-throttle acceptance of the deals.Analysts said the conflict will also set back Israeli efforts to secure more normalization deals with other Arab states, like Saudi Arabia.The criticism has not only put Arab governments that signed the diplomatic accords with Israel in a difficult position with their citizens, it also affirms that the Palestinian cause continues to resonate deeply with people across the Middle East.“No matter what your national priorities are at the moment or regional priorities are at the moment, when stuff like this happens, the Palestinian issue comes back and hits you,” Emirati political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla said.Still, the open calls for Palestinian rights and condemnation of Israel voiced by countless Gulf Arab citizens have largely mirrored official statements from their governments, all of which have condemned the violence in some form. Some have gone further, and Abdulla said he’d hoped the United Arab Emirates' most recent statement calling “on all parties” to cease fighting had been bolder and named Israel as the aggressor.In speaking out, Gulf citizens are challenging the official narratives around normalization with Israel.In Bahrain, civil society groups signed a letter urging the government to expel the Israeli ambassador. In Kuwait, protesters held two rallies and are demanding permission to hold more. In Qatar, the government allowed hundreds to protest over the weekend as Hamas’ top leader delivered a speech. In the UAE, some have openly donned the black-and-white checkered Palestinian keffiyeh on Instagram while others have tweeted under hashtags supportive of Palestinians.Last year, the UAE became the first Arab country in over two decades to establish ties with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan in 1979 and 1994, respectively. It was a brazen move that bypassed the Palestinians, who slammed it as treason and a stab in the back.The UAE's move paved the way for three other countries — Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco — to announce similar pacts with Israel in rapid succession.Immediately after the UAE formalized ties with Israel in September, a tsunami of state propaganda framed it as a new era of peace, religious tolerance and security for the region.Among the general Emirati public, there was little to no visible pushback from citizens when their government announced ties with Israel. Fiery nationalistic figures on Twitter with tens of thousands of followers aggressively cheered the pact, and throughout the current conflict have both defended ties with Israel and made posts mocking Palestinian protesters.But unlike in Western democracies, a lack of protest in the Gulf does not mean acceptance. In the UAE, political parties are banned and political expression is heavily suppressed.“The show of support that we saw during the early days of normalization, I think it represents something deeper in Emirati society ... and that is that the vast majority support their government,” Abdulla said. “It was a show of support for the government rather than a show of support for ‘normalization’ as such.”Mira Al-Hussein, an Emirati PhD candidate at Cambridge University, said Emiratis feel taken care of and valued by their government, which provides citizens with strong social safety nets.“But that doesn’t mean we feel comfortable by what’s happening around us,” she said.She changed her Twitter handle in support of Palestinians since the fighting broke out, and has used the platform to slam Israel's policies and highlight the atrocities of the war.“You don’t sign papers and expect a human catastrophe to go away,” she said of the accord with Israel.Over the years, there have been changes to school curricula across Gulf Arab states to replace pan-Arab and pan-Islamic ideals with a nationalistic identity that unites people around the flag.The UAE has been trying to mold public discourse around nationalism and a rejection of youth or Islamic movements, said Kristin Smith Diwan, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.“I think the relation with Israel was seen as a way to even cement that further. I don’t know how that’s going to work now,” she said.Al-Hussein said her younger brother, who is in his 20's, never studied the Arab-Israeli conflict in school. But he “just learned about it today from social media," she said.For millions of Arabs, social media is the only space where limited freedom of expression is possible. Since the war began, users have been flooded by images of dead Palestinian children being pulled from the rubble of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.These platforms have also been awash with images of Israeli security forces firing stun grenades and tear gas at worshippers and protesters in Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, of Palestinian families fighting eviction from their homes and of deadly protests across the occupied West Bank.At least 217 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including 61 children and 36 women. More than 1,440 people have been wounded. Twelve people in Israel, including a young boy and a soldier, have been killed in Hamas rocket attacks.Bader al-Saif, a Kuwait University professor, said “the sheer un-proportionality” of the conflict has pushed many people to speak out across the Gulf.“For Israelis to feel secure, they need to feel that they are accepted,” al-Saif said. “That feeling of acceptance cannot be complete without them dealing with the Palestinian issue.”U.K.-based Saudi scholar Madawi Al-Rasheed, a fierce critic of the Saudi government, said despite the kingdom's widespread crackdown on activists — most of whom are steadfast supporters of Palestinian rights — the outrage expressed by many online reveals the gap between the cautious push by the Saudi leadership to inch closer to Israel and public sentiment in the streets.“It shows that despite several years of adopting a normalization discourse in official Saudi media, the pulse of the people is actually not diverted from the Palestinian cause,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-longer-silent-gulf-arab-citizens-express-anger-at-israel-101621413516014.html
19-05-2021||World||'No one left but you': Bereaved Gaza father clutches wounded baby boy rescued from his dead mother's arms||Inside a Gaza hospital, Mohammad al-Hadidi cradled his baby boy Omar -- his only surviving child after Israeli air strikes killed his wife and four other sons in the night."I have no one left in the world but you," the 37-year-old father said.After the strikes, rescue workers pulled the five-month-old from the arms of his dead mother early Saturday, one of his tiny legs fractured in three places.All his other children -- Suhayb, 13, Yahya, 11, Abderrahman, 8, and Osama, 6 -- perished in the bombing along with their mother Maha Abu Hattab, 36."They've gone to find God, we don't want to stay around here for much longer," the bereaved father said, sobbing."We will meet them soon, you and I. Oh God, let it not be too long."Sitting on the edge of a hospital bed, Hadidi carefully kissed his child's cheek.In his arms, Omar rested peacefully, his right leg poking out of his romper in a plaster cast.Under a crown of tiny brown curls, his eyelids were bruised dark and swollen, and his face covered in scratches.- 'Begged to stay the night' -Saturday's strikes hit at the conclusion of Eid al-Fitr, usually a time of joy when Muslim families gather to mark the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.On Friday, Omar's mother had taken him and his brothers to visit their cousins nearby in the Shati refugee camp outside Gaza City where they all lived."The kids put on their Eid clothes, took their toys and headed off to their uncle's house to celebrate," Hadidi said."They called in the evening to beg to stay the night and I said OK."Hadidi then paused to gather himself as he recalled what would become a fateful night.I slept "at home alone... (and) woke up suddenly to the sound of bombing," he said.Soon a neighbour called to say an Israeli missile had hit his brother-in-law's home."I hurried over as fast as I could, but when I got there the home was rubble, and rescue workers were pulling out bodies."His sister-in-law and four of her children were also among the dead.A video widely shared on social media shows Hadidi clutching his son to his chest, overwhelmed that he had survived.- 'God was preparing us' -Hadidi gently touched his son's face."All my other sons breastfed, except for Omar who refused from day one," he said wistfully."God was preparing us and we had no idea."Israeli air raids have killed 200 people including 59 children in the besieged coastal enclave since last Monday.On the Israeli side, the rockets of Palestinian armed groups have killed 10 people.Hadidi accused Israel of deliberately targeting children."What have they done to deserve being bombed without any warning to evacuate the home?"Israel claims it is targeting armed militants, including from the Islamist Hamas group running the Gaza Strip.But human rights groups have repeatedly condemned strikes that have killed women and children in the overcrowded territory of some 2 million inhabitants.The Gaza-based Mezan Centre for Human Rights says 341 residential units have been damaged in the aerial bombardment.Even with air strikes ongoing, Hadidi said he was waiting for his baby to be declared well enough for him to take him home."I will care for him and bring him up on my own," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-one-left-but-you-bereaved-gaza-father-clutches-wounded-baby-boy-rescued-from-his-dead-mother-s-arms-101621412457724.html
19-05-2021||World||Indigenous community in Canadian province donates for India’s Covid fight||More assistance related to the coronavirus crisis in India is flowing from Canada, including a donation from an indigenous community in the western province of Manitoba.The Manitoba Metis Federation, which is the government of the indigenous people there, has announced a donation of 50,000 Canadian dollars ( ₹3,025,544 approx) to help India during the crisis. Federation president David Chartrand said, “People are dying from lack of oxygen in India. Our hearts go out to all the families who have lost loved ones. The Indo-Canadian community in our province has a well-deserved reputation for generosity towards their neighbours. Now, that their families and friends in India need our help, it’s our chance to return the favour.”Chartrand pointed to the scale of the devastation in India as he said, “Over 270,000 people have died from Covid-19 in India. That is enough to wipe out the entire Métis population in Manitoba twice over.”Chartrand made the pledge during an online ‘Oxygen for India’ fundraiser organised by the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce or ICCC on Sunday.Chartrand said that while the Metis were not a rich people, it was in their “DNA as Métis people that if we see our neighbours struggle, we need to help”.“Like the Métis, people in India highly value and respect their elders and seniors, who we know are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. We need to help protect their families and communities. If you can, I encourage all Métis citizens, and indeed all Canadians, to donate to Oxygen for India,” he added.Meanwhile, the province of Ontario which has already despatched 3,000 ventilators to India, will send another 2,000. Premier Dough Ford said he had “directed our folks to ship another 2,000 (ventilators)” and expected that a “whole planeload” with supplies will arrive in India soon. Ford also made the announcement at the ICCC fundraiser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indigenous-community-in-canadian-province-donates-for-india-s-covid-fight-101621402456822.html
19-05-2021||World||How Mumbai’s officials made their city more Covid-ready than Delhi||woAt midnight on April 17, as a deadly new wave of the coronavirus overwhelmed India, Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal learned that six hospitals in his city would run out of oxygen within hours -- putting the lives of 168 patients at risk.Amid the ensuing scramble, the patients were rushed to the temporary hospitals Chahal’s team had set up during the city’s first wave in 2020. He hadn’t dismantled the facilities even when cases dipped. Unlike most Indian hospitals that relied on cylinders, they had been equipped with pipes that supplied oxygen directly to patients’ beds. All 168 survived.That night -- which Chahal describes as the scariest he’s ever had -- offers a look at tactics India’s financial capital used to quell its outbreak faster, and with fewer casualties, than other parts of the country. Mumbai has reported 2,784 deaths since the second wave began on March 1, around a fourth of the 10,595 in capital New Delhi. Even India’s Supreme Court has suggested that aspects of Mumbai’s model could be adopted in other parts of the nation like New Delhi.By contrast, the record number of daily deaths India continues to report, along with the collapse of the health system in parts of the country, have highlighted broad shortfalls in governance and public planning nationally. The country reported an unprecedented 4,529 deaths on Wednesday.Chahal attributes the city’s successes partly to a decentralized system his team set up during the first wave, which included neighborhood war rooms to manage cases by locality. He’s also made vast changes to the way the city sourced and used its medical oxygen, creating emergency stocks and tracking systems for tankers. So, even as families around India desperately pleaded for supplies on social media, Mumbai’s patients reported fewer problems.With a population of 16 million spread across glistening skyscrapers, apartment complexes and sprawling slums, Mumbai is the world’s second-most densely packed city, according to data from the United Nations. About 32,000 people are crammed in per square kilometer. That makes lessons from India’s financial capital particularly valuable as fears grow about outbreaks in other crowded places from Bangkok to Kathmandu.“I knew it was a long drawn war; and I knew only systems can win the wars -- individuals can’t,” Chahal said in an interview via Zoom. “Devising systems and making them run on auto pilot is key to the Mumbai model.”As of May 11, Mumbai had almost half the number of active virus cases as capital New Delhi. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Principal Secretary of Health Ashish Chandra Verma didn’t reply to calls seeking comment.Still, the risks to Mumbai are far from over. The city has recorded 688,696 cases since the pandemic began, adding 1,544 on May 16. Chahal is preparing for a third wave by setting up jumbo pediatric hospitals because public health experts have warned his team that more children might be infected in the next surge.Managing the trajectory of the virus in Mumbai is crucial given the potential human toll of a runaway epidemic. And as India’s financial capital, the city is also central to the nation’s already battered economy.Mumbai houses the nation’s main stock exchange. It’s where large multinationals like Unilever Plc and global financial giants from Citigroup Inc. to KKR & Co. have their Indian headquarters. It’s home to the nation’s central bank and India’s mammoth film industry -- Bollywood.Indian financial assets have decoupled from the national covid situation. The rupee is up 1.5%, turning into Asia’s best-performing currency this month amid hopes of faster inoculations in coming months. The benchmark stock index has also climbed about 3% in May.Chahal, 55, says he built up administrative skills growing up in a military family: His father was an officer in the Indian army. Over the past decades, he’s held a string of bureaucratic positions, including working on a proposal to remodel Dharavi and helming an overhaul of Maharashtra state’s irrigation systems.He had to hit the ground running last May, when Maharashtra’s chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked him to head the municipal corporation at the height of Mumbai’s first wave. Bodies were piling up in mortuaries and the city’s densest slum, Dharavi, was battling a fast growing coronavirus crisis.Lessons from last year taught him the importance of a local approach and getting patients quickly isolated, a model he calls “Chase the Virus.” His team went door to door in Dharavi looking for people with symptoms and eventually isolating 150,000 people from the slum, a move that stopped the chain of infection. At the time, Chahal also abolished the central hub handling the city’s crisis and created local war rooms in each of the 24 administrative divisions -- wards or neighborhoods -- of the city.That localized approach helped as affluent neighborhoods were worse hit during the second wave. The local war rooms got test reports and reduced the spread the of infection by pointing patients to the nearest available hospital beds. The city administration negotiated with private hospitals to allocate beds for Covid patients at government decided rates.“We set up an excellent public private partnership between hospitals which is still today not visible in rest of the country,” Chahal said.When oxygen was running out during the second wave, Chahal started to source oxygen from nearby states. Mumbai’s civic authorities also banned hospitals from adding beds beyond their oxygen storage capacity, dodging the shortages that rocked other cities.Vaccinations“Wiser after our experience of last year, when the second wave hit with its dangerous mutations, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation quickly scaled up its infrastructure including beds, equipments and doctors,” said Dr. Hetal Marfatia, professor and head of the ear, nose and throat department at Mumbai’s KEM Hospital. This time round most hospital beds had readily available oxygen lines, she said.At times, Chahal said he’s had to simply find innovative ways to use limited resources. When ambulances were in short supply, he called the city’s election commission and converted the 800 cars they sent over into ambulances by putting up partitions between the driver and passenger.Still, Mumbai has been the epicenter of the virus twice, and local doctors warn of the continued risks. Chahal’s team has also drawn criticism for what some have described as a chaotic approach to vaccinations.“Though our cases graph has come down now, I would say this is not the end,” said Dr. Vikas Oswal, a pulmonologist practicing in clinics in Dharavi and other parts of Mumbai. “We are expecting a rise in cases within two weeks now, as vaccination centers are over flooded. They are not being managed properly.”Chahal acknowledges some of the risks, saying he’s preparing more jumbo hospitals with 6,500 added beds, and he’s attempting to directly import vaccines from international companies.Mumbai has received three bids to import Russia’s Sputnik vaccines, he told Bloomberg TV in an interview Wednesday, adding that the city will reduce its positivity rate to 2% by the end of May. More than 20% of India’s tests are yielding positive results, far higher than the less-than-5% the World Health Organization considers as an indicator that the epidemic is under control.“More we vaccinate, the greater are chances that we reduce the threat of the next wave,” Chahal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-mumbai-s-city-officials-made-their-city-more-covid-ready-than-delhi-101621400739587.html

But, that unfortunate milestone was reached as health authorities are increasingly positive of a return to a semblance of normalcy over the summer and into autumn.Canada has now recorded 25,018 deaths from Covid-19. The first death was reported on March 9 last year. But with the third wave of the pandemic waning in the country, and vaccinations ongoing, there may be room for optimism.This was echoed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a media interaction that “this summer once cases are low and at least 75% of people have had one dose and 20% had a second, you can look forward to outdoor things”, including sharing meals at patios of restaurants, hiking and camping. The fall may be better, as he said “once three-quarters of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated we’ll be able to do more of the indoor things we missed whether that’s watching sports in person or a dinner party at a restaurant”.Vaccine availability is easing in the country, about 55% of its approximately 37 million population has had at least one jab of the coronavirus inoculation, including about 4% with both doses.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam was also positive as she said Canada was “making steady progress, with a 25% decrease in reported active cases since the peak of the 3rd wave in mid-April”. However, she warned with regard to relaxation of restrictions: “We’re not there yet, but I am really hopeful because of how fast some of the vaccines are going in the arms.”More demographic groups are now eligible for vaccinations as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization or NACI has now recommended that the complete two-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given to those aged between 12 and 18.Health authorities have also said that those who received a jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine as their first dose could have the option of choosing a different vaccine for their second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-25-000-covid-19-fatalities-in-canada-101621401018164.html
19-05-2021||World||US Congress passes Bill to fight hate crime after Asian-American attacks||The U.S. House passed by a wide bipartisan margin legislation to combat hate crimes across the country, a measure sparked by a sharp rise in attacks against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders since the coronavirus pandemic began.The 364-62 vote comes just weeks after the Senate passed the same legislation and sends it to President Joe Biden, who called for speedy action after March’s shootings by a white gunman at three Atlanta-area spas that left eight people dead. The victims included six women of Asian descent.While the bill bolsters resources for addressing hate crimes more broadly, supporters said it will send a clear message to the Asian American community that steps are being taken to curb an alarming increase in assaults and threats.“Those of Asian descent have been blamed and scapegoated for the outbreak of Covid-19, and as a result Asian Americans have been beaten, slashed, spat on and even set on fire,” Representative Grace Meng, a New York Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill, said. “The Asian American community is exhausted from being forced to endure this rise in bigotry and racist attacks.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she has “seen the pain” in her own district that includes San Francisco and its expansive Asian American community. She called it an “epidemic” that is “a challenge to the conscience of our country which demands bold, aggressive action.”Biden plans to sign the legislation later this week, press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.The legislation requires the Justice Department to conduct a review of hate crimes, and to provide guidance to state and local governments to enable them to establish online reporting of hate crimes and expand public education campaigns to raise awareness of such assaults. It also provides grants for states to establish state-wide hate crimes reporting hotlines and improve their training to better identify and report them.Backers of the bill cited the language of former President Donald Trump and some of his allies, who routinely called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan Virus” because of its origins, for inflaming prejudice.Separately, the House will vote Wednesday on a non-binding resolution that condemns the March 16 Atlanta-area shootings and acts of violence against Asian Americans. The resolution, led by Representative Judy Chu, a California Democrat, condemns the “heinous and inexcusable acts of gun violence” that sparked the shootings. It also takes on some of the rhetoric used by the former president and his allies, calling it the cause of some acts of harassment and violence.An estimated 3,800 hate crime incidents against people of Asian descent were recorded between March 19, 2020 -- around when lock downs started -- and Feb. 28, 2021, according to the tracking initiative Stop AAPI Hate. Most were verbal harassment and shunning, but 11% of them were physical assaults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-passes-bill-to-fight-hate-crime-after-asian-american-attacks-101621390958001.html

Data on immune responses are expected in the coming months.Spain embarked on the study to determine how best to proceed after limiting AstraZeneca's shot to people aged over 60 due to concerns about blood clotting in younger people.That restriction caused widespread uncertainty and meant some younger people who had already received a first dose have been excluded from getting a second."Today's results support the possibility of vaccinating patients who have received the first dose from AstraZeneca, but the decision is not up to the investigators of this study," said Jesus Antonio Frias, clinical director at Carlos III.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-followed-by-pfizer-dose-highly-safe-effective-study-101621397859796.html

Authorities have identified 2,323 cases of the variant, with cases doubling in the past week in Bolton and Blackburn in England, Hancock said.With 86 local authorities confirmed to have five or more cases of the variant, Hancock said it was vital that people get vaccinated. Most people with the variant known as B.1.617.2 in areas around Bolton hadn’t received a vaccine shot, he said.At least 200 million doses of Covid vaccines have been given in the EU, according to AFP data. The milestone indicates the EU should be on track to meet its goal of fully vaccinating 70% of adults, about 255 million people, by July end.In Canada, Krista Brodie, a female armed forces veteran, was picked to lead the country’s vaccine roll-out, replacing Dany Fortin, who was removed due to charges of sexual misconduct.Australian man trapped in India dies from CovidAn Australian citizen of Indian-origin, 47-year-old Govind Kant from Sydney, died from Covid-19 on Tuesday after he had flown to India for personal matters before Australia’s flight ban was announced.

Hamas began firing rockets eight days ago in retaliation for what it said were rights abuses against Palestinians in Jerusalem.Two Thai workers were killed by a mortar barrage fired from the Gaza Strip that slammed into a plant in southern Israel, pushing the overall death toll inside Israel to 12.Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel’s 21% Arab minority staged a general strike on Tuesday in solidarity. “It allows the other side, the Jews, to realise the big impact of the Arabs,” Diaa Rabaya’a, 23, said at Damascus Gate between East Jerusalem and the Old city.Gaza medical officials say 213 Palestinians have been killed, including 61 children and 36 women. Israeli authorities say ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children.Nearly 450 buildings in the Gaza strip have been destroyed or badly damaged, including six hospitals and nine primary care health centres, the UN humanitarian agency said.More than 52,000 Palestinians have been displaced by airstrikes, the UN aid agency has said, while rights group Amnesty International said Israeli air raids on residential buildings might amount to war crimes.Israel said more than 3,450 rockets have been launched at it from Gaza, some falling short and others shot down by its Iron Dome air defences. It says its forces have killed around 130 Hamas fighters and another 30 from Islamic Jihad.EU foreign ministers called for a ceasefire, but failed to reach unanimity as Hungary, Israel’s closest ally in the bloc, declined to join the other 26 foreign ministers in calling for a truce on their video call.US defence secretary Lloyd Austin expressed his support for a de-escalation in fighting in a call with his Israeli counterpart on Tuesday, the Pentagon said.Calling Israeli PM Netanyahu on Monday, US President Joe Biden again said Israel had the right to defend itself but encouraged it to make efforts to protect civilians, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bombs-rain-on-gaza-after-lull-world-scrambles-for-ceasefire-101621390980171.html

19-05-2021||World||Pelosi calls for US, world leaders to boycott China's 2022 Olympics||US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called for a US diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, criticizing China for human rights abuses and saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.US lawmakers have been increasingly vocal about an Olympic boycott or venue change, and have lashed out at American corporations, arguing their silence about what the State Department has deemed a genocide of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China was abetting the Chinese government.Pelosi, a Democrat, told a bipartisan congressional hearing on the issue that heads of state around the world should shun the games, scheduled for February."What I propose - and join those who are proposing - is a diplomatic boycott," Pelosi said, in which "lead countries of the world withhold their attendance at the Olympics.""Let's not honor the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China," she added."For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?" she said.An independent United Nations panel said in 2018 it had received credible reports that at least 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims had been held in camps in China's Xinjiang region. Beijing describes them as vocational training centers to stamp out extremism, and strongly rejects accusations of abuse and genocide.Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told Reuters that US attempts to interfere in China's domestic affairs over the Olympics were doomed to fail."I wonder what makes some US politicians think they actually have the so-called 'moral authority'? On human rights issues, they are in no position, either historically or currently, to make wanton groundless criticism against China," Liu said.'HELD TO ACCOUNT'Republican Congressman Chris Smith, who led the hearing, said corporate sponsors should be called to testify before Congress and be "held to account"."Big business wants to make lots of money, and it doesn't seem to matter what cruelty - even genocide - that the host nation commits," Smith said.Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern added the Games should be postponed to give the International Olympic Committee time to "relocate to a country whose government is not committing atrocities.""If we can postpone an Olympics by a year for a pandemic, we can surely postpone the Olympics for a year for a genocide," McGovern said, referring to the decision by Japan and the IOC to delay the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo due to Covid-19.Demands for some form of boycott of the Beijing Games are growing.Last month, Republican Senator Mitt Romney introduced an amendment to broader legislation to counter China that would implement a US diplomatic boycott.And a coalition of human rights activists on Tuesday called for athletes to boycott the Games and put pressure on the IOC.US President Joe Biden's administration has said it hopes to develop a joint approach with allies to participation in Beijing's Olympics, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken has repeatedly said the issue has not yet been broached in discussions.Asked about Pelosi's comments, a senior administration official told Reuters the administration's position on the 2022 Olympics had not changed.Biden, a Democrat, has said China is America's strategic competitor, and has vowed to not let the country surpass the United States as a world leader on his watch.Proponents of Americans competing in Beijing's Olympics say it would be unfair to punish athletes, and the Games would provide a platform for the United States, which has one of the highest Winter Olympic medal counts, to show its vitality on the global stage.Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive officer of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a written statement the committee was concerned about the "oppression of the Uyghur population," but barring US athletes from the Games was "certainly not the answer.""Past Olympic boycotts have failed to achieve political ends," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-calls-for-us-world-leaders-to-boycott-china-s-2022-olympics-101621382327272.html
19-05-2021||World||More California counties see Covid-19 case improvements||Five more California counties will move to less restrictive tiers because of improving Covid-19 conditions and no counties regressed, the state Department of Public Health said Tuesday.Orange, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and Amador counties are moving from the orange, or moderate, tier to the yellow, or minimal, tier. Tehama County is improving from the red, substantial, tier to orange.The moves will put 13 counties in yellow, 35 in orange, 10 in red. No counties are in the purple, or substantial, tier.Santa Clara County's health officer, Dr. Sara Cody, immediately announced that new yellow tier rules will implemented Wednesday. Among the local rules being lifted are requirements that businesses maximize the number of staff who are teleworking.The improvements were announced a day after the state's health director announced that California will require people to keep wearing masks and practice social distancing indoors until June 15 — the date when Gov. Gavin Newsom has said nearly all Covid-19 restrictions will be dropped if cases remain low.More than 34.8 million vaccines have been administered in California, and the seven-day positivity rate is down to just 0.9%.During a virtual meeting of the California Travel and Tourism Commission on Tuesday, the governor noted, however, that since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended looser masking guidelines last week there has been a decline in vaccinations “that is creating some pause and a little bit of concern.”More than a dozen other states, including neighboring Oregon, have already followed the new CDC masking guidelines.Most of the 58 counties in California — including gigantic Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego — are heeding the state's masking schedule.Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said Monday the county will use the extra month to fully vaccinate more people. ”More than half of our adult population remains vulnerable," she said.After becoming the epicenter for the virus in the US at the start of the year, California has experienced a tremendous decline in Covid-19 cases.Newsom, like the Biden administration, has been under pressure to ease mask restrictions as coronavirus cases decline nationwide. But the Democratic governor faces a recall election this fall driven largely by frustration with his handling of the pandemic.The tiers are based on cases, positivity rate and on vaccination figures. Newsom has indicated California will do away with the system in mid-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-california-counties-see-covid-19-case-improvements-101621371553577.html
19-05-2021||World||Biden administration removes Trump-era H-1B rule vacated by court||The Biden administration on Tuesday announced that it has removed a Trump-era rule that had sought to narrow the definition of “speciality” for qualifying for H-1B non-immigration short-term work visas in the country - doing away with one more of former president Donald Trump’s restrictive changes to the visa programme.The Trump administration had issued an order last October seeking to “narrow” the definition of speciality occupation to ensure US companies could use the visa programme to make “real offers” to “real employees” and not to hire foreigners as “low-cost replacement” for qualified Americans. A bachelor’s degree wasn’t sufficient under that rule. Instead, a bachelor’s degree in a specific field related to the job was required.The rule couldn’t be implemented, though, as it was a vacated by a court. The department of homeland security has now removed it altogether from the Code of Federal Rules.“This is one of Trump’s three big midnight regulations to remake (some would say destroy) the H-1B system,” Doug Rand, an immigration official from the Obama administration, had tweeted back in October. He added, separately, “The Biden administration continues to take a thoughtful approach to Trump-era immigration regulations, an unprecedented number of which were jammed through at the last moment. The lawsuits continue to pile up, and we may see other Trump-era H-1B rules evaporate as well.” Rand is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a tech company that helps immigrants get green cards and citizenship.Speciality occupation will now go back to being what it was before October 2020. It technically means “an occupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialised knowledge in fields of human endeavour… and which requires the attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States”.The US grants 85,000 H-1B visas every year under a congressionally mandated cap to American companies to hire foreign workers to make up for the shortage of qualified workers locally. More than 70% of the visas go to Indian professionals hired from India or from US schools and colleges by American companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft, as well as by US subsidiaries of Indian companies such as TCS, Wipro and Infosys.Trump had issued a slew of orders starting within days of taking office in January 2017 to end what he and other immigration hawks in his administration had called fraud and abuse of the H-1B visa programme.Of the many measures initiated by his administration, only two survive: ending the use of electronic lottery to select successful petitions for H-1B visas and prioritise those getting higher wages; and fixing wage levels for H-1B hires in tune with prevailing wages to prevent the programme from bringing low-wage replacement for American workers.“Both rules are problematic and there is no final decision on their fate. It is also possible the Biden administration could resurrect in some manner the part of the vacated Trump H-1B regulation that places new restrictions on work at third-party sites. But that would certainly invite legal challenges, and the two delayed rules also have lawsuits pending,” said Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-partisan body that has done extensive research into immigration issues.US President Joe Biden has ended the ban on the entry of H-1B visa holders ordered by Trump ostensibly to protect American jobs for Americans in the wake of unprecedented layoffs caused by the Covid-19 pandemic; and has withdrawn an order denying work authorisation to spouses of H-1B visa-holders cleared for green cards.Biden has also backed an immigration overhaul legislation that seeks to remove country limits on green cards, which, if enacted, will cut waiting time for Indian applicants; and also prevent their dependent children from “aging out” when they turn 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-removes-trump-era-h-1b-rule-vacated-by-court-101621368255167.html
19-05-2021||World||From New Jersey, the story of alleged caste discrimination and exploitation||Workers at an under-investigation New Jersey temple were forced to perform manual labour at 1963 pay levels for double or triple the hours they were initially promised but a fellow worker’s death galvanised them into organising, according to a lawsuit filed in the case and conversations with lawyers and unions helping the complainants.The temple was raided by federal agents last Tuesday after allegations that the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan (BAPS) Sanstha exploited 200 workers, many of them Dalit, for the project.The class action lawsuit was filed in a New Jersey district court and first reported by the New York Times.“These individuals have suffered greatly – financially as a result of the wage theft, physically as a result of the grueling work they were forced to undertake, and mentally as a result of being forced for stay within the temple compound for months, and for many, years,” said Swati Sawant, an attorney for the people who worked at the temple in Robbinsville.“We were first made aware of these accusations early Tuesday morning. We take each seriously and are conducting a thorough internal review. These allegations are also part of a pending lawsuit and tied to claims made by the plaintiffs,” Matthew Frankel, spokesperson for BAPS, said over email.The 42-page lawsuit, which asked for a jury trial, traced an alleged history of exploitation of workers, who worked at the temple since 2011, didn’t read or write in English. All six named plaintiffs in the case are Dalits.The workers were brought to the United States (US) on R1 visas, meant for religious vocations and members of faith-based outfits, through agents and personal BAPS contacts. The workers were told they’d work four to seven hours a day, and later made to labour for 12-13 hours daily.Also Read | Will US Covid vaccine patent waiver lead to more jabs in India? Not really“Although the Plaintiffs and R-1 workers would be performing manual labor for pay at the temple, they were told to describe their work in the United States as volunteer work at the temple, and to say that they would be performing the work as a service to the deities,” the lawsuit alleged.BAPS members held their passport and visas during the recruitment process, gave it to them during transit and took it back once the workers reached the US.“The plaintiffs and the R-1 workers were never able to recover their passports or visas during the entire time they were in the United States,” the lawsuit said.Once they started working at the temple – some started in summer of 2018, others in 2019 – they were given a day off every 30-40 days and paid ₹31,000- ₹35,000 a month. Of this, around ₹3500 was paid to them in cash and the rest deposited in their bank account. Large sums – up to ₹7,500 – would be deducted for infractions.The figures quoted in the lawsuit came out to about ₹95 an hour, or $1.20 an hour.Worker unions pointed out that in comparison, the current US federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour and New Jersey minimum wage is $11/hour for most employees. The pay was comparable to the US minimum wage limit in 1963: $1.25 (not adjusted for inflation).Additionally, the workers couldn’t leave the premises because their papers were with BAPS, 50 cameras monitored them and threats that local police would arrest them if they stepped out. “Workers were told that if they spoke to outside people or if they left the temple premises they would have deductions taken from their wage,” the lawsuit alleged.When a plaintiff told a BAPS member about the pay disparity, he was allegedly told he was “serving god”.A key complaint was that BAPS profited from the vulnerable status of the workers – both on account of their marginalised caste and employment. A top BAPS member allegedly called the worker “worms” and others were forced to make financial guarantees that other workers from India to take their place when they went back home. “One worker was fined 35,000 rupees when a worker he had guaranteed in fact did not return to New Jersey to work,” said the lawsuit.Also Read | Plan long stay, there’s waiting time in visa renewal: US embassy to IndiansBut protests broke out after a worker, Mohan Lal, died, and others demanded better working conditions and a funeral in accordance to the customs followed by Lal.“They stopped work in protest and refused to return to a workplace they knew to be unhealthy and unsafe. The protest leaders were fired and forcibly returned to India,” said the Pathar Gadhai Mazdoor Suraksha Sangh, a labour union that helped the New Jersey workers.The workers hailed from two districts of Rajasthan and came back over the past six to eight months, said Madan Lal Meghwal of the Sangh who conducted interviews with the returnees.“BAPS has a lot of influence in Rajasthan, from where it has been hiring temple workers for many years. In many cases, the workers are worried about their jobs and keep quiet,” he added.The kind of work the New Jersey workers did — cutting and laying stones, removing garbage, road work, dipping stones in chemicals, and other tasks — can lead to long-term health effects. The Sangh, in its interviews, found that workers inhaled dust from cut stones and fumes from chemical solutions used to soak the stones. “This can lead to silicosis and other health damages,” Meghwal said.Since the allegetions became public, some Hindu groups have said a local American company was responsible for the exploitation, not BAPS.They cite an April 30 stop-work order by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL) against a Newark-based construction company; the order came after visits to two of the company’s current worksites, BAPS Temple in Robbinsville and BAPS Temple in Edison.“These inspections found the contractor was paying the workers in cash off the books and did not have workers’ compensation insurance,” the NJDOL said in a statement.But the worker unions rejected these charges and NJDOL officials clarified that the stop-work order was not related to the court-ordered federal search of the premises two weeks later.“In any case, the workers have clearly said that BAPS members picked them out, their medical examination was done at BAPS premises in Ahmedabad and their visa process was also done by them. So to say that BAPS was not responsible for recruiting them or their condition is evading responsibility,” said Priyanka Jain, a labour researcher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-new-jersey-the-story-of-alleged-caste-discrimination-and-exploitation-101621335913695.html
