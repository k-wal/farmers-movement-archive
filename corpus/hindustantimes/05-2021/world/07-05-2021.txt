The oxygen generation plants from the UK’s surplus stocks and 1,000 ventilators will be ferried from Belfast on Friday by an Antonov An-124 aircraft. Airport staff worked through the night to load the life-saving equipment funded by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Each of the three oxygen generation plants – the size of 40-foot freight containers – produces 500 litres of oxygen a minute, enough for 50 people to use at a time. They are expected to reach India on Sunday morning, and the Indian Red Cross Society will transfer them to hospitals. The latest support package is in addition to 200 ventilators and 495 oxygen concentrators that the UK sent to India last month. It follows discussions with India and a pledge from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK to do all it can to help, the UK foreign office said. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “The UK is sending surplus oxygen generators from Northern Ireland to India. This life-saving equipment will support the country’s hospitals as they care for vulnerable Covid-19 patients. “The UK and India are working together to tackle this pandemic. No-one is safe until we are all safe.” In a separate development, the Japanese embassy announced on Friday that 100 oxygen concentrators will be sent to India on May 8 as part of the first batch of emergency assistance from Japan in response to the surge of Covid-19 infections. The Japanese government had announced on April 30 that it will provide a total of 300 oxygen concentrators and 300 ventilators to India. “Japan will continue to extend further support promptly in order to contain the Covid-19 situation in India,” the embassy said. On May 5, Japanese foreign minister Yoshihide Motegi told his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar that Japan is ready to provide grant assistance of up to $50 million (about 5.5 billion yen) to India in addition to the other assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-largest-cargo-plane-carries-three-oxygen-plants-to-india-from-uk-101620411661864.html
07-05-2021||World||US determined to help India in its hour of need: Vice prez||US vice-president Kamala Harris said on Friday the situation in India, which is battling a devastating second wave of Covid-19 cases, is “nothing short of heartbreaking” and America is “determined to help India in its hour of need”.Harris, whose mother came from India, spoke of the situation in India for the first time after the Biden administration pledged assistance worth $100 million to help it fight the second wave of the epidemic. Planeloads of supplies that have already reached India include refillable oxygen cylinders, N95 masks and remdesivir. The administration has also announced support for India and South Africa’s proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to ensure easy affordable access to them around the world, especially in developing countries.“As many of you know, generations of my family come from India. My mother was born and raised in India, and I have family members who live in India today,” Harris said in a recorded video message played at a state department virtual event on US assistance and the role of the Indian diaspora. Her late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was from and many of her relatives still live there, including “chithis”, as she called her aunts in Tamil in a speech in 2020. Father Donald Harris, who is estranged from the family, is from Jamaica.She added: “The welfare of India is critically important to the United States. The surge of Covid-19 infections and deaths in India is nothing short of heartbreaking.”The vice-president went on to provide a timeline of how the Bien administration came to announce the assistance, starting with a phone call between President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 26, a Monday. “By Friday, April 30,” Harris said, “military members from the United States and civilians were delivering relief on the ground”.Harris is the first woman, African American, Asian-descent and Indian-descent vice president of the United States and shares an extremely close working relationship with the president, who has made sure, by his own admission, Harris is the last person to leave the room on all big issues; as Biden himself was as vice president to President Barack Obama.Vice-president Harris went on to give a detailed account of the assistance the United States is sending to India, adding, in most instance, with “more to come”.Harris noted, at some length, the US support to India and South Africa’s waiver proposal announced on Wednesday, which has been applauded as a “monumental moment” and “bold decision”. “We have announced our full support for suspending patents on Covid-19 vaccines to help India and other nations vaccinate their people, more quickly.”As President Biden has noted several times before, Harris, recounted India’s help to the US. “At the beginning of the pandemic, when our hospital beds were stretched India sent assistance. And today, we are determined to help India, in its hour of need.”She added: “We do this as friends of India, as members of the Asian quad. And as part of a global community. I believe that if we continue to work together across nations and sectors. We will all get through this together.”Diaspora participants at the event were MR Rangaswami, founder and chair of the board of Indiaspora; Lata Krishnan, founder and co-chair of the board of the American Indian Foundation; Gunisha Kaur, an anesthesiologist who is a member of several Sikh organisations; and Ghazala Hashmi, a state senator from Virginia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-determined-to-help-india-in-its-hour-of-need-vice-prez-101620408541468.html
07-05-2021||World||Iran's leader Khamenei calls Israel 'not a country, but a terrorist base'||Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday called Israel "not a country, but a terrorist base" during a speech on Al-Quds Day, an annual show of solidarity with the Palestinians.Thousands massed for rallies across several Muslim-majority countries including Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan for the day, seen in Israel as an expression of hatred and anti-Semitism.Tensions have been running high between arch-foes Iran and Israel following a series of maritime attacks, an explosion at an Iranian nuclear facility and the assassination of a top nuclear scientist that Tehran blamed on Israel.The Islamic republic does not recognise the Jewish state, and supporting the Palestinian cause, as well as backing armed groups such as Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, has long been a pillar of Iran's foreign policy."Israel is not a country, but a terrorist base against the nation of Palestine and other Muslim nations," Khamenei said in live televised remarks."Fighting this despotic regime is fighting oppression and terrorism, and (doing so) is everyone's duty," he added.Khamenei also blasted Israel's normalisation of ties with "some weak Arab governments" during the past year as attempts to undermine the Israeli "nightmare of Muslim unity".The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan have all normalised ties with Israel in recent months under US-brokered deals."I say this decisively: these attempts will get nowhere," Khamenei said, calling on Palestinians to continue their resistance and for Muslim governments to support them."The decline of the enemy Zionist regime has begun and will not stop."Elsewhere in the region, thousands of Yemenis flooded the streets of the capital Sanaa, held by Iran-backed Huthi rebels, some carrying signs saying, "Death to American, Death to Israel".In the Iraqi Shiite holy city of Najaf, protesters torched paper replicas of Israeli flags and trampled an American one.At a rally in the Pakistani city of Karachi, protesters held up cardboard signs that read "We will wipe out Israel" as they took part in Al-Quds Day.- Burning flags -Al-Quds Day has been held annually on the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan since the early days of Iran's Islamic revolution.This year state-sponsored nationwide rallies were absent due to Covid-19 restrictions.But state TV showed the burning of flags by small groups of demonstrators who it said had come out "spontaneously" for the occasion, while an AFP journalist said protesters also rallied on motorbikes in Tehran.Khamenei's comments came amid a rise in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and as tensions have soared in annexed east Jerusalem over an eviction threat hanging over four Palestinian families.Israeli security forces killed two Palestinians and critically wounded a third after the trio had opened fire on a West Bank base on Friday.Police and protesters have clashed in recent days in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of east Jerusalem, fuelled by a years-long land dispute between Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlers.The latest violence came as Palestinian Muslims flocked to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in east Jerusalem for the last Friday prayers of Ramadan.The United Nations called on Israel to end any forced evictions in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, warning that its actions could amount to "war crimes".In 2018, Khamenei reiterated Tehran's position that Israel is a "malignant cancerous tumour" that must "be removed and eradicated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-khamenei-calls-israel-not-a-country-but-a-terrorist-base-101620406947851.html
07-05-2021||World||Deforestation of Brazilian Amazon hits record in April||Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon hit a record last month, the government reported Friday with figures that belie President Jair Bolsonaro's pledge to crack down on such destruction.The area of the rainforest that was destroyed -- 580 square kilometers (225 square miles) -- marked a new high for the month of April and a 42.5 percent on-year rise, according to satellite monitoring by the Brazilian space agency INPE. Its data goes back to 2015.The level for March was also higher than 12 months earlier, and followed two months of decline in the rainy season when logging activity decreases.From January through April 29, however, the cutting of trees to provide lumber and clear land for agriculture was down 3.9 percent compared to the same period in 2020, INPE said.The dry season, which peaks in July and August, is when most deforestation happens.Records have been set in the past three dry seasons, INPE said.The Amazon, the world's biggest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing climate change because of the carbon dioxide it absorbs from the atmosphere.About 60 percent of the rainforest is in Brazil."Right now it is not possible to say what will happen but in 2021 there could be a fourth straight deforestation record," said the Climate Observatory, a group of 63 NGOs and social organizations.Bolsonaro, a far-right climate change skeptic, came to power in 2019 encouraging commercial exploitation of the rainforest and calling conservation groups "cancer."However, last month he pledged to "eliminate illegal deforestation in Brazil by 2030," 10 years earlier than initially planned.Environmental NGOs have expressed doubt that Brazil under Bolsonaro will live up to this pledge."In 2021 there is no federal effort to control deforestation," the Climate Observatory said.The government agency that carries out inspections in the Amazon "is doing nothing" and the process of punishing violators has been halted, it added.A study published last week by the journal Nature Climate Change said the Brazilian Amazon released nearly 20 percent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over the last decade than it absorbed.This report shows humanity can no longer depend on the world's largest tropical forest to help absorb man-made carbon pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deforestation-of-brazilian-amazon-hits-record-in-april-101620406320752.html
07-05-2021||World||Blinken offers veiled jabs as top China diplomat hosts UN event||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken used a speech to the United Nations on multilateralism to issue a not-so-subtle rebuke of China’s behavior on everything from human rights to territorial disputes. He also acknowledged what he called American missteps during the Trump administration.Speaking minutes after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi -- who was hosting the virtual UN Security Council event on Friday -- Blinken appeared to take aim at Beijing’s expansive but disputed claims in the South China Sea and its treatment of Uyghur minorities in the western region of Xinjiang, as well as Russian actions toward Ukraine.Without ever saying the word “China,” the top U.S. diplomat criticized nations seeking “to resolve territorial disputes by using or threatening force” or claiming entitlement to a “sphere of influence to dictate or coerce the choices and decisions of another country.”On human rights, Blinken disputed the notion that the UN or other international blocs can’t criticize violations taking place within a country’s borders, saying no nation has a “blank check.” China has told nations criticizing its policies in Xinjiang to stop interfering in domestic affairs.China’s Wang kicked off the event by calling on countries to “pursue equity and justice, not bullying and hegemony.” After Blinken spoke, Wang said all countries would like to see the U.S. “change course” and practice multilateralism.“Splitting the world along ideological lines conflicts with the spirit of multilateralism,” said Wang.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was more explicit, saying that Western nations use the phrase “rules-based order” to impose their own national interests on the rest of the world.“It’s amazing that Western leaders, openly undermining international law, don’t hesitate to assert that the main goal of global politics should be to counter Russian and Chinese attempts to change the order,” Lavrov said in his address. “The West is no longer concerned with the standards of international law and is now demanding that everyone follow its rules and observe the order it has established.”Blinken’s address followed his meeting with allied leaders from the Group of Seven nations in London this week, where officials singled out China for criticism. China lashed out at the G-7 statement at the end of the meeting, criticizing “clique politics” and urging Western nations to stop meddling in its internal issues.Despite ascending to the rotating presidency of the Security Council in May, China is increasingly under fire. Beijing decided to cancel an economic dialogue with Australia and its diplomats assailed New Zealand because lawmakers there declared human rights abuses are occurring in China’s Xinjiang region. In the early weeks of the Biden administration, Beijing bristled at U.S. efforts to raise the profile of the Quad -- an alliance with Japan, India and Australia -- that was seen as a rebuke of China.Blinken sought to use his speech on Friday to reassure allies and rivals that the U.S. sees the UN as a critical player in global issues. He said he understood if other nations were wary of U.S. intentions after the Trump administration’s “America First” approach to the world, which saw the former president withdraw the country from UN bodies like the Human Rights Council and World Health Organization.Those types of actions “have undermined the rules-based order and led others to question whether we are still committed to it,” Blinken said.And he insisted the U.S. is seeking a stable international order for the benefit of all nations.“Let me be clear -- the United States is not seeking to uphold this rules-based order to keep other nations down,” Blinken said. “The international order we helped build and defend has enabled the rise of some of our fiercest competitors. Our aim is simply to defend, uphold, and revitalize that order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-offers-veiled-jabs-as-top-china-diplomat-hosts-un-event-101620402091716.html
07-05-2021||World||‘Nothing short of heartbreaking’: Kamala Harris says US determined to help India in its hour of need||US vice president Kamala Harris on Friday said that the surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India is “nothing short of heartbreaking”. Speaking at an online event organised by the US state department, Harris delivered a message of solidarity with the people of India and sent condolences to those who have lost their loved ones to the pandemic. She noted that President Joe Biden’s administration took action as soon as the dire nature of the situation in India became apparent.“On Monday, April 26th, President Joe Biden spoke with the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) to offer our support. By Friday, April 30, military members of the United States and civilians were delivering relief on the ground,” Harris said at the event 'Bolstering US Covid Relief Efforts in India: Perspectives from the Diaspora'.“Already, we have delivered refillable oxygen cylinders, with more to come. We've delivered oxygen concentrators, with more to come. We have delivered N95 masks, and have more ready to send. We have delivered doses of Remdesivir to treat Covid patients,” she added.India is witnessing an unprecedented public health crisis as the second wave of Covid-19 overwhelmed health infrastructure. Several countries, including the United States, have extended help after the shortage of oxygen and critical medical supplies made the situation in India dire. Last week, the first consignment of Covid-19 assistance arrived from the United States, which included 440 oxygen cylinders and regulators and 960,000 rapid diagnostic tests.“Meanwhile we have announced our full support for suspending patents on Covid-19 vaccines to help India and other nations vaccinate their people more quickly,” said Harris, highlighting the recent decision of the US to back India’s proposal at the World Trade Organisation to waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines.The United States remains the worst-hit nation in terms of Covid-19 cases, followed by India. The US has reported over 32.6 million Covid-19 cases and more than 580,000 related deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University. Harris said that India sent assistance to the US at the beginning of the pandemic, "and today, we are determined to help India in its hour of need."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-us-determined-to-help-india-in-its-hour-of-need-101620405787065.html
07-05-2021||World||Britain reopens travel from May 17 to limited destinations||Britain will allow people in England to resume international travel from May 17 but is limiting the number of destinations open for quarantine-free holidays to just a handful of countries as it cautiously emerges from lockdown restrictions.Portugal, Israel, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore all made the green list for travel in a system that will be reviewed every three weeks, transport minister Grant Shapps said on Friday. Popular destinations such as France, Spain and Greece did not.Airlines, holiday companies and tourist hotspots in southern Europe have been waiting for over four months for big-spending Britons to start travelling again, but they will have to wait a few months longer for a full rebound to take off.Left off the list were Spain, France, Italy and the U.S., the top four most visited countries by UK residents in 2019, which all sit in the amber category, requiring self-isolation on return to the UK.Despite the limitations, permitting travel abroad is still a welcome boost for the beleaguered sector and should prompt bookings. Britons have been banned from going abroad without an essential reason since early January, a blow for leisure travel and also splitting families who live across different countries.British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, TUI and others will now likely have to wait until next month for the larger scale re-opening they need to repair their COVID-19 battered finances.They have argued that Britain's vaccination programme, which has outpaced the rest of Europe, should mean the country can allow more travel sooner, but so far the EU's plans are ahead. It has recommended the arrival of foreign travellers from more countries from June.Earlier on Friday, the chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG called on the UK and the U.S. to open a travel corridor given their high vaccination rates.Countries where Britons might want to travel will still have their own rules for entry. For example, Britons are currently banned from going to the U.S.Green list travel will involve people taking two COVID-19 tests, one before arrival back into the UK and one within two days of returning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-reopens-travel-from-may-17-to-limited-destinations-101620405072689.html
07-05-2021||World||Pakistan allows indicted opposition leader, Shahbaz Sharif, to travel abroad||A top Pakistani court on Friday granted permission to the country’s ailing opposition leader, who has been charged with corruption, to travel abroad for medical treatment.The Lahore High Court ruled that Shahbaz Sharif may travel abroad from May 8 to July 3. Sharif had petitioned the court, saying he is a cancer survivor who now needs treatment outside of Pakistan.The development drew criticism from Prime Minister Imran Khan's government, which said it will explore legal options to stop Sharif from leaving.Sharif faces corruption charges in three separate court cases. He heads the opposition bloc in parliament and leads his brother’s Pakistan’s Muslim League party after Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister was disqualified from office.The ex-premier and elder Sharif, convicted of corruption, lives in exile in London. He was released from prison in 2019 on bail to seek medical treatment abroad but never returned home. Islamabad last December started the process to reach an extradition treaty with Britain that would pave the way for the U.K. to hand over Nawaz Sharif.Shahbaz Sharif was released on bail last month on a court order, about seven months after he was arrested by an anti-graft body over alleged involvement in money laundering.Angered over Friday's order, Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry described the ruling as a “joke" that he said could help the younger Sharif escape the law like his brother did.There was no immediate comment from Khan, who on Friday left on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia to boost economic ties with the kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-indicted-opposition-leader-shahbaz-sharif-to-travel-abroad-101620405707795.html
07-05-2021||World||Iran nuclear deal talks 'on right track' as diplomats reconvene||The fourth round of talks between world powers on Iran's nuclear programme opened in Vienna on Friday, with diplomats voicing hope an agreement can be reached before the Islamic republic's June presidential election.The remaining parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia as well as Iran, held talks for about an hour at a luxury hotel in the Austrian capital.The Russian ambassador to the UN in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted after Friday's session that "the participants agreed on the need to intensify the process"."The delegations seem to be ready to stay in Vienna as long as necessary to achieve the goal," Ulyanov said.One diplomatic source told AFP before Friday's talks that while "nothing was guaranteed" at the negotiations, they are "on the right track".The source expressed hope that the latest talks could be the "final round".The aim is a return to full compliance with the 2015 accord, known as the JCPOA, which has been slowly disintegrating since former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and Tehran responded by breaking the deal's limits on its nuclear activities.Trump's successor Joe Biden has said he wishes to rejoin the JCPOA, and an American official said on Thursday an agreement was "possible" in the coming weeks, before Iran's June 18 election.The US is taking part in the talks indirectly, with European diplomats acting as intermediaries between the Americans and Iranians.The talks are seeking to find a way to lift sanctions on Iran reimposed by Trump, and for Iran to come back into line with the JCPOA's limits on its nuclear activities.Besides the Iran election, another source of time pressure is the looming expiration of a three-month agreement between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The agreement announced in February allows the IAEA to maintain a level of oversight of Iran's nuclear facilities despite Tehran's suspension of some inspections by the body.Under the agreement, Iran pledged to keep recordings "of some activities and monitoring equipment" and hand them over to the IAEA as and when US sanctions are lifted.IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi on Thursday met the head of the Iranian delegation to the Vienna talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.In an interview last week with Bloomberg TV, Grossi expressed concern that Iran would destroy the camera data if an agreement was not reached in time, adding: "Let's hope it hasn't happened."He said that if the temporary agreement expired and the broader diplomatic talks remained stuck, he would return to Tehran to try to broker another compromise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-deal-talks-on-right-track-as-diplomats-reconvene-101620388280042.html
07-05-2021||World||Iraq brings Saudi, Iran closer as Biden resets policy||Iraq is carving out a mediating role between Iran and Gulf Arab oil producers including Saudi Arabia, a shift for a country better known as a victim of regional conflict than a conduit to defuse it.In recent weeks, Iraq convened indirect talks between its neighbors Saudi Arabia and Iran, with a focus on Yemen’s war, where the two countries back opposing sides. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief experienced in regional security issues, is seen by Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates as having a degree of autonomy from Iran. He’s been able to build up trust to make such engagement possible, four people briefed on the talks say.Kadhimi has also kept open channels between Tehran and President Joseph Biden’s administration, which two people briefed on the Iraqi side say has welcomed the separate avenue to engage diplomatically with Iran. World powers are holding talks in Vienna to try to resurrect a 2015 deal with Iran to rein in its nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief.The mid-May expiration of an agreement on monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities gives these multi-track talks added urgency. The regional outreach could help promote the revival of the nuclear accord, after former President Donald Trump’s unilateral exit was followed by attacks on global shipping lanes and Saudi oil installations, many of them blamed on Iran or its regional proxies.Kadhimi’s PathKadhimi has navigated Iraq’s politics on the front-line of the broader confrontation with Iran, and played his cards wisely, said Robert Satloff, executive director of The Washington Institute and an expert on U.S. Middle East policy. “His stock is very high in Washington right now.”Long caught in the middle of conflicts between global and regional powers, and still rebuilding from the invasions of the U.S. and Islamic State, Iraq hopes to ratchet down tensions that affect it directly. Kadhimi is also seeking to strengthen his role on the international stage, even as he navigates internal politics in Iraq, where he’s pulled between powerful competing parties.In an online interview with the Beirut Institute on Wednesday, Iraqi President Barham Salih acknowledged that Iraq had hosted talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia “more than once.” He said he saw signs of a “diffusion” of tensions between regional powers including Iran, Turkey and Arab countries.“For Iraq to be able to play that convenient role between these regional actors is important,” he said. “Instead of Iraq being a source of instability let it be the common bridge.”A Saudi Foreign Ministry official confirmed his country is in discussions with Iran, according to Reuters. Rayed Krimly, head of policy planning at the ministry, told the news agency that Riyadh wanted to see “verifiable deeds” before evaluating the talks.The meetings, which have involved intelligence officials, began under former Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi but have intensified under Kadhimi. Several rounds are planned with the first set mainly used to test the waters for future rapprochement, a senior Iraqi official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations.“The U.S. is pushing its Gulf allies to talk directly to Iran,” said Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow and project director of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House. “That’s part of the two-track approach that Biden is pursuing to get all sides involved in the process.”The State Department didn’t respond when asked to comment on Iraq’s role. Spokesman Ned Price on April 22 referred questions about the Iraqi mediation to Baghdad and Riyadh.Back-ChannelRegional and global concerns converged this week with the visit of a delegation of senior U.S. officials to the Middle East, meant to ease allies’ concerns over Biden’s bid to rejoin the nuclear deal. Gulf Arab states have long said they should be involved in diplomacy on Iran at a global level for any deal to be sustainable.Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif welcomed Iraq’s role during a visit to the country last week and said Tehran wanted to see Baghdad become a more “pivotal” actor in regional matters.If the Vienna talks fail, Iran-backed militias will act up in the region and Iranian hardliners will continue to resist the deal, said Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser in the Middle East and North Africa team at International Crisis Group. The Gulf Arabs and Iraqis are trying to preempt that by conducting their talks now, she said.Saudi Arabia and Iran both want to end the regional crises, according to the senior Iraqi government official. Tehran is under increasing economic pressure from sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, while Saudi Arabia’s top concern is mounting attacks from Iran-backed Yemeni fighters, a second person close to the Iraqi government said.Iraq has found Saudi Arabia more open to dialog with Iran and thinks Kadhimi is a factor in that, the senior Iraqi government official said. The UAE also takes that view, trusting Kadhimi to communicate with them on Iran, a person familiar with the UAE government view said.Prince MohammedSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said last week the kingdom was working to resolve its differences with Iran, in comments that referred to an unspecified regional effort.“We’re working today with our partners in the region to find solutions to these issues, and we hope to overcome them and have a good and positive relationship with them,” Prince Mohammed told a Saudi television channel on April 27.That’s a dramatic reversal from his remarks on Iran in his last local television interview in 2017, when he accused Iran of trying to control the Islamic world and said the kingdom would take “the battle” to Iran, rather than wait for it to be in Saudi Arabia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-brings-saudi-iran-closer-as-biden-resets-policy-101620392766542.html

Exercise increased caution due to crime and terrorism,” the State Department said on Wednesday in its latest travel advisory that looked identical to the one issued on April 28.Both the travel advisories have been marked 'Level 4' which is the highest warning level.On April 28, the Department approved the voluntary departure of family members of US government employees.On May 5, the Department approved the voluntary departure of non-emergency US government employees.“US citizens who wish to depart India should take advantage of available commercial transportation options,” it said.Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for India due to Covid-19, indicating a very high level of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urges-citizens-to-return-home-from-india-through-available-flights-101620398234684.html

Surge testing was being carried out in areas where evidence indicates community spread.Cases of the B.1.617.2 variant increased to 520 from 202 over the last week, PHE said, mainly in London and the northwest town of Bolton, with almost half the cases related to contact with a traveller."I think we've got to be very careful about that," Johnson told reporters, in reference to the variant."We're doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing."PHE cited evidence that it spreads more quickly than the original version of the virus and could spread as quickly as the so-called "Kent" variant which fuelled England's second wave of infections.The public health body said other characteristics of the B.1.617.2 variant were still being investigated."There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed any less effective," PHE said in a statement.The original India variant, B.1.617, was first detected in October, but PHE has categorised three different subtypes, all with slightly different mutations.Other variants of concern include variants first identified in Kent, southeast England, as well as South Africa and Brazil.Two weeks ago, India, which is experiencing a deadly surge in cases, was added to Britain's travel "red list", meaning travellers have to quarantine in special hotels.But the move, which came in on April 23, was announced on April 19, giving travellers notice if they wanted to change plans and beat the hotel quarantine.Britain has recorded 4,428,553 coronavirus cases and 127,583 deaths since the pandemic hit its shores, making it one of the worst hit countries in the world. About 66% of the adult population has now been vaccinated and lockdown restrictions are being eased.India is reporting record daily death tolls. In total it has recorded 21.49 million cases and 234,083 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-labels-coronavirus-variant-of-concern-linked-to-travel-from-india-101620392797219.html

Communication officers are in contact with the group leaders and have been constantly surveilling situation there. They haven't confirmed any [Covid-19] cases or condition of existing threat out there," the ministry stated.The ministry has urged media outlets to only disseminate information that comes from official channels as other reports might create panic and fear amongst climbers as well as their families.The ministry's remarks come despite over a dozen climbers have been evacuated in the last few weeks from Everest Base Camp to capital Kathmandu, after they develop symptoms like Covid-19. They were later tested positive for Covid-19.Norwegian climber Erlend Ness was amongst the first to confirm that he along with his team members have tested positive for the virus after undergoing tests in Kathmandu.Initially, it was believed that Ness had pulmonary edema, a condition where the air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid that is often associated with altitude sickness.Ness had tested negative prior to departing from Norway and again while quarantining in Kathmandu before heading to the base camp.This year Nepal has issued record permits to 745 climbers despite the ravaging pandemic.After Everest, Dhaulagiri Base Camp earlier this week have had reported cases of Covid-19 where many of the climbers have claimed to be tested positive for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-refutes-claims-of-covid-19-cases-at-everest-other-mountain-base-camps-101620394450355.html

Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a 1 million hiring surge in April. The unemployment rate edged up to 6.1%.Treasury yields plunged, while inflation expectations spiraled downward and dollar turned sharply lower. U.S. stock futures maintained gains.The disappointing payrolls print leaves overall employment well short of its pre-pandemic level and is consistent with recent comments from company officials highlighting challenges in filling open positions. While job gains accelerated in leisure and hospitality, employment at temporary-help agencies and transportation and warehousing declined sharply.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week the dichotomy likely reflects a combination of a skills gap, child care obligations and lingering virus fears. Some firms indicate enhanced unemployment benefits and the latest round of pandemic-relief checks are discouraging a return to work.Some firms indicate enhanced unemployment benefits and the latest round of pandemic-relief checks are discouraging a return to work even as job openings approach a record.The dearth of job candidates has led some states to swing into action to alleviate the labor shortage.

South Carolina plans to terminate all federal and pandemic-related jobless programs at the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-growth-misses-all-estimates-unemployment-rate-at-61-101620391407675.html
07-05-2021||World||Boris Johnson hails party's crushing win in UK opposition stronghold||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday welcomed early election results in Britain's first major vote since Brexit and the pandemic, including a stunning by-election victory for his Conservative party in an opposition Labour stronghold.The "Super Thursday" local and regional contests could reshape the UK as pro-independence forces in Scotland, where voting for the devolved parliament was also held, bid to break away.Results in Scotland are due on Saturday.But in the first results from England on Friday, the Conservatives were performing strongly in various regions and won by a landslide in the northeast parliamentary seat of Hartlepool, in a bitter blow for Labour and its leader Keir Starmer.The rust-belt town constituency, which is deep in traditional Labour heartlands and has never voted Conservative since its creation in 1974, saw a 16 percent swing to the Tories."It's a very encouraging set of results so far," Johnson told reporters."I think that's really because we have been focusing, as a government, on our priorities, the people's priorities, and bouncing back from the pandemic as much as we can."Hartlepool's newly-elected Tory MP Jill Mortimer called her win "truly historic" and accused Labour of taking its people "for granted for too long."The result continues the trend from the last election in December 2019, when Brexit was the dominant issue and Conservatives grabbed a string of seats across Labour's so-called "Red Wall" heartlands in northern England.- 'Shattering' -The vote in strongly pro-Brexit Hartlepool, held alongside local elections across much of the country, came about after its Labour incumbent quit over sexual harassment allegations.In 2019 -- Labour's worst election result since 1935, under the hard-left leadership of Jeremy Corbyn -- around a quarter of Hartlepool's electorate opted for the upstart Brexit Party.Now, with Britain's withdrawal from the European Union complete and that party rebranded, those voters appeared to flock to the Conservatives.The result will ratchet up the pressure on Starmer, elected leader a year ago promising to rebuild the party and reconnect with its traditional voters.Senior party MP Steve Reed called the result "shattering"."It tells us that the pace of change in the Labour Party has not been fast enough," he told the BBC.Starmer had already played down expectations, stressing that rebuilding Labour would take more than a year.- 'Popular' PM -In Hartlepool, a giant inflatable Johnson appeared outside the building where the vote count was taking place. The balloon prime minister, complete with trademark scruffy blond hair, gave two thumbs up.The outcome suggests he continues to enjoy popularity in former Labour strongholds and has benefitted from Britain's successful vaccine rollout, despite the country also suffering one of the world's worst Covid-19 death tolls.Johnson, who has been dogged in recent weeks by several scandals, has campaigned on his record of finally having "got Brexit done". He has also touted government economic support during the pandemic and the vaccine drive.Results of voting for local councils in England, regional mayors including in London, and for the devolved assemblies in Wales and Scotland -- expected later Friday and over the weekend -- will give a broader picture of his support.Initial results showed his Conservatives performing strongly beyond Hartlepool in the northeast, as well as in central and southeast England.They suggest Starmer faces an increasingly daunting task to unseat Johnson at the next general election due in 2024."The structural realignment of party support is clearly going to be the dominant story of the elections in England," said University of Southampton politics professor Will Jennings.He noted the "feel-good factor" of the vaccine rollout may have helped maintain the recent shifts towards Conservatives.- 'Different directions' -But Conservative celebrations could be tempered by events in Scotland.The Scottish National Party (SNP) is seeking a pro-independence majority to pressure Johnson to permit another referendum on splitting from the UK, after most Scots voted in 2014 to stay in."It really is on a knife edge," SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted Thursday.Political pundits predicted a strong SNP showing alongside the Conservative gains in England could intensify calls for another poll."It entrenches the sense that the two nations are moving in very different directions. That can only fuel demand for independence," said ITV News' UK editor Paul Brand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-hails-party-s-crushing-win-in-uk-opposition-stronghold-101620391294967.html
07-05-2021||World||Maldives ex-president 'critical' after assassination attempt||Former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed was in a "critical" condition on Friday following an assassination attempt, doctors said.Nasheed, 53, the Maldives' first democratically elected president and still an important figure in the island nation's murky politics, was rushed to hospital after an explosion late Thursday.Since then he has undergone 16 hours of life-saving operations in the capital Male for injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs.The private ADK hospital said Friday evening that Nasheed was "in a critical condition in intensive care".In a televised address to the nation, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih announced that a team from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) would arrive Saturday to help with the investigation into the blast.Solih described the attack as an assault on the fledgling democracy, promising the perpetrators "would face the full force of the law".Police said officials from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime have also been asked to assist in the investigation.Maldivian police said they were treating Thursday's bomb attack as a "deliberate act of terror" and urged the public to provide any information that could identify the perpetrators.Police said a device attached to a motorcycle was detonated as Nasheed got into a car in the capital.The hospital said earlier that shrapnel had been removed from one of his lungs and from his liver but that another piece was still in the same organ."We are hopeful of a full recovery," said a family member who did not want to be named, adding that Nasheed was responsive and spoke with doctors when he was admitted.One of his bodyguards as well as a British national were also wounded and taken to hospital.- Underwater cabinet -The Indian Ocean nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is best known for its luxury holiday resorts popular with honeymooners, but it suffers from regular political turmoil.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's bomb attack, but officials close to Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) said they suspected vested political interests opposed to his anti-corruption drive.Nasheed had vowed to investigate a $90-million theft from the state's tourism promotion authority during the tenure of former president Abdulla Yameen."There are some dormant Islamists who could have collaborated with political elements threatened by Nasheed's anti-corruption drive," an MDP source told AFP.The government has cracked down on extremism and foreign preachers are banned.Violent attacks have been rare, though a dozen foreign tourists were wounded by a bomb blast in Male in 2007.The Islamic State claimed a boat arson attack last year, but there is little evidence the group has a presence in the archipelago.Nasheed, a liberal, is maybe best known internationally for holding a 2009 underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the threat of global warming, signing documents as officials wore scuba gear against a backdrop of coral reefs.He was toppled in a military-backed coup in February 2012, convicted on a charge of terrorism and jailed for 13 years.He left the country on prison leave for medical treatment and sought refuge in Britain.He returned after his nominee Solih won the presidency in 2018, winning parliamentary elections the next year to become speaker.Messages of support for Nasheed poured in on Friday from neighbouring India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as Western nations, which have strongly backed his pro-democracy and environmental activism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-ex-president-critical-after-assassination-attempt-101620391192153.html
07-05-2021||World||Poland, Hungary push against 'gender equality' at EU social summit||Lobbying by Poland and Hungary has led to the removal of the phrase "gender equality" from a draft declaration on advancing social cohesion that the EU is due to publish on Friday, according to diplomats and documents seen by Reuters.Poland's nationalist ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and its eurosceptic ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, promote what they call traditional social values at home and have repeatedly clashed with their more liberal Western peers over the rights of women, gays and migrants.The two countries opposed mentioning "gender equality" directly in the draft prepared for discussion by the bloc's 27 national leaders, who are meeting in the Portuguese city of Porto on Friday and Saturday.While an earlier draft said the bloc would "promote gender equality", the later version seen by Reuters - which could potentially be redrafted again - avoids the phrase and reads:"We will step up efforts to fight discrimination and work actively to close gender gaps ...and to promote equality."European Union diplomats said Warsaw and Budapest had sought the looser language. Both governments have sought to promote Catholic, conservative social values in campaigns that have gone hand-in-hand with increasing state control over media, courts and academics.Asked to comment on the matter, a Polish official said: "Poland always underlines how important legal clarity is... The Treaty of the European Union very clearly refers not to gender equality but to equality between women and men." The official did not elaborate.There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from the Hungarian missions to the EU.The leaders will commit to an inclusive recovery from the bloc's record recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 700,000 people in Europe, shut businesses and travel, and confined millions to their homes for more than a year."Our commitment to unity and solidarity also means ensuring equal opportunities for all and that no one is left behind," the leaders will declare in mentioning the bloc's planned green and digital reforms, as well as focus on education and training."...The priority will be to move from protecting to creating jobs and to improve job quality," they will say, according to the latest draft, which also welcomes a proposal to look beyond GDP readings to measure economic and social progress.The leaders are due to gather in Porto from 1200 GMT.Twenty-four will attend in person, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and two others dialling in for discussions that will also try to overcome divisions on waiving patents for COVID-19 vaccines, and the EU's fraught ties with Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-hungary-push-against-gender-equality-at-eu-social-summit-101620382241968.html

Samples had been taken in order to do genome sequencing, the health ministry has said.The Philippines also allowed a container ship with a travel history to India to dock on Thursday to provide medical assistance to 12 of the 21 Filipino crew members who tested positive for Covid-19.Out of the 12, two were in critical condition and had to be evacuated to a medical facility for treatment, while the others were receiving care on the ship, the transport ministry said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-tightens-controls-on-inbound-travellers-over-covid-19-variants-101620378294151.html

Both the vaccines use new mRNA technology to build immunity against the coronavirus.The EMA and other regulators are already reviewing the possibility of rare blood clotting conditions with Covid-19 vaccines, including AstraZeneca's.Guillain-Barré Syndrome is a rare neurological condition in which the body's immune system attacks the protective coating on nerve fibres. Most cases follow a bacterial or viral infection, and develop over the course of days or weeks.It is an extremely rare, known risk associated with respiratory and gut infections, as well as some vaccinations in the past.AstraZeneca, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-reviews-reports-of-rare-nerve-disorder-after-astrazeneca-covid-shot-101620389912719.html

07-05-2021||World||Experts believe Covid-19 vaccine waiver won’t boost supply to India quickly. Here’s why||While US President Joe Biden’s administration announced its support for a waiver on patent protections for vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), some experts are apprehensive about the impact on vaccine production in the near future. India and South Africa were the first to submit a proposal to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), suggesting a waiver for all members of the trade body on the implementation, application and enforcement of certain provisions of a 1995 intellectual property (IP) rights agreement in order to boost Covid-19 prevention, containment or treatment.As the second wave of Covid-19 ravaged India’s healthcare infrastructure, calls to waive patent protections for vaccines gained momentum, with supporters arguing that the waiver could help the world come out of the pandemic much faster. After the US announced its support for the waiver, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus termed the decision as a “monumental moment” in the fight against Covid-19.But some experts believe that waiving intellectual property rights would have little effect given the technical complexity of manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, Rachel Silverman, a policy analyst with the Center for Global Development, said that the waiver won’t immediately boost vaccine supply to countries like India and Brazil, two of the worst-hit countries.“It could even backfire, with companies using the move as an excuse to disengage from global access efforts,” Silverman wrote.Silverman opined that most drugs are simple and easily analysable chemical compounds that can be produced with relative ease after reverse engineering by competent chemists. On the other hand, vaccines are complex biological products and “observing their contents is insufficient to allow for imitation,” she added.While the European Union has shown willingness to discuss the proposal to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, Germany has opposed any kind of waiver. A spokesperson for the German government said in a statement that the main factors in vaccine production are capacity and quality standards, and not patents. "The protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so in the future," she added.WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the Post that even if the members of the trade body arrive at a consensus to waive the patent protections, production won’t scale up overnight. “It is very difficult to say now whether there is going to be a consensus, but I think they will be able to come to some pragmatic agreement that will give both sides the necessary comfort that they need,” she was quoted by the Post as saying.Moderna Inc, the US-based pharmaceutical company which produced Covid-19 vaccines based on mRNA technology, said that rivals would face significant hurdles in scaling up manufacturing. During a post-earnings conference call, Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel listed the barriers that other countries and companies would face from taking advantage of the waiver. Bancel noted that there is no mRNA manufacturing capacity in the world and companies won’t find people “who know how to make mRNA.”“And then even if all those things were available, whoever wants to do mRNA vaccines will have to, you know, buy the machine, invent the manufacturing process, invent creation processes and ethical processes, and then they will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale manufacturing. This doesn’t happen in six or 12 or 18 months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-believe-covid-19-vaccine-waiver-won-t-boost-supply-quickly-here-s-why-101620388210644.html

Results of its review of the COVID-19 shot made by Sinovac Biotech could come next week, he said.A WHO emergency listing is a signal to national regulators on a product's safety and efficacy.

Hundreds of thousands of new Covid cases are confirmed every day, there are no hospital beds open or oxygen supply left, and people are tragically dying before they can even get to a doctor,” Jayapal, the first and only Indian-American in the US House of Representatives, said.“India needs our help — and it is our moral responsibility to rise to the challenge at the local, Federal, and international level because to defeat a global pandemic, we need a global response,” said Jayapal, who was recently in India to meet her parents who were hospitalised due to Covid-19 infections.Chairwoman of the powerful Progressive Caucus in the House of Representatives, Jayapal on Thursday also had a virtual meeting with Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.After holding an Indian-American community roundtable with advocates, local leaders, and residents about worsening health conditions in India, Jayapal said that she has repeatedly called on the Biden administration to approve India’s request for raw vaccine materials, release some of America's stockpile of unused Covid vaccines to India, and support a resolution at the WTO to waive patent protections so that they can finally put people’s lives over pharmaceutical profits.“The Biden administration’s willingness to quickly heed my call on each of these life-saving requests comes at a moment when wealthy countries have administered more than 80 per cent of global vaccines while low-income countries have received just 0.3 per cent,” she said.“To redress this injustice, the Congressional Progressive Caucus is focused on partnering with Ambassadors, multilateral organisations, and the Biden Administration to achieve our shared goal of an equitable global vaccination programme that quickly gets more vaccines to countries in need around the world,” Jayapal said.“As we work to accomplish this globally, I am proud of the critical efforts that Indian-American advocates, activists, and allies are doing locally. Groups like the India Association of Western Washington (IAWW) are bringing people throughout our region together to aid families in India,” she said.Jayapal also condemned anti-Asian hate in the US as a spike in Covid cases abroad leads to an upsetting spike in anti-Asian discrimination and violence at home.“As the first Indian-American woman ever elected to the House of Representatives, I will do everything in my power to ensure that we end anti-Asian hate. We each have a role to play — and I am committed to playing mine as we stand together against violence, discrimination, and white supremacy,” Jayapal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-moral-responsibility-to-help-india-fight-covid-congresswoman-jayapal-101620378604680.html
07-05-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine delivery by age may mitigate deaths, severe health impacts: Study||A multi-institutional study suggests that prioritizing vaccine delivery to older age groups and the medically vulnerable has the greatest impact in minimizing loss of life.Strategic vaccine delivery is critical to reducing Covid-19 transmission, mortality and long-term health impacts affirm a study published in PLOS Computational Biology by Sam Moore, Matt Keeling and colleagues at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom.While older people are more likely to experience serious health outcomes related to Covid-19 infections, younger age groups contribute significantly to disease transmission and spread. In order to test the efficacy of different vaccination strategies on minimizing deaths and hospitalisations, researchers built an age-structured model that simulated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within different regions in the United Kingdom.The authors then used the model to test multiple different scenarios, including variations in vaccine efficacy using observational data on comorbidities and social-distancing measures in the United Kingdom.The models showed that vaccine strategies prioritizing older age groups first most effectively mitigated deaths and lost quality of life years, despite the significant role of younger groups in disease spread. Since the study's completion in 2020, data has become available for the key assumption on vaccine uptake and specific vaccine characteristics, however, the general conclusions of the study remain relevant.Additionally, the research has already helped guide UK policymakers in the development of an effective Covid-19 vaccination program, including the formation of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation's priority groups that have been used for vaccine delivery.According to the authors, "While the ultimate success of any vaccination scheme will be highly contingent on the characteristics of the vaccine itself and the level of population uptake, as vaccines are developed which mitigate the disease, it is of great importance that they are delivered in an optimal manner -- reducing mortality and healthcare demands. In all scenarios, we find vaccinating the most elderly and vulnerable first to have the greatest impact."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-delivery-by-age-may-mitigate-deaths-severe-health-impacts-study-101620378631826.html
07-05-2021||World||China’s emissions now exceed all the developed world’s combined||China now accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than all of the world’s developed nations combined, according to new research from Rhodium Group.China’s emissions of six heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, rose to 14.09 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019, edging out the total of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members by about 30 million tons, according to the New York-based climate research group.The massive scale of China’s emissions highlights the importance of President Xi Jinping’s drive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and reach net-zero by 2060. China accounted for 27% of global emissions. The U.S., the second biggest emitter, contributed 11% while India for the first time surpassed the European Union with about 6.6% of the global total.Still, China also has the world’s largest population, so its per capita emissions remain far less than those of the U.S. And on a historical basis, OECD members are still the world’s biggest warming culprits, having pumped four times more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than China since 1750.“China’s history as a major emitter is relatively short compared to developed countries, many of which had more than a century head start,” the researchers said. “Current global warming is the result of emissions from both the recent and more distant past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-emissions-now-exceed-all-the-developed-world-s-combined-101620377192599.html
07-05-2021||World||UK's Conservative Party strikes early blow in opposition stronghold||Britain's governing Conservative Party has won a special election in the north of England town of Hartlepool, dealing a big blow to the main opposition Labour Party, which had held the parliamentary seat since its creation in 1974.The victory for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's party, announced Friday morning, provides further evidence that the Conservatives are making ground in parts of the country that have been Labour strongholds for decades, managing to present itself as the party of change even though it's been in power for 11 years.Over the coming couple of days, results from an array of elections in Britain will be announced. On what was dubbed Super Thursday, around 50 million voters were eligible to take part in scores of elections, some of which had been postponed a year because of the pandemic that has left the U.K. with Europe’s largest coronavirus death toll.The results of Thursday's election in Hartlepool showed the Conservative candidate Jill Mortimer winning with 15,529 votes, or nearly 52% of the vote. The Labour candidate, Paul Williams, only received 8,589 votes, or around 29% of the vote.“It is a truly historic result and a momentous day," Mortimer said in her victory speech. “Labour have taken people in Hartlepool for granted for too long."In the 2019 general election, the Conservative Party made big inroads into Labour's “red wall” in northern England on a combination of factors, including its pro-Brexit stance. The recent success of Britain's coronavirus vaccine rollout also appears to have given the Conservatives a shot in the arm.Whatever lay behind the result, the loss of Hartlepool, a post-industrial town that is one of the poorest in England, represents a stunning defeat for the Labour Party and its new leader Keir Starmer.Hopes were high that Starmer would help Labour reconnect with its lost voters in the north of England when he took the helm a little more than a year ago after succeeding the more left-wing Jeremy Corbyn, who led the party in 2019 to its worst election performance since 1935.Steve Reed, Labour's communities spokesman, said it was “absolutely shattering" to see a Conservative candidate win in a place like Hartlepool.“I think what this shows is that although we have started to change since the cataclysm of the last general election, that change has clearly not gone far enough in order to win back the trust of the voters,” he told the BBC.Over the coming couple of days, Labour should have some results to cheer, with Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham expected to easily win second terms as the mayors of London and Manchester.Other results to come include the elections for the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales. In addition, thousands of council members, police commissioners and other local authorities are up for grabs in England. No elections took place in Northern Ireland.The result that could have the biggest U.K-wide implications is the Scotland election, where the governing Scottish National Party is looking for a renewed mandate that could speed up the prospect of a second independence referendum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-conservative-party-strikes-early-blow-in-elections-101620377208403.html
07-05-2021||World||India’s Covid-19 outbreak peak in coming days, suggests mathematical model||A mathematical model prepared by advisers to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggests India’s coronavirus outbreak could peak in the coming days, but the group’s projections have been changing and were wrong last month.The team’s most recent forecast puts them more in line with at least some other scientists, who have suggested a mid-May peak for India.India reported a record 412,262 new infections and 3,980 deaths on Thursday, with experts saying that the reported figures likely underplay the real toll because the nation’s crematoriums and hospitals have been overwhelmed. That makes the assessment of any peak particularly complicated.Still, estimates may become crucial because Modi has been avoiding a national lockdown, choosing instead to allow states to implement their own restrictions to curb the spread.“Our predictions are that the peak will come within a few days,” Mathukumalli Vidyasagar, professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad, said by email Thursday, referring to a model prepared with Manindra Agrawal, a professor from IIT Kanpur. “As per current projections, we should hit 20,000 cases per day by the end of June. We will revise this as needed.”In April, Vidyasagar’s team wrongly predicted that the wave would peak by the middle of last month. That was due to incorrect parameters as “the pandemic was changing rapidly, even wildly, until about a week ago,” he wrote on Twitter at the time.More recently, he told Reuters that the peak would be between May 3-5, and then the India Today publication that it would come on May 7.Scientists are largely agreed that the coming few weeks will be difficult for India. A team at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore used a mathematical model to predict about 404,000 deaths will occur by June 11 if current trends continue. India’s death toll from the pandemic has already crossed 200,000.Infections have surged by more than 300,000 cases for 15 straight days, pushing India’s total tally past 21 million. Some experts blame the sudden surge of India’s second wave on a new variant that has emerged in the country.Anuradha Mittal, a pediatrician with the Kailash Hospital in Noida, on the outskirts of New Delhi, got Covid last month despite receiving both her shots earlier this year. She said that about 50 other doctors in her network had a similar experience. “Probably the viral load is very, very high in the hospitals we work in and the mutants have a role to play,” Mittal said.Scientists worry that new virus mutations can become the next blindspot that can stretch the pandemic for the entire world, as strains from countries like India reach other nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-19-outbreak-peak-in-coming-days-suggests-mathematical-model-101620365309222.html
07-05-2021||World||Kamala Harris' family in India grapples with Covid-19||G. Balachandran turned 80 this spring — a milestone of a birthday in India, where he lives. If not for the coronavirus pandemic, he would have been surrounded by family members who gathered to celebrate with him.But with the virus ravaging his homeland, Balachandran had to settle for congratulatory phone calls. Including one from his rather famous niece: Vice President Kamala Harris.“Unfortunately, because of the Covid, I cannot have such an elaborate function,” the retired academic said in a Zoom interview Thursday from his home in New Delhi.Harris' uncle says he spoke with the vice president and her husband, Doug Emhoff, for quite a while. To close out the conversation, Harris assured him she’d take care of his daughter — her cousin — who lives in Washington.“Don’t worry, Uncle. I’ll take care of your daughter. I talk to her quite a lot,” Balachandran recalls Harris telling him in their March conversation.It was the last time they had a chance to speak. Since then, the coronavirus has raged out of control in India, overwhelming the nation’s health care system and killing hundreds of thousands of people.While the crisis in India has created diplomatic and humanitarian challenges for the Biden administration, for Harris it is also personal: Her mother was born there, and she’s spoken emotionally throughout her political career about the influence of her many visits to India as a child.On Friday, she’s set to deliver remarks at a State Department event focused on the effort to combat Covid-19 in India, and she’s expected to express U.S. solidarity with the nation.Speaking at a fundraiser for the Indian nongovernmental organization Pratham in 2018, Harris talked about walking hand-in-hand with her grandfather, P.V. Gopalan, and listening to him speak with friends about the importance of a free and equal democracy.“It was those walks on the beach with my grandfather on Besant Nagar that have had a profound impact on who I am today,” she said.She spoke often on the campaign trail about her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a headstrong and resilient woman who bucked tradition and decided to leave India to pursue a career as a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.And during her acceptance speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Harris opened her speech with a shout-out to her “chithis” — a Tamil word for aunt. One of those chithis, Sarala Gopalan, is a retired obstetrician who lives in Chennai.As a child, Harris used to visit India every other year. Now all that remains of her extended family there are her aunt and uncle. Another Indian-born aunt lives in Canada.Balachandran said that while he used to hear about friends of friends getting the virus, now it’s hitting close to home. Those he knows personally or worked with are getting the virus, and some are dying.“The conditions are pretty bad in India,” he said.Balachandran considers himself one of the lucky ones, as he’s retired and largely stays home alone, leaving only occasionally for groceries, so that “nobody can infect me other than myself.”His sister Sarala is the same, he says, and has largely isolated herself in her apartment in Chennai to avoid exposure. Both are fully vaccinated, something he knows is a luxury in India, which has suffered from a severe vaccine shortage.That shortage is part of what prompted criticism in India of what many saw as an initially lackluster U.S. response to a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the nation over the past month. The U.S. initially refused to lift a ban on exports of vaccine manufacturing supplies, drawing sharp criticism from some Indian leaders.When Covid-19 cases in India started to spin out of control in April, there were calls for other countries — particularly the U.S. — to get involved. While a number of countries, including Germany, Saudi Arabia and even India's traditional foe Pakistan, offered support and supplies, U.S. leaders were seen as dragging their feet on the issue.The White House had previously emphasized the $1.4 billion in health assistance provided to India to help with pandemic preparedness and said when asked that it was in discussions about offering aid.The delay in offering further aid was seen as putting a strain on long-standing close diplomatic relations between the two nations, and on April 25, after receiving scrutiny over the U.S. response, a number of top U.S. officials publicly offered further support and supplies to the nation — including a tweet and a call to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi from President Joe Biden himself.Harris’ niece in California, Meena Harris, has retweeted a half-dozen accounts calling for more aid to India, including one from climate activist Greta Thunberg admonishing the global community to “step up and immediately offer assistance.”Harris' office declined to comment for this article.The U.S. announced it would lift the export ban on vaccine manufacturing supplies and said it would send personal protective equipment, oxygen supplies, antivirals and other aid to India to help the nation combat the virus.The administration gets no criticism from S.V. Ramanan, a temple administrator of the Shri Dharma Sastha Temple in Harris’ Indian grandfather’s hometown Thulasendrapuram in Southern Tamil Nadu state, 215 miles (350 kilometers) from the coastal city of Chennai.“Everyone has their priorities. America also passed through something similar and we helped then. Now they are helping us,” he said.Ramanan added that he didn’t expect that having Harris as vice president fast-tracked aid to India or that it somehow meant help should have come earlier, adding: “I think in general all other countries should help, and I’m glad the U.S. has stepped up.”He hopes Harris can make a visit to her ancestral village when things are better.While Harris has embraced her Indian heritage as part of her political profile, in responding to the crisis there she’s been careful to speak from the perspective of a vice president rather than an Indian American worried about her family’s safety.“We are all part of a world community. And to the extent that any of us, as human beings who have any level of compassion, see suffering anywhere around the world, it impacts all of us. You know, it impacts us all,” she told reporters last week in Ohio.A ban on travel to and from the country was announced that day. Harris said only that she hadn’t spoken to her family since the ban was announced.And G. Balachandran, Harris’ uncle, doesn’t fault his niece for how the U.S. response has played out.He said that, knowing Kamala, “she would have done all that she can in order to expedite the matter.”For now, he's content with the occasional phone call from his niece. When the two talk, it’s mostly about family; he doesn’t share much about current affairs in India because, he joked, “she’s got a whole embassy that’s sending her cables every hour on all of India!”But he does hope to visit the vice president's residence in Washington at the Naval Observatory when he can travel again. Balachandran said he'd like to meet Biden again and remind him that the last time they met was when Biden was vice president and swore in Harris as a U.S. senator.“I wish we could all be together at the same time,” he said of the extended family, “but that’s a big wish to look for at this moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-family-in-india-grapples-with-covid19-101620363712141.html
07-05-2021||World||Why patents on Covid vaccines are so contentious||The Biden administration's call to lift patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines to help poor parts of the world get more doses has drawn praise from some countries and health advocates.But it has run into resistance from the pharmaceutical industry and others, who say it won't help curb the outbreak any time soon and will hurt innovation.Here's a look at what patents do and why they matter:HOW DO DRUG PATENTS WORK?Patents reward innovation by preventing competitors from simply copying a company's discovery and launching a rival product. In the US, patents on medicines typically last 20 years from when they are filed, which is usually done as soon as a drugmaker thinks it has an important or lucrative drug.Because it often takes a decade to get a drug approved, companies typically end up with about a dozen years of competition-free sales. But drugmakers usually find ways to improve their product or widen its use, and they secure additional patents that can extend their monopoly for another decade or more.WHY IS PATENT PRODUCTION SO IMPORTANT TO DRUGMAKERS?Medicines are incredibly expensive to develop. Most experimental drugs fail at some point during what can be years of laboratory, animal and finally human testing. Averaging in the cost of all those flops, it typically costs more than $1 billion to bring a drug from discovery to regulatory approval. Without the prospect of years of sales without competition, that work is all the more risky.WHY IS THE US BACKING EFFORTS TO LIFT PROTECTIONS ON COVID-19 VACCINES?The Biden administration has been under intense pressure, including from many Democrats in Congress, to get more COVID-19 vaccines to the rest of the world. Support for the waiver idea floated by India and South Africa in October has been growing in other countries while the outbreak worsens in some places, especially India.WHY HAVE THE US AND OTHERS OPPOSED LIFTING PROTECTIONS IN THE PAST?The US and some other wealthy countries lead the world in many areas of research and innovation. That's particularly true for medicines. Aside from the prestige they confer, pharmaceutical companies provide millions of jobs that pay very well, pay taxes on their income and provide new medicines that can save or improve lives. Drugmakers and their trade groups spend millions every year lobbying governments to maintain the status quo on patents.WHY IS THE INDUSTRY SO OPPOSED TO THE EFFORT?In a word, money. In the US, pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever they want for their medicines. They can and do raise prices, typically twice a year, so that list prices often double or triple during a drug's patent-protected years.That makes the big, long-established drugmakers among the world's most profitable companies. But a huge amount of innovation comes from startup pharmaceutical and biotech companies.They must constantly raise money from venture capital firms and other investors to fund early research until they can get their medicine approved or, more often, get a big drugmaker to help fund the research and buy rights to that drug or the entire startup. Without the prospect of a big payday for the new drug, it would be much harder to attract the crucial early money.WHAT WOULD BE THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF LIFTING PROTECTIONS ON COVID-19 VACCINES?That's not entirely clear, but drugmakers and some analysts say waiving their patent rights won't do much to get Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries faster.That's because making the vaccines is far more complex than following a recipe, requiring factories with specialised equipment, highly trained workers and stringent quality control — things that can't be set up quickly.There's little available factory capacity, as the companies with authorised vaccines already have hired many contract drug manufacturers to help them make their shots. In addition, many of the raw materials to make the vaccines, along with vials, stoppers and other components, are in very short supply, and that's not expected to change soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-patents-on-covid-vaccines-are-so-contentious-101620361839167.html

The UN team has also purchased ventilators and oxygen-generating plants.UNICEF is also providing cold chain equipment for Covid-19 vaccines.“Our team has also delivered testing machines and kits, as well as airport thermal scanners,” he said adding that WHO is also providing tents and beds for temporary health facilities and the agency has deployed thousands of public health specialists to help address the pandemic.UNICEF and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) are also helping to monitor more than 175,000 vaccination centres across India.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore had earlier cautioned that the “tragic" Covid-19 situation in India should “raise alarm bells for all of us. Unless the world steps up and helps India now, there will be reverberations across the region and the world in terms of virus-related deaths, virus mutations and supply delays.”India is in the midst of a raging second wave of Covid-19 and is recording over 400,000 daily coronavirus infections and over 3,000 deaths. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India has a total of over 20.6 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 226,000 deaths.Countries across the South Asia region are witnessing rises in infections, with India accounting for over 90 per cent of both cases and deaths in the region, according to the World Health Organization.India also accounted for 46 per cent of global cases and 25 per cent of global deaths reported in the past week, WHO has said.UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei had said in a statement that urgent action and steadfast leadership are indispensable to stop the catastrophe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-agencies-delivered-nearly-10-000-oxygen-concentrators-10-mn-masks-to-india-101620361850020.html
07-05-2021||World||Canadian MPs ask Trudeau to drop opposition to TRIPS waiver||Sixty Canadian MPs have written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking him to drop “without delay” his government’s opposition to temporarily waiving intellectual property protections for vaccines and medication required to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, amid signs Ottawa may be softening its stance on the matter.India and South Africa had submitted a proposal in October last year seeking that waiver under the Agreement of Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights or TRIPS for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, some nations, mainly from the West had opposed that move.On Thursday, 60 Canadian MPs, belonging to the House of Commons and Senate and cutting across party lines, wrote to Trudeau demanding a change in Ottawa’s position. The MPs, including members of the ruling Liberal Party, wrote, “Simply, we need to eliminate all potential barriers to the timely access of affordable Covid-19 medical products, including vaccines and medicines, and scale up the manufacturing and supply of essential medical products. There is no question that normative intellectual property rights represent a significant potential barrier.”The Canadian government is taking a softer line on this issue, as Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng told the House:“Canada will actively participate in negotiations to wave intellectual property protection, particular to Covid-19 vaccines.” She also said Canada will continue to work with members of the World Trade Organisation or WTO “to reach an agreement and to find solutions that will accelerate the production and equitable distribution of vaccines”.Canada’s new tone comes after the United States expressed its support for the waiver this week, and was joined in that stand by France.The motion moved by India and South Africa was officially endorsed by 58 countries with 100 supporting it. The MPs, in their letter to Trudeau, said they wanted to add their “voices to call on the Government of Canada to endorse the proposed TRIPS waiver without delay and work collaboratively with WTO members to support its adoption”.In an interview to CBC News, India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said India and Canada had a conversation ongoing in this regard at the level of the nations’ WTO ambassadors. He added, “We’re hoping we get this through and I’m sure all our partners will be part of this process as we go forward.”The Canadian MPs noted that opponents of the measure had argued that patent monopolies were necessary for pharmaceutical companies to recover their investments in research and development. However, they countered that this justification did not apply since Covid-19 vaccine development “was primarily financed through public investment and advanced market commitments”. They asserted that “we all benefit when every human is vaccinated, and barriers to this objective must be removed wherever possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-mps-ask-trudeau-to-drop-opposition-to-trips-waiver-101620361257163.html
07-05-2021||World||Blast that injured Nasheed, is attack on Maldives' democracy: President Solih||The Maldives president said on Friday an explosion that wounded former leader Mohamed Nasheed was an attack on the country's democracy and economy and said Australian police would assist the investigation.Nasheed, 53, was injured in the blast Thursday night outside his home and was being treated in a hospital in the capital, Male, police said. Home Minister Imran Abdulla told a local television that Nasheed's injuries were not life-threatening.He is the current Parliament speaker and was the Maldives' first democratically elected president, serving from 2008 to 2012.President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih said in a televised speech Friday that Australian Federal Police investigators will arrive in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation on Saturday.Neither Solih nor police have given further details on the attack and no one has claimed responsibility.Photos circulated on social media showed a ripped-up motorcycle at the scene.Neighbouring India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a tweet described the blast as an attack on Nasheed.“Wish him a speedy recovery. Know that he will never be intimidated,” Jaishankar said.The presidency of Nasheed ended a 30-year autocratic rule, but his own term ended when he resigned amid protests. He was defeated in the following presidential election and became ineligible to enter the 2018 election due to a prison sentence. His party colleague Solih won the 2018 presidential election.Nasheed remained an influential political figure and was elected Parliament speaker in 2019.Nasheed has championed global efforts to fight climate change, particularly warning that rising seas caused by global warming threaten the low-lying islands of the Indian Ocean archipelago nation.He has also been an outspoken critic of religious extremism in this predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, where preaching and practicing other faiths are banned by law.Maldives is known for its luxury resort islands but has seen rare violent attacks.In 2007, a blast in a park in the capital wounded 12 foreign tourists.

Along with the Norwegian climber it infected on Mount Everest in late April, the virus has struck climbers on the world's seventh-highest peak -- Dhaulagiri -- 345 kilometers (214 miles) west of Everest. A CNN report quoting the chairperson of tour operator Seven Summits Trek Mingma Sherpa says that at least 19 people have been evacuated from the camps of the mountain out of which seven tested positive and 12 others were scheduled to take a test after showing symptoms.Also Read: Nepal issues record number of permits for Everest expeditions despite Covid-19On Everest too, 30 people have been evacuated from base camp and subsequently tested positive after April, according to Polish climber Pawel Michalski's Facebook post.The highly virulent virus, which has infected more than 156 million and killed over 3 million people around the world, according to the real-time statistics provider website Worldometers, forced China to cancel permits to the world's highest peak in March last year. Soon after, Nepal too called off all expeditions to the peak from its side of the mountain. Now that the restrictions have been eased, a year later, the 8848.86 meters-tall mountain issued a record 394 permits for expeditions till April, according to news agency PTI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNepal generates a large part of its revenue from the tourism sector. Many Nepalis depend on climbing for their livelihoods. After last year's season was called off due to the pandemic, this year's permits are rays of hope for numerous local guides, sherpas and chefs. The tourists will attempt to bubble and socially distance. However, according to experts, following Covid-appropriate behaviour may be tough. "Base camp is really a small city," said veteran Everest watcher Alan Arnette, and according to Furtenbach Adventure, there are around 1,200 people at the camp this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hits-new-highs-after-mount-everest-virus-spreads-to-other-peaks-101620351110342.html

As the wind blows, if we don't stop it today, it'll spread around the world,” he said.Expressing concern over the current situation in India, Rev Jackson said he will personally speak to the healthcare industry to donate oxygen concentrators and cylinders to India and follow up with the pharmaceutical giants to ensure therapeutic supplies to the country.Other Indian Americans from the Chicago area echoed similar sentiments."It is everyone's duty to help India flatten this COVID-19 surge as we live in a world that cannot be separated by borders," said Dr Vijay Prabhakar, the chairman of American Association of Multiethnic Physicians."Based on the current projections some of the models are suggesting, there may be 1 million deaths by the end of August. As we know, that would be a tragic humanitarian crisis,” said Dr Srinivas Reddy, the trustee of Chicago Medical Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-activist-urges-biden-to-release-60-mn-doses-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-for-india-101620353409976.html

Inhale, because I felt really heavy -- I felt like those cartoons when they experience G and your face is just sagging down," said American Victor Glover, one of the astronauts in the group called Crew-1.It was the first regular mission to be taken and then returned from the ISS aboard a spacecraft built by billionaire Elon Musk's company."I expected it to be so dynamic -- and so challenging -- that the actual event I think, was a little less than what I was expecting, and so it was enjoyable all around," Glover said.The weight of acceleration was concentrated in the chest, making it difficult to breathe.But then, "launch and entry are such unique experiences," he said.NASA has contracted SpaceX to launch astronauts into space from US soil, something that has not been possible since 2011 with the end of space shuttle program.Since that time until now NASA was forced to pay for rides to the ISS aboard Russian Soyuz vessels, which land on dry land."Landing in the water was interesting because none of us really knew what to expect, but I would say from my standpoint, it felt a little bit softer than landing on land," said US astronaut Shannon Walker."You spend less time under a parachute on the Dragon than you do under the Soyuz," he said.Soon, space "tourists" -- civilians who are not professional astronauts -- will take their places on Dragon.US astronaut Mike Hopkins believes that space tourists will be able to handle the rough reentry rides.After the civilians go through some centrifuge training "it's not going to be completely unique to them," he said.Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi said the landing was pretty smooth."Impact was very, very minimal, and right after splashdown. We feel the waves, we come back to the water planet."That's a great feeling."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-felt-really-heavy-astronauts-describe-returning-to-earth-on-spacex-capsule-101620349699029.html

One of the boosters is an additional low-dose shot of its existing vaccine, while the other type is customised against the South Africa strain.Scientists and drugmakers are moving rapidly to head off the rise of coronavirus variants with new mutations that may help them elude existing vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn Moderna’s trial, the customised booster, called mRNA-1273.351, produced the highest levels of antibodies against the strain common in South Africa.“We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforces our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective against these newly detected variants,” said Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.Meanwhile, Moderna said that initial results from its trial of its Covid vaccine in adolescents aged 12-17 years showed that it was 96% effective, with no serious safety problems identified so far.The company is continuing to collect data and is in discussions with regulators about amending its emergency use authorisation to include teenagers.China detects 18 cases of double mutant variantChina has confirmed at least 18 cases of the “double mutant” coronavirus variant circulating in India, including in three Chinese nationals who worked near New Delhi and returned home last month.

07-05-2021||World||US can prevent 6 mn cases if it vaccinates half its population by summer: Study||A new study finds if the United States vaccinates half its population by the summer vs fall, 6.8 million cases could be prevented and USD 9.8 billion in societal costs could be saved.The study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases shows the lives, hospitalisations, and costs that can be saved by even relatively small increases in vaccination coverage and reaching higher vaccination coverage levels sooner (e.g., by the end of the summer versus fall/winter).The study was led by researchers from PHICOR (Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research) at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe team developed a computer simulation model of the entire U.S. and the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus throughout the country. Using the model, the team could simulate vaccinating different proportions of the population at different rates with different types of COVID-19 vaccines. Like real people, each of these virtual people could become infected with the virus and develop different symptoms over time and, depending upon the severity of those symptoms, visit clinics, emergency departments, or hospitals. These in turn would have associated costs, allowing the tracking of various medical costs and productivity losses.The study showed that going from a 30 per cent vaccination coverage to a 40 per cent coverage could save 24.3 million cases and $33.1 billion in direct medical costs and productivity losses. Going from 50 per cent to 70 per cent coverage could save 9.5 million cases and 10.8 billion in direct medical costs and productivity losses.In fact, even relatively small increases in vaccine coverage can prevent thousands of cases and lives and hundreds of millions in costs. For example, results from the model showed each 1 per cent increase between 40 and 50 per cent of the U.S. population being vaccinated by the fall can prevent 1.6 million cases, 60,190 hospitalizations, and 7,100 deaths and save USD 674.2 million in direct medical costs and USD 1.5 billion in productivity losses.Each 1 per cent increase between 50 and 70 per cent can prevent 473,900 cases, 17,600 hospitalizations, 2,000 deaths, and 537 million in direct medical costs and productivity losses.The study also emphasised the importance of reaching higher coverage levels as soon as possible. For example, speeding up vaccinations to reach a 50 per cent coverage by July 2021 instead of October 2021 could save an additional 5.8 million cases, 215,790 hospitalizations, 26,370 deaths, USD 3.5 billion in direct medical costs, and USD 4.3 billion in productivity losses.Results suggested that getting as many people fully vaccinated as possible before the early winter would be particularly important. The model incorporated changes in the transmission of the virus that occurred with the changing seasons in 2020, when surges occurred during the winter months, and projected what may happen in 2021. For example, when 50 per cent of the U.S. population is vaccinated by October 2021 instead of the end of December 2021, 6.6 million cases, 252,260 hospitalizations, 29,380 deaths, USD 4.0 billion direct medical costs, and USD 8.0 billion productivity losses were saved."The results of this study can give policymakers, community leaders, and other decision-makers a sense of how much can be invested into vaccinating those who may be harder to get vaccinated," explained Sarah Bartsch, MPH, the study's lead author and project director for PHICOR."Such investments may end up paying for themselves. For example, the potential cost savings exceed the USD 1.5 billion Biden Administration community outreach and media campaign. Our results show that increasing total vaccination coverage by just one per cent could cover the costs of this effort.""The longer it takes to reach higher vaccination coverage levels and herd immunity thresholds, the more the virus can spread," said Bruce Y Lee, senior author of the study, executive director of PHICOR, and CUNY SPH professor."It may be particularly important to reach higher coverage levels before the late fall to prevent another winter surge."Additionally, the study showed how increasing vaccination coverage levels were more valuable than using vaccines with higher effectiveness. For example, we found that achieving a 70 per cent coverage with a 70 per cent effective vaccine can save 2.1 million cases and 5.5 billion in medical costs and productivity losses compared to achieving a 50 per cent coverage with a 90 per cent effective vaccine over the same period.This shows the value of using all Covid-19 vaccines that are available to get more people vaccinated as soon as possible, rather than focusing only on those with the highest effectiveness. Moreover, as more contagious variants circulate, potentially decreasing the effectiveness of the existing Covid-19 vaccines, this can help address concerns about continuing with the existing vaccines or waiting for an updated version.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-can-prevent-6-mn-cases-if-it-vaccinates-half-its-population-by-summer-study-101620346342709.html

The posturing was sparked by a protest by French fishing boats, which gathered outside Jersey’s main port, raising fears of a blockade.That prompted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to send two royal navy gunboats to the area, with France following suit with two of its own coast patrol vessels.The British navy vessels HMS Severn and HMS Tamar arrived in Jersey’s waters to “monitor the situation,” the UK government said on Thursday, while people in the French military said “the situation is very calm overall”.Johnson said on Thursday that two Royal Navy vessels would remain off the island of Jersey, his office said after a call between Johnson and Jersey’s Chief Minister John Le Fondré.Earlier in the day, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, appealed for tensions to be defused. “...obviously we call for restraint and for calm, and for discussing the issue at stake between the two stakeholders calmly,” spokesperson Dana Spinant said at a daily briefing in Brussels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thaw-in-tensions-with-britain-after-french-fishermen-end-stir-over-rights-101620334496940.html
