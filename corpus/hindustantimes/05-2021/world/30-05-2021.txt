Scientists have hypothesized that it most likely spread from wild animals to humans. The idea that the virus may have accidentally escaped from a research lab, long promoted by some Republicans, has gotten renewed attention from the Biden administration.In a surprise statement on Wednesday, President Joe Biden called for a renewed investigation into the virus’s emergence. U.S. intelligence agencies had conflicting assessments of whether it was more likely the virus crossed the species barrier from a natural reservoir or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Biden said. He ordered the agencies to “redouble their efforts” and report to him again in 90 days.Debate over the virus’s origin was fueled anew by a Wall Street Journal report on May 23 that three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care for “symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.”Scientists should be allowed to conduct a long-term investigation in China and take blood samples from humans and animals, Hotez said. The U.S. should pressure China, including with the threat of sanctions, to allow for an inquiry.“We need a team of scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, bat ecologists in Hubei province for a six-month, year-long period,” Hotez said.Chinese officials have disputed the Wuhan lab theory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday dismissed Biden’s inquiry as an attempt to engage in “stigmatization, political manipulation and blame-shifting.”A World Health Organization report released in March didn’t fully uncover the virus’s origin but called a lab leak unlikely. The global health body called for more investigation at that time.“As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement when the March report was released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/find-covid-19-origin-or-face-another-pandemic-us-experts-warn-101622396047440.html
30-05-2021||World||Israeli opposition parties reach coalition deal to oust Netanyahu||Far-right party leader Naftali Bennett threw his crucial support on Sunday behind a "government of change" in Israel to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in what would be the end of a political era.Bennett's decision, which he announced in a televised address, could enable opposition chief Yair Lapid to put together a coalition of right-wing, centrist and leftist parties and hand Netanyahu his first election defeat since 1999.Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party that finished second to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in an inconclusive March 23 national ballot, faces a Wednesday deadline from Israel's president to announce a new government.Lapid's chances of success have rested largely with Bennett, a former defence chief whose Yamina party's six seats in the 120-member parliament are enough to give him the status of kingmaker.Under a prospective power-sharing deal, Bennett would replace Netanyahu, the 71-year-old head of the Likud party, as prime minister and later give way to centrist Lapid in a rotation agreement."It's either a fifth election, or a unity government," Bennett, 49, said in his speech, explaining his decision to partner with Lapid.Israel has held four inconclusive elections since April 2019.The new coalition's diverse members would have little in common apart from a plan to end the 12-year-run of Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, now on trial over corruption charges he denies.An anti-Netanyahu coalition would be fragile and require outside backing by Arab members of parliament who oppose much of Bennett's agenda, which includes more settlement building in the occupied West Bank and its partial annexation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-opposition-parties-reach-coalition-deal-to-oust-netanyahu-101622395183289.html
30-05-2021||World||Israel, Egypt hold talks over a 'permanent ceasefire' in Gaza||Israeli and Egyptian officials held talks in both countries Sunday aimed at bolstering the Cairo-brokered ceasefire that ended the latest deadly flare-up of violence between the Jewish state and Gaza's Hamas rulers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in Jerusalem to discuss "strengthening cooperation" between their countries, Netanyahu's office said.Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi tasked Kamel and his delegation, who also visited the occupied Palestinian Territories, with hammering out a permanent ceasefire deal, senior Egyptian security officials told AFP.On the same day, Israel's Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi made the first official visit by an Israeli top diplomat to neighbouring Egypt in 13 years, for talks with his counterpart Sameh Shoukry.Ashkenazi tweeted that they would "discuss establishing a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, a mechanism for providing humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Gaza with a pivotal role played by the international community".He later called for efforts "to prevent strengthening extremist elements that threaten regional stability, and to ensure the return home of the missing persons and prisoners held by Hamas."The Egyptian foreign ministry tweeted that the ministers' talks were "part of Egypt's relentless and continued efforts to revive the peace track and to build on the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip".Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was also expected in Cairo for talks, senior Egyptian security officials said, without providing further details.Egypt played a pivotal role in negotiating the May 21 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought an end to 11 days of deadly fighting.Israeli strikes on Gaza killed 254 Palestinians, including 66 children, health officials said.Rockets and other fire from Gaza claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, medics said.- Prisoners -Sisi also tasked Kamel with working to help iron out political divisions between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Egyptian officials said.Kamel met Sunday with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah, according to official Palestinian media.They discussed the latest developments linked to the truce, as well as the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian national dialogue, the Wafa news agency said.A bitter divide between Hamas and Fatah has long plagued Palestinian politics, but analysts say the latest escalation has served to unite the geographically fragmented Palestinian community in a way not seen in years.Netanyahu reiterated Israel's demand "for the prompt return" of Israelis being held in the Gaza Strip, according to the statement.Ashkenazi also said Israel was "fully committed" to repatriating Israeli prisoners held by Hamas.Since Israel's 2014 invasion of the Gaza Strip, the Islamist group has held the bodies of Israeli soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, although Hamas has never confirmed their deaths.Hamas is also believed to be holding two Israeli citizens who entered Gaza alone and whose families say they have mental health issues.Israel is meanwhile holding more than 5,000 Palestinians in its jails.- Gaza reconstruction -Sisi has pledged $500 million to help reconstruction efforts in the densely populated Gaza enclave, which was pummelled by Israeli air strikes.Hamas has pledged not to touch "a single cent" of international aid to rebuild Gaza.Israel, which has enforced a land and maritime blockade on the enclave since 2007, accuses the group of diverting international aid to military ends.The statement from Netanyahu's office said he and Kamel also discussed "mechanisms and processes to prevent the strengthening of Hamas and its use of the resources that will be directed to the civilian population in the future".The latest violent flare-up was sparked by increased tensions in Jerusalem, including over Israeli security forces cracking down on Palestinians inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, which is also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.Shoukry emphasised the "need to consider the particular sensitivity (of) east Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa mosque and all Christian and Muslim holy sites," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement.The UN Human Rights Council decided Thursday to create an open-ended international investigation into violations surrounding the latest Gaza violence.It said it would also look at the "underlying root causes of recurrent tensions and instability, including systematic discrimination" in the occupied Palestinian Territories and inside Israel.UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet voiced particular concern about the "high level of civilian fatalities and injuries" from the bombing of Gaza and warned the Israeli strikes on the enclave "may constitute war crimes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-egypt-hold-talks-over-a-permanent-ceasefire-in-gaza-101622393428134.html
30-05-2021||World||UK may ask NHS workers to take vaccine against Covid-19, opposition up in arms||The British government may require National Health Service workers to be inoculated against COVID-19 — a contentious proposal that was immediately criticised by opposition leaders as counterproductive.The UK government's vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, told Sky News on Sunday that officials were considering the move in hopes of preventing medical workers from spreading COVID-19 to their patients. The government has already asked the public to comment on a similar requirement for care home employees.“It's absolutely the right thing and would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated," Zahawi said.“There is precedent for this. Obviously, surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it is something that we are absolutely thinking about."British authorities are scrambling to protect their plans to lift all COVID-19 restrictions on June 21, allowing people to enjoy their summer holidays, amid concern about a fast-spreading variant that was first discovered in India. New infections and coronavirus-related deaths have risen over the past week, though the current figures are still a fraction of the levels reported during the January peak.While Britain has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll, at over 128,000 people, public health officials say the situation has improved since last winter because of the rapid rollout of vaccines. More than 74% of British adults have received at least one dose of vaccine.The opposition Labour Party was quick to condemn the proposal for compulsory vaccinations, saying it would be better to work with staff to address their concerns than to force them to get the shot.“Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS, I think it's far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them," said lawmaker Thangam Debbonaire, a party spokesperson on such issues. “Threatening staff, I don't think, is a good idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-may-ask-nhs-workers-to-take-vaccine-against-covid-19-opposition-up-in-arms-101622393289218.html

30-05-2021||World||Horses starve to death as Covid pandemic hits Bangladesh tourism||More than 20 horses have died of starvation in just one month at Bangladesh's most popular resort district, the animals' owners said Sunday, as the country's tourism industry reels from the pandemic's economic fallout.The South Asian nation of 168 million people is battling a fresh wave of coronavirus infections that has stretched its healthcare system and triggered a nationwide lockdown.The horses' owners said they were struggling to afford fodder for their animals, which are used for tourist rides at Cox's Bazar beach -- one of the world's longest."Once coronavirus hit, tourist numbers... sharply dropped to a trickle," Farida Begum, spokesperson of the Cox's Bazar Horse Owners Association, told AFP."We are struggling to make ends meet. How can we feed the horses?"Tourists had briefly returned to the district from December to February when infections slowed, but visits dried up under the fresh lockdown imposed from April 14.At least 21 horses out of up to 90 used for tourists at the beach died over the past month while others were emaciated, Begum said.During last year's lockdown, 41 horses -- including eight of Begum's own -- died, she added.Some owners have set their horses free, hoping they can survive by eating grass or foraging for food.The horse owners say they have been struggling to feed their own families, with many taking out loans from microlenders just to make ends meet."Officials from the microlender come to my home every week and badger me to pay back the loan in instalments. But unless the tourists start arriving in Cox's Bazar, I can't pay back the money," Begum said, adding that she had borrowed 100,000 taka ($1,200).Dozens of horse handlers usually hired by the owners to help tourists with the rides have switched to driving rickshaws or construction work.- 'No tourists means no income' -The resort town usually attracts more than two million mostly domestic tourists every year.But under the nationwide lockdown, offices and markets are shut and public transport has been halted.Horse owner Sarwar Azam told AFP that one of his animals died last week and the second was also going hungry.The head of a local horse owners' organisation, Nishan Ahsan -- whose four animals died during last year's lockdown -- said his members had received limited aid from the government."During the peak tourism time, a horse can earn up to 2,000 taka ($23) a day. We would set aside a slice of that income for the horses' food, which is expensive," Ahsan told AFP."But no tourists means no income for us."The government administrator for Cox's Bazar, Sumaiya Akter, said she had only heard of four to five horses dying in the past eight months.She added that the government had given the owners 146 sacks of husks and 20 cans of molasses since May 9.Bangladesh has recorded nearly 800,000 coronavirus infections and more than 12,300 deaths since the start of the pandemic, but experts say the actual numbers are likely to be much higher.Just over six percent of the population has received the first vaccine dose, while the government has said it is running out of jabs as it tries to combat the latest devastating virus wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horses-starve-to-death-as-covid-pandemic-hits-bangladesh-tourism-101622386004358.html
30-05-2021||World||Talks with India if Jammu and Kashmir's pre-August 2019 status restored: Imran Khan||Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday that Pakistan would hold talks with India if New Delhi restores the pre-August 5, 2019 status of Jammu and Kashmir.India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two Union territories."If Pakistan revives its relations with India (without the latter restoring the status of Kashmir), it will be similar to turning our back on the Kashmiris,” Khan said during a live questions and answers session with the people.Khan said that if India takes back the steps it took on August 5, "then we can definitely hold talks".New Delhi has repeatedly said Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the country is capable of solving its own problems.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with it in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories.However, lately there has been some improvement when the two countries agreed in February to restore peace on the Line of Control. It is said that the rival officials have been interacting through the back channel diplomacy to ease tension.Khan also responded to several questions about domestic issues including inflation and promised that his government was working hard to bring down prices of commodities. He also said that Pakistan will continue to achieve economic growth in the days to come as he termed the process gradual and one that would take time.

The new panorama, touted as a “cosmic masterpiece”, was compiled using a giant mosaic of data from Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. The image depicts billions of stars and countless black holes in the centre of the Milky Way.“What we see in the picture is a violent or energetic ecosystem in our galaxy’s downtown,” Astronomer Daniel Wang of the University of Massachusetts Amherst told Associated Press in an email.“There are a lot of supernova remnants, black holes, and neutron stars there. Each X-ray dot or feature represents an energetic source, most of which are in the center,” Wang added.Sharing the image, Nasa noted that the threads of superheated gas and magnetic fields are “weaving a tapestry of energy at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.” According to the US space agency, the latest image expands Chandra’s image, which was based on previous surveys, farther above and below the plane of the Galaxy where most of the Galaxy's stars reside.Also Read | Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter survives wild flight after a navigation error. Here’s what happenedThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration explained that orange, green, blue and purple colours are X-rays from Chandra showing different X-ray energies. The radio data received from MeerKAT are shown in lilac and grey. “One thread is particularly intriguing because it has X-ray and radio emission intertwined. It points perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and is about 20 light years long but only one-hundredth that size in width,” said Nasa.A new study of the X-ray and radio properties of this “thread” by Wang, who spent over a year working on it, suggests these features are bound together by thin strips of magnetic fields. Wang’s study describing these results will appear in the June issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a preprint is available online.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cosmic-masterpiece-nasa-image-shows-violent-energy-of-milky-way-downtown-101622382422334.html
30-05-2021||World||Falling fertility rates pose challenges for Chinese military||After the new census showed a fall in the fertility rate of China, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is facing a significant challenge as it seeks to fill the need of hundreds of thousands of new recruits each year, being the world's largest military.China's once-a-decade census, released this month, showed that 12 million babies were born in the last year, the lowest since 1961, during the Great Famine, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).The country's move to loosen China's one-child policy in 2016 and allow people to have a second child had failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate. The census showed China's 2020 fertility rate was 1.3 children per woman, which is below the replacement level of 2.1 needed for a stable population.Military expert Antony Wong Tong said that many mainland military officials and observers had voiced concerns about the impact of the one-child policy on the military since 1993. Professor Liu Mingfu from the PLA National Defence University in 2012 warned that at least 70 per cent of PLA soldiers were from one-child families, and the figure rose to 80 per cent among combat troops."We could find the PLA has recruited more female soldiers in the past decade - a popular approach adopted by developed countries facing a shortage of new blood," Wong said.The gathering pace of the PLA's modernisation has given its instructors and recruiters the challenge of how to train a newer breed of soldier, SCMP reported citing experts."Military instructors found the strict and dogmatic training modes applied in the last century didn't work for the more individual young soldiers born in the 21st century," said Zhou Chenming, a researcher from a Beijing-based think tank.Chinese media reported that rather than only orders and scolding, China's military has also brought in therapy sessions by professional psychotherapists since 2011 to ease stress.Physical fitness has been another tough challenge for the PLA since the military shifted its recruitment targets from peasants' children to rural youth with a higher education level in 2000.The military recruited more than 120,000 college graduates in 2009 - the highest since 1949 - to command and operate increasingly advanced and sophisticated weapon systems, SCMP reported.Even after postponing the results of the once-in-a-decade census for a month, the Chinese government was unable to fully cover up the alarming demographic situation that the country is facing.According to the seventh nationwide census of 2020, China's population has grown by merely 5.38 per cent over the last 10 years. China's birthrate has been on the decline since 2017, despite easing of the 'one-child policy' in order to avert an incoming demographic crisis.China's one-child policy, implemented in 1979 and withdrawn in 2016, had exacerbated the practice of sex-selective abortion in favour of boys, said Jiang Quanbao, a demography professor.

30-05-2021||World||Netanyahu in last-minute bid to scupper possible deal to unseat him||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu manoeuvred on Sunday to try to dissuade opponents from forming a "government of change", with media reports saying a deal to unseat Israel's longest-serving leader could be imminent.Opposition chief Yair Lapid, who has until Wednesday to put together a coalition after the fourth inconclusive election in two years, was closing in on an alliance of right-wing, centrist and leftist parties, Israeli media reported.The new coalition's parties would have little in common apart from a plan to end the 12-year-run of Netanyahu, a right-wing leader on trial over corruption charges he denies.Lapid's chances of success rest with far-right politician Naftali Bennett, whose Yamina party's six seats in the 120-member parliament are enough to give him the status of kingmaker.Bennett, 49, was widely expected to announce, possibly as early as Sunday, whether he would team up with Lapid, whose centrist Yesh Atid party placed second to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in the latest election two months ago.Bennett convened Yamina's legislators on Sunday to discuss his next steps. Most Israeli media predicted Bennett would agree to a deal under which he would replace Netanyahu as prime minister and later give way to Lapid in a rotation agreement.Such a deal had already been reported as close when violence broke out between Israel and Gaza militants on May 10, which prompted Bennett to suspend discussions. The fighting ended with a ceasefire after 11 days. Bennett has maintained public silence in recent days.To form a government with Lapid, Bennett would first have to rally his own party's legislators, despite a closer political affinity to Netanyahu's Likud.An anti-Netanyahu coalition would be fragile, and require outside backing by Arab members of parliament who oppose much of Bennett's agenda. It would be expected to focus on the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, while setting aside issues on which members disagree, such as the role of religion in society and Palestinian aspirations for statehood.COUNTER-OFFERNetanyahu, 71, made a sudden three-way counter-offer on Sunday to stand aside in favour of another right-wing politician, Gideon Saar. Under Netanyahu's blueprint, Saar would serve as prime minister for 15 months, Netanyahu would return for two years, and Bennett would then take over for the rest of the government's term."We are at a fateful moment for Israel's security, character and future, when you put aside any personal considerations and take far-reaching and even unprecedented steps," Netanyahu said in a video statement on Twitter about the proposal.However, Saar, a former Likud cabinet minister, swiftly rejected the offer, writing on Twitter: "Our position and commitment are unchanged - to end Netanyahu's rule."There was no immediate comment from Bennett, who has reversed course before over whether to push out Netanyahu.Netanyahu's rivals have cited his corruption case as a main reason why Israel needs a new leader, arguing that he might use a new term to legislate immunity to shield himself.If Lapid, 57, fails to announce a government by Wednesday, a new election, the fifth since April 2019, is likely. Bennett has said he aims to avoid it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-in-last-minute-bid-to-scupper-possible-deal-to-unseat-him-101622376594182.html

The Kotri Barrage is bearing the most serious shortage i.e. 50.44 per cent.As of Saturday, Sindh's three barrages are bearing with 36.94 per cent water shortage which undermines cotton crop that has been sown in areas wherever water is made available for the early Kharif.IRSA's Sindh member Zahid Junejo says everyone hopes that the water situation improves in view of rising temperature in upper reaches that may lead to improved water flows."But currently, wherever cotton is grown or paddy nurseries are prepared, crops are affected due to water shortage that has been going on for a long period," he said.He also disagreed with the viewpoint of Punjab, which accuses Sindh of providing fudged figures."We check water flows at every point. Formation of a committee is now likely with consent of Sindh and Punjab. It would be entrusted with monitoring of water discharges through independent inspectors," he added.He also said that allowable losses have been revised at 30 per cent, which was again a loss for the Sindh province, reported Dawn."That's why Sindh says transit losses between Taunsa and Guddu are exceptionally higher and explains that gradients are not steeper and the temperature remains exceptionally high there," he added.He also regretted that when IRSA decided on May 24 to not open the Taunsa-Panjnad link canal, it was still opened by Punjab to the great disadvantage of Sindh, where farmers have lost their early sowing of Kharif crops considerably".Amid the rising population and climate change, the availability of fresh water is becoming worrisome in South Asia, particularly in Pakistan, which may face absolute water scarcity by 2040.According to a Washington-based magazine, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed Pakistan at the third position in the list of countries facing acute water scarcity.Moreover, the per capita availability of fresh water in Pakistan has fallen below the water scarcity threshold (1,000 cubic meters), which was 3,950 cubic meters in 1961 and 1600 in 1991.

They chanted slogans against the government, the federal minister for education and other officers of the education department.As the Covid-19 pandemic forced the educational institutes to remain closed, online classes were conducted only for a short period. Under such a situation, the students insisted that final exams should be taken online.As the protest turned violent, protesters started damaging private vehicles and also beat and injured the drivers of these vehicles, claimed officials. In response, the police resorted to baton-charge to disperse the protesters, Dawn reported.The students pelted stones at the police after which the police used tear gas to disperse them, taking over a dozen of protesters into custody.Later, the arrested students along with the bikes were shifted to different police stations.The officials said that during questioning those who were arrested failed to prove that they were students and enrolled in any educational institutes. They seemed to be miscreants and had joined the students' protest to disrupt law and order, they added.Meanwhile, a gridlock was witnessed on the expressway and other roads due to the protest by the students at Faizabad creating hardship for motorists, Dawn reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-dozen-students-arrested-in-islamabad-after-protest-against-in-person-exams-101622378561852.html

Joshua Sanders said at a news conference. He indicated that there were no survivors.“Our efforts have transitioned from a rescue effort to that of a recovery effort. ... We are no longer ... looking for live victims at this point,” Sanders said.County officials identified the seven killed in a news release late Saturday. Brandon Hannah, Gwen S. Lara, William J. Lara, David L. Martin, Jennifer J. Martin, Jessica Walters and Jonathan Walters, all of Brentwood, Tennessee, were presumed dead. Their names were released after family members had been notified.Earlier Saturday, officials confirmed that at least one person had died in the crash and that search crews had found a debris field and identified parts of the airplane in the lake. Sanders said the crash appeared to have taken place entirely in the lake.Authorities also did not release registration information for the plane, which was heading from Smyrna Rutherford County Airport to Palm Beach International Airport.The Tennessee Highway Patrol told news outlets that a witness saw the plane go into the water near a marina.The National Transportation Safety Board and FAA both had investigators at the scene.Smyrna is located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Nashville.

30-05-2021||World||British spies believe Wuhan Covid lab leak theory is ‘feasible’: Report||The controversy around the possible leak of the Sars-CoV-2 virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan has received another boost. According to a Sunday Times report, British intelligence officials believe it is “feasible” that the pandemic began after a virus leak from a Wuhan laboratory. The British spies are now investigating the theory of a possible leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to the report.Quoting people familiar with the development, the British daily said that a recent reassessment of the possible source of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has prompted UK intelligence to investigate the lab leak theory. Sharing renewed concerns over virus origin, American diplomatic sources said that the world is “one wet market or bio lab away from the next spillover”, reported The Sunday Times.The hypothesis of the introduction of Sars-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident had gained a lot of traction in the early days of the pandemic but was largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. A global study, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), also deemed it “extremely unlikely” after international experts visited Wuhan in January this year.Also Read | Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsBut a recent remark by top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on virus origin possibilities took the world by surprise, which was followed by a demand for a new “transparent” investigation. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a virtual event that he was not convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.”"Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus," he said.According to a Daily Mail report, a study has found that the Sars-CoV-2 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’ and was created by Chinese scientists while working on ‘gain-of-function’ research. The study, which is set to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, claimed that the Chinese scientist also tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering the viruses to make it look like they naturally arose from bats, reported Daily Mail.“I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why,” UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-spies-believe-wuhan-covid-lab-leak-theory-is-feasible-report-101622374947571.html

Surjit Singh, a 64-year-old Indian immigrant, was sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter after a fatal vehicle accident in Yuma, Arizona.Last year, Singh was stripped of his turban when he entered Yuma county jail and had his beard forcibly shaved by corrections officers after he was transferred to Alhambra Reception Center, operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry (ADCRR), the advocacy groups have alleged. Singh believes, in accordance with his Sikh faith, that he must wear a turban and refrain from cutting any of his hair, including facial hair, according to the complaint.Calling it an “egregious incident”, the advocacy groups said that the incident caused Singh “deep shame and mental trauma, including severe depression” as he had never cut, shaved, trimmed, or otherwise removed his hair. The complaint also alleged continued harassment of the Sikh immigrant over his religious practices, claiming that prison staff at the Douglas facility tried to shave his facial hair a second time because it had grown out beyond the one inch allowed by the ADCRR policy.There are around 26 million Sikhs worldwide, of which more than 500,000 reside in the US. As per the Sikh code of conduct, called the Rehat Maryada, Sikh men are required to wear external articles of faith, and the most commonly maintained article is unshorn hair (kesh) covered by a turban. However, the ADCRR requires prisoners to shave any facial hair before having their photo taken during the intake process to facilitate a clean picture for the ‘Mug Photo Interface Subsystem’.“Mr. Singh’s faith requires him to maintain unshorn facial hair, and the ADCRR’s arbitrary policies should not violate his or anyone else’s religious rights in Arizona,” Cindy Nesbit, Sikh Coalition senior staff attorney, said in a statement.The complaint has been jointly filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arizona, the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief (PFRB), the ACLU National Prison Project (NPP), the Sikh Coalition, and WilmerHale LLP, an international law firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-immigrant-forced-to-shave-beard-in-us-prison-advocacy-groups-demand-probe-101622370929497.html

Famous stir-fried Chinese dishes like fish-flavoured shredded pork and Gong Bao (Kung Bao) chicken are both on the menu,” the Xinhua report said.Separately, the CMSEO announced that the three astronauts who will take the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft to the space station’s core cabin in June were undergoing quarantine ahead of their departure.“The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-12 mission, who were selected from China’s first and second batch of astronauts, will stay in space for three months, during which they will conduct tasks including repair and maintenance, appliance switch and scientific operation of payloads,” Yang Liwei, CMSEO director and China’s first astronaut told state broadcaster, CCTV.Following five launch missions this year, China plans to have six more missions, including the launch of the Wentian and Mengtian lab modules, two cargo spacecraft and two crewed spaceships, by 2022, to complete the construction of the space station.“Since 2003, China has sent six astronauts into space including astronaut Zhai Zhigang who carried out China’s first outer space walk in September 2008,” the report said.Once completed, the Tiangong is set to be a rival to the International Space Station from which China is excluded.The ISS comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tianzhou-2-reaches-space-station-module-carrying-supplies-101622367219998.html

Some like the United Arab Emirates have sought to normalise ties after Assad regained control of most of the country."So far we see nothing on the horizon for a political solution acceptable to the Syrian people... the (regime's)approach and conduct has not changed," Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told UK-based Al Araby television in an interview aired on Friday."There is no motivation for us to re-establish ties with the Syrian regime at this time," Sheikh Mohammed said. "The Syrian regime is committing crimes against its people."Syria's government said that Wednesday's election shows the country is functioning normally despite the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced 11 million.Gulf Arab states downgraded or shut missions in Damascus in 2012 over attacks by the government on protests at the start of the conflict.The UAE re-opened its mission to Damascus in late 2018 in a bid to counter the influence of non-Arab actors like Iran, which along with Russia backs Assad, and Turkey, which backs rebels.The UAE has a charge d'affaires in Syria.

The record of 10 hours and 56 minutes is held by a Sherpa guide, Lakpa Gelu.A climbing accident on Everest in 2019, when Muir hurt his ankle falling off a ladder, did not deter him from attempting to scale the peak again. He began mountaineering late in life, and said he was scared and anxious during his latest adventure.“You realize how big a mountain it is, how dangerous it is, how many things that could go wrong. Yeah, it makes you nervous, it makes you know some anxiety there and maybe little bit of scared," Muir told reporters in Kathmandu.“I was just surprised when I actually got to there (the summit) but I was too tired to stand up, and in my summit pictures I am sitting down," he said.Also Read | First blind Chinese mountaineer climbs Mount EverestMuir began mountaineering at age 68 with trips to South America and Alaska before attempting Everest in 2019, when he fell off the ladder.Climbing was closed last year due to the pandemic.Married and a father of three, Muir has six grandchildren. The last one — a boy — was born while he was still in the mountains during his current expedition.Tsang made only two stops between the base camp, located at 5,300 meters (17,390 feet), to the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit to change, and covered the near vertical distance in 25 hours and 50 minutes.She was lucky because there were barely any climbers on the way to the highest camp at South Col. After that, on her way to the summit, she met only climbers making their descent, which did not slow her speed climb.There are only a few days of good weather left on the mountain this year, when hundreds of climbers line up to the summit, many having to wait for a long time in the traffic jam on the highest trail.“I just feel kind of relief and happy because I am not looking for breaking a record," she said. “I feel relieved because I can prove my work to my friends, to my students."She made a previous attempt on May 11, but bad weather forced her to turn back from a point very close to the summit. She then returned last Sunday.“For the summit, it is not just not your ability, team work, I think luck is very important,” she said.An outbreak of the coronavirus among climbers and their guides at the Everest base camp has forced at least three teams to cancel their expeditions. But hundreds of others have pushed through attempting to scale the summit, at a time Nepal is in lockdown battling its worst surge in Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oldest-american-fastest-woman-on-everest-return-safely-101622364166151.html

Report reveals new timeline of infection||Three weeks before China admitted SARS-CoV-2 virus cases, the country might have its first case, Daily Mail reported quoting new findings. These findings are based on an interview of Wuhan University biostatistics professor Yu Chuanhua, given to Chinese medical journal, Health Times. In the interview, the professor talked about one suspected fatality of a patient who fell ill in September 2019 and eventually died.Who is Patient Su?According to Daily Mail, there is a record of a case under the name of Patient Su who was treated at Rongjun Hospital in Wuhan. The patient did not undergo nucleic testing. The data has not been confirmed, the professor said. Going by the building and the street number as found in hospital records, it is believed that the woman lived somewhere n the Kaile Guiyan community on Zhuodaoquan Street, very close to where several bat-related research was taking place. "These include a laboratory run by China’s Centre for Disease Control with the second-highest global levels of biosecurity little more than one mile away, while downtown sites run by Wuhan Institute of Virology are less than three miles away," Daily Mail said.Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsPatient Su's location was also close to a high-speed rail line, which might have played a crucial role in spreading the infection.The screenshots of the details were by mistake published by the medical journal.Yu, according to the report, called up the journalist within two days to retract this information and claimed that the dates had been entered incorrectly and all the other suspected cases before December 8 needed verification.Covid timelineOn December 31, China informed the World Health Organization about a Vitus outbreak in Wuhan. Between December 8 and January 2, 41 people had fallen ill, according to China's official account.A Us intelligence report has recently found that several researchers at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill in November 2019.

A survey by management-side law firm Fisher Phillips earlier this year found that only 9% of the more than 700 employers surveyed said they were considering mandating vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-workers-sue-texas-hospital-over-compulsory-vaccinations-report-101622345462110.html

Sixteen of them had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, while 12 had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.People who had received two doses of Pfizer saw a three-fold reduction in their antibodies against the Indian variant, B.1.617, according to the study, but were still protected."The situation was different with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which induced particularly low levels of antibodies neutralising" the Indian variant, the study said.Patients who had had Covid-19 within the past year and people vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer retained enough antibodies to be protected against the Indian variant, but three to six times less antibodies than against the UK variant, Schwartz said.The study shows that "this variant.. has acquired partial resistance to antibodies," Schwartz said.Since first emerging in late 2019 in China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 has developed several variants, usually named for the places where it first appeared including the so-called South Africa and UK strains.The variant first detected in India appears to be much more transmissible than earlier variations.It has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, according to a World Health Organization report.To try to curb its spread, France and Germany have re-introduced tighter rules on arrivals from affected countries, including the United Kingdom.bc/yad/bpPFIZERASTRAZENECA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-less-effective-but-protects-against-variant-found-in-india-study-101622341779802.html
30-05-2021||World||In Covid aftermath, scientists are concerned about biolab leaks. Here's why||The theory that Covid-19 might be the result of scientific experiments has thrown a spotlight on the work of the world's most secure biolabs.While the evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China is strictly circumstantial, a number of experts want tougher controls on such facilities over fears that accidental leaks could touch off the next pandemic.Here's what you should know.59 TOP FACILITIESThe Wuhan lab belongs to the most secure class, commonly referred to as biosafety level 4, or BSL4.These are built to work safely and securely with the most dangerous bacteria and viruses that can cause serious diseases for which there are no known treatment or vaccines."There are HVAC filtration systems, so that the virus can't escape through exhaust; any waste water that leaves the facility is treated with either chemicals or high temperatures to make sure that there's nothing alive," Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, told AFP.The researchers themselves are highly trained and wear hazmat suits.There are 59 such facilities across the world, according to a report Koblentz co-authored that was released this week."There are no binding international standards for safe, secure, and responsible work on pathogens," the report, called Mapping Maximum Biological Containment Labs Globally, said.ACCIDENTS DO HAPPENAccidents can happen, sometimes at the top tier facilities, and much more frequently at lower rung labs of which there are thousands.Human H1N1 virus -- the same flu that caused the 1918 pandemic -- leaked in 1977 in the Soviet Union and China and spread worldwide.In 2001, a mentally disturbed employee at a US biolab mailed out anthrax spores across the country, killing five people.Two Chinese researchers exposed to SARS in 2004 spread the disease to others, killing one.In 2014, a handful of smallpox vials were uncovered during an Food and Drug Administration office move.Lynn Klotz, a senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the public safety threats posed by such facilities."Human errors constitute over 70 percent of the errors in laboratories," he told AFP, adding that US researchers have to rely on data from Freedom of Information requests to learn of these incidents.GAIN OF FUNCTION CONTROVERSYThere is disagreement between the US government, which funded bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, and some independent scientists, about whether this work was controversial "gain of function" (GOF) research.GOF research entails modifying pathogens to make them more transmissible, deadlier, or better able to evade treatment and vaccines -- all to learn how to fight them better.This field has long been contentious. Debate reached a fever pitch when two research teams in 2011 showed they could make bird flu transmissible between mammals.Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told AFP he was concerned "that it would create a strain of virus that if it infected a laboratory worker could not just kill that laboratory worker... but also cause a pandemic.""The research is not required and does not contribute to the development of drugs or vaccines," added molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, one of the staunchest opponents of this kind of research.In 2014 the US government announced a pause in federal funding for such work, which gave way in 2017 to a framework that would consider each application on a case-by-case basis.But the process has been criticized as lacking transparency and credibility.As late as last year, a nonprofit received funding from the US on research to "predict spillover potential" of bat coronavirus to humans in Wuhan.Questioned by Congress this week, Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health denied this amounted to gain of function research, but Ebright said it clearly does.THE PATH AHEADNone of this means that Covid-19 definitely leaked from a lab -- in fact there is no hard scientific evidence in favor of natural origin or lab accident scenario, said Ebright.But there are certain lines of circumstantial evidence in favor of the latter. For instance, Wuhan is around 1,000 miles north of bat caves that harbor the ancestor virus, well out of the animals' flight range.Scientists from Wuhan were however known to be carrying out routine trips to those caves to take samples.Alina Chan, a molecular biologist from the Broad Institute, said there were no signs of risky pathogen research dying down in the wake of the pandemic -- in fact "it's possibly expanded."Last year, Chan published research showing that, unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 was not evolving fast when it was first detected in humans -- another piece of circumstantial evidence that could point to lab origin.Chan considers herself a "fence-sitter" on the competing hypotheses, but does not favor banning risky research, fearing it would then go underground.One solution "might just be as simple as moving these research institutes out into extremely remote areas...where you have to quarantine for two weeks before we re-enter in human society," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-covid-aftermath-scientists-are-concerned-about-biolab-leaks-here-s-why-101622338361938.html

Belarusian authorities scrambled a fighter jet and flagged what turned out to be a false bomb alert to force the plane to land, then detained Roman Protasevich, a journalist who was on board.Psaki said the US, with the EU and other allies, was preparing a list of targeted sanctions against key members of Lukashenko’s government “associated with abuses of human rights and corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election, and the events of May 23”.The White House also issued a “Do Not Travel” warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American passenger planes to “exercise caution” if considering flying over Belarusian airspace.The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aims-targeted-sanctions-at-belarus-after-journalist-held-101622335377391.html

No end in sight. We removed all the plastic yesterday, only to see more of it dumped by the waves overnight," he said.The pellets and waste were packed into green and white polythene sacks and taken away by trucks.An officer leading another team said that in certain parts of the beach the microplastics and charred debris was 60 centimetres (two feet) deep.Local fisherman Peter Fernando, 68, said he had never seen such destruction.The December 2004 Asian tsunami devastated much of the island's coastline and killed an estimated 31,000 people, but only damaged coastal infrastructure.Roman Catholic priest Sujeewa Athukorale said most of his parishioners were fishermen who risked becoming destitute."Their immediate need is to be allowed to go back to the sea," he said."There are 4,500 fishing families in my parish alone."- Mangroves threatened -Fisherman Lakshan Fernando, 30, said people feared the plastic waste could destroy mangroves as well as the corals where fish breed in the shallow water."No one is able to say how long we will have the adverse effects of this pollution," Fernando told AFP."It could take a few years or a few decades, but in the meantime what about our livelihoods?"An oil leak from the vessel, said to be carrying 278 tonnes of bunker oil and 50 tonnes of gasoil, would increase the risk of devastation.Much of the ship's cargo, including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, lubricants and other chemicals, appeared to have been destroyed in the fire, officials said.The X-Press Pearl caught fire as it waited to enter Colombo harbour and remains anchored just outside the port.An international salvage operation is led by the Dutch company SMIT, which has sent specialist fire-fighting tugs. India has sent coastguard vessels to help Sri Lanka's navy.SMIT was also involved in dousing a burning oil tanker off Sri Lanka's east coast last September after an engine room explosion killed a crew member.The fire on the New Diamond took more than a week to put out and left a 40-kilometre (25-mile) long oil spill. Sri Lanka has demanded the owners pay $17 million for the clean-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ship-burns-as-lanka-facing-worst-beach-pollution-in-its-history-101622333859829.html

Police said eight of the 10 were shot dead. Earlier in the day, Colombian President Iván Duque announced the deployment of military forces to the city of Cali to quell the protests.“This deployment will almost triple our capacity throughout the province in less than 24 hours, ensuring assistance in nerve centres where we have seen acts of vandalism, violence and low-intensity urban terrorism,” said the president, speaking from Cali.Juliette de Rivero, representative in Colombia of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called for an end to violence, also citing cases of “civilians shooting” in Cali.Protests were held in other parts as well as the country marked a month since the start of the largest protests in the country decades. The protests erupted when Duque proposed a wide-ranging tax increase, but continued even after he backed off, transformed into a general outcry against growing poverty and inequality in a country where the unemployment rate doubled over the past year of pandemic.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Colombia’s vice-president Marta Lucia Ramirez in Washington on Friday.Blinken “expressed his concern and condolences for the loss of life during recent protests in Colombia and reiterated the unquestionable right of citizens to protest peacefully”, according to spokesman Ned Price.Colombia’s finance ministry estimates protests and roadblocks have cost the country $2.68 billion, with the roadblocks leading to shortages of food and other supplies, boosting prices, and disrupting operations in the country’s main seaport as well as for hundreds of companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-killed-in-colombia-anti-govt-protests-101622323868264.html

In one more photos, he is seen showing bruises on his arm. It is not clear if Antigua Newsroom took the photos or these were accessed via Mehul Choksi’s legal team. To be sure, Choksi’s lawyers have alleged the businessman was abducted from Antigua, whose citizenship he holds, taken to Dominica where he was arrested to facilitate his repatriation to India.First pictures emerge of Mehul Choksi behind bars pic.twitter.com/UvelfTXKx8Choksi faces multiple charges of embezzling funds from the state-owned Punjab National Bank in India; the fraud is worth some ₹13,500-crore. He had acquired citizenship of Antigua under its Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017, weeks before investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation started.Also Read: Choksi’s 1st photo in 3 yrs emerges as next stop bursts a controversy in AntiguaChoksi’s legal team promptly filed a habeas corpus plea in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court that has barred authorities from removing him from the country until further orders. The court will take up the case on June 2. Choksi was released from police custody on Friday following the court order and has been moved to a quarantine facilityIn the only official statement that had emerged from Dominica’s capital Roseau before the court’s interim ruling, the authorities had made it clear that they were checking Choksi’s citizenship papers and were likely to send him back to Antigua 100 nautical miles away. The statement was interpreted to end speculation that Dominica could deport Choksi to India, prompted in part due to Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne’s statement that he didn’t want Choksi back.Also read: Antiguan oppn party hits out at PM Browne, seeks to treat Choksi as citizen“We asked them (Dominica) not to repatriate him to Antigua. He needs to return to India where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him”, Browne told journalists soon after Mehul Choksi turned up on the Dominican coast.That remark also exposed PM Browne to sharp attacks from the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP), which, according to reports in Antigua Newsroom, insisted that since Choksi was an Antiguan citizen, he was entitled to due process and should be treated according to the rule of law.Browne hit back at the UPP. “After mischievously accusing my administration of harbouring Mehul Choksi, who has an Interpol Red Notice, they are now seeking to sanitise this fugitive to get campaign funding...There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship.”Referring to Browne’s statement, the UPP said: “The statement is both irresponsible and frightening. It is not for the prime minister to decide who is entitled to the protection of the constitution.” Choksi’s lawyers have said that their client enjoys legal protection as a citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-image-of-fugitive-mehul-choksi-in-custody-of-dominica-police-released-101622312519295.html
