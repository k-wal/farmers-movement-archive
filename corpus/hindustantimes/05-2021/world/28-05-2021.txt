Biden’s central goal is instead societal change -- attempting to reverse decades of widening income and wealth gaps that often fall along racial lines.The budget comes at the tail-end of the Covid-19 recession, which exacerbated these divides and erased years of gains made by American workers.The administration forecasts no major change in the trend rate for GDP in the coming decade, with the expansion seen averaging about 2% over the coming decade. That’s in line with the average over the 15 years through 2019, before the pandemic struck.The proposed 2022 budget request includes funding for early childcare and colleges, investing in minority-owned businesses and grants to improve public transportation in poor communities.“Where we choose to invest speaks to what we value as a nation,” Biden said in a statement released by the Office of Management and Budget. “It is a budget that reflects the fact that trickle-down economics has never worked.”The idea is that boosting the middle class and the poorest Americans will provide more stable, long-term growth.It’s an approach that contrasts sharply with the strategy of prior presidents including Ronald Reagan, whose administrations argued that tax cuts and deregulation would strengthen economic expansions -- something that George H.W. Bush derided as “voodoo economics.” President Donald Trump also promised to juice the economy, forecasting 3% annual growth.“Unlike past major investments, the plan also prioritizes addressing long-standing and persistent racial injustice and helps ensure rural, urban, and Tribal communities have a fair shot at prosperity,” the administration said in describing Biden’s infrastructure and jobs plan Friday.Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Friday that the economic forecasts were developed in early February, and don’t fully reflect the policies proposed in the budget. She said that the White House opted to release the budget, already later than its typical publication date, without further delay to incorporate recent data and progress battling the pandemic, and that she couldn’t currently quantify that full impact.Still, the steady-state forecast does include some of the impact of the $4 trillion in spending and tax credits in the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, Biden’s two-pronged long-term economic programs.‘Equitable’ Growth“The administration’s policies thus far are very much targeted at not just growing our way out of this -- because that’s always going to be just a part of the solution -- but making sure that that growth is equitable,” Jared Bernstein, a Biden economic adviser, said on Bloomberg TV May 11. Equity is mentioned almost 40 times in the budget document, double the references to growth.The White House sees the budget deficit shrinking from the historic pandemic highs, though remaining well above 4% in the outer years of the coming decade, with 4.7% seen for 2031. Inflation, as measured by consumer prices, is seen remaining contained after its pop this spring, with the pace never exceeding an annual 2.3% in the next 10 years.Biden’s budget plan, headlined with $6 trillion of requested spending for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, along with his longer-term proposals, faces major reshaping in Congress. But it serves as a gauge of White House priorities as negotiations proceed with lawmakers. To fund his spending plans, Biden has pitched tax increases on corporations and wealthy American households.While the tax system would be more progressive, it would not fully pay for the proposed spending plans over a decade, according to the budget proposal. The discrepancies will present a challenge for Congressional Democrats as many moderates want to scale back some of these tax proposals, as well, which means an even bigger funding gap.Biden’s Jobs plan would increase taxes on corporations by $2 trillion over the decade. The Families plan includes approximately $1.5 trillion in tax increases on high-earners roughly split from increased rates on income and capital gains, and from increased IRS enforcement and audits. The total spending on tax credits for low-income households, childcare spending and education investments total nearly $1.8 trillion.Biden’s economic team at the White House has been determined to make good on his campaign pledge to raise taxes on the rich, emboldened by the sharply divergent experiences of those at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic scale during the Covid-19 crisis.The top 1% of U.S. households experienced a $4 trillion increase in wealth last year, or 35% of total gains, while the poorest half in the country -- about 64 million people -- saw only 4% of the gains. Much of that accumulated to those investing in stocks and with a college education.“The president believes strongly that the biggest corporations and those folks who have done extremely well over the last several decades should pay a bit more,” Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the National Economic Council, said in a Bloomberg TV interview earlier this year. While “the wealthiest folks” did well even over the past year, one in seven American families reported going hungry during the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-budget-shows-focus-on-wealth-redistribution-not-growth-101622225159176.html
28-05-2021||World||US, Britain seek WHO look deep into Covid-19 origins in China||The United States and Britain are stepping up calls for the World Health Organization to take a deeper look into the possible origins of Covid-19, including a new visit to China where the first human infections were detected.WHO and Chinese experts issued a first report in March that laid out four hypotheses about how the pandemic emerged. The joint team said the most likely scenario was that the coronavirus jumped into people from bats via an intermediary animal, and the prospect that it erupted from a laboratory was deemed “extremely unlikely.”Late Thursday, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva issued a statement saying the first phase of the study was “insufficient and inconclusive,” and called for a “timely, transparent, evidence-based and expert-led Phase 2 study, including in the People’s Republic of China.”The statement — coming in the middle of the WHO's annual assembly in Geneva — demanded access for independent experts to “complete, original data and samples” relevant to the source of the virus and early stages of the outbreak.“We appreciate the WHO’s stated commitment to move forward with Phase 2 of the Covid-19 origins study, and look forward to an update from Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,” the statement said.Also Thursday, the British ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, said the first phase study was “always meant to be the beginning of the process, not the end.”“We call for a timely, transparent, evidence-based, and expert-led phase two study, including in the People’s Republic of China, as recommended by the experts’ report,” he said.At a press briefing on Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said the search for the origins of the coronavirus “has been poisoned by politics.”“Over the last number of days, we’ve seen more and more and more discourse in the media with terribly little actual news or evidence or new material,” Ryan said. “And this is quite disturbing.”He said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been clear that ”all hypotheses for the origin of the virus remain on the table” and pleaded for space so scientists could do their work.“If you expect scientists to collaborate and actually get the answers that you want ... we would ask that all this be done in a de-politicized environment, where science and health is the objective, and not blame and politics,” Ryan said.WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an e-mail that a technical team -- led by Peter Ben Embarek, who headed the WHO team in China that co-authored the first report -- was preparing “a proposal for the next studies that will need to be carried out.”Jasarevic said that proposal would be presented to Tedros “for his consideration,” but said there was no timetable for such a presentation.After the first report was released, the WHO chief acknowledged that further studies were needed on issues like early detection of cases and clusters, and the possible roles of animal markets, transmission through the food chain, and the lab-incident hypothesis, Jasarevic noted.The push in Geneva amounts to a new front of U.S. pressure a day after President Joe Biden said that he had instructed the U.S. intelligence community to “redouble their efforts” to get “information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion” on the virus' origins, and to report back in 90 days.Biden's administration wants to step up calls for China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to head off complaints from opposition Republican senators that the president has not been tough enough, as well as to use the opportunity to press China on alleged obstruction.Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have promoted the theory that the virus emerged from a laboratory accident rather than naturally through human contact with an infected animal in China.On Tuesday, a Chinese representative, who was not identified, told the WHO's assembly that China believed the “China part” of the origins-tracing study “has been completed.” According to an interpreter, he said China wanted a “global origin-tracing cooperation” — which suggested his government wants the hunt to be carried out elsewhere.On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian went further, suggesting that U.S. sites should be explored — reiterating Chinese-fanned speculation that the coronavirus could have erupted elsewhere. China has provided no evidence for such claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-britain-seek-who-look-deep-into-covid-19-origins-in-china-101622223168712.html
28-05-2021||World||US bans imports from Chinese fishing fleet over forced labor allegations||U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday imposed a new import ban on seafood from a Chinese fishing fleet that the agency says is using forced labor on its 32 vessels, including abuses against many Indonesian workers.CBP said it will immediately detain tuna, swordfish and other products from the Dalian Ocean Fishing Co Ltd at U.S. ports of entry. The "withhold release order" banning the imports also applies to other end use products containing seafood from the company, such as canned tuna and pet food, a CBP official said.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that the action marks the first time that CBP has banned imports from an entire fishing fleet, as opposed to individual vessels targeted in the past."DHS will continue to aggressively investigate the use of force labor by distant water fishing vessels, and by a wide range of other industries," Mayorkas told a news briefing. "Producers and U.S. importers alike should understand that there will be consequences for entities that attempt to exploit workers to sell goods in the United States."CBP officials said the agency's investigation revealed that many Indonesian workers hired onto Dalian Ocean Fishing vessels found conditions far different than what they expected and were subjected to physical violence, withholding of pay, debt bondage and abusive working and living conditions.Earlier this week, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai called attention to the issue of forced labor on fishing vessels, submitting a new proposal to the World Trade Organization to curb subsidies to illegal fishing and requiring that member countries recognize the problem.U.S. imports from Dalian Ocean Fishing are small, amounting to just $233,000 in the 2020 fiscal year, CBP said.But the issue of forced labor is a growing flashpoint in strained U.S.-China relations, after numerous recent import bans related to China's detention of Uyghur Muslims in the farwestern Xinjiang region. The move comes less than two days after Tai held an initial conversation with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.The Trump administration, during its last week in office in January, announced a sweeping import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they are produced with Uyghur forced labor - a far reaching move that would require apparel and textile industries to reorder their supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-imports-from-chinese-fishing-fleet-over-forced-labor-allegations-101622219701107.html
28-05-2021||World||UK cops stumble on Bitcoin mine while hunting for cannabis farm||When British police raided a warehouse, they were expecting to find a cannabis farm. Instead they found banks of computers illegally siphoning the electricity needed to mine for Bitcoin.Cops in West Midlands, England seized around 100 computer units that were working to bypass the local power grid. They discovered the warehouse after sending a drone over the site, which detected a considerable heat source.Mining for Bitcoin devours massive amounts of power, racking up huge bills for dedicated miners. The process, which needs computers to solve complex math problems to create new coins, now uses 66 times more electricity than in 2015, Citigroup Inc. said in a recent report. The Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge estimates it uses more electricity globally in a year than the Netherlands.“It’s certainly not what we were expecting,” Police Sergeant Jennifer Griffin, said in a statement Friday. “It had all the hallmarks of a cannabis cultivation set-up.”The police said they hadn’t yet made any arrests but believed thousands of pounds worth of power had been taken from the grid.“Mining for cryptocurrency is not itself illegal but clearly abstracting electricity from the mains supply to power it is,” Griffin said. It is just the second illegal mining operation the local force have discovered in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cops-stumble-on-bitcoin-mine-while-hunting-for-cannabis-farm-101622214007158.html
28-05-2021||World||With 8 new ones, 35 features on Moon now have Chinese names||At least eight features on the Moon near the landing area of the Chinese spacecraft Chang’e-5 were named after Chinese scientists and places earlier this month.The Paris-based International Astronomical Union (IAU) said that it had approved eight Chinese names for features on the Moon in the vicinity of Chang’e-5’s landing site.The total number of lunar features, which now have Chinese names is 35.The new names are Mons Hua, Mons Heng, Pei Xiu, Shen Kuo, Liu Hui, Song Yingxing, Statio Tianchun and Xu Guanqui. The names are of Chinese mathematicians, astronomers, cartographers, mountains, and a constellation.“Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed,” the IAU says.According to Chinese state media, lunar entities are named in four categories: deceased outstanding scientists, existing place names on Earth, Latin words that describe weather or other abstract concepts, and then the landing sites, which can be named however the team behind the mission wants.“China first got approval for the names of lunar locations in August, 2010. Three craters on the surface were named after Chinese scientists Cai Lun, who invented the technique of paper making; Bi Sheng, who invented movable-type printing; and Zhang Yuzhe, considered the father of modern Chinese astronomy,” CGTN, China’s state-run English channel, reported earlier.The Chang’e-5 spacecraft successfully landed on the near side of the Moon in December, 2020.China became the second country after the US in more than 50 years to plant its flag on the Moon following the landing of the spacecraft.Later that month, on December 17, the return capsule of China’s Chang’e-5 probe touched down on Earth, bringing back the country’s first samples collected from the moon, as well as the world’s freshest lunar samples in over 40 years, Chinese state media reported.Five Chinese names for lunar features were approved by the IAU in 2019 after the Chang’e-4 probe became the first spacecraft to land on the dark side of the Moon.The IAU, which announced the names, describes itself an international astronomical organisation that brings together more than 13,500 professional astronomers from more than 100 countries.“The IAU also serves as the internationally recognised authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies and the surface features on them,” it states on its website.Names successfully reviewed by a task group are submitted by the task group chair to the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN).After a successful review by the members of the WGPSN, names are considered approved as official IAU nomenclature, and can be used on maps and in publications.Approved names are then entered into the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, which is maintained by the US-based USGS Astrogeology Science Centre, and posted on its website, the IAU stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-8-new-ones-35-features-on-moon-now-have-chinese-names-101622213963302.html

It is already being used in the European Union for those aged 16 and older.The EMA said two doses were required in the 12-15 age group and should be administered with an interval of at least three weeks. It is now up to individual EU states to decide if and when to offer the vaccine to teenagers, it added.Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching "herd immunity" and taming the pandemic.However, giving vaccines to younger people in affluent countries while many parts of the world await doses for older and more vulnerable people has raised concerns.Pfizer and BioNTech in March unveiled trial data showing their vaccine offered 100% protection against the infectious disease in a trial with 2,260 adolescents aged 12 to 15. It was also well tolerated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-endorses-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-as-young-as-12-101622213083288.html

28-05-2021||World||Turkey President Erdogan inaugurates major new mosque in heart of Istanbul||President Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated an imposing new mosque in Istanbul on Friday, fulfilling a decades-old goal and stamping a religious identity on the landmark Taksim Square in the heart of Turkey's largest city.The Taksim mosque and its 30-metre high dome loom symbolically over a monument to the foundation of the Turkish republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, whose staunchly secular legacy has been eroded by nearly two decades of Erdogan's rule.After performing Friday prayers with thousands of worshippers, Erdogan said completion of the mosque marked the culmination of a dream for Turks, and that the call to prayer would be heard there "until the end of time".Erdogan told crowds outside the mosque that before building work started four years ago there was not even a prayer room at the site. "Worshippers were trying to pray here on top of newspapers, literally like a hen-house," he said.Construction of the mosque began in February 2017 in a project championed by Erdogan, a devout Muslim, and his Islamist-rooted AK Party, but which was beset for decades by court battles and public debate.Officials on Friday shared on Twitter a video showing Erdogan in 1994, the year he became Istanbul mayor, pointing from the top of a building towards the area where he said he would build the mosque, the exact spot where it now stands.It is one of many construction projects with which Erdogan has left his mark on Turkey, including a huge hilltop mosque overlooking the Asian side of Istanbul. Last year he reconverted into a mosque the city's Haghia Sophia, for centuries the world's largest church before being turned into a mosque and museum in turn.Supporters of the Taksim project argued there were not enough Muslim places of worship close to one of the city’s busiest hubs. Opponents saw it as a bid to impose a religious tone on the square, featuring a cultural centre dedicated to Ataturk which was demolished and is being rebuilt.The mosque complex, with two towering minarets, will be able to host as many as 4,000 worshippers and includes an exhibition hall, a library, car park and soup kitchen, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.Pro-government newspapers hailed the new mosque. Aksam's headline mocked critics who fear creeping religiosity: "It looks great. A mosque was built in Taksim and neither has sharia law come, nor has the republic collapsed," it said.The inauguration also coincides with the date when protests began just 100 metres away in Gezi Park, before growing into massive protests against Erdogan's government which spread across Turkey in June 2013.The Gezi protests began on May 28, 2013 after demolition work began in one corner of the park the previous evening, knocking down a wall and some trees, drawing a small group of protesters who camped out at the site.The anniversary of the protests is generally marked on May 31, when the protests escalated. In June of that year, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in demonstrations against a plan to build a replica Ottoman barracks on Gezi Park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-president-erdogan-inaugurates-major-new-mosque-in-heart-of-istanbul-101622208873472.html

They’re working on systems that would allow travelers to use mobile phone apps to prove they’ve been vaccinated, helping them avoid quarantine requirements at their destinations.Mayorkas says the underlying point is: “Everyone should get vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taking-very-close-look-at-vaccine-passports-for-travel-101622208882854.html
28-05-2021||World||Pak Hindu lawmaker wants religious minorities to be termed as 'non-Muslims'||A Hindu lawmaker in Pakistan has submitted a bill in the lower house of Parliament seeking that religious minorities in the country be constitutionally referred to as 'non-Muslims' to end the discrimination and establish equality and justice for every citizen.Keeso Mal Kheeal Das, a member of the National Assembly from the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, approached the National Assembly with a private member bill under rule 118 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.Called as the Constitution Amendment Act, 2021, the bill aims to end discrimination against Pakistani non-Muslims who have been also referred in the constitution as minorities.He suggested that the bill should be adopted and brought into effect immediately.The government has not opposed the bill so far and the matter has been referred to the relevant standing committee. After it is vetted by a bipartisan committee of the house, it will be presented for voting.Das is of the view that the inaccurate reference as minorities gives the impression of being second-class citizens.“It is against the spirit of the Constitution, 1973, to discriminate against a large number of population by declaring them a minority, when the sacrifices of that population are remarkable in every sphere of life for the prosperity, growth and bright future of the country,” Das said in the bill.“The word ‘Minority’ is used four times (in the constitution) while the word ‘non-Muslims’ is used 15 times, which reflects the intent of the makers of the Constitution. Therefore, the anomaly shall be omitted by substituting the word minority with the word non-Muslims,” he said.He said that the constitutional amendment will be a constructive effort to establish equality and justice for every citizen to build Pakistan as a home for everyone.Pakistan is a predominantly a Muslim country but non-Muslims make more than 3.5 per cent of its about 220 million population.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.Other minority communities include Christians, Ahmadis, Baha'is, Sikhs, Parsis and Buddhists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-hindu-lawmaker-wants-religious-minorities-to-termed-nonmuslims-101622206828298.html

The new category was created in 2019 as Japan increasingly relies on foreign workers to make up for its aging and declining workforce.The government also said two Myanmar diplomats in Tokyo who were dismissed by their country’s military junta for supporting the anti-coup movement can keep their diplomatic visas issued by the ousted government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Also Friday, the UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and discussed support for an effort by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to hold a dialogue of all stakeholders on stopping the violence in Myanmar.Burgener said she has been in consultation with all parties and ASEAN leaders and hopes to be able to give more details in two to three weeks.The Feb. 1 coup reversed years of progress toward democracy in Myanmar after five decades of harsh military rule. It was met with widespread popular opposition that the military has tried to silence through force, including killing protesters and imprisoning activists and journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-allow-myanmar-residents-to-extend-stay-as-emergency-measure-101622206455850.html

Here’s what happened||Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter managed to land safely on the Martian surface after a navigation timing error sent it on a wild sixth flight. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on Thursday said that approximately 54 seconds into the flight, a glitch occurred in the pipeline of the images that were being delivered by the navigational camera mounted on the experimental helicopter, resulting in unexpected motion. But the helicopter stopped oscillating in the final moments of the flight, levelled its attitude and touched down at the speed of design.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration shared a sequence of images, taken by the navigation camera aboard the Ingenuity Mars helicopter, that depicted the last 29 seconds of the rotorcraft’s sixth flight.Håvard Grip, the chief pilot of Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at JPL, later explained the in-flight anomaly. In a blog post, Grip said that during a flight, Ingenuity keeps track of its motion using an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU), which measures the helicopter’s accelerations and rotational rates. The helicopter’s position, velocity, and attitude are estimated by integrating the information gathered over time.Also Read | Nasa captures sound of chopper blades on MarsHowever, the navigation system doesn’t rely on the IMU alone since the errors would accumulate over time, and the helicopter would eventually lose its way. In order to maintain better accuracy, Ingenuity’s downward-looking navigation camera takes 30 pictures a second of the Martian surface and immediately feeds them into the helicopter’s navigation system.Every time the navigation system receives an image, it examines the timestamp to determine when the image was taken. The navigation algorithm then makes a prediction about what the camera should have been seeing at that particular point in time and at where those features actually appear in the image.“The navigation algorithm uses the difference between the predicted and actual locations of these features to correct its estimates of position, velocity, and attitude,” wrote Grip.Just keep flying 🚁#MarsHelicopter completed its 6th flight. Despite unexpected motion from an image processing issue, Ingenuity muscled through the final ~65 meters of its 215-meter journey, landed safely & is ready to fly again. The chief pilot explains https://t.co/533hn7qixk pic.twitter.com/IHkkjXaHDdThe glitch in the pipeline of images caused a single image to be lost, which resulted in all later navigation images being delivered with inaccurate timestamps. The navigation algorithm started performing a correction based on the navigation image and operated on the basis of incorrect information about when the image was taken.“The resulting inconsistencies significantly degraded the information used to fly the helicopter, leading to estimates being constantly ‘corrected’ to account for phantom errors. Large oscillations ensued,” the chief pilot added.Despite the anomaly, a built-in system to provide an extra margin for stability “came to the rescue” and Ingenuity landed safely on the surface within approximately 16 feet of the intended touch down location, said Grip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-survives-wild-flight-after-a-navigation-error-101622206211797.html
28-05-2021||World||China’s internet firms’ power consumption set to increase by 289% by 2035||China’s computer data centres and rapidly expanding 5G stations could use four times more electricity by 2035, putting Beijing’s carbon neutral goals under stress, a new report by environment group Greenpeace said on Friday.Electricity use by data centres and 5G base stations in China will grow by an estimated 289% between 2020 and 2035, the report said.The huge jump in power consumption would mean more carbon emissions as 61% of China’s electricity generation is from coal, the report added.According to Greenpeace data, the combined electricity consumption by data centres and 5G base stations in China stood at more than 200 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2020. If current trends continue, this is expected to rise to 782 billion kWh by 2035, the group said, which means the sector will be one of the fastest growing sources of climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions.This growth could be stopped if the Chinese government invests in clean energy.“Explosive growth in digital infrastructure does not need to mean growth in emissions. Technology companies have the potential to catalyse real emissions reductions via investment in distributed renewables projects and direct purchase of wind and solar energy, among other strategies,” Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Ye Ruiqi said.Only two major data centre operators - Chindata Group and AtHub - have pledged to source all energy from renewable sources by 2030.“But some of the industry’s biggest players, including Alibaba and GDS, have yet to issue 100% renewable energy or carbon neutrality commitments,” Ye said.This could depress China’s ambitious climate plans.Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to bring the country’s climate-warming emissions to a peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, committing the country to an accelerated transition to renewable energy.The report, however, said that carbon emissions from China’s internet industry are projected to continue to rise through 2035, long after its targeted 2030 national emissions peak, creating complications for the country’s carbon neutrality commitments.“By 2035, emissions from digital infrastructure in China are forecast to reach 310 million tonnes, more than three times (southern Chinese province) Guangzhou’s total carbon emissions in 2019. By contrast, sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metal, and cement are expected to peak emissions around 2025,” the report added.The 5G sector too is one of the fastest growing sources of internet sector emissions in China. “Power consumption from 5G in China is on track to skyrocket 488% by 2035, reaching 297 billion kWh by 2035, roughly equivalent to (southwestern China’s) Sichuan’s total electricity consumption in 2020.”“Internet companies in China must commit to achieve 100% renewable energy and carbon neutrality across the supply chain by 2030. At the same time, policymakers can help enable this transition by mandating the use of 100% renewable energy and providing financial incentives for companies to shift to wind and solar,” Ye said.“Digital technology should be a solution to the climate crisis, not a growing source of emissions,” Ye added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-internet-firms-power-consumption-set-to-increase-by-289-by-2035-101622204842292.html
28-05-2021||World||UK approves single shot Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine||Britain on Friday approved the use of the single shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced."This is a further boost to the UK's hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus," said Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The government hopes the single-dose jab "will play an important role in the months to come", he added, as young people come forward for their vaccinations amid concern over the rise of the so-called Indian variant.Britain has ordered 20 million doses of the vaccine.The European Medicines Agency said in April that a warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelet count should be added to its product information following cases in the United States.The vaccine was found to be 72 percent effective in preventing moderate to severe coronavirus infection, according to a US trial.Britain has administered more than 62 million shots so far, mainly using the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. It has also approved the use of the Moderna vaccine.After months of falling cases, infections have started to rise again due to the emergence of the Indian variant, which has put in doubt plans for a full reopening of the country on June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-approves-single-shot-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine-101622203331875.html

But in the country ravaged by the 10-year-old conflict, areas controlled by rebels or Kurdish-led troops did not hold the vote.At least 8 million, mostly displaced, live in those areas in northwest and northeast Syria. Over 5 million refugees — mostly living in neighbouring countries — have largely refrained from casting their ballots.US and European officials have also questioned the legitimacy of the election, saying it violates UN resolutions in place to resolve the conflict, lacks any international monitoring, and is unrepresentative of all Syrians.Also Read | Syria loses voting rights at global chemical watchdog for poison gas use in civil warSyria's parliament speaker, Hammoud Sabbagh, announced the final results from Wednesday's vote. He said Assad garnered 95.1 per cent of the votes. He said turnout stood at 78.6 per cent of the voters, in an election that lasted for 17 hours on Wednesday with no independent monitors.Assad was facing symbolic competition from two candidates— a former minister and a former opposition figure.Assad's victory comes as the country is still devastated by the conflict. Fighting has subsided but the war is not over. An economic crisis is getting worse in a country where over 80% of the population lives below the poverty line and the local currency is in a free fall.Assad, close associates and government officials are facing widening Western sanctions, added to already existing ones that have escalated as the war unfolded. European and US governments blame Assad and his aides most of the war's atrocities.Damascus erupted in celebrations, with gunfire and fireworks lighting the night sky.Thousands gathered in major squares in Damascus, and the coastal city of Tartus, dancing while waving flags and pictures of Assad. They chanted: “With our soul, blood, we defend you Bashar,” and “We only choose three: God, Syria and Bashar.”A large stage was set in the capital's Omayyad Square, with speakers blaring national songs. One singer appeared on a stage set up in a Tartus square, dressed in the flag of Syria. Almost no one was wearing a face mask, though Syria is facing a surge of coronavirus cases.The election is likely to offer little change to conditions in Syria. While Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran, may be seeking a new seal of legitimacy for the president in office since 2000, his re-election is likely to deepen the rift with the West, driving him closer to Russian and Iranian backers as well as China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrias-bashar-al-assad-wins-a-fourth-term-in-a-predictable-landslide-101622192264608.html

According to local media reports, the Honduran woman was trying to jump the border fence between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. While she managed to scale up the 18-foot high wall, she was unable to climb down.The US customs and border protection (CBP), the agency in charge of securing American borders and facilitating lawful international and trade, said that the woman was taken to University Medical Center for a medical evaluation and was found in good health, per reports. She was immediately processed and expelled the same day to Mexico under Title 42, which refers to the use of a section of US public health law to prohibit people from entering the country who potentially pose a health risk.A video of the rescue effort surfaced online in which the CBP can be seen helping her down the border fence.A pregnant woman got stuck while trying to jump the border fence between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.

The implementation allowed the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prohibit those from entering the US when the director believes that “there is serious danger of the introduction of [a communicable] disease into the United States.”The then-CDC director, Robert R Redfield, was quick to rely on the regulation and issued an order suspending the “introduction” of certain individuals who have been in “Coronavirus Impacted Areas.” The use of Title 42 to expel asylum seekers to their country of last transit has been controversial.Immigration Impact, a project of the American Immigration Council, recently carried an article titled ‘It’s Time to End Title 42’, written by Rebekah Wolf, criticising the use of Trump-era policy to restrict asylum seekers from accessing the US immigration system. Wolf accused the Trump administration of misusing an outdated public health law to “‘trump’ the United States’ own laws designed to protect asylum seekers.”“With the country’s evolving knowledge of how Covid-19 is spread, no legitimate public health justification for its continuation, and the wide range of alternatives to detention that are available, Title 42 should be ended immediately,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-woman-gets-stuck-on-18-foot-high-wall-while-trying-to-enter-us-rescued-101622198337688.html
28-05-2021||World||'Political game': China on US Prez Biden's order to probe into Covid-19 origins||In a sharp rebuke to the United States, China has lamented US President Joe Biden's order to review the origins of Covid-19 as a "political game and an attempt to shift the blame on others"."Virus origins is a complex scientific question. This time, the United States is trying to let intelligence services draw scientific conclusions. This only shows that the US is not interested in the truth, it does not want any scientific research, this is just a political game, an attempt to shift the blame on others," Chinese spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a briefing on Friday.US President Biden on Wednesday said he has asked the US intelligence community to "redouble their efforts" to come to a conclusion on the origins of Covid-19 and report back to him within 90 days, Sputnik reported.This comes amid growing calls for a fuller probe on whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from a Wuhan lab.In response, the Chinese Embassy in the US issued a statement on Thursday. Without naming any country, a spokesperson said "some people have played the old trick of political hype on the origin tracing of Covid-19 in the world"."Since the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, some political forces have been fixated on political manipulation and blame game," the statement said.A few days back, an explosive report by Wall Street Journal had stated that three researchers from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology sought hospital care after they fell ill in November 2019, a month before Beijing reported the first patient with Covid-like symptoms."The US government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses," the report read, fueling debate of the lab leak theory.Meanwhile, addressing the World Health Organization's main annual meeting of member states, the United States and other countries called on Tuesday for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive.Australia, Japan and Portugal were among other countries to call for more progress on the investigation, while the British representative urged for any probe to be "timely, expert-driven and grounded in robust science".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-game-china-on-us-prez-biden-s-order-to-probe-into-covid-19-origins-101622195785635.html

This nearly-10-month genocidal campaign left two-three million people dead, 200,000-400,000 women raped and more than 10 million people displaced -- a majority of whom were Hindus, the HAF said in a statement."Your website i.e https://www.hinduamerican.org/1971-bangladesh-genocide is involved in dissemination of content with intent to ridicule, defame the Armed Forces of Pakistan in order to provoke anti-state sentiments, cause disharmony, feelings of enmity among masses at large, which is prejudicial to the integrity, sovereignty and security of Pakistan," said the communication from Pakistan.The HAF has refused to take down the site."The government of Pakistan's feeble attempt to threaten and intimidate a respected American non-profit organisation is just the latest example of its anti-American, anti-Hindu acts," stated Deepali Kulkarni, HAF director of human rights."The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has a proven track record of killing, forcibly converting or driving out Hindus, Christians, Ahmaddiya Muslims and other religious minorities in Pakistan, and now it appears that it is going after these same religious minorities in other countries, too," Kulkarni said.The HAF said its website has been blocked for viewers in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-threatens-hindu-american-body-for-exposing-1971-genocide-in-bangladesh-101622192580509.html
28-05-2021||World||India's 'terrible' Covid-19 surge severely impacted global vaccine supply: Covax||The “terrible" surge of the coronavirus cases in India has severely impacted Covax’s vaccine supply in the second quarter of this year to the extent that there will be a shortfall of 190 million doses by the end of June, according to a joint statement by the WHO, UNICEF, GAVI and CEPI.The joint statement was issued on Thursday by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) CEO Dr Richard Hatchett, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance CEO Dr Seth Berkley, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore.“Countries that are advanced in their vaccination programmes are seeing cases of Covid-19 decline, hospitalisations decrease and early signs of some kind of normality resume. However, the global picture is far more concerning,” the statement said.Giving a call to action to equip Covax to deliver 2 billion doses in 2021, the statement said, “we are seeing the traumatic effects of the terrible surge of Covid-19 in South Asia – a surge which has also severely impacted global vaccine supplies.”It added that Covax has proven it works as the global mechanism for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, having delivered over 70 million doses to 126 countries and economies around the world since February – from remote islands to conflict settings – managing the largest and most complex rollout of vaccines in history. Over 35 countries received their first Covid-19 vaccine doses thanks to Covax.“However, the terrible surge of the virus in India has had a severe impact on Covax’s supply in the second quarter of this year, to the point where, by the end of June we will face a shortfall of 190 million doses,” the joint statement said.It said even though Covax will have larger volumes available later in the year through the deals it has already secured with several manufacturers, it warned that “if we do not address the current, urgent shortfall, the consequences could be catastrophic.”It said the pandemic has just taken a frightening new turn, as a deadly surge of cases rages across South Asia and other hotspots.The global agencies called on nations to share doses “now”, saying the United States and Europe have collectively pledged to share 180 million doses.“But we still need more, we need them to go through Covax, and we need them to start moving in early June. At least one billion doses could be shared by wealthy countries in 2021.“Covax’s need for doses is greatest right now. Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon, should swap their places in supply queues with Covax so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible,” it said.The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, is the key supplier of AstraZeneca doses to Covax.According to the agreement between GAVI and SII, which included funding to support an increase in manufacturing capacity, SII is contracted to provide Covax with the SII-licensed and manufactured AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (known as Covishield) to 64 lower-income economies participating in the Gavi Covax AMC (including India), alongside its commitments to the Government of India.However, supply of vaccines from SII to Covax has been impacted as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic ravages India.Last week, Ghebreyesus had said that once the devastating outbreak in India recedes, “we also need the Serum Institute of India to get back on track and catch up on its delivery commitments to Covax.”UNICEF had also noted with concern that the devastating surge in coronavirus cases in India has impacted vaccine supplies to the Covax facility.“Among the global consequences of the situation in India, a global hub for vaccine production, is a severe reduction in vaccines available to Covax. Soaring domestic demand has meant that 140 million doses intended for distribution to low-and-middle-income countries through the end of May cannot be accessed by Covax. Another 50 million doses are likely to be missed in June,” Fore had said in a statement last week.A note to editors in the UNICEF statement had said that “shortfall numbers are based on delays related to shipments from the Serum Institute of India (SII) only.” Other delays related to the original Covax delivery schedule are expected to be made up by the end of June. “There is currently no timetable to resolve SII-related delays”, the note said.The Covax facility is slated to deliver its 65 millionth dose in the coming days when it should have been at least its 170 millionth.Covaxis the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking at a virtual event by the Ikea Foundation, Purpose and the UN, expressed concern that the “recent surges in South Asia and elsewhere show that Covid-19 is still very much with us.“More than 80,000 people died in the past week alone. We are in a war against this virus. To achieve victory, we need to put our economies and societies on a war footing. We need a true global vaccination plan,” he said.He encouraged all companies, particularly those with global representation, to look beyond headquarters and focus on the most vulnerable countries and communities, from South Asia to sub-Saharan Africa.According to Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker, more than 168,769,000 confirmed cases have been reported from across the world while the deadly disease has claimed the lives of over 3,507,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-terrible-covid-19-surge-severely-impacted-supply-covax-statement-101622191986447.html
28-05-2021||World||South Africa starts vaccination for elderly as Covid-19 surge looms||Spry and gray-haired, many dressed in their Sunday best or colorful African prints — and all sporting masks — dozens of South Africans aged 60 and over gathered at a government health clinic outside Johannesburg to get their Covid-19 shots.Some looked at vaccine notifications on their mobile phones, others clutched pieces of paper, as the line moved along at a good pace. Eight at a time, they were ushered into a tent where they took seats distanced from each other.“You are about to receive a vaccine to protect against Covid-19. It is the Pfizer vaccine and it requires two doses,” said a nurse, speaking the Zulu language to the group at the Orange Farm township clinic, about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of Johannesburg. She described what they should do about possible side effects.“Amen,” she said in closing, and the vaccine recipients murmured the same response, as if in church.South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the Southern Hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent's Covid-19 deaths.Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million health care workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks nearly 200,000 have received the Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose.“I am getting the vaccine because I want to be alive,” 76-year-old Elizabeth Mokwena said. “I know it's the best thing for me to do against this Covid.”After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa's new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on May 12 to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period.The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June.The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of re-imposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that liquor can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings.South Africa has by far the heaviest burden of the disease in Africa. With more than 1.6 million confirmed cases, including 55,976 deaths, the country has more than 30% of the cases and 40% of the deaths recorded by all of Africa's 54 countries, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The continent of 1.3 billion people has reported 4.7 million cases, including 129,000 deaths, according to the Africa CDC.South Africa has set a goal of vaccinating 5 million seniors by the end of June, so the new campaign's slow start must quickly ramp up speed.“We're under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told The Associated Press.“New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day," he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.”South Africa's overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. To achieve that it has purchased 30 million Pfizer doses, of which 1.3 million have been delivered so far and 4.5 million are expected by the end of June.The country has also ordered 31 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which have not yet arrived. An initial delivery of 500,000 doses was used to vaccinate health care workers.Both the J&J and Pfizer vaccines are effective against the Covid-19 variant dominant in South Africa, according to studies. Earlier this year South Africa received 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the United Nations-backed COVAX initiative but scrapped their use because a preliminary, small study showed it did not give effective protection against the variant.“It was a good move for South Africa to purchase the Pfizer and J&J vaccines on its own,” said Moshabela, who is also acting deputy vice chancellor for research and innovation at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. “Many other African countries are now stuck because COVAX deliveries of the (AstraZeneca) vaccines from India have been delayed.”“We are off to a slow start, but it will speed up and we will have an adequate supply of vaccines. It’s a good thing we purchased those directly,” he said.The rest of Africa's reliance on COVAX for supplies of AstraZeneca vaccine has led to problems now that India, beset by a deadly surge, has halted exports of the shots until it vaccinates an adequate amount of its 1.4 billion people.The World Health Organization announced Thursday that Africa needs at least 20 million AstraZeneca doses in the next six weeks to give second shots to all those who have received a first dose.In addition, another 200 million doses of approved vaccines are needed to enable the continent to vaccinate 10% of its population by September, WHO said.So far just 28 million doses of vaccines have been administered in Africa, representing less than 2% of the continent's population. Globally, 1.5 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered.“Africa needs vaccines now. Any pause in our vaccination campaigns will lead to lost lives and lost hope,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said Thursday.“It’s too soon to tell if Africa is on the cusp of a third wave. However, we know that cases are rising, and the clock is ticking so we urgently appeal to countries that have vaccinated their high-risk groups to speed up the dose-sharing to fully protect the most vulnerable people.”At the Orange Farm clinic in South Africa, where nearly 200 people were vaccinated daily this week, Freedman Zikhali said he was pleased to have gotten his first dose.“Getting this vaccine was the right thing to do," the 76-year-old said in the Zulu language.“I’d ask myself while watching TV, ‘Why haven’t I received the vaccine while other people around the world are being vaccinated?' So I think what I have done here is the right thing to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-starts-vaccination-for-elderly-as-covid-19-surge-looms-101622192432569.html

"We've seen overseas how difficult that movement can be to control," he said.Expressing concern over how fast the virus was spreading, Merlino said the time between people catching the virus and passing it on was "tighter than ever".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-s-victoria-enters-7-day-lockdown-101622191570556.html

China and Russia were among those voting in favour."The Human Rights Council this afternoon adopted a resolution on ensuring respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel," the UN body said in a statement.It said the international commission of inquiry has been established to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights during the recent conflict.The special session of the Council was called to discuss the “grave human rights situation" in the Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem.India's permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Indra Mani Pandey said at the special session that New Delhi welcomes the diplomatic efforts of the international community and regional countries that have resulted in bringing ceasefire between Israel and armed groups in Gaza."India calls on all parties to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that aggravate tensions and refrain from any further attempts to unilaterally change the existing status-quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods," he said.In a statement, Pandey also expressed concern at the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif and other Palestinian territories."We remain concerned about the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif/Temple Mount and other Palestinian territories, and about the possible eviction process in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem," he said.Pandey said the indiscriminate rocket firings from Gaza targeting the civilian population in Israel, and the retaliatory airstrikes into Gaza have caused immense sufferings."We deeply mourn the loss of civilian lives resulting from the violence, and urge the international community's immediate attention to providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza," he said."India continues to provide developmental and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian Authority, including COVID-19 related assistance, bilaterally, and through our dedicated contribution to the UN," he added.Both Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire that has come into effect on last Friday after 11 days of intense fighting in which around 230 people were killed in Gaza and 12 in Israel.Pandey said India was firmly convinced that dialogue remains the only viable option that can effectively address the issues confronting the region and its people."Recent developments have once again underscored the need for immediate resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine, aimed at realising the establishment of two States living side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-abstains-from-voting-on-unhrc-resolution-to-probe-alleged-violations-and-crimes-in-gaza-conflict-101622188844626.html

Coming back from this event, I did not do enough to follow that advice and I’m sorry,” Jagmeet said.“I will do better to keep my family, our community and all Canadians safe. We cannot let our guard down if we want to beat this virus, and I’m committed to continue to do my best until we’re on the other side of this,” he added.The event Jagmeet referred to was a drive-in iftar event in the town of Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA.

He is currently serving a separate 14-month jail term for other convictions earlier this year also related to unauthorized rallies in 2019, when Hong Kong residents took to the streets in the biggest challenge to Beijing since the city was handed from British to Chinese control in 1997.Also Read| China continues to undermine Hong Kong's democratic institutions, says BlinkenWith the two sentences combined, Lai will serve a total of 20 months behind bars.He is also being investigated under the city’s sweeping national security law, imposed last year, for colluding with foreign powers to intervene in the Hong Kong affairs.Also Read| Hong Kong changes electoral law, reduces direct public voteAuthorities have arrested and charged most of the city’s pro-democracy advocates, who also include Joshua Wong, a student leader during 2014 protests.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement called on Hong Kong authorities to drop charges filed against people “merely for standing for election or for expressing dissenting views.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-more-jail-time-over-2019-protest-101622176985332.html
28-05-2021||World||Stephen Hawking's archive and office acquired for UK public||London's Science Museum and the Cambridge University library said Wednesday they have acquired a large collection of items belonging to late physicist Stephen Hawking, from his personalised wheelchairs to landmark papers on theoretical physics and his scripts from his appearance on “The Simpsons.”The entire contents of Hawking's office at Cambridge — including his communications equipment, memorabilia, bets he made on scientific debates and office furniture — will be preserved as part of the collection belonging to the Science Museum Group.Hawking occupied the office at the university's department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics from 2002 until shortly before his death in 2018.Highlights will go on display at the London museum early next year. Museum officials are also hoping to create a touring exhibition in the U.K. before setting up a permanent display in London.Meanwhile, his vast archive of scientific and personal papers, including a first draft of his bestselling “A Brief History of Time” and his correspondence with leading scientists, will remain at Cambridge University's library.The institutions' acceptance of Hawking's archive and office meant that his estate settled 4.2 million pounds (USD 5.9 million) in inheritance tax.This was done through a U.K. government plan which allows those who have such tax bills to pay by transferring important cultural, scientific or historic objects to the nation. Artefacts accepted under the plan are allocated to public collections and available for all.Hawking studied for his PhD at Cambridge and later became the university's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, the same post that Isaac Newton held from 1669 to 1702.Cambridge's acquisition of the 10,000-page archive means that Hawking's papers will join those of Newton and Charles Darwin at the university library, where they will soon be free for the public to access.“The archive allows us to step inside Stephen's mind and to travel with him round the cosmos to, as he said, better understand our place in the universe,'” said Jessica Gardner, the university's librarian.“This vast archive gives extraordinary insight into the evolution of Stephen's scientific life, from childhood to research student, from disability activist to ground-breaking, world-renowned scientist,” she added.Diagnosed with motor neuron disease at 22 and given just a few years to live, Hawking survived for decades, dying in 2018 at 76.His work on the mysteries of space, time and black holes captured the imagination of millions, and his popular science books made him a celebrity beyond the preserves of academia. Hollywood celebrated his life in the 2014 biopic “The Theory of Everything.”Hawking's children, Lucy, Tim and Robert, said they were pleased that their father's work will be preserved for the public for generations to come.“My father would be so pleased and I think maybe at the same time, just a tiny bit overwhelmed that he was going to form part of the ... history of science, that he was going to be alongside the great scientists, the people whose work he really admired," Lucy Hawking said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stephen-hawking-s-archive-and-office-acquired-for-uk-public-101622164365790.html

28-05-2021||World||US-China row intensifies over Covid origins probe||A global row intensified amid renewed calls for an investigation into the origins of the Covid pandemic on Thursday, with Beijing accusing the Biden administration of playing politics and shirking responsibility, even as the US President pledged to release the findings of the US intelligence community’s probe into the matter.On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden ordered intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, including a possibility that the trail might lead to a laboratory in China’s Wuhan.A day later, China said the US was playing politics. Its foreign ministry said scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) had already said that the “lab leak” theory was unlikely. The ministry dismissed the theory that the virus may have leaked from a lab as a “conspiracy”. “Some people in the United States completely ignore facts and science,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Biden later pledged to release the results of the intelligence community’s investigation into the origins of Covid-19, including the possibility of a leak from the Wuhan virology lab in China, unless it contained something he was “not aware of”. He previously ordered the community to “redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days”.He added: “As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China.” “The majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one (theory) to be more likely than the other,” the US President said.Zhao said that the US ranks first globally in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and fatalities, which have reached around 33 million and 600,000, respectively. He said the US should accept the WHO-led international investigation.“The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.”Zhao said the administration’s position came in “in total disregard of facts and science... while totally ignoring the doubts over the origin-tracing work and failure of pandemic response in the US”.“This fully shows that the US side does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing, but wants to use the epidemic to engage in stigmatisation and political manipulation, and to shirk responsibility,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uschina-row-intensifies-over-covid-origins-probe-101622162141051.html
28-05-2021||World||Competitor fears Musk could 'monopolise' space||The launching of thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit by tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX threatens the "de-facto monopolisation" of space, the head of competitor Arianespace Stephane Israel has warned.Elon Musk's Starlink constellation project recently received authorisation from US regulator the Federal Communications Commission to provide broadband from space and place thousands of satellites lower than previously proposed, angering competitors including Amazon.SpaceX, which asked the FCC for permission which will apply to some 2,800 satellites, plans ultimately to blanket poorly connected and isolated areas of the globe with internet connectivity.But rivals claim the lower altitude could increase risk of space collisions and heightened radio interference."We want space to remain accessible for human activities... but we refuse a Wild West space. It really is our responsibility to ensure that low orbit (less than 1,000 kilometres or 625 miles) above the Earth is sustainable long-term," Israel told a UN-sponsored conference in Geneva on sustainable space development goals.Israel noted that of more than 9,000 satellites sent into orbit since 1957, "SpaceX has already deployed 1,677 satellites for Starlink, which means that today, of all satellites in operation, 35 percent belong to one man -- Elon Musk."And if you include satellites of more than 50 kilogrammes, that's more than 50 percent."He added that recent years had seen several collisions, at least two of them involving Starlink satellites, and warned that "very quickly, we could find ourselves in a catastrophic scenario that would render this orbit impractical."Israel said there was also "a risk of de-facto monopolisation" for Starlink as one of the first firms to set up such a satellite network.He suggested that was "rather what our competitor is banking on" by securing the FCC's green light.The FCC judged in April that deployment at a lower altitude than the 540 to 570 kilometres initially proposed "will improve the experience for users of the SpaceX service, including in often-underserved polar regions".It would also enable the satellites to be more speedily removed from orbit which would have "beneficial effects" in terms of reducing space debris, the authority found.In all, SpaceX has requested FCC authorisation for up to 42,000 satellites.That has put pressure on Arianespace, a joint venture between Airbus and French multinational Safran, to ramp up its own competitiveness for launches -- a global market whose value Fortune Business Insights estimated at almost $13 billion in 2019, rising to $26 billion by 2027.French UN ambassador in Geneva and conference organiser Francois Rivasseau stressed that space had a "vital" role to aid sustainable development.But he also warned that potential risks could suddenly go from fringe concerns to global problems -- pointing to the coronavirus pandemic as a precedent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/competitor-fears-musk-could-monopolise-space-101622161570949.html

It is already authorised in the EU for those over 16."Children and young people aged 12 and over will have the chance to book a vaccine appointment from June 7," Merkel said after talks with Germany's regional leaders.Those willing will be offered at least their first of two shots by the end of August, she added, roughly in time for the new school year."The main message to parents is: there will be no compulsory vaccinations," Merkel told reporters.Schools would not require pupils to be vaccinated, she said. "And it would be totally wrong to think you can only go on holiday with a vaccinated child."Inoculating children is seen as a key step towards achieving herd immunity in the fight against the pandemic.Canada and the United States have already started vaccinating over-12s.But experts have also expressed reservations, pointing out that children rarely suffer from severe Covid and that vaccine supply is still tight.Merkel urged patience, saying not everyone would get an appointment for their child right away.'Not over'Germany's STIKO vaccine regulator is due to give its recommendations for over -12s shortly after the Pfizer jab is approved.The agency has already signalled it intends to recommend the jab only for children in risk categories, such as those with underlying medical conditions.All over -12s will still be allowed to get jabbed regardless, similar to the AstraZeneca vaccine which is officially recommended only for people over 60 in Germany but is open to anyone who has consulted with their doctor.After a much-criticised slow start, the coronavirus inoculation campaign in Europe's top economy has kicked into high gear in recent weeks.More than 40 percent of adults have now had their first jab, and 15 percent are fully vaccinated.The accelerated pace, along with rapid testing and widespread shutdowns, has helped break a third coronavirus wave and allowed Germany to relax restrictions."This is a great success," Merkel said. But she called on Germans not to ditch precautions such as social distancing, mask wearing, and airing out rooms."The pandemic is not over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-not-over-yet-germany-to-vaccinate-children-over-12-from-june-7-101622160955084.html

Google declined to comment. TikTok did not immediately respond.Repeat offences can be punishable by a fine of up to 10% of the company's total annual revenue, Roskomnadzor has said, but it is unclear whether it would take such a step.Roskomnadzor earlier on Thursday said it was not yet planning to slow down the speed of Google or Facebook, as it has done with Twitter, but warned it could take more radical steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-fines-twitter-for-failing-to-delete-content-101622160335158.html

He faces a possible life sentence.State Attorney R.J. Larizza said during a news conference that charging Fucci as an adult wasn't only appropriate but the only choice his office could make. An autopsy discovered at least 114 stab wounds on Tristyn Bailey."Every time that arm went back and every time that arm went down, that was premeditation," Larizza said.Investigators said that Fucci had also told several friends that he planned to kill someone, though it wasn't clear whether Bailey was his intended target from the beginning, Larizza said.Bailey was last seen early May 9 at the community center in the Durbin Crossing community south of Jacksonville. Bailey and Fucci attended nearby Patriot Oaks Academy, where Bailey was a cheerleader.Bailey's parents reported her missing later that morning, and a neighbor found her body in a heavily wooded area that evening, the St. Johns County Sheriff Office said. Fucci was arrested the next day on a second-degree murder charge.According to an arrest report, video surveillance from the community center showed the girl walking with Fucci shortly after 1 a.m. May 9. Another video from a nearby home showed the pair walking along a road about 1:45 a.m. The same video showed only Fucci walking in the areas at 3:27 a.m., the report said.The videos led the detectives to talk to Fucci. The girl's body was found close to the boy's home, the report said. Detectives reported finding evidence related to the clothing seen in the surveillance videos in the boy's bedroom. And some of the items had a presumptive positive result for the presence of blood, the report said. A dive team found a knife in a nearby pond that investigators believe was the murder weapon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boy-14-charged-as-adult-in-13-year-old-girl-s-death-from-stabbing-101622152738584.html
28-05-2021||World||President Biden brushes aside wage worries in defense of economic plans||President Joe Biden offered a broad defense of his economic agenda on Thursday, arguing that his policies have already begun to benefit ordinary Americans and rejecting business-community concerns about labor shortages and rising wages.In a speech at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Biden pointed to the receding pandemic and accelerating hiring and consumer demand as indications the U.S. is “coming back.”“Covid cases are down, deaths are down, unemployment filings are down, hunger is down,” he said. “Vaccinations are up, jobs, real growth is up, people getting health coverage is up, small business confidence is up.”Biden’s political opponents have charged that rising prices and difficulty some businesses have experienced in hiring are a result of the president’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief measure, which boosted unemployment benefits and is distributing billions in cash directly to households. But the president argued that U.S. productivity has grown far faster than wages, offering no apology to businesses that have to raise pay to attract workers.“We must restore the connection between the success of our economy and the people who produce that success, hardworking Americans,” Biden said. “Rising wages aren’t a bug; they’re a feature.”New figures released Thursday showed that applications for state unemployment insurance fell for a fourth consecutive week, data that supports Biden’s argument.Yet the improving jobs numbers, along with rising prices for products ranging from lumber to used cars, have fueled the GOP’s case that the government doesn’t need to spend an additional $4 trillion on Biden’s proposals to overhaul infrastructure and support families.Biden said his administration would soon announce new initiatives to address what he called “supply pressures” in the economy, beginning with construction materials and “transportation bottlenecks.” He also said the administration would combat “anti-competitive practices that hurt small business and families.”The investments he’s proposed, he said, would keep the U.S. ahead of competitors already spending on their own infrastructure, listing Japan, Canada, Italy, France and the EU as countries that have undertaken infrastructure and research-and-development improvements of their own.“The pandemic exposed just how badly we need to invest in the foundation of this country and the working people of this country,” he said.While many Republicans are interested in funding road- and bridge-building, they oppose raising taxes to pay for Biden’s other plans, such as expanding community college access or universal pre-K. Republicans argue such hikes could jeopardize any nascent economic recovery.A group of Republican senators led by West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito publicly revealed a $928 billion counteroffer on infrastructure on Thursday, but the plan includes only about $257 billion in federal spending beyond what Congress was already expected to enact and is more than $1 trillion short of Biden’s latest proposal.In the speech, Biden glossed over April’s disappointing jobs report, saying instead that the U.S. had added an average of 500,000 jobs each of the first three months of his presidency.Biden again called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, a move that would require Congress to act. And he reiterated his plan to impose higher rates on the wealthy and corporations -- a key point of his plan to finance what the White House bills as transformative and historic investments for the country.“The American people understand that the economy we had before the pandemic left far too many people behind, and that more and more families were finding that their grip on a middle class life – and the security it affords – was precarious,” Mike Donilon, a senior adviser to Biden, wrote in a memo. “They know we can’t afford to simply turn the clock back to where we were.”Donilon cited a range of non-partisan polling that showed some of Biden’s infrastructure and tax plans are popular with the majority of Americans.The community college where Biden spoke was supposed to be the site of a campaign rally in March 2020, before it was canceled when the pandemic hit and social-distancing practices were adopted in the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-brushes-aside-wage-worries-in-defense-of-economic-plans-101622146463293.html

Some elements in it lean towards human contact with an infected animal and one towards the lab leak theory. “The majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,” the US president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pledges-to-release-covid-19-intelligence-review-report-101622140623002.html
28-05-2021||World||US considers in-person Quad summit||The United States is looking to convene an in-person summit of the leaders of Quad this fall, Kurt Campbell, who is President Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific czar, said lending a certain degree of specificity to a general understanding among member countries that it will be held sometime later in the year. He added that the summit will be focused on infrastructure.The in-person summit, as a follow up to the historic first one of the leaders of the four member countries Australia, Japan, India and the US held virtually in March, was supposed to take place on the sidelines of the G-7 meet in the UK in June but an announcement of a specific date teased by the White House in April never came.The plan to hold it in the UK, which was being pushed by Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, fell apart in a way when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced earlier this month his inability to attend the G-7 meeting because of the devastating second wave of Covid-19 tearing across India. Though not a member of the G-7, Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in were to join the summit as special invitees of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“We want to look this fall to convene an in-person Quad and the hope will be to make a similar kind of engagement on infrastructure more generally,” Campbell said on Wednesday at a virtual event hosted by Stanford University.An in-person summit was always on the cards as announced in the statement issued by the four countries after their March summit. But, the timing had never been firmed and officials have been working towards sometime later in the year, according to people familiar with the discussions, adding that even if one was held on the sidelines of the G-7 meet, it would not have foreclosed the possibility of a stand-alone in-person summit.The Covid-19 pandemic was the focus of the virtual summit held in March and the four countries announced a joint initiative to fund, make and distribute more than 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Indo-Pacific countries. They had also set up task forces on climate change, emerging technologies and critical resources, giving legs, for the first time, to a group that previously had only joint statements to show for outcomes.The focus on infrastructure as indicated by Campbell points to a need felt by the four countries to harness their resources to counter China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” that is creating dependencies among vulnerable nations through the use of predatory financing mechanisms.Biden’s Indo-Pacific czar also made clear the United States has truly abandoned its strategy of engagement with China, continuing a break from the past US strategy spelt out explicitly first by the Trump administration. “A period that had been broadly described as engagement has come to an end,” he said, adding, “The dominant paradigm is going to be competition. Our goal is to make that a stable, peaceful competition that brings out the best in us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-looks-to-convene-in-person-quad-summit-this-fall-101622127059730.html
