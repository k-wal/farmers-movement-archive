12-05-2021||World||US fuel shortages worsen on day six of pipeline outage||Fuel shortages worsened in the southeastern United States on Wednesday, as the shutdown of the largest US fuel pipeline network entered its sixth day and Washington officials pledged to help alleviate supply issues.A ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline last week halted 2.5 million barrels per day of fuel shipments. The pipeline stretches 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from US Gulf Coast oil refineries to consumers in Mid-Atlantic and Southeast states.US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the Biden administration is working around the clock to help deal with fuel shortages and restore Colonial operations, including moving gasoline to places that need it.The White House also said top officials were considering new ways to alleviate the shortages, following a raft of waivers easing quality standards for gasoline and extending working hours for fuel truckers to boost shipments.“Our top priority right now is getting the fuel the communities that need it, and we will continue doing everything that we can to meet that goal in the coming days," Buttigieg told reporters at the White House.Congressional committee members have asked for a formal briefing from a White House interagency task force about the federal response to the most disruptive cyberattack on US energy infrastructure.On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Colonial's chief executive indicated that the company would decide Wednesday whether it can make a full restart, which could take days to complete.Privately owned Colonial Pipeline opened portions of the line manually in Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey and the Carolinas. It also accepted 2 million barrels of fuel to begin a restart that would "substantially" restore operations by week's end, the company said.The supply crunch has sparked panic buying in the US Southeast, bringing long lines and high prices at gas stations ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend at the end of May, the traditional start of the peak summer driving season.The average national gasoline price rose to above $3.00 a gallon on Wednesday, the highest since October 2014, the American Automobile Association said.Nearly 60% of gas stations in metro Atlanta were without gasoline on Wednesday, tracking firm GasBuddy said. More than 70% of stations were out in metro Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, and Pensacola, Florida. Virginia and South Carolina also saw relatively high outages.LONG LINESStevenson Rosslow, 47, was filling up his Lexus with regular gas at a BP station in south Atlanta on Wednesday morning."This takes premium, but they're out," said Rosslow, the owner of the Wrecking Bar Brewpub in Atlanta's Reynoldstown neighborhood. "Even at that, the price jumped to what, $3.39?"The station Rosslow stopped at was the fourth he had tried. "I think we're having a problem here because of hoarding," he said.Four southeastern states - Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia - joined federal regulators in relaxing driver and fuel restrictions to speed deliveries of supplies. Georgia suspended sales tax on gasoline until Saturday.The FBI has accused a shadowy criminal gang called DarkSide of the ransomware attack. DarkSide is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe.Russia's embassy in the United States rejected speculation that Moscow was behind the attack. President Joe Biden on Monday said there was no evidence so far that Russia was responsible.REFINERS, AIRLINES REACTIt is unknown how much money the hackers are seeking, and Colonial has not commented on whether it would pay.Gulf Coast refiners that move fuel to market on the Colonial Pipeline have cut processing. Total SE trimmed gasoline production at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, and Citgo Petroleum pared back at its Lake Charles, Louisiana, plant.Citgo said it was moving products from Lake Charles and "exploring alternate supply methods into other impacted markets." Marathon Petroleum said it was "making adjustments."Colonial also serves US airports including Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic.Several airlines have been transporting fuel by truck or fueling planes at destinations rather than at East Coast origins. American Airlines has made changes to two long-haul flights out of Charlotte, North Carolina – one of its hub airports – through Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fuel-shortages-worsen-on-day-six-of-pipeline-outage-101620842359737.html
12-05-2021||World||WHO appointed panel slams slow response to Covid-19 in 2020, seeks more powers for UN body||A World Health Organization (WHO) appointed panel has concluded that countries around the world could have done more in early 2020 to contain the spread of the Coronavirus and called for the UN body to be given more powers to respond to future pandemics. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which was appointed by WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in response to a World Health Assembly resolution seeking an independent and impartial review of the current pandemic, also called on the world community to end the Covid-19 pandemic by implementing recommendations to redistribute, fund and increase the availability of vaccines. The panel issued its findings and recommendations on Wednesday after an eight-month review of lessons learned during the past year. “Our message is simple and clear: The current system failed to protect us from the Covid-19 pandemic,” said former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, co-chair of the Independent Panel. “If we do not act to change it now, it will not protect us from the next pandemic threat, which could happen at any time.” The panel described February 2020 as “a lost month” because “many more countries” could have done more to contain the spread of the new Coronavirus after WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30 after the initial outbreak at Wuhan in China. Quicker action “would have helped to prevent the global health, social and economic catastrophe that continues its grip”, the panel said, adding that “the system as it stands now is clearly unfit to prevent another novel and highly infectious pathogen, which could emerge at any time, from developing into a pandemic”. In a statement on its report, “Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic”, the panel said: “The current system – at both national and international levels – was not adequate to protect people from Covid-19. The time it took from the reporting of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in mid-late December 2019 to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern being declared, was too long.” Johnson Sirleaf added: “The shelves of storage rooms in the UN and national capitals are full of reports and reviews of previous health crises. Had their warnings been heeded, we would have avoided the catastrophe we are in today. This time must be different.” India, which was elected chair of WHO’s executive board last year, has pushed for reforms of the UN health body on the grounds that it had not reacted speedily to the spread of the Coronavirus. The panel asked high-income countries with adequate vaccine supplies to commit to provide at least one billion doses to 92 low and middle income countries covered by the WHO-backed COVAX facility by September 2021. Major vaccine producing countries and manufacturers should agree to share intellectual property rights on their doses, guided by the UN health agency and the World Trade Organization (WTO), it said. “If actions on this don’t occur within three months, a waiver of intellectual property rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should come into force immediately,” the panel said. The G7 or the world’s wealthiest countries should immediately allocate 60% of the $19 billion required for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) for vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and strengthening health systems, the panel recommended. As part of reforms to prevent a future outbreak becoming a pandemic, the panel called for establishing a “Global Health Threats Council” that will “maintain political commitment to pandemic preparedness and response and hold actors accountable. It said countries should adopt a “Pandemic Framework Convention” within the next six months. The panel recommended a new global system for surveillance, based on full transparency, should be established to provide WHO with the “authority to publish information about outbreaks with pandemic potential on an immediate basis without needing to seek approval and to dispatch experts to investigate at the shortest possible notice”. Countries should invest in national preparedness “now as it will be too late when the next crisis hits”, and all governments should review preparedness plans and allocate necessary funds and people to be prepared for another health crisis. The current ACT-A should be transformed into a global platform for delivering global public goods, including vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and supplies, swiftly and equitably worldwide by shifting from a market model, the panel said. The panel also recommended that the world community should strengthen the authority and financing of WHO, including by developing a new funding model that increases member state fees, and create an “International Pandemic Financing Facility” that will have the capacity to mobilise long term contributions of about $5 billion to $10 billion a year to finance ongoing readiness. The Independent Panel said 125 million people were estimated to have been pushed into extreme poverty and 72 million primary school-age children were at risk of being unable to read because of school closures. According to WHO, there have been more than 159 million Coronavirus infections globally, including more than 3.3 million deaths, since the pandemic began. In its weekly epidemiological update, WHO said some 1.2 billion vaccine doses had been administered so far. India is currently grappling with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen Coronavirus infections surge well past the 350,000-mark for several days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-appointed-panel-slams-slow-response-to-covid-19-in-2020-seeks-more-powers-for-un-body-101620839204846.html
12-05-2021||World||Myanmar protesters decry arrests, beatings as junta fights for control||Myanmar security forces fired shots and arrested about 30 people at an anti-coup rally in the country's second-biggest city on Wednesday, witnesses said, as protesters kept defying a months-long crackdown by a junta struggling to impose order.Chaos erupted in Mandalay, a hotbed of anti-military sentiment, when plainclothes police emerged from vehicles minutes into a protest, firing guns and beating demonstrators who fell as hundreds fled, according to four witnesses. They said they saw about 30 people arrested."There are no words to describe their cruelty," Aung Pyae Sone Phyo, 21, a protest leader, told Reuters. "They used enormous force to crack down on us. More than 10 military vehicles filled the little ward, they blocked every road in the area," he said."We will keep doing what we are doing until our revolution prevails."Myanmar has been gripped by protests and deadly violence since the military seized power from an elected government on Feb. 1, unleashing an outpouring of public anger and international condemnation of the junta's lethal response.Many demonstrators back a National Unity Government (NUG), an anti-junta coalition that has declared itself Myanmar's legitimate authority and pushed hard for international recognition and support.The State Department said on Wednesday U.S. officials had held conversations with the NUG where it outlined its inclusive vision for a diverse, unified, federal democracy."The U.S. will continue to support all those working peacefully to restore Burma to the path of democracy and urges the military to cease its violent actions and release all those unjustly detained," a State Department spokesperson said.GROWING UNRESTHnin, a frontline protester in Mandalay, said security forces held demonstrators to the ground, beating some and confiscating many motorcycles."They pushed their faces to the wall. Some were beaten by the soldiers and plainclothes security members," she said.A junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.Myanmar has seen a succession of small explosions in recent weeks, some at government offices and military facilities, while several junta-appointed administrators have been fatally stabbed.A group calling itself the People's Defence Force in Tamu in the central Sagaing region said it had killed 15 security personnel in separate clashes on Tuesday night and early on Wednesday. State MRTV in its nightly news said one member of the security forces was wounded in an attack by "terrorists".It followed an ambush that killed three soldiers on Monday, claimed by another militia in Sagaing, just days after the NUG announced the formation of a People's Defence Force to fight the military.Military-controlled media said 39 people had been arrested across the country on suspicion of orchestrating explosions and arson attacks, as well as seeking military training with an ethnic minority rebel group.It said 48 "handmade mines", 20 sticks of TNT, gunpowder, detonators, fuses and other material had been seized in a raid.With 783 people killed in the suppression of protests, according to an advocacy group, some supporters of the ousted government have sought military training with insurgents that have battled the military for decades in remote border regions.The United Nations cites the same death toll. Reuters is unable to independently verify casualties and the military has imposed restrictions on the media, internet services and satellite broadcasts.The military ruled Myanmar, once known as Burma, from 1962 to 2011 before launching a phased transition to democracy that led to unprecedented economic and political reforms and modernisation under a quasi-civilian government.But its intervention after only a decade has rekindled memories of oppressive rule and economic mismanagement that pro-democracy groups say people will not tolerate again.The military said it seized power because its complaints of fraud in a November election won in a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi's party were not addressed by an election commission that deemed the vote fair.The United States, European Union and Britain have imposed targeted sanctions on the generals and the military's businesses, while activists have urged the United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-decry-arrests-beatings-as-junta-fights-for-control-101620839153711.html
12-05-2021||World||Israel declares curfew, boosts police in Arab-Jewish town hit by violence||Jews cleared Torah scrolls from a torched synagogue on Wednesday and burnt-out cars lined nearby streets in an ethnically mixed Israeli town hit by violence denounced by the president as "unforgivable" acts by Arabs incensed at air strikes on Gaza.Moving to head off further violence in Lod, which has also seen assaults by Jews on Arab passersby, police declared a night-time curfew and deployed heavily armed reinforcements.In several other areas populated by Israel's 21% Arab minority, Palestinian flags festooned electricity poles and hundreds of residents have turned out for protests, sometimes clashing with police or Jewish residents."We have lost control of the city and the streets," Lod Mayor Yair Revivo told Channel 12 News after nightly confrontations in which an Arab townsman was shot dead, a killing in which two Jewish suspects have been arrested.Scores of other people have been arrested in Lod and in majority-Arab towns in central and northern Israel, including Umm al-Fahm along the West Bank border and Jisr al-Zarqa on the Mediterranean coast, police said.In Lod, men carried Torah scrolls through the blackened and debris-strewn yard of the torched synagogue. President Reuven Rivlin described events in terms recalling anti-Semitism abroad."The sight of the pogrom in Lod and the disturbances across the country by an incited and bloodthirty Arab mob ... is unforgivable," he said, calling the flying of the Palestinian flag by protesters "a brutal assault on shared existence".Israel's Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country’s 1948 creation.Most are bilingual in Arabic and Hebrew, and feel a sense of kinship with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They often complain of systemic discrimination, unfair access to housing, healthcare, and education services.Tension in Arab-Jewish towns has risen as Israel conducted air strikes in Gaza and Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel in an escalation of violence since clashes in East Jerusalem on Monday morning.In the coastal city of Acre, Uri Buri, a Jewish-owned fish restaurant, was set fire to and some Arab residents said they were scared to leave home.In Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, Arab protesters clashed with police firing stun grenades to disperse them."We condemn that our people's solidarity and cohesion with our brethren in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip is being channelled through acts of sabotage to public and private property, as is now happening at Umm al-Fahm's entrance," said Samir Mahamid, Mayor of Umm al-Fahm.Neighbourhoods with Arab residents, including Lod and Jaffa, were among those where sirens were triggered by rocket fire. An Arab resident of Lod and his daughter were killed on Wednesday when a vehicle was hit by a rocket, Israeli authorities said.In Haifa and Jaffa, and in the Arab city of Nazareth, protesters have chanted slogans in support of Palestinians facing eviction from an East Jerusalem neighbourhood under a long-running legal case.Arab citizens of Israel were among the thousands of protesters who have faced off in recent days with Israeli police near Al-Aqsa mosque and elsewhere in Jerusalem's Old City.A spokesman for the Hamas Islamist militant group in Gaza encouraged Arab citizens to "rise up" against "our enemy and yours".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-declares-curfew-boosts-police-in-arab-jewish-town-hit-by-violence-101620836650722.html
12-05-2021||World||Minnesota judge finds aggravating factors in George Floyd murder||A Minnesota judge has ruled that aggravating factors were involved in the death of George Floyd, opening the possibility of a longer sentence for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.Chauvin, a white former officer convicted in a Minnesota state court of murdering Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, during an arrest last May, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 25.In a six-page ruling dated Tuesday, District Court Judge Peter Cahill found that prosecutors had proven Chauvin abused his position of trust and authority, treated Floyd with particular cruelty, committed the crime as a group and did so with children present, all aggravating factors."The slow death of George Floyd occurring over approximately six minutes of his positional asphyxia was particularly cruel in that Mr. Floyd was begging for his life and obviously terrified by the knowledge that he was likely to die but during which the defendant objectively remained indifferent to Mr. Floyd's pleas," Cahill wrote.A jury convicted Chauvin, 45, of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter on April 20 after hearing three weeks of testimony in a highly publicized trial.Floyd's death after he was handcuffed on a Minneapolis street with Chauvin's knee on his neck for more than nine minutes prompted massive protests against racism and police brutality in many U.S. cities and other countries last summer.Three other former officers who were at the scene have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death and are set to go on trial on Aug. 23.Cahill, who presided over the trial, will also sentence Chauvin, who technically faces a combined maximum 75 years in prison if the sentences run consecutively. State guidelines, however, give judges leeway to impose sentences that are far less harsh.Prosecutors on April 30 asked Cahill to consider several aggravating circumstances in Floyd's death so that he could make "an upward sentencing departure" in the case.While Cahill accepted most of the prosecutors' arguments that aggravating circumstances were present, he rejected one of them, finding that they had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Floyd was "particularly vulnerable."Also pending before Cahill is a May 4 request for a new trial in which Chauvin's lawyer argued that his client was deprived of a fair trial because of prosecutorial and jury misconduct, errors of law at trial and that the verdict was contrary to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-judge-finds-aggravating-factors-in-george-floyd-murder-101620838075682.html
12-05-2021||World||EU says Russia is aiming to ‘de facto integrate’ eastern Ukraine||The European Union says Russia is trying to gradually absorb parts of eastern Ukraine, according to a document the bloc shared this week with member states.In the paper, seen by Bloomberg, the EU says steps by the Kremlin such as organizing illegitimate elections and issuing passports to locals are “aimed at de facto integration of Ukraine’s non-governmental-controlled areas into Russia.” The EU’s foreign-affairs arm, the EEAS, will prepare a report on the matter, according to the paper.Russia has repeatedly denied plans to take over the territories, saying it’s committed to a now-stalled 2015 peace deal under which they’d receive substantial autonomy within Ukraine.War broke out in the breakaway regions after President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea from his neighbor in 2014. While major fighting between Ukraine’s army and Kremlin-backed insurgents ended the following year, fatal skirmishes continue today, adding to the more than 13,000 deaths already recorded.Greater autonomy for the region, known as Donbas, would potentially give it veto power over national goals such as NATO and EU membership that are opposed by Putin but backed by a majority of the county’s 42 million population.Tensions between the former Soviet allies spiked last month as Russia deployed military hardware and more than 100,000 troops to the border area before partially pulling back following calls by Western leaders to de-escalate. In a show of support, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv last week.The EU document presents options the bloc could take to strengthen Ukraine’s resilience to Russian aggression, including:The EU has faced criticism for not going as far as the U.S. in sanctioning Russia. Further penalties would depend on a “further grave deterioration of the situation with regard to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” according to the document.Ukraine has also sought backing from Brussels for its bid to join NATO.EU ambassadors of the bloc’s political and security committee had diverging views on the paper when they discussed it Tuesday, according to a separate memo seen by Bloomberg.One group broadly supported the timing and contents of the options. Another said the proposals didn’t sufficiently emphasize the reforms Ukraine must implement itself -- such as anti-corruption measures -- and that member states should talk more before exploring cooperation involving the bloc’s security programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-russia-is-aiming-to-de-facto-integrate-eastern-ukraine-101620833288592.html
12-05-2021||World||'Tamed the virus': US deaths hit lowest level after July 2020||Covid-19 deaths in the US have tumbled to an average of around 600 per day — the lowest level in 10 months — with the number of lives lost dropping to single digits in well over half the states and hitting zero on some days.Confirmed infections, meanwhile, have fallen to about 38,000 days on average, their lowest mark since mid-September. While that is still a cause for concern, they have plummeted 85% from a peak of more than a quarter-million cases per day in early January.The last time deaths were this low was early July, nearly a year ago. Covid-19 deaths in the US topped out in mid-January at an average of more than 3,400 a day, just a month into the biggest vaccination drive in the nation's history.Kansas reported no new deaths from Friday through Monday. In Massachusetts, the Boston Herald put a huge zero on Wednesday's front page under the headline “First time in nearly a year state has no new coronavirus deaths.”Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, said that vaccinations have been crucial even as the nation struggles to reach herd immunity.“The primary objective is to deny this virus the ability to kill at the rate that it could, and that has been achieved," he said. “We have in effect tamed the virus.”Nearly 45% of the nation's adults are fully vaccinated, and over 58% have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This week, Pfizer's vaccine won authorization for use in 12- to 15-year-olds, in a move that could make it easier to reopen the nation's schools.Physicians like Dr. Tom Dean in South Dakota’s rural Jerauld County are cautiously optimistic, concerned about the many people who have decided against getting vaccinated or have grown lax in guarding against infections. The county has seen just three confirmed cases in the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins data.“What I’m afraid of is people believing this whole thing is over and you don’t have to worry about it any more,” Dean said. “I think complacency is our biggest threat right now.”The encouraging outlook stands in sharp contrast to the catastrophe unfolding in places like India and Brazil.The overall US death toll stands at about 583,000, and teams of experts consulted by the CDC projected in a report last week that new deaths and cases will fall sharply by the end of July and continue dropping after that.“I think we are in a great place, but I think India is an important cautionary tale," warned Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins.“If there is a right combination of vaccine hesitancy, potentially new variants and quickly rolling back control measures that comes together, we could potentially screw this up and have yet another wave that is completely unnecessary at this point."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tamed-the-virus-us-deaths-hit-lowest-level-after-july-2020-101620836167411.html
12-05-2021||World||Escalating Mideast violence bears hallmarks of 2014 Gaza war||Rockets streamed out of Gaza and Israel pounded the territory with airstrikes Wednesday as the most severe outbreak of violence since a 2014 war took on many hallmarks of that devastating 50-day conflict, with dozens killed and no resolution in sight.Palls of gray smoke rose in Gaza, as Israeli airstrikes levelled two apartment towers and hammered the militant group's multiple security installations, destroying the central police compound.In Israel, barrages of hundreds of rockets fired by Gaza's Hamas rulers and other militants at times overwhelmed missile defenses and brought air raid sirens and explosions echoing across Tel Aviv, Israel's biggest metropolitan area, and other cities.The death toll in Gaza rose to 48 Palestinians, including 14 children and three women, according to the Health Ministry. More than 300 people have been wounded, including 86 children and 39 women.Six Israelis, including a soldier, three women and a child, were killed, and dozens of people were wounded.While the rapidly escalating conflict has brought images familiar from 2014 Israel-Hamas war, the past day has also seen a startling new factor: A burst of fury from Israel's Palestinian citizens in support of those living in the territories and against Israel's recent response to unrest in Jerusalem and its current operations in Gaza.Amid those protests, communal violence erupted in several mixed Jewish-Arab Israeli cities, including the burning of a Jewish-owned restaurant and a synagogue, the fatal shooting of an Arab man and attacks on Arab-owned cars.In a rare move that highlighted the tensions, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Wednesday ordered units of border guards deployed to help police keep order.There was no sign that either side is willing to back down. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to expand the offensive, saying “this will take time.” Hamas has called for a full-scale intifada, or uprising. The last such uprising began in 2000 and lasted more than five years.The latest eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed police tactics during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police.A focal point was the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.Late Monday, Hamas, claiming to be “defending Jerusalem,” launched a barrage of rockets at the city in a major escalation.The Israeli military said militants have fired more 1,050 rockets since the conflict began, with 200 of them falling short and landing inside Gaza. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said two infantry brigades were sent to the area, indicating preparations for a possible ground invasion.The army also confirmed that a soldier — Staff Sgt. Omer Tabib, 21 — was killed in an anti-tank missile attack near the Gaza Strip, the first Israeli military death in the fighting.Israel has struck hundreds of targets in the Gaza Strip, where 2 million Palestinians have lived under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas took power in 2007.The fiercest attack was a set of airstrikes that brought down an entire 12-story building. The building housed important Hamas offices, as well as some businesses. Israel fired a series of warning shots before demolishing the building, allowing people to flee and there were no casualties.Israeli aircraft heavily damaged another Gaza City building early Wednesday. Israel said the nine-story building housed Hamas intelligence offices and the group's command responsible for planning attacks in the occupied West Bank; it also had residential apartments, medical companies and a dental clinic. A drone fired five warning rockets before the bombing.Fighter jets struck the building again after journalists and rescuers had gathered around. There was no immediate word on casualties. The high-rise stood 200 meters (650 feet) away from the AP bureau in Gaza City, and smoke and debris reached the office.In another strike, Hamas' Gaza City commander was killed Wednesday, the group confirmed, making him the highest-ranking military figure in the group to be killed by Israel since the 2014 war. Israel's internal security agency said that a series of airstrikes had killed Bassem Issa and several other senior militants.At one point Wednesday, Hamas fired 100 rockets at the Israeli desert town of Beersheba in what it said was retaliation for some of the strikes.Samah Haboub, a mother of four in Gaza, said she was thrown across her bedroom in a “moment of horror” by an airstrike on an apartment tower next door. She and her children, aged 3 to 14, ran down the stairway of their apartment block along with other residents, many of them screaming and crying.“There is almost no safe place in Gaza,” she said.One strike hit a taxi in Gaza City, killing a man, woman and driver insider, and a second strike killed two men nearby on the street, witnesses who brought the bodies told the AP at the hospital. Several other bystanders, including a woman, were wounded.In the Israeli city of Lod, a 52-year-old man and his 16-year-old daughter, reportedly Arab citizens of Israel, were killed early Wednesday when a rocket from Gaza hit the courtyard of their home.The Jerusalem turmoil and the ensuing battle come at a time when the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process is virtually non-existent.

"All efforts should be directed at avoiding civilian casualties, and supporting de-escalation."The statement came as Israelis and Palestinians traded missile and rocket fire in a military escalation after weekend clashes in and around the shared holy Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem."The grave escalation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the major upsurge in violence in and around Gaza, must stop," Borrell said.While saying the "indiscriminate launching of rockets from Hamas and other groups towards Israeli civilians is unacceptable" and affirming Israeli's "legitimate need to protect its civilian population," Borrell stressed that the response "needs to be proportionate"."The EU calls for an immediate end to the ongoing violence. Everything must be done to prevent a broader conflict, which will, first and foremost, affect the civilian populations on both sides," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/broader-conflict-must-be-averted-in-israeli-palestinian-violence-eu-101620834893368.html

12-05-2021||World||US CDC identifies 28 clotting cases after Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine||The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday it had identified 28 cases of serious, potentially life-threatening cases of blood clotting, among the more than 8.7 million people who had received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.The CDC said in a presentation that current evidence "suggests a plausible causal association" with the J&J vaccine and the cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets - the cells in the blood that help it to clot.Three of the 28 have died. Previously, as of April 25, the CDC had reported 17 cases of clotting among nearly 8 million people given vaccines.It said the events appear similar to what is being observed following administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.The syndrome does not appear to be associated with either of the Covid-19 vaccines produce by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SA or Moderna Inc.Most of the cases were among women aged 18 to 49, the CDC said. Rates among women aged 30-39 and 40-49 were particularly high, according to the presentation, at 12.4 cases per million and 9.4 cases per million, respectively.Only six of the clotting events identified were in men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-identifies-28-clotting-cases-after-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-101620835903598.html

This week Canberra set a new goal of vaccinating all willing adults by the end of this year.So far, Australia has delivered 2.5 million vaccine shots, versus the roughly 50 million jabs needed to vaccinate the entire population.After a series of problems with vaccine delivery and the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those under 50, the government is now in talks to manufacture promising mRNA vaccines domestically.Australia has ridden out the coronavirus pandemic by effectively sealing itself off from the rest of the world, and with a series of snap local lockdowns.It remains one of the few places where there is no widespread community transmission and daily life is relatively normal.But very few Australians are immunized and there have been repeated outbreaks linked to quarantine facilities, raising fears that its success could be fleeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-deliver-25-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-australia-by-2022-101620831751472.html
12-05-2021||World||President Biden beats first GOP effort to block stimulus ban on tax cuts||The Biden administration can enforce a congressional ban on tax cuts by states that tap almost $200 billion in Covid stimulus money while a lawsuit over the provision proceeds, a judge ruled.The ruling on Wednesday denying Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s request for an injunction against the ban is the first legal test of the restriction, which triggered five legal challenges in mostly Republican-led states after it was added to the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act.U.S. District Judge Douglas R. Cole’s decision is a positive early sign for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who argued in court papers that the tax mandate is a “straightforward exercise” of Congress’s authority to attach conditions that “preserve its control over the use of federal funds.”But the dispute is far from over. Judges in the other cases may come to different conclusions when ruling on pending requests for injunctions, and either side could ultimately prevail on the merits following a trial.Yost’s press secretary, Steve Irwin, didn’t immediately have a comment when reached by phone.Read More: Ohio Sues Biden Administration Over Stimulus Tax RestrictionThe dispute is one of several GOP-led legal challenges to the Biden administration’s policies, including lawsuits over his moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public land and his plan to freeze deportations of undocumented immigrants for 100 days, which was blocked by a judge pending trial in another suit brought by Republican state AGs.In the Ohio case, Yost argued that the tax mandate added by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was holding the state’s $5.5 billion in federal relief “hostage.” Republican state AGs have said they should be permitted to accept federal cash and cut taxes without fear that the money will be clawed back. Democrats in Congress say the funds should be used for relief efforts and not to finance tax cuts popular with Republican voters.The relief money “may be directed to a broad variety of state efforts to respond to the public health emergency created by the Covid-19 pandemic and to its economic effects, including by funding state-level government services and by providing assistance to households, small businesses, and industries,” Yellen said in a filing responding to a parallel suit by Arizona.Other states that have sued include Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky, whose legislature is controlled by Republicans. The states have called the tax mandate an improper offer of federal money they “can’t refuse” and an attempt at a “complete take-over of state finances.”The case is State of Ohio v. Yellen, 21-cv-00181, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio (Cincinnati).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-beats-first-gop-effort-to-block-stimulus-ban-on-tax-cuts-101620831699784.html
12-05-2021||World||Covid-19 cases spike among prisoners in Bangkok||Nearly 3,000 inmates at two prisons in Thailand’s capital have tested positive for Covid-19, the Corrections Department said Wednesday, as the country battles a new wave of the coronavirus.The department said 1,785 of the 3,274 inmates tested positive at Bangkok Special Prison, which holds detainees ahead of trial. At the Central Women’s Correctional Institution, 1,040 of the 4,475 inmates were infected, it said.The Corrections Department announced the infections after a prominent political activist released on bail last week announced Wednesday that she had tested positive for the virus. Panusaya “Rung” Sitthijirawattanakul and fellow members of a student-led pro-democracy movement are awaiting trial on charges of defaming the monarchy, or lese majeste, which is punishable by up to 15 years' imprisonment.The department confirmed last week that two other activists also tested positive for Covid-19. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said nine activists who were detained have tested positive, including Panusaya and another who has been released.Health authorities on Wednesday announced 1,983 new coronavirus cases, bringing Thailand's confirmed total to 88,907 since the pandemic began. There were 34 new deaths, for a total of 486.The new coronavirus wave began at the beginning of April, originating in upmarket entertainment venues in Bangkok and spawning clusters in several crowded slum communities, followed by other venues such as department stores. Many recent cases involve the British variant of the virus, which is more infectious than the original form found last year.The new wave accounts for about two-thirds of all confirmed Thai cases and more then three-fourths of the deaths.Anti-coronavirus restrictions have been tightened, although there are no strict curfews or travel bans. In the worst-hit areas, such as Bangkok, restaurants are barred from dine-in service and can only sell take-out meals.The surge in cases and deaths has strained the capacity of hospitals to provide beds and ICU facilities, leading to the establishment of temporary field hospitals.There is concern over the slow pace of vaccinations after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government failed to secure adequate vaccines. Less than 3% of the country’s population has been vaccinated.Even with limited supplies, demand for vaccinations through an online scheduling app has fallen short of targets in some areas, said health officials, who announced plans to make it easier to get inoculated.While it will still be possible to book online, people will also be able register via groups to which they belong, such as their workplaces, as well as go to several mobile walk-in centers without reservations, Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announced. The expanded system will come into effect in June, when local production of the AstraZeneca vaccine is to begin at a planned rate of 10 million doses monthly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-spike-among-prisoners-in-bangkok-101620831020652.html

It's impossible to just remain indifferent," a woman who gave her name only as Albina said after coming to pay her respects at School Number 175.The head of Russia's Muslim-majority region of Tatarstan, where Kazan is the main city, has called it a national tragedy and the Kremlin has called for tighter gun controls.Russia has strict restrictions on civilian firearm ownership, but some categories of gun are available for purchase for hunting, self-defence or sport, once would-be owners have passed tests and met other requirements.Around 100 people, some of them wearing face masks because of the COVID-19 pandemic, gathered at a traditional Muslim funeral for Elvira Ignatieva, an English teacher who was among the victims."She was protecting her children ... She was protecting (them) and didn't hide away," said Talgat Gumerov, a Kazan resident.Twenty-three people were still in hospital on Wednesday, including 12 children with gunshot wounds, the TASS news agency reported. Five children were in a serious condition and one of them was critical, it said.The Investigative Committee, which investigates major crimes, said that it planned to charge a suspect named Ilnaz Galyaviev later on Wednesday. A court was expected to rule later on the terms of custody for the 19-year-old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-pay-tribute-to-victims-of-mass-shooting-at-kazan-school-101620830141434.html

It was first reported in the "Private Eye" magazine.Johnson's office did not immediately have a comment when contacted by Reuters.Johnson's finances have been the subject of extensive scrutiny in recent weeks, with electoral authorities investigating the funding of refurbishments to his flat, and parliament investigating the declaration he made relating to a donor-funded foreign trip.A county court judgement is issued when someone submits a claim and judges decide the money needs to be paid. The register of these judgements is used by banks and other financial institutions to determine an individual's credit rating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-has-unpaid-535-pound-debt-document-101620818789961.html
12-05-2021||World||UK said to reconsider plan to buy AstraZeneca Covid-19 antibody drug||The U.K. has reconsidered plans to buy one million doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 antibody treatment, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.While the first data from the treatment’s trials are expected in the coming weeks, the UK has no orders for it and is still evaluating the role antibody cocktails may play in Britain’s response to the pandemic, according to one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified because details of the discussions are private. Alok Sharma, the U.K.’s former business secretary, said in November that the country had procured the doses pending trial results.The deal Sharma announced last year was a non-binding and in principle agreement, the person said. By contrast, the U.S. increased its order for the Astra antibody treatment by half a million doses in March, taking its potential supplies to 700,000 in 2021.Monoclonal antibodies are aimed at protecting high-risk people such as cancer patients whose immune systems may not be able to cope with vaccination. The drugs can neutralize the virus and mimic the necessary immune response to avoid infection. Astra’s treatment -- AZD7442 -- proved effective against variants of the virus in early testing. The company is expected to report the first data shortly from a trial evaluating the drug’s ability to prevent infection in people who have been exposed to Covid-19 in places like nursing homes.A spokesman for the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment. A spokesman for Astra said the company is “working with international and government agencies around the world to enable broad access” to the treatment if it proves effective in trials.Astra has five advanced-stage trials testing a combination of two long-acting antibodies for both the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 in different populations. The company said last month that, if the data were positive, it would apply for emergency authorization in the U.S., followed by other global submissions for clearance.Unlike with vaccines, it’s much harder to scale up production of monoclonal antibodies. Drugmakers like Astra can only manufacture several million doses a year.A number of antibody treatments have shown success in trials and been cleared for use. A cocktail treatment from from Eli Lilly and Co. was granted an emergency use authorization earlier this year, while GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Vir Biotechnology Inc. have applied for such clearance of their antibody drug, targeted at people with mild to moderate infection at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-said-to-reconsider-plan-to-buy-astrazeneca-covid-19-antibody-drug-101620809343671.html
12-05-2021||World||Republicans oust Trump critic Liz Cheney from leadership||Wednesday's vote by House Republicans over whether to oust anti-Trump conservative Liz Cheney from her leadership role will almost certainly confirm that the party out of power in Washington is casting its lot with the former US president.Eighteen months before crucial midterms and three years before the next presidential race, the Republican Party appears intent on punishing one of its own because she refuses to embrace Donald Trump's false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election.Republicans argue it's about unity, and that Cheney hammering on about Trump and what she calls his "dangerous and anti-democratic cult of personality" has done nothing to bring a fractured party together following a contentious election that left them in the political hinterland.Cheney, a Wyoming conservative and the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney, is expected to be removed from her role as the number three House Republican in a morning vote by the party's conference.On Tuesday evening she delivered a defiant speech on the House floor, warning her colleagues of the potential "unraveling of our democracy" as a former president continues to mislead millions of Americans and sow doubt about election integrity."Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar," Cheney told a nearly empty chamber."I will not participate in that. I will not sit back in silence as others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law, and joins the former president's crusade to undermine our democracy."In a statement issued Wednesday morning before the vote, Trump said House Republicans "have a great opportunity today to rid themselves of a poor leader, a major Democrat talking point, a warmonger, and a person with absolutely no personality or heart.""As a representative of the Great State of Wyoming, Liz Cheney is bad for our Country and bad for herself," the ex-president added.- What comes next? -Trump, top House Republican Kevin McCarthy and number two Steve Scalise have all endorsed a young moderate-turned-Trumpist, Elise Stefanik, as Cheney's replacement.Stefanik does not yet have serious competition for the post, and the endorsements make her the clear frontrunner.But a vote for a new conference chair is not yet set, as some Republicans worry that Stefanik -- while a fierce Trump defender -- is insufficiently conservative.Regardless of Cheney's replacement, "it's clear that we need to make a change," McCarthy told members Monday."Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future."While Cheney and a few allies, such as House Republican Adam Kinzinger, warn against clinging to the former president, many in the GOP including Senator Lindsey Graham believe their party cannot move forward without Trumpism -- whether or not Trump himself remains a force.In a Tuesday letter to fellow Republicans, congressman Chip Roy said Cheney will be ousted because she spent more time "unhelpfully engaging in personal attacks and finger-wagging towards president Trump" than building a party platform to take on Democrats."She forfeited her ability to be our spokesperson by pulling us into distraction," the Texas lawmaker said.With Republican divisions on awkward display, President Joe Biden will court bipartisanship Wednesday when he hosts his first White House meeting with the four congressional leaders: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Republicans McCarthy and Senator Mitch McConnell.The huddle may serve as a reminder that in the midst of a purge of a congressional leader, Washington's gears continue churning."Hopefully... they can talk about areas of agreement and things like infrastructure," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.Cheney nevertheless sits at the center of a crisis for a party unable to quit its defeated former president or reject his false claim of election fraud.mlm/dw/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-oust-trump-critic-liz-cheney-from-leadership-101620824915186.html
12-05-2021||World||Britain to launch public inquiry into Covid response, says PM Boris Johnson||A full, independent public inquiry into the British government's handling of its response to the coronavirus pandemic will be held early next year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday.The country had "found itself in the teeth of the gravest pandemic for a century" and the state has "an obligation to examine its actions as rigorously and as candidly as possible and to learn every lesson for the future", he told lawmakers.Britain has been hit hard by the outbreak, with more than 127,000 deaths since March last year -- the world's fifth highest official toll, according to data collected by AFP -- raising questions about why it has fared worse than other nations.Johnson told parliament the inquiry would be established on a "statutory basis", with oral evidence given under oath and powers to "compel the production of all relevant materials".He added he expected the inquiry, which is likely last over a year, will begin in the spring of 2022.The government in London will work with the UK's devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to determine the scope of the inquiry.Johnson's government has rebuffed months of calls for a wide-reaching investigation into its handling of the pandemic, saying it would hamper the ongoing response.But months of lockdown restrictions are being eased, and the number of cases of Covid-19 and deaths has fallen sharply, as a mass vaccination campaign continues apace.Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer called for the inquiry to start "as soon as possible".Johnson, however, said the start had to be delayed so it did not "weigh down the efforts of those engaged in protecting us every day".The events of the last year needed to be looked at in the "cold light of day", he added.Johnson's leadership has come under particular scrutiny since the start of the outbreak.He has been accused of being too slow to impose a nationwide lockdown measures to contain the virus at the outset, and too fast to lift restrictions once the first wave passed.There were also initial problems with the supply of protective equipment to frontline workers, testing capacity, and glitches in an app to trace Covid contacts.Johnson has denied that he dismissed the prospect of a wave of Covid-19 deaths, after reports he had said he would rather see "bodies pile high in their thousands" than impose a third coronavirus lockdown.Ultimately, Johnson did order a new round of restrictions in January.Johnson's former top aide Dominic Cummings has publicly called into question his ex-boss' judgement at key moments during the pandemic.He is due to give evidence to a separate parliamentary inquiry into the government's Covid response later this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-launch-public-inquiry-into-covid-response-says-pm-boris-johnson-101620824482837.html

The country reported 149 COVID deaths over the last 10 days, health officials said.According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus data, Sri Lanka has reported 131,098 COVID-19 cases and 850 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-announces-night-travel-ban-to-check-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101620820121646.html

12-05-2021||World||Afghan security forces fight to recapture Taliban-held district outside Kabul||Afghan security forces mounted an operation to recapture a Taliban-held district outside the capital Kabul on Wednesday just before the start of a three-day ceasefire at midnight, a local official said.Taliban insurgents had killed or captured some government soldiers and forced others to retreat after storming the district centre, which lies in Wardak province less than an hour's drive from Kabul.Government forces have been struggling against stepped-up attacks by the insurgents as US troops withdraw after two decades of fighting in the country.Wardak mayor Zarifa Ghafari said that if the district was not taken soon, fighting would reach the gates of Kabul in a few days.The defence ministry said on Wednesday special forces have been deployed in the area to retake the district after troops made a "tactical retreat" on Tuesday.A senior government official said they aimed to regain control before a three-day ceasefire announced by the Taliban for the Muslim religious holiday of Eid, which starts on Thursday."We will have to do it today because after the ceasefire, it will give the Taliban enough time to dig in and will complicate the operations and increase our casualties," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The government carried out air strikes at the start of the operation, the defence ministry said.The insurgents have maintained a strong presence in Wardak and nearby Logar province to the south over the years. Afghan officials say the Taliban have used the provinces as launchpads for hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings on Kabul.The Taliban has staged a months-long campaign to expand its influence across the country as the United States has begun withdrawing troops from May 1 and closed some bases in keeping with a peace deal it signed with the Taliban last year.Afghan officials say since Washington announced plans last month to pull out all US troops by Sept. 11, the Taliban have stepped up attacks.Critics of the decision to withdraw say the Islamist militants will try to sweep back into power.US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in late 2001 for sheltering the al-Qaeda militants involved in the September 11 attacks on the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-security-forces-fight-to-recapture-taliban-held-district-outside-kabul-101620819677592.html

Paralympic participants will also get their shots before the Games begin on Aug. 24.Around 1,800 people are set to be vaccinated across six cities, with COB vice-president Head of Mission Marco Antonio La Porta saying the Brazilian population would receive two doses for every person on the delegation who is vaccinated."This is a great contribution from the Olympic Movement at this very difficult time that the world is facing," La Porta told reporters."Even without the vaccine being mandatory for participation in the Games, there is no doubt that we will feel safer to represent Brazil in the Olympic Games."Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said they would be using either the Pfizer or the Sinovac shots.Brazil has recorded the second-deadliest Covid-19 outbreak in the world and continues to average more than 2,000 deaths per day. More than 425,000 people have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to the Health Ministry.On Tuesday, the Health Ministry announced it had signed a deal for Pfizer to deliver an additional 100 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, doubling the number of shots from the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-brazil-will-vaccinate-athletes-staff-headed-to-tokyo-olympics-101620817527546.html
12-05-2021||World||Death toll rises from air strikes in Gaza and rocket fire on Israel||Israel carried out hundreds of air strikes in Gaza on Wednesday and Palestinian militants fired multiple rocket barrages at Tel Aviv and the southern city of Beersheba in the region's most intense hostilities in years.At least 49 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Six people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said.A Palestinian source said truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations were continuing but without progress so far. U.N. Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said the United Nations was working with all sides to restore calm.In Gaza, a multi-storey residential building collapsed after Israel warned its occupants in advance to evacuate, and another was heavily damaged in the air strikes.Israel said its warplanes had targeted and killed several of the Islamist group Hamas's intelligence leaders. Other strikes hit what the military said were rocket launch sites, Hamas offices and the homes of Hamas leaders.The heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in the Hamas-ruled enclave has increased international concern that the situation could spiral out of control."Israel has gone crazy," said a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings.Sixteen people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza on Wednesday, Gaza's health ministry said. Witnesses and health officials in Gaza said one Israeli air strike killed three people, including a woman, in a car.Many Israelis also spent a sleepless night, with sirens wailing in Tel Aviv, heralding several waves of rocket strikes in Israel's heartland."The children have escaped the coronavirus, and now a new trauma," an Israeli woman in the coastal city of Ashkelon said in footage on Channel 11 television.Israelis ran to shelters or lay flat on pavements in communities more than 70 km (45 miles) up the coast from Gaza as interceptor missiles streaked into the sky."All of Israel is under attack. It's a very scary situation to be in," said Margo Aronovic, a 26-year-old student, in Tel Aviv.An Israeli was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Gaza at a vehicle near the border, Israel's national ambulance service said. Hamas claimed responsibility. Two people were killed by a rocket that hit their car in Lod, near Tel Aviv.Lod and other mixed Arab-Jewish towns have been gripped by demonstrations over the Gaza violence and tensions in Jerusalem.Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said Israeli forces had attacked "many hundreds of targets" and killed senior militants in Gaza and that "all means and options" remained on the table."The Israeli military will continue to attack and will bring about complete and long-term quiet," Gantz told reporters. "Only when we achieve this goal, can we talk about calming things down. At the moment, there is no end-date."NEW CHALLENGEHamas's armed wing said it fired 210 rockets towards Beersheba and Tel Aviv overnight in response to the strikes on the tower buildings in Gaza City. Israel's military says about a third of the rockets have fallen short, landing within Gaza.For Israel, the targeting of Tel Aviv, its commercial capital, posed a new challenge in the confrontation with Hamas, regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.The violence followed weeks of tension during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters near Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.These escalated ahead of a court hearing - now postponed - that could lead to the eviction of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem homes claimed by Jewish settlers.The conflict has led to the freezing of talks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opponents on forming a governing coalition to unseat him after Israel's inconclusive March 23 election.Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank. Medical sources said a 16-year-old Palestinian was killed in clashes with Israeli forces on Wednesday."If they (Israeli forces) want to escalate, the resistance is ready, if they want to stop, the resistance is ready," Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said.Gaza's health ministry said 14 of the people reported killed in the enclave were children. The Israeli military said it was looking into these reports and that preventing civilian casualties was a priority.The White House said on Tuesday Israel had a legitimate right to defend itself from rocket attacks but applied pressure on Israel over the treatment of Palestinians, saying Jerusalem must be a place of coexistence.Israel said it had dispatched infantry and armour to reinforce tanks already gathered on the border, evoking memories of the last Israeli ground incursion into Gaza to stop rocket attacks in 2014.Witnesses said Israeli aircraft destroyed Gaza's Hamas-run police headquarters in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-rises-from-air-strikes-in-gaza-and-rocket-fire-on-israel-101620818772007.html

12-05-2021||World||Japan's Covid-19 vaccine booking system crashes||Technical problems derailed Japan's coronavirus vaccination booking system on Wednesday, compounding frustration over the government's handling of new outbreaks of infections and an inoculation drive that critics say has been woefully slow.The online system to book a vaccine crashed in many places including parts of Tokyo and the western city of Minoh because of a global problem with US cloud computing vendor Salesforce.com Inc, public broadcaster NHK reported.Salesforce chief technology officer Parker Harris said on Twitter that the company was experiencing a "major disruption", later updating to say services had been mostly restored."Making an appointment for a vaccination seems to be a tall order for the elderly," wrote Twitter user @obachan66972352."Please consider making it possible to get the vaccine without an appointment."A representative of the health ministry's vaccine office was not immediately available when contacted by Reuters.The ministry has faced numerous technical problems throughout the pandemic, from a contact tracing application that failed to pass on vital information to a cumbersome database that health workers were reluctant to use.Japan has only inoculated 2.8% of its population, the lowest rate among wealthy countries despite an ambitious government target of giving shots to its 36 million elderly people by July, when the Olympics Games are due to open in Tokyo.But according to government projections, about 86% of Japan's 1,741 cities and towns would meet that goal.Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said to meet the target, about 1 million shots a day had to be delivered, about three times the current pace.Japan's inoculation campaign was initially slow because of tight supplies of imported doses of Pfizer Inc's vaccine but has since been plagued by a shortage of manpower and other logistical snags.Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccines, has urged the public to be patient and to take steps to streamline the booking process.Christophe Weber, chief executive of Japan's biggest drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, acknowledged on Tuesday that the country was behind on its inoculation push and needed to accelerate.Some 75% of Japanese are dissatisfied with the vaccine rollout, and they had the lowest opinion of their government's handling of the pandemic among six major economies in a survey by global consultancy Kekst CNC released on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-covid-19-vaccine-booking-system-crashes-101620816473564.html
12-05-2021||World||UK to help vulnerable countries against Russia, China cyber threat||Britain said on Wednesday it would invest 22 million pounds ($31 million) to help vulnerable countries in Africa and the Indo-Pacific build up their cyber defences to prevent China, Russia and others from filling a cyberspace vacuum.British foreign minister Dominic Raab said Britain and its partners needed to take action to ensure there was a cyberspace that was free, open and peaceful in the face of hostile states seeking to undermine democratic elections and turn the internet into a lawless space."We've got to win the hearts and minds across the world in a much broader space for our positive vision of a cyberspace ... there for the benefit of the whole world," Raab said at an online security conference."Frankly, we've also got to prevent China, Russia and others from filling the multilateral vacuum. That means doing a lot more to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries who are most at risk."Last month, Britain joined the United States in saying Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, was responsible for the SolarWinds hack which led to the compromise of nine federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies.Britain's top cyber spy also warned in April that the West needed to act urgently to ensure China does not dominate important emerging technologies and gain control of the "global operating system".Raab said Britain's investment would be used to support national cyber response teams, advise on mass online safety awareness campaigns and to collaborate with global police coordination agency Interpol to set up a new cyber operations hub in Africa.This hub would operate across Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda to help fight cybercrime in the fast-growing economies, the foreign office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-help-vulnerable-countries-against-russia-china-cyber-threat-101620814881095.html
12-05-2021||World||Could have prevented Covid-19 but institutions failed: Expert panel||The catastrophic scale of the Covid-19 pandemic could have been prevented, an independent global panel concluded Wednesday, but a "toxic cocktail" of dithering and poor coordination meant the warning signs went unheeded.The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) said a series of bad decisions meant Covid-19 went on to kill at least 3.3 million people so far and devastate the global economy.Institutions "failed to protect people" and science-denying leaders eroded public trust in health interventions, the IPPPR said in its long-awaited final report.Early responses to the outbreak detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 "lacked urgency", with February 2020 a costly "lost month" as countries failed to heed the alarm, said the panel.To tackle the current pandemic, it called on the richest countries to donate a billion vaccine doses to the poorest.And the panel also called on the world's wealthiest nations to fund new organisations dedicated to preparing for the next pandemic.Read more: Foreign aid for Covid-19 swiftly cleared for states, says Centre- 'Delay, hesitation and denial' -The report was requested by World Health Organization (WHO) member states last May.The panel was jointly chaired by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.The report, "Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic", argued that the global alarm system needed overhauling to prevent a similar catastrophe."The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented," Sirleaf told reporters."It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response."The report said the emergence of Covid-19 was characterised by a mixture of "some early and rapid action, but also by delay, hesitation, and denial."Poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis."The threat of a pandemic had been overlooked and countries were woefully unprepared to deal with one, the report found.- Vaccine ultimatum -The panel did not spare the WHO, saying it could have declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) -- its highest level of alarm -- on January 22, 2020.Instead, it waited eight more days before doing so.Nevertheless, given countries' relative inaction, "we might still have ended up in the same place", said Clark.It was only in March after the WHO described it as a pandemic -- a term that is not officially part of its alert system -- that countries were jolted into action.As for the initial outbreak, "there were clearly delays in China -- but there were delays everywhere", she added.Without the lag between the first identification in Wuhan and the PHEIC declaration -- and then the "lost month" of February 2020 -- "we believe we wouldn't be looking at an accelerating pandemic, as we have for the last 15 or 16 months or so. As simple as that", said Clark.The panel made several recommendations on how to address the current pandemic.Rich, well-vaccinated countries should provide the 92 poorest territories in the Covax scheme with at least one billion vaccine doses by September 1, and more than two billion by mid-2022, it said.The G7 industrialised nations should pay 60 percent of the $19 billion ($15 billion euros) required to fund vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics via the WHO's Access to Covid Tools Accelerator programme in 2021, it added.Fellow G20 nations and others should provide the rest.The WHO and the World Trade Organization should also get major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree voluntary licensing and technology transfers for Covid-19 vaccines, the panel said."If actions do not occur within three months, a waiver of... intellectual property rights should come into force immediately."- Invest billions, save trillions -To tackle future outbreaks and pandemics, the panel called for a Global Health Threats Council made up of world leaders, plus a pandemic convention.The G20 should also create an International Pandemic Financing Facility, able to spend $5-10 billion a year on preparedness, with $50 to $100 billion ready to roll in the event of a crisis."Ultimately, investing billions in preparedness now will save trillions in the future, as the current pandemic has so clearly illustrated," Clark told reporters.The panel also proposed an overhaul of the WHO to give it greater control over its funding and more authority for its leadership.Its alert system needed to be faster and it should have the authority to send expert missions to countries immediately without waiting for their green light, it added.The panel believe their recommendations would have stopped Covid-19 from becoming a pandemic, had they been in place before the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/could-have-prevented-covid-19-but-institutions-failed-expert-panel-101620814549381.html

12-05-2021||World||China should offer couples $156,000 to incentivise childbirth: Expert||The Chinese government should offer couples 1 million yuan (more than ₹11 million/$156,000) for each newborn to incentivise childbirth and increase country’s declining birthrate, a high-profile entrepreneur and economist has suggested.China’s population is growing at its slowest pace in decades, latest census data released on Tuesday showed, with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade.It has raised widespread worries about China’s ageing population and declining workforce.The slump in the growth rate - despite Beijing withdrawing the one-child policy in 2016 strictly in force since the late 1970s - will add pressure on Beijing to incentivise childbearing as the most populous country deals with a rapidly ageing population and the resultant economic burden.One way to incentivise is to pay couples in cash or subsidies, Liang Jianzhang, professor of applied economics at the Peking University in Beijing and founder of multinational online travel company, Trip.com, has suggested.Liang said on China’s Twitter-like social media platform Weibo that it would likely cost China 10% of its GDP to push up birthrates from the current 1.3 total fertility rate to the replacement-level fertility, the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next.Breaking down the 10% of the GDP-cost, Liang said it would amount to about a 1 million yuan per child, which could be paid in cash, housing subsidies or tax relief.“I’ve spoken to a lot of young people ... if it’s just a few tens of thousands of yuan it basically wouldn’t encourage people to have another child,” Liang was quoted as saying by Reuters.The costs incurred now by the government would be offset by future contributions made to the economy by the population, said Liang.“If a family gives birth to another child, that child’s future contributions to social security, to tax revenues, will exceed 1 million yuan,” he said.Liang has repeatedly suggested that the Chinese government carry out urgent reforms in its population policy. “For instance, it is suggested that the Ministry of Finance may consider the overall distribution of maternity subsidies. From the birth of a child to the age of six, the state finance can issue a certain amount of childcare subsidies every month. The specific amount can refer to the local minimum wage standard,” Liang had argued in a state media editorial last year.In terms of incentivising the housing policy for couples, he said, the government should consider the high price of housing as an influencing factor in couples’ willingness to have children.“For example, exempting land prices could slash the housing prices by half. To make it more feasible, the local governments could directly exempt multi-children families from the land price or refund them if they have more children after purchasing houses, with a flexible exemption ratio in line with the fertility rate,” he argued in the editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-should-offer-couples-156-000-to-incentivise-childbirth-expert-101620808771134.html
12-05-2021||World||Over 1,050 rockets, mortar shells fired from Gaza Strip since Monday||The Israeli Army on Wednesday said over 1,050 rockets and mortar shells were fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel since the violence broke out on Monday evening.Israel defence forces (IDF) Spokesperson Hidai Zilberman said the Iron Dome air defence system had an interception rate between 85 and 90 per cent of rockets heading toward populated areas, The Times of Israel reported.In response, the IDF launched strikes on upwards of 500 targets in the Gaza Strip, aimed at Hamas personnel, weaponry and infrastructure, Zilberman says.The Israeli Air Force carried out a series of early morning airstrikes early today on the Gaza Strip, destroying dozens of police and security installations, witnesses say.Watch: Indian woman killed in Hamas airstrike in Israel; condolences pour inA wall of dark gray smoke rose over Gaza City and observers in Gaza said that it is one of the heaviest Israeli strikes ever.The ongoing violence marks a dramatic escalation of tensions linked to the potential eviction of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem by Israeli settlers and access to one of the most sacred sites in the city, which is a key hub for Islam, Judaism and Christianity.The confrontation intensified in recent days as Ramzan brought large crowds to al-Aqsa and clashes broke out between Palestinians and Israeli police. More than 300 Palestinians were injured on Monday.The protests spread to other Arab areas inside Israel. In the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod, Arab protesters threw stones and fireworks at passersby and police early Tuesday. And a man whose identity has not been disclosed opened fire on a group of Arab protesters carrying Palestinian flags, The Washington Post reported.More than 1,100 Palestinians were injured in clashes with the Israeli military on May 7-10, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).Health authorities in Gaza said at least 36 Palestinians - including 10 children - were killed in Israeli airstrikes on the Strip since late on Monday, after Hamas launched rockets from the coastal territory towards Israel. At least 250 others were injured.At least five people in Israel have also been killed.The security forces in Israel are bracing up for further violence. Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai ordered a "significant" bolstering of police presence in the city of Lod and a number of other locations after Public Security Minister Amir Ohana declared a state of emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-1-050-rockets-mortar-shells-fired-from-gaza-strip-since-monday-101620803532052.html
12-05-2021||World||Taliban seize district on outskirts of Afghan capital: Officials||The Taliban have seized a district from Afghan government forces on the outskirts of Kabul, ahead of a three-day ceasefire agreed between the warring sides, officials said.Nerkh district is around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the Afghan capital in neighbouring Wardak province, which has long been used by militants as a gateway to reach the city and launch deadly attacks.Violence has soared since May 1 when the US military began formally withdrawing its last remaining troops, even as peace efforts between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled."Security and defence forces made a tactical retreat from the police headquarters of Nerkh district," Interior Ministry spokesman Tareq Arian told AFP.Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said the insurgents had captured the area on Tuesday, adding its fighters had seized the police headquarters and an army base.The Defence Ministry on Wednesday said it would launch an offensive to win back the district, home to more than 60,000 people."Commando reinforcements are on their way," Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the defence ministry said.Large swathes of Wardak and neighbouring Logar province have been controlled or contested for years by Taliban fighters and have served as a strategic staging ground for militants hoping to enter Kabul.The main highway that connects Kabul to southern Kandahar province -- the former Taliban stronghold and the scene of intensive fighting in recent weeks -- crosses through the district.Taliban fighters have been increasingly encircling major Afghan urban centres, spurring speculation the militants are waiting for the Americans to withdraw before launching all-out assaults on the country's cities.The capture of Nerkh comes after the Taliban and the Afghan government agreed to observe a three-day ceasefire to mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday starting on Thursday.Ceasefires in the past have widely held in what is largely thought to be an exercise by the Taliban leadership to prove they have firm control over the myriad factions across the country that make up the jihadist movement.Violence has intensified across the provinces, particularly in the south, since the US missed a May 1 deadline agreed with the Taliban to withdraw the last of its troops.While the Taliban have avoided engaging American forces, attacks against government and civilian targets have not stopped.Thousands of residents in Helmand have been displaced because of clashes, which saw the US military called in to defend Afghan forces.In the latest violence to rock Kabul, more than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a western district of the capital when three bombs exploded outside a girls' school on Saturday.It was the deadliest attack in more than a year and came as residents were out shopping ahead of Eid.The US military has so far completed between six and 12 percent of its final withdrawal, the Pentagon said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seize-district-on-outskirts-of-afghan-capital-officials-101620803028683.html
12-05-2021||World||Here's what Melinda Gates may spend her fortune on after her divorce||Even after her divorce with Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates, American philanthropist Melinda Gates will remain one of the wealthiest persons in the world. Her philanthropic engagement with the world points towards what is expected of her in the decades ahead, according to a CNN report.Alexsis de Raadt St. James, founder and managing partner of Merian Ventures, describes Melinda Gates' impact as 'so disproportionately powerful'. "I have no doubt in her ability to have impact," Alexsis told CNN.Melinda and Bill Gates, who launched the world’s largest charitable foundation, said they would continue to work together at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after their divorce.Here is a look at what else Melinda Gates is expected to focus on:Women empowerment: In her own words, there is a 'structural inequality' in women's and girls' lives and to address that, she launched her investment and incubation company, Pivotal Ventures in 2015. The company helps amplify women-focussed efforts and even encourages women to run for public office, according to the report. "The data is unequivocal: No matter where in the world you are born, your life will be harder if you are a girl," according to Melinda. She has also been vocal about the right to access to contraceptives for women as it not only gives her right over their bodies but also serves as the "greatest anti-poverty tool in the world."Mental health: Melinda Gates has initiated several mental health programmes. Her association with 'Sound It Out' and her last year's launch of 'The Upswing Fund for Adolescent Mental Health' suggests that she will keep her focus on the issue in the upcoming decades.Covid-19 vaccine access: The philanthropist has on several occasions highlighted how important it was for everyone to have access to the Covid-19 vaccine. "Everybody needs this vaccine," she told CNN's Poppy Harlow in December. "If we only get it to the high-income countries, this disease is going to bounce around. We're going to see twice as many deaths. And our recovery of our economies is going to be much slower than if we get the vaccine out to everybody," she said.Paid leave: Pivotal Ventures works with US' national campaigns such as Paid Leave for All and PL+US (Paid Leave for the US). Melinda Gates invested more than $65 million in efforts to bring about a comprehensive federal paid leave policy since 2016, according to CNN. Going forward too, her company could further contribute to the cause. In May 2019, Melinda Gates told CNN that the US was the only country that did not have a government-funded paid family leave and that it "makes an enormous difference."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-where-melinda-gates-may-spend-her-fortune-after-her-divorce-101620787278933.html

The sessions so far have featured finger-pointing about missed intelligence, poor preparations and an inadequate law enforcement response.The Capitol Police have faced criticism for being badly overmatched, the FBI for failing to share with sufficient urgency intelligence suggesting a possible “war” at the Capitol, and the Defense Department for an hourslong delay in getting support to the complex despite the violent, deadly chaos unfolding on TV.“Our hearing will provide the American people the first opportunity to hear from top Trump Administration officials about the catastrophic intelligence and security failures that enabled this unprecedented terrorist attack on our nation’s Capitol,” the committee’s chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a statement.Rosen, for his part, is expected to tell lawmakers that the Justice Department “took appropriate precautions” ahead of the riot by putting tactical and other elite units on standby after local police reports indicated that 10,000 to 30,000 people were expected at rallies and protests.Miller's testimony will amount to the most thorough explanation of Pentagon actions after months of criticism that it took hours for the National Guard to arrive.In his prepared remarks, he defends his resistance to a heavy military response as being shaped in part by public “hysteria” about the possibility of a military coup or concerns that the military might be used to help overturn the election results.Fearful of amplifying those suspicions — as well as the possibility a soldier might be provoked into violence in a way that could be perceived as an attack on First Amendment activities — he says he agreed in the days before the insurrection to deploy soldiers only in areas away from the Capitol.“No such thing was going to occur on my watch but these concerns, and hysteria about them, nonetheless factored into my decisions regarding the appropriate and limited use of our Armed Forces to support civilian law enforcement during the Electoral College certification,” Miller says. “My obligation to the Nation was to prevent a constitutional crisis.”Although he says the Defense Department should not play a lead role in domestic law enforcement, he felt it important to initiate planning discussions out of concern about a lack of coordination and information-sharing between other agencies.Democrats have signaled that they intend to press Miller on why it took so long for the National Guard to arrive despite urgent plans for help. In his prepared testimony, Miller contends that those complaints are unjustified, though he also concedes that the Guard was not rushed to the scene — which he says was intentional.“This isn’t a video game where you can move forces with a flick of the thumb or a movie that glosses over the logistical challenges and the time required to coordinate and synchronize with the multitude of other entities involved, or with complying with the important legal requirements involved in the use of such forces," he says.Although the timeline Miller offers in his remarks generally matches up with that provided by other high-ranking leaders, he notably puts himself at odds with William Walker, who as commanding general of the D.C. National Guard testified to what he said were unusual Pentagon restrictions that impeded his response. He also described a more than three-hour delay between when aid was requested aid and when it was received.Walker has since become the House sergeant-at-arms, in charge of the chamber's security.Miller says that Walker was given “all the authority he needed to fulfill the mission" and that before Jan. 6 had never expressed any concern about the forces at his disposal. Miller says he authorized the deployment of 340 National Guard personnel, the total amount Walker had said would be necessary.Miller says he approved the activation of the Guard at 3 p.m. That support did not arrive at the Capitol complex until well after 5 p.m., which Miller says reflected the time-consuming process of coordination and planning.Miller served as a White House counterterrorism adviser under Trump before being tapped as acting defense secretary for the final months of the Trump administration. He replaced Mark Esper, who was fired as defense secretary after the election after being seen by Trump as insufficiently loyal.The abrupt appointment raised concerns that Miller was in place to be a Trump loyalist. Maloney foreshadowed a focus on Trump at Wednesday's hearing, saying his “inflammatory language provoked and incited the violent mob."In his opening statement, though, Miller says he believes Trump “encouraged the protesters" but declines to say if Trump bears responsibility. He recounts a Jan. 5 conversation when Trump, impressed by a crowd of supporters at a rally that day, told him 10,000 troops would be needed the next day.“The call lasted fewer than thirty seconds and I did not respond substantively, and there was no elaboration. I took his comment to mean that a large force would be required to maintain order the following day,” Miller says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-officials-to-testify-on-january-6-riots-101620793909212.html
12-05-2021||World||Canadian province halts AZ vaccine drive over rare blood clot fears||Canada’s most populous province Ontario has halted the administration of doses of AstraZeneca (AZ) Covid-19 vaccine over concerns related to a rare adverse reaction in the form of blood clots.The announcement that the province will no longer roll out the vaccine as part of its inoculation programme was made by its chief medical officer of health Dr David Williams. That decision was also linked to a decreasing case load in the province as well as easier access to other vaccines as AZ supply has been constrained due to several factors including the ongoing coronavirus crisis in India.In a statement, he said, “This decision was made out of an abundance of caution due to an observed increase in the rare blood clotting condition, known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.”A total of 12 cases of this side-effects have been reported in the country so far, including three that led to death.Federal health authorities have yet to comment on the Ontario decision.Canada has so far received approximately 2.3 million doses of the vaccine, including 1.5 million from the United States, 500,000 manufactured by the Serum Institute of India under the Covishield brand and the remainder from the global Covax facility.Williams pointed out that till May 8, 651,012 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were administered with a rate of VITT of 0.9 per 100,000 doses administered and 202,873 doses of the Covishield vaccine were administered with a rate of VITT of 1 per 100,000 doses administered. “However, over the last few days, there have been increased reports of VITT, with a rate of 1.7 per 100,000 doses administered.”Provincial health authorities are now conferring with Health Canada and others and reviewing data to consider whether to administer the AZ jab going forward for the second dose. Among those who received the AZ injection as their first dose is Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Williams also stated that data from the UK “points to a much-reduced risk of VITT in second doses of AstraZeneca”. He also maintained that those who got their first dose in the form of the AZ vaccine “did absolutely the right thing”.Among the options being explored is mixing vaccines, as the province awaits results of research currently underway. “The decision to pause is also based on the increased and reliable supply of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and the downward trend in cases. We are also seeing early promising results of administering two doses of different vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-province-halts-az-vaccine-drive-over-rare-blood-clot-fears-101620793710469.html

We decide our foreign policy," he said.Initiated in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Quad for short, is an informal grouping of the US, India, Australia and Japan.China has vehemently opposed the formation of the Quad with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman emphasising in March that exchanges and cooperation between countries should help expand mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting or harming the interests of third parties.The Quad member countries have resolved to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the strategically vital region.The first summit of the Quad leaders was hosted by US President Joe Biden on March 12 and the virtual meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four Quad leaders have vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending a clear message to China against its aggressive actions in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-took-note-of-china-s-warning-to-bangladesh-against-quad-official-101620786558702.html
12-05-2021||World||35 killed in Gaza, 5 in Israel, as violence escalates||Hostilities between Israel and Hamas escalated overnight, with 35 Palestinians killed in Gaza and five in Israel in the most intensive aerial exchanges for years.Israel carried out hundreds of air strikes in Gaza into the early hours of Wednesday, as the Islamist group and other Palestinian militant groups fired multiple rocket barrages at Tel Aviv and Beersheba.One multi-story residential building in Gaza collapsed and another was heavily damaged after they were repeatedly hit by Israeli air strikes. Israel said it attacked Hamas targets, including intelligence centres and rocket launch sites.Watch: Indian woman killed in Hamas airstrike in Israel; condolences pour inIt was the heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in Gaza, and prompted international concern that the situation could spiral out of control.UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland tweeted: "Stop the fire immediately. We're escalating towards a full scale war. Leaders on all sides have to take the responsibility of de-escalation."The cost of war in Gaza is devastating & is being paid by ordinary people. UN is working w/ all sides to restore calm. Stop the violence now," he wrote.Into the early hours of Wednesday morning, Gazans reported their homes shaking and the sky lighting up with Israeli attacks, outgoing rockets and Israeli air defence missiles intercepting them.Israelis ran for shelters or flattened themselves on pavements in communities more than 70 km (45 miles) up the coast and into southern Israel amid sounds of explosions as interceptor missiles streaked into the sky.In the mixed Arab-Jewish town of Lod, near Tel Aviv, two people were killed after a rocket hit a vehicle in the area. Israeli media reported one was a 7-year-old girl.Hamas's armed wing said it fired 210 rockets towards Beersheba and Tel Aviv in response to the bombing of the tower buildings in Gaza City.For Israel, the militants' targeting of Tel Aviv, its commercial capital, posed a new challenge in the confrontation with the Islamist Hamas group, regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.The violence followed weeks of tension in Jerusalem during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in and around Al-Aqsa Mosque, on the compound revered by Jews as Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.These escalated in recent days ahead of a – now postponed - court hearing in a case that could end with Palestinian families evicted from East Jerusalem homes claimed by Jewish settlers.Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where a 26-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli gunfire during stone-throwing clashes in a refugee camp near the city of Hebron.'A VERY HEAVY PRICE'There appeared no imminent end to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that militants would pay a “very heavy” price for the rockets, which reached the outskirts of Jerusalem on Monday during a holiday in Israel commemorating its capture of East Jerusalem in a 1967 war.The outbreak of hostilities led Netanyahu's political opponents to suspend negotiations on forming a coalition of right-wing, leftist and centre-left parties to unseat him after an inconclusive March 23 election.Opposition leader Yair Lapid has three weeks left to establish a government, with a new election - and another chance for Netanyahu to retain power - likely if he fails.The Arab League, some of whose members have warmed ties with Israel over the last year, accused it of "indiscriminate and irresponsible" attacks in Gaza and said it was responsible for "dangerous escalation" in Jerusalem.Hamas named its rocket assault "Sword of Jerusalem", seeking to marginalise Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and to present itself as the guardians of Palestinians in Jerusalem.The militant group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said Israel had “ignited fire in Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa and the flames extended to Gaza, therefore, it is responsible for the consequences."Haniyeh said that Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations had been in contact urging calm but that Hamas’s message to Israel was: "If they want to escalate, the resistance is ready, if they want to stop, the resistance is ready."The White House said on Tuesday that Israel had a legitimate right to defend itself from rocket attacks but applied pressure on Israel over the treatment of Palestinians, saying Jerusalem must be a place of coexistence.The United States was delaying U.N. Security Council efforts to issue a public statement on escalating tensions because it could be harmful to behind-the-scenes efforts to end the violence, according to diplomats and a source familiar with the U.S. strategy.State Department spokesman Ned Price urged calm and "restraint on both sides", saying: "The loss of life, the loss of Israeli life, the loss of Palestinian life, It's something that we deeply regret."He added: "We are urging this message of de-escalation to see this loss of life come to an end."PLUMES OF BLACK SMOKEIsrael said it had sent 80 jets to bomb Gaza, and dispatched infantry and armour to reinforce the tanks already gathered on the border, evoking memories of the last Israeli ground incursion into Gaza to stop rocket attacks, in 2014.More than 2,100 Gazans were killed in the seven-week war that followed, according to the Gaza health ministry, along with 73 Israelis, and thousands of homes in Gaza were razed by Israeli forces.Video footage on Tuesday showed three plumes of thick, black smoke rising from a 13-story Gaza residential and office block as it toppled over after being demolished by Israeli air strikes.The Israeli military said the building, in Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood, housed "multiple" Hamas offices, including ones for military research and development and military intelligence.The existence of one Hamas office, used by political leaders and officials dealing with the news media, was widely known locally.Residents in the block and the surrounding area had been warned to evacuate the area before the air strike, according to witnesses and the Israeli military.A second residential and office building in the same neighbourhood was heavily damaged in Israeli attacks shortly before 2 a.m. on Wednesday. Residents and journalists working in the building had already left.On Tuesday Gaza health ministry officials put the death toll at 32, but a Hamas-affiliated radio station later said three more people, including a woman and a child, were killed shortly before 2 a.m. on Wednesday in an Israeli air strike on an apartment above a restaurant.Israeli political leaders and the military said they had killed "dozens" of militants, and hit buildings used by Hamas.Defence Minister Benny Gantz said Israel had carried out "hundreds" or strikes, and that "buildings will continue to crumble."Gaza's health ministry said that of the 30 reported dead, 10 were children and one was a woman.Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said a 50-year-old woman was killed when a rocket hit a building in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion, and that two women had been killed in rocket strikes on Ashkelon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/35-killed-in-gaza-5-in-israel-as-violence-escalates-101620786634131.html

The same week, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong received another 10-months in jail for his role in 2019 anti-government protests, writes William Pesek for Nikkei Asia.At the same time, he suspended a ministerial economic dialogue with Canberra, with his government hitting Prime Minister Scott Morrison's for a "Cold War mindset" and "ideological discrimination".Pesek wrote that China's inner circle is miffed about Morrison's questions, which everyone should be asking - on Covid-19 and its demands for a seat on the G7 table despite being irresponsible for the pandemic.Much of South Asia avoids getting at Xi's bad side. After South Korea welcomed a US-designed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile-defense system, Chinese tourism flows to Seoul disappeared.Xi had a once-in-lifetime opportunity to grow Beijing's soft power at America's expense amid trade wars between then US President Donald Trump. However, he blew it and China's international image in international polls has lost ground since 2018.As the Covid-19 ravaged the world, Xi's belligerence deserves considerable blame - with Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Galwan border clash with India, Canada and more.Meanwhile, current US President Joe Biden is pivoting the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue against China, much to Xi's chagrin, with additional resistance from China.Pesek for Nikkei Asia wrote that despite the common view that the Chinese President does not care what the world thinks, press freedom in China is racing in the wrong direction and Xi himself seems to fear Google and Facebook.These actions signal insecurity and a dearth of savvy that a leading power needs to exploit at the moment and thus not a great report card a year out from Xi's plan to secure yet another term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doubts-emerge-over-xi-jinping-s-chances-of-securing-3rd-term-as-chinese-prez-101620786298600.html
12-05-2021||World||US expresses 'serious' concern over Israel-Palestine conflict, calls for de-escalation||The US White House on Tuesday (local time) expressed "serious concern" over the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, calling for de-escalation of tensions between both countries by establishing a two-state solution.Speaking at her daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: "The President has been briefed daily on developments in Jerusalem and Gaza. He just received another update before I came out here from the National Security Advisor.""Since last week, he has directed his team to engage intensively with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials, as well as leaders throughout the Middle East. His team is communicating a clear and consistent message in support of de-escalation, and that is our primary focus," she added.Also Watch: Indian woman killed in Hamas airstrike in Israel; condolences pour inAlso Read: Israel hits Gaza with airstrikes as Netanyahu vows to step up attacks on HamasPsaki added that the US stands against extremism that has inflicted violence on both Israeli and Palestinian communities."We will also continue to support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That is the only way to ensure the just and lasting peace that two peoples have struggled to achieve. We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measures of freedom, security, dignity, and prosperity," she said.She also said that US officials have spoken to their Israeli counterparts on how evictions of Palestinian families and demolitions of these homes work against their common interests in achieving a solution to the conflict.Meanwhile, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tuesday (local time) spoke to his Israeli counterpart Meir Ben Shabbat, where he condemned the ongoing rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups."He also conveyed the United States' encouragement of steps toward restoring a sustainable calm. They agreed to continue to stay in close touch. Sullivan also spoke today with the Government of Egypt on the situation in Gaza and Jerusalem. They discussed steps to restore calm over the coming days and agreed to stay in close touch," read a White House readout.This comes as the tensions between Israel and Palestine are rapidly escalating, with ramping up of rocket attacks and airstrikes from both sides. Three people have been killed in rocket strikes from Gaza on Tel Aviv.On Tuesday, Hamas said that it fired 137 rockets in around five minutes in an apparent attempt to overwhelm the Iron Dome missile defense system.Over 630 rockets were fired at Israel from Monday evening through Tuesday afternoon, 200 of which were intercepted by Iron Dome missile defence batteries while 150 others fell short of their targets and landed inside the Strip, according to the army.Meanwhile, Israeli bombing raids across Gaza from Monday have killed at least 28 people, including 10 children, and injured at least 152 more, CNN reported citing Palestinian health officials. The Israeli military said it had killed more than 15 militants.The country has been embroiled in conflict over the impending eviction of dozens of Palestinians from East Jerusalem's neighbourhood.Over 70 Palestinians in total are set to be evicted from Sheikh Jarrah in the coming weeks to be replaced by right-wing Jewish Israelis. The Palestinians live in houses built on land that courts have ruled were owned by Jewish religious associations before the establishment of Israel in 1948, reported The Times of Israel.Over 300 Palestinians have been injured in the riots, several of them seriously hurt by rubber-tipped bullets in the head, eye and jaw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-serious-concern-over-israel-palestine-conflict-calls-for-deescalation-101620783405660.html
12-05-2021||World||NASA's giant Webb telescope succeeds in key pre-launch test||The world's largest and most powerful space telescope unfolded its giant golden mirror for the last time on Earth on Tuesday, a key milestone before the $10 billion observatory is launched later this year.The James Webb Space Telescope's 21 feet 4 inch (6.5 meter) mirror was commanded to fully expand and lock itself into place, NASA said -- a final test to ensure it will survive its million-mile (1.6 million kilometer) journey and is ready to discover the origins of the Universe."It's like building a Swiss watch at 40-feet-tall... and getting it ready for this journey that we take into the vacuum at minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit (-240 Celsius), four times further than the Moon," said Scott Willoughby of lead contractor Northrop Grumman.He was speaking at the company's spaceport in Redondo Beach, California, from where the telescope will be shipped to French Guiana to be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket, with NASA targeting October 31 for liftoff.Webb's primary mirror is made of 18 hexagonal segments coated with an ultra-thin layer of gold to improve its reflection of infrared light.It will fly to space folded like a piece of origami artwork, which allows it to fit inside a 16-foot (5-meter) rocket fairing, and will then use 132 individual actuators and motors to bend each mirror into a specific position.Together, the mirrors will function as one massive reflector, to enable the telescope to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before.Time machine Scientists want to use the telescope to look back in time over 13.5 billion years ago and see for the first time the first stars and galaxies that formed, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.To do this, they need to detect infrared. The current premier space telescope, Hubble, only has limited infrared capacity.This is key because by the time the light from the first objects reaches our telescopes, it has been shifted towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum as a result of the Universe extending the space between objects as it expands.Another key area will be the discovery of alien worlds. The first planets to orbit other stars were detected in the 1990s and there are now more than 4,000 exoplanets that have been confirmed.Webb "has instrumentation that will propel this new and exciting field into its next epic of discovery," said Eric Smith, James Webb telescope program scientist.Scientists from 44 countries will be able to make use of the telescope, with proposals including using the infrared capabilities to penetrate the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, including our own."The discovery capability of Webb is limited only by our own imaginations, and scientists around the world will soon be using this general purpose observatory to take us places we haven't dreamed of going before," said Smith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-giant-webb-telescope-succeeds-in-key-pre-launch-test-101620777975535.html

If you compete for resources... then the virus gets the advantage.”Nepal: Foreign climbers return to Mount EverestForeigners climbed Mount Everest for the first time since Nepal reopened the mountain after it was shut last year due to the pandemic, despite coronavirus cases being reported at its base camp in recent days.Thirty-eight climbers including ten Bahraini and two British mountaineers climbed the world’s highest mountain on Tuesday, according to hiking companies.WHO warns against use of ivermectin for CovidThe WHO has recommended against the use of the orally-administered drug ivermectin for treating those suffering from Covid-19.“Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. WHO recommends against use of ‘ivermectin’ for Covid-19 except within clinical trials,” Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-cases-deaths-are-plateauing-who-chief-101620777468917.html
12-05-2021||World||Hamas rockets target Tel Aviv after Israeli strikes flatten Gaza tower||Palestinian militants Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at Israel's economic hub Tel Aviv on Tuesday in retaliation for an Israeli strike that destroyed a tower block in Gaza, as the foes traded their heaviest fire for several years.The sharp escalation, triggered by violence in Jerusalem, has killed at least 32 Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip and three Israelis, and wounded hundreds more."This is just the beginning" of Israel's strikes, Defence Minister Benny Gantz warned.Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh vowed that "if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it."Watch: Indian woman killed in Hamas airstrike in Israel; condolences pour inThe UN envoy for Middle East Peace, Tor Wennesland, warned that Israel and Hamas were "escalating towards a full-scale war".In the crowded, Israeli-blockaded enclave of Gaza, 10 children and one woman were among those killed since Monday night.A further 220 people were reported wounded from the ongoing Israeli air strikes, many rescued from the smouldering ruins of buildings.- 'It was scary' -In Israel, sirens sounded as Hamas rockets rained down, and some of those unable to make it to underground shelters took cover under bridges."It was scary," said Haim Roy Ben Shlomo, 38, resident of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv, adding he had heard "several loud shots, or booms, above our heads."An Israeli woman was killed as rockets hit Rishon Letzion on the coastal city's southern edge, while in nearby Holon, AFP footage showed a burnt-out bus as rescue workers cleaned up debris.The rocket fire forced Israel to suspend flights at its main airport of Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod which borders the airport, as police said "wide-scale riots erupted by some of the Arab residents".Reinforcements were sent to the area after clashes broke out the night after an Israeli Arab was killed in the city.- 'Hell' -In Gaza, people sifted through debris after an Israeli air strike destroyed a 12-storey building.Hamas, which controls the Palestinian territory, said the tower block had been a residential building. AFP reporters said it also houses offices of several Hamas officials.Hamas threatened to turn the nearby Israeli city of Ashkelon into "hell", and rockets fired by militants in Gaza killed two women there.At one stage the group claimed to have fired more than 100 rockets in under five minutes to overwhelm air defences.At least 100 Israelis were injured in Tuesday's escalation.Israel's army said more than 600 rockets had been fired since Monday from Gaza towards Israel mainly by Hamas, which rules Gaza, and the Islamic Jihad group.Many landed inside Gaza or were taken out by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad confirmed they had commanders who had died in the Israeli strikes.- 'Fighting will intensify' -Army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Israel estimated it had killed 20 Islamist militants in Gaza, warning that "our expectation is the fighting will intensify".Asked about unconfirmed reports that Hamas was seeking a ceasefire, Conricus said: "I don't think my commanders are aware, or particularly interested."A member of the Palestinian intelligence services was killed and another wounded by Israeli army gunfire in the north of the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian security source told AFP.The Israeli army reported an attempted drive-by shooting, saying "two assailants were neutralised at the scene".Weeks of tensions boiled over when Israeli riot police clashed with crowds of Palestinians at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque, on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Nightly clashes since then at the compound, which is holy to both Muslims and Jews, and elsewhere in east Jerusalem have left at least 700 Palestinians injured.Palestinians clashed again with Israeli officers in riot gear on Tuesday evening, with 245 injured, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.Hamas had warned Israel on Monday to withdraw all its forces from the mosque compound and the Jerusalem district of Sheikh Jarrah, where looming evictions of Palestinian families have fuelled protests.Sirens wailed across Jerusalem just after the deadline as people in the city, including lawmakers in the Knesset legislature, fled to bunkers for the first time since the 2014 Gaza conflict.- Another UN emergency meeting -Diplomatic sources told AFP that Egypt and Qatar, who have mediated past Israeli-Hamas conflicts, were attempting to calm tensions.But Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told an emergency Arab League meeting that although Cairo had "extensively reached out" to Israel and other countries, "we did not get the necessary response".The UN Security Council was set to discuss the violence at an emergency meeting on Wednesday.A previous meeting on Monday ended without a joint statement, with the United States expressing reluctance to adopt a draft statement "at this point".Large protests were held in solidarity with Palestinians around the world, including in London, as well as in Muslim-majority countries including Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Tunisia and Turkey.Five members of a single family were killed by an Israeli strike in northern Gaza on Tuesday, including young brothers Ibrahim and Marwan, who were filling sacks of straw when it hit."We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire," their cousin, also called Ibrahim, told AFP."I saw my cousins set alight, and torn into pieces," said the 14-year-old, breaking down in tears."Why did they leave me? I would have wanted to die as a martyr like them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hamas-rockets-target-tel-aviv-after-israeli-strikes-flatten-gaza-tower-101620777852361.html

He took a picture, posted it on a neighborhood blog with a warning for people to stay away, and called an emergency police number."It was very scary because this is a very family-oriented community, and you see lots of kids and (babies) strolling," Ramos said.Wes Manion, an off-duty sheriff's deputy who lives in the area, saw the post, raced to the scene and confronted the cat with a revolver in footage filmed by neighbors."Last thing I wanted to do was shoot the tiger," Manion told another TV station, KHOU. "It didn't seem super aggressive."Cuevas was known to police because he was free on bond awaiting a murder trial.On Twitter, people feasted on news of the missing feline."Are you conducting a meownhunt? Is pawrole on the table?" wrote @CooperEarlJones."There must be some claws in the statute that says this is allowed," quipped @EssBee44.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bengal-tiger-seen-roaming-around-in-texas-neighborhood-owner-arrested-101620777550363.html
12-05-2021||World||Pipeline shutdown sparks fear of US gasoline shortage||Fears the shutdown of a major fuel pipeline network would cause a gasoline shortage led to some panic buying and prompted US regulators on Tuesday to temporarily suspend clean fuel requirements in three eastern states and the nation's capital.While it remained unclear the degree to which supplies would be affected, drivers lined up to fill their tanks at gas stations in the southeast, with some carrying extra containers amid fears of fuel scarcity.A ransomware attack Friday on Colonial Pipeline forced the company to shut down its entire network, but government officials on Tuesday urged calm and said the situation is only temporary.The operator of the largest fuel conduit system in the United States, Colonial Pipeline sends gasoline and jet fuel from the Gulf Coast of Texas to the populous east coast through 5,500 miles (8,850 kilometers) of ducts that serve 50 million consumers.The company said it expects to have the pipeline network fully up and running by the end of the week.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said some areas "may feel a supply crunch, as Colonial fully resumes."However, "there should be no cause for hoarding gasoline, especially in the light of the fact that the pipeline should be substantially operational by the end of this week and over the weekend," she told reporters at the White House.The shutdown raised fears the shortages would cause gasoline prices to spike just ahead of the US Memorial Day holiday, the unofficial kickoff to the summer travel season.But Granholm called on station owners to act responsibly and said, "We will have no tolerance for price gouging."The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday announced a one-week suspension of clean air rules in an effort to ease supply issues.The waiver is meant "to address the fuel supply emergency caused by a cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline's computer networks that led to the pipeline's shutdown," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a letter to the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia and the mayor of Washington.Regan said the EPA and Energy Department "have been actively monitoring the supply of fuel" and found that "the unusual pipeline shutdown has affected gasoline supplies."- No gas by nightfall? -The EPA move, effective through May 18, suspends rules that require urban areas to use fuel with additives like MTBE, which makes gasoline less polluting but also more expensive.The waiver "is necessary to take action to minimize or prevent disruption of an adequate supply of gasoline to consumers," Regan said.That followed the weekend announcement from the Transportation Department that it was easing up on time limits for drivers of tankers carrying diesel, gasoline and jet fuel to 18 of the most affected states, and is considering easing shipping rules as well."Everybody's seeing the news, you know, they get fearful, then everybody rushes out and gets gas. They're filling up gas cans and everything," one gas station manager in Raleigh, North Carolina told AFP."We'll be out of gas before the sun goes down if it stays this way."Oil industry analyst Patrick De Haan said on Twitter the national average gasoline price reached $2.97 a gallon, "matching the highest since 2018."While he said some gasoline stations along the east coast are running out of fuel, including a little over five percent in Georgia and 7.5 percent or more in North Carolina and Virginia, he cautioned against overreacting."Rack prices, or the prices stations pay for gasoline, rose only by a couple of cents today throughout the southeastern US. There is no pending spike coming to (gas prices) in the area, folks. No reason to freak out," De Haan said.Oil prices already had been on the rise as the global economy bounces back from the Covid-19 pandemic, rebounding to just over $68 a barrel on Tuesday from less than $22 in April 2020.John Catsimatidis, CEO of United Refining Company, which processes more than 70,000 barrels per day of oil and owns more than 400 gas stations in the New York area, said on Monday that the pipeline shutdown will send prices higher, estimating an impact of "at least four cents a gallon."Colonial said late Tuesday it was making progress in "around-the-clock efforts to return our system to service."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pipeline-shutdown-sparks-fear-of-us-gasoline-shortage-101620777315513.html

12-05-2021||World||Gaza boils as Hamas, Israel clash||A confrontation between Israel and Hamas sparked by weeks of tensions in contested Jerusalem escalated on Tuesday. Israel unleashed new airstrikes on Gaza, killing a number of militants and civilians, while militants barraged southern Israel with hundreds of rockets, killing two Israelis.On Tuesday night, the Israeli city of Tel Aviv was under fire from a barrage of rockets launched from the Gaza Strip.The outgoing volleys set off air raid sirens across the city, and Israel’s anti-rocket defence systems were activated.Hamas said it launched a total of 130 rockets, its most intense strike so far, in response to Israel’s destruction of a high-rise building in Gaza earlier in the evening.Since sundown on Monday, 28 Palestinians - including 10 children and a woman - were killed in Gaza, most by airstrikes, health officials there said. The Israeli military said at least 16 of the dead were militants.Two women were killed by rockets fired from Gaza that hit their homes in the southern city of Ashkelon - the first Israeli deaths in the current violence. At least 10 other Israelis have been wounded since Monday.Netanyahu vows to step up attacks on HamasAfter those deaths, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said officials decided to “increase both the strength and rate of the strikes” against militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. “Hamas will receive blows now that it didn’t expect,” he said.Egypt was trying to broker a ceasefire, but the cycle of violence was gaining momentum. Even before the two Israeli deaths, the Israeli military said it was sending troop reinforcements to the Gaza border and the defence minister ordered the mobilisation of 5,000 reserve soldiers.The barrage of rockets and airstrikes was preceded by hours of clashes on Monday between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, including dramatic confrontations at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque compound. The current violence has been fuelled by conflicting claims over Jerusalem, which is at the emotional core of the long conflict.In a sign of widening unrest, hundreds of residents of Arab communities in Israel staged overnight demonstrations denouncing the recent actions of Israeli security forces against Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-boils-as-hamas-israel-clash-101620777106168.html
12-05-2021||World||US working closely with India on Covid-19 crisis: White House official||The US is working closely with India on its continued and emerging needs during the unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a top State Department official has said.While the assistance from the US government has been worth USD 100 million, the private sector has donated an additional USD 400 million, totalling half a billion dollars to India, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Tuesday.“We are continuing to work closely with Indian officials and health experts to identify continued needs and emerging needs in this ongoing crisis,” he said.“I was talking about our catalytic effect in another context earlier… Secretary (of State) Tony Blinken, Special Coordinator Gayle Smith participated in calls the other week with the US India Business Council and the Chamber of Commerce in an effort to elicit additional supplies from the private sector, which we'd be terrifically gratified to see,” Price said.Earlier in the day, top American senator Mark Warner spoke with India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu and assured his full commitment for the assistance to India.“India right now is at the epicenter of Covid-19. This morning I spoke with the Indian ambassador and pledged to do our part to help the Indian people respond to the surge. I will continue working with the Biden administration on this,” Warner said after the call.Warner is Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.“Thanked him for his strong support for India during this challenging time,” Sandhu tweeted.Congressman Andy Levin said that more needs to be done for India.“We cannot lose sight of the catastrophe wracking India right now. While the US is starting to work to make vaccines more accessible, we must do more. The Indian people need equipment and other tools now to end this crisis,” he said.Meanwhile, the 4th consignment of more than 78,000 doses of Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences reached India.“More than 2,61,000 have reached so far, in addition to US Government support of around 1,25,000 doses. More to follow!” the Indian envoy tweeted.Congresswoman Deborah Ross said that helping India respond to this latest wave is humane and is in the US' national interest as this pandemic will not end anywhere until it ends everywhere.“Please consider supporting groups that are providing what is needed locally on the ground,” she said.Noting that India is seeing daily new Covid-19 cases at 400,000, and the deaths are catastrophic, Indian-American congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said that he is pushing the Biden administration to slow this dangerous rise in cases through sharing resources.“A Covid-19 fire anywhere in the world is a threat to us,” he said.According to Price, there have now been six airlifts to India deployed by the USAID in the course of six days.Among the supplies included in those airlifts are 20,000 courses of Remdesivir, nearly 1,500 oxygen cylinders, 550 mobile oxygen concentrators, 1 million rapid diagnostic tests, nearly 2.5 million N95 masks, large scale deployable oxygen concentration system and pulse oximeters, he said.“In addition, USAID immediately allocated funding to purchase locally an additional 1,000 mobile oxygen concentrators,” Price added.Meanwhile, Pentagon Spokesperson Peter Hughes said in response to a question that currently the Defence Logistics Agency is preparing 159 oxygen concentrators at Travis Air Force Base scheduled to ship via commercial air for a Monday delivery to India."We remain in close communication with our partners in the Indian Government“As (Defence) Secretary (Loyd) Austin has said previously, we’re committed to use every resource at our disposal, within our authority, to support India’s frontline healthcare workers,” he said.India has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds.After recording over four lakh fresh cases for four consecutive days, India witnessed a single-day rise of 3,66,161 Covid-19 cases on Monday and 3,29,942 infections on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-working-closely-with-india-on-covid-19-crisis-white-house-official-101620775813425.html

12-05-2021||World||India reopened prematurely, causing ongoing Covid surge: Top US medical adviser||Top public health officials of the Biden administration told US lawmakers on Tuesday that the ongoing devastating surge in Covid-19 cases in India is the result of an “incorrect assumption” that led to reopening “prematurely” and it has become a cautionary tale of the dangers of not being careful.“The reason that India is in such dire straits now is that they had an original surge and made the incorrect assumption that they were finished with it,” Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases and chief medical adviser to the US president, said at a Senate hearing when asked what lessons could be learnt from the situation in India.He added that “they opened up prematurely and wound up having a surge right now that we’re all very well aware of is extremely devastating”.Fauci is known for offering straightforward assessments and views that had put him at odds with former president Donald Trump and his conservative allies such as Senator Rand Paul, who continue to question his views.Fauci went on to list two more lessons emerging from India’s ongoing battle with the second wave of Covid-19 cases and fatalities, which are projected by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research body, to rise cumulatively to 1.49 million by September 1.The second lesson from India, Fauci said, is the need for “preparedness”. “We need to continue to build up our local public health infrastructure which over the last decades, we have led to actually in many respects go into disarray, likely because of our successes in controlling so many diseases,” he said.The third lesson, Fauci said, “is that this is a global pandemic that requires a global response, and we need to pay attention to the responsibility that we have not only for our own country but to join with other countries, to make sure that we have the access to interventions, particularly vaccines, throughout the world”.The epidemiologist pointed to a new variant of Sars-Cov2 detected in India, B.1.617. “We have a threat here in the United States, particularly with variants and you know this one variant in India.”Fauci, who has shaped the Biden administration’s response to the pandemic, pressed for the need to send Covid-19 vaccines to India and other countries, over and above the supplies already sent to India, such as oxygen cylinders, PPE kits, therapeutic drugs and test kits.Rochelle Walensky, who heads the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cited India as a cautionary tale of what to not do. With more people getting vaccinated, she said while giving senators an update on the situation in the US and abroad, “we are cautiously optimistic. However, globally the pandemic is more severe than ever. India’s surge of cases is tragic and a reminder that the virus can rapidly outstrip our efforts to contain it, if we are not careful”. More than 152 million Americans have received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine so far, which is 57.2% of the eligible population and 46% of the total population.While the US government has sent assistance worth $100 million to India, it has also indefinitely suspended travel from the country on the advice of the CDC due to - as the White House said in an announcement in April end - the Covid-19 “caseloads and multiple variants circulating in India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-reopened-prematurely-causing-ongoing-covid-surge-top-us-medical-adviser-101620758068086.html
12-05-2021||World||US looking at joint production of Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India||The US is looking at the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in India and ways to help Indian manufacturers, such as the Serum Institute of India (SII), ramp up production to meet vaccine needs around the globe, a senior American diplomat said on Tuesday.US chargé d’affaires Daniel Smith said the US stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines – currently believed to be 10 million doses – can’t be shared with other countries till the jabs are certified as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of problems associated with the plant that manufactured them.Smith, a career diplomat who served as acting secretary of state, was named the acting head of the US mission in New Delhi last month to help oversee the Biden administration’s efforts to help India cope with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen daily infection rates surge well past the 350,000-mark for several days.He told a virtual news briefing the US administration is working on a list of raw materials and other supplies urgently needed to manufacture vaccines but cautioned this wouldn’t be an easy task because of disruptions to global supply chains.“We are now working closely with them to go through this list to decide what is available, what we can provide and how quickly we can provide that. I just want to say this is not an easy task, that is, there are global challenges in the global supply chain right now when it comes to precursors and raw materials necessary for these vaccines,” Smith said.In addition to working with the SII and other Indian vaccine manufacturers on ways to boost production, the US is looking into the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India and encouraging private sector discussions to ramp up manufacturing.“I know [the US International] Development Finance Corporation is looking at how we can invest so that we can help produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine here in India,” Smith said.“I think we are watching carefully the production levels at the SII and elsewhere. We’ve been in close touch with the SII to try to determine what raw materials we could provide, and assistance that we can provide to help boost production. But that’s an issue with vaccines across the board, it’s not simply with the AstraZeneca vaccine in that regard,” he said in response to a question from HT about what India and the US are doing to ramp up production to help other countries through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad.At a time when India and other countries are hoping the US will begin shipping doses from its stockpile of some 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Smith said this wouldn’t be possible till the FDA certifies the safety and efficacy of the vaccines made at a plant outside Baltimore.The FDA is investigating an error at the Baltimore plant that led to ingredients of the AstraZeneca shot contaminating a batch of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which were being made at the same facility.“I know that there are a number of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were made in the plant outside of Baltimore, but there were problems with this plant. So far, the FDA hasn’t certified that these vaccines are available for anyone’s use, for export or not. So I can’t say when that will happen or what will be done exactly as we go forward,” Smith said.The Biden administration, he added, decided not to use the AstraZeneca jabs as it has sufficient stocks of three other vaccines, and is “eager to supply these to the world but we won’t do so before we’re assured that they are safe and effective”.The US is determined to do all it can to help boost India’s vaccine production because Washington recognises New Delhi’s critical role in helping the world counter the pandemic. “Our global partnership with India, when it comes to vaccines and vaccine production, is essential for the world’s emergence from this pandemic. We recognise that in helping India, we’re helping a lot more than just India,” Smith said.Smith also cautioned that a proposal by India and South Africa for waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO) would be a long and complex process despite support extended by the Biden administration.“The WTO is a consensus-based organisation. So, we’re going to have to negotiate this with our partners in the WTO as we go forward... We’re not just waiting for that to take place, what we’re also doing is ramping up all of our efforts across the board, in partnership with India and other countries, to increase production of Covid-19 vaccines and increase availability,” he said.“We are concerned obviously with the current course of the pandemic in India, not simply because of the humanitarian catastrophe but the fact that it has global implications... India’s role as the supplier for not just what was envisioned by the Quad but for much of the world when it comes to vaccines is critical,” he added.As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India exported more than 65 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative but supplies have slowed to a trickle since March as domestic infection rates surged.Smith said the US plans to work with European partners and other countries that have additional AstraZeneca doses to help countries in the region whose vaccine supplies were affected once India began focusing on its second wave. “The challenge is nobody has studied the viability of using a different vaccine for the second dose...Some countries may even resort to starting over with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but obviously if we could solve this by providing a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, that would be the simplest and best solution,” he said.He outlined the aid worth more than $100 million that the US has provided to India, mainly oxygen-related equipment and medical supplies, and said the US side is working closely with the Indian government on the use of this official assistance. “I think we have very good visibility to where that assistance is gone,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-looking-at-joint-production-of-j-j-vaccine-in-india-101620740066908.html
