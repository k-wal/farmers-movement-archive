01-05-2021||World||More perilous phase ahead for Biden after his first 100 days||Joe Biden's presidency is entering a new and more perilous phase where he is almost certain to face stiffer Republican opposition and also have difficulty keeping Democrats united as he pushes for $4 trillion in additional spending on programs that have echoes of the New Deal and the Great Society.Past the 100-day mark, with positive approval ratings and a far-reaching, nearly $2 trillion Covid-19 relief bill to show for it, Biden is now facing far more uncertain terrain. The president is racing against the calendar, governing with the most slender of majorities on Capitol Hill while knowing that historically the party that holds the White House loses seats in midterm elections, which would cost Democrats control of Congress after the 2022 vote.His next 100 days will feature his first foreign trip but will be dominated by his push to pass his expansive plans on infrastructure and children, families and education, which would expand the social safety net for children, increase taxes on the wealthy and fund projects that his critics say are infrastructure in name only.Overall, his approach is less about stimulating the economy than stabilizing it over the long term with middle-class jobs, and proving that a democracy, even a bitterly divided one, remains capable of doing big things.“In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us: In America, we do our part,” Biden said in his address to Congress on Wednesday night. “That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.”Biden has made personal overtures to Republicans in Congress, but the efforts were aimed at least as much at Republican voters, who have been far more supportive of his plans. A nod to bipartisanship is also important to reassure moderate Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia that the president is at least trying to win over Republicans, even if in the end he might push ahead without them.His task may be easier given the hopeful signs of a strong economic recovery, with an annualized growth rate of 6.4% during the first three months of the year. With the relief bill passed, Biden’s economic team is now able to focus on structural issues such as income inequality, systemic racism and shortfalls in public investment.“These were ideas that were germinating pre-pandemic,” said Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. “It feels like these are things that we’ve known we needed to do.”Several aides are now focused on distributing billions of dollars from the relief package for housing assistance, school upgrades and state and local government aid.The administration also wants to measure the results of the spending to show Congress that its relief programs are succeeding.One example: The expanded child tax credit is of critical importance because Biden has proposed extending the one-year increase through 2025 as part of his families plan.“We know that implementing the enhanced child tax credit right is critical not just to cutting child poverty this year but to showing it can be done well so that it builds support for extending it on and on,” said Gene Sperling, named by Biden to oversee the relief programs.With such expensive and wide-ranging programs, Biden has not shied away from comparisons between his own ambitious legislative agenda and those championed by a pair of his Democratic predecessors, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. When the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill was passed in March, Biden gathered with Harris and a few senior staff members in the Roosevelt Room to watch the vote.Biden recalled that it was in that room where, as vice president, he and President Back Obama watched the final passage of the Affordable Care Act some 11 years earlier. But he remembered that room being packed with people, something impossible to do during the pandemic.“If we didn’t have Covid, we’d probably all be raising a glass together but instead this is what we are doing,” Biden said, according to two White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about private moments.The meaning was clear: Even in a moment of triumph, the pandemic was ever-present. But now, with virus cases falling and vaccinations spreading, Biden must guide the nation toward reopening from Covid-19 lockdowns.He took a cautious step Tuesday by highlighting changing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on outdoor mask-wearing. More fundamental steps are ahead as Biden tries to guide the country toward resuming normal activities, fully reopening offices and schools and safely fulfilling pent-up demand for travel, dining and entertainment.To this point, the public has largely gone along. Gallup polling shows Biden’s average approval rating over his first three months in office is 56%, higher than Donald Trump’s at 41% but slightly lower than Barack Obama’s at 63%.But Biden fares less well on some specific issues such as immigration and the border. West Wing officials were caught off guard by the rise in the number of migrants, many of them children, streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border, creating a humanitarian upheaval and handing Republicans a political cudgel.“The border and immigration has been a huge challenge, and it will continue to be in the next 100 days and beyond,” said David Axelrod, who was a senior advisor to Obama. “The president’s desire to confront issues like gun violence and voting rights may continue to outstrip the capacity a bare Senate majority allows, which may anger his progressive base.”Biden has counseled patience to some of the left, stressing the importance of sequencing legislation, prioritizing the infrastructure plan before turning to thornier issues such as immigration, voting rights, guns and policing. The president blitzed through executive actions on those issues but will likely need cooperation with Congress for any meaningful action.That won't be easy. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, derided Biden's agenda as a “multitrillion-dollar shopping list that was neither designed nor intended to earn bipartisan buy-in, a blueprint for giving Washington even more money and even more power to micromanage American families.”There has been some bipartisan momentum on policing after the guilty verdict in the killing of George Floyd, a Black Man, who died under the knee of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer. But gridlock threatens other issues, with rising chatter from Democrats on Capitol Hill that a change to the filibuster may be needed.“Things will begin to percolate on parallel tracks,” said White House senior adviser Steve Ricchetti. “There is a lot of work on immigration and police reform and criminal justice reform being done in the committees and in the White House, we’re engaged in serious, healthy dialogue. And then we’ll see what’s ready to go and when.”But Biden will also have to turn his focus to international affairs.The defining relationship will be with China, which Biden invokes as an economic rival that can only be defeated if democracy is repaired at home. He has so far largely continued Trump's tough approach and maintained most tariffs.He has ordered urgent help to India, a nation reeling from Covid-19. In a jam on Iran sanctions, the president will be forced to choose which Trump-era sanctions to lift in a bid to coax Tehran back into compliance with the its nuclear deal.In June, he is scheduled to make his first trip overseas as commander in chief, heading to Britain for an economic summit and then to Brussels to pledge support to NATO, the military alliance built as a bulwark to Moscow’s aggression.And, while not finalized, negotiations are being held to add a third stop: a summit, elsewhere in Europe, with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-perilous-phase-ahead-for-biden-after-his-first-100-days-101619885977274.html
01-05-2021||World||Roger Stone says he took ‘not a dime’ from anyone seeking Trump pardon||Republican operative Roger Stone denied asking a political ally of U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz for $250,000 in exchange for attempting to secure a pardon in a child sex-trafficking and identity-theft case.The Daily Beast reported Thursday that Stone offered to help Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector who’s expected to plead guilty this month, get a pardon from President Donald Trump before he left office. The pardon was never granted.The report was based on alleged text messages between Stone and Greenberg, as well as an alleged written confession by Greenberg saying that he and Gaetz, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, paid for sex with women as well as with a 17-year-old girl.Stone, who was himself pardoned by Trump after being convicted of lying to Congress and tampering with witnesses in an effort to protect the president during the Russia probe, said in a text message late Friday that his communications with Greenberg were “clipped out of context.”“I told Greenberg he would need a lawyer (I am not a lawyer) and that he should be prepared to wire a $250,000 retainer to the right lawyer if he could find one,” Stone said. “I made no effort whatsoever to secure a pardon for Mr. Greenberg and I took not a dime from him or anyone else seeking a pardon.”The Daily Beast report quotes Stone saying to Greenberg in a Jan. 13 text, “I hope you are prepared to wire me $250,000 because I am feeling confident.”Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. His outside public relations firm, Logan Circle Group, said in a statement Saturday about the Daily Beast report that details of the criminal case against Greenberg are evidence of his ability to deceive and distort the truth. The firm pointed to an April report on Greenberg’s case by Politico, including federal claims that he created a bogus Facebook account to falsely accuse a teacher of having sex with a child.“Congressman Gaetz has never paid for sex, nor has he had sex with a 17 year old as an adult,” Logan Circle Group said. “Politico has reported Mr. Greenberg’s threats to make false accusations against others, and while The Daily Beast’s story contains a lot of confessions from Mr. Greenberg, it does not add anything of substance, and certainly no evidence for the wild and false claims about Rep. Gaetz.”Greenberg’s lawyer, Fritz Scheller, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call or email seeking comment on Saturday.Around the time Greenberg’s plan to plead guilty was revealed in court on April 8, Gaetz hired one of Trump’s criminal defense lawyers, Marc Mukasey, as well as a new spokesperson and political analyst, Logan Circle Group’s Erin Elmore, who was once a contestant on Trump’s “The Apprentice” reality TV show.Stone said Greenberg was implicating others because “desperate men often tell lies.”“I have seen no substantiation or actual proof of any of the wild accusations he has made against Congressman Gaetz,” Stone said.At the April hearing, Greenberg agreed with prosecutors that his case “should resolve by guilty plea” at a hearing set for May 15 before U.S. District Judge Gregory A. Presnell in Orlando.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roger-stone-says-he-took-not-a-dime-from-anyone-seeking-trump-pardon-101619888466737.html

The letter has been signed by Pramila Jayapal, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Ro Khanna, Karen Bass, Brad Sherman and others.The demand found support among Democratic Senators too as 10 of them, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Baldwin, Sherrod Brown, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Murphy, Jeff Merkley, Ed Markey, Chris Van Hollen and Raphael Warnock, wrote to Biden urging him to support the proposal of the temporary TRIPS waiver."Our globalised economy cannot recover if only parts of the world are vaccinated. In the end, the TRIPS waiver will help us all. This temporary TRIPS waiver is key for countries to manufacture necessary supplies of COVID19 treatments and vaccines. The current flexibilities included in TRIPS are ill-suited to an urgent, global crisis. TRIPS allows countries to negotiate compulsory licenses, a flexibility that was reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration. However, compulsory licenses must be negotiated by each WTO member country and for each patent or other protection applying to each individual product," the letter said.India, South Africa to make fresh push for waiver of vaccine patents at WTOThe waiver was proposed by India and South Africa in October 2020 before vaccination against Covid-19 started. The proposal sought the lifting of certain intellectual property barriers so that countries can locally manufacture vaccines and therapeutics. The Trump administration at that time blocked the proposal."This temporary TRIPS waiver is key for countries to manufacture necessary supplies of COVID19 treatments and vaccines. The current flexibilities included in TRIPS are ill-suited to an urgent, global crisis. TRIPS allows countries to negotiate compulsory licenses, a flexibility that was reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration," the letter said.However, compulsory licenses must be negotiated by each WTO member country and for each patent or other protection applying to each individual product, the signatories said.Though there is the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, which promises equitable distribution of vaccines and two billion vaccine doses t developing countries by the end of 2021, the amount would cover only 20 per cent of all participating countries, the congressmen said."As Covid-19 ravages the globe, we know that any vaccine or therapeutic pharmaceutical corporations develop with public money is 100% ineffective for those that cannot access it. We need to make public policy choices, both in the U.S. and at the WTO, that put lives first. Your Administration has an incredible opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump Administration to our nation's global reputation and restore America's public health leadership on the world stage," they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reverse-damage-done-by-trump-congressmen-write-to-biden-on-india-s-trips-waiver-proposal-101619888094611.html
01-05-2021||World||Turkey adds cryptocurrency exchanges to terror funding rules||A presidential decree published Saturday added cryptocurrency exchanges to a list of firms covered by Turkey’s terror financing and money laundering.The move came after a ban on using cryptocurrencies for making payments, which was introduced in response to claims that such transactions are too risky, took effect in Turkey on Friday.The presidential decree makes “crypto asset service providers” responsible for seeing their assets are not used illegally. The decree immediately went into force with its publication in Turkey’s Official Gazette.Turkish authorities last month launched fraud investigations into two cryptocurrency exchanges, Thodex and Vebitcoin. Six suspects linked to the Thodex probe were jailed Friday pending trial.The investigation into Thodex, which handled daily trades of hundreds of millions of dollars, initially led to the arrests of 83 people after customers complained of not being able to access their funds. Interpol issued a detention warrant for the firm’s CEO on Turkey’s behalf.Turks have been increasingly attracted by cryptocurrencies as protection against the decline of the lira and double-digit inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-adds-cryptocurrency-exchanges-to-terror-funding-rules-101619865537509.html
01-05-2021||World||Pakistan to seek debt restructuring of CPEC power projects||Islamabad is set to seek debt restructuring of USD 3 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) energy projects and request China to consider restructuring of the repayments for 10 to 12 years in a bid to eliminate the need for increasing power tariff in the country.This is part of the Imran Khan government's proposals to minimize tariff increase requirements under a recently approved debt management plan, The Express Tribune reported."The country is scheduled to make PKR 435 billion or nearly USD 3 billion principal repayments to 12 Chinese independent power producers in three years," Special Assistant to the PM on Power and Petroleum Tabish Gohar told The Express Tribune."The government will request China to consider restructuring of the USD 3 billion repayments for 10 to 12 years, which in return will reduce the tariff increase requirements by PRK 1.50 per unit."According to the Pakistani daily, China has set up two dozen power plants under the CPEC and the repayments of the Chinese debt are included in the electricity tariffs. "We do not want to embarrass our friend, but the fact is that half of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs') payments are related to Chinese power projects," the Special Assistant added.Sources told The Express Tribune that the Pakistan government had also earlier made an attempt to renegotiate the IPPs deals but China declined to reopen them.Amid lack of progress on several CPEC projects, subtle signs of unease have emerged between the two countries over the future direction and funding of mega projects, under increasing scrutiny of media and the public.According to a report published in Modern Diplomacy, the outcome of recent meetings between the two countries reveals significant scaling down of Pakistan's expectations regarding the inclusion of more projects under CPEC phase II.Fabien Baussart in an opinion piece for Modern Diplomacy last month had said, "While the country has for long portrayed USD 6.8 billion Main Line-I project to be the main artery of the Pakistan Railways and tried to convince China for financing the project, the Chinese side has tried to avoid any commitment for funding."Pakistan has been unable to secure any favourable consideration including the concessionary loan at an interest rate of one per cent, said Baussart while adding that China is only willing to offer a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project backed by suitable guarantees by Pakistan.In 2015, China announced an economic project in Pakistan worth USD 46 billion. With the CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India.The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometres west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail, and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-seek-debt-restructuring-of-cpec-power-projects-101619869285818.html
01-05-2021||World||Nepal reports high Covid-19 cases, govt says hospital beds shortage||The Nepali government on Saturday reported a record spike in Covid-19 cases with the second wave of coronavirus hitting the Himalayan country."A total of 5,763 Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours," Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population said on Saturday. The last record of highest coronavirus cases in a day was reported on October 21 last year, when the Nepali government reported 5,743 cases.Nepal, which had reported cases as low as 47 on March 6, had started to see a rise in the cases in late March. But the cases have been surging rapidly in the last two weeks. In the last week, the number of cases more than doubled from 2,619 on April 24 to over 5,700 on Saturday.Along with rising cases, hospitals are running out of beds which prompted the health ministry to issue a stern warning on Friday that the cases were rising at the scale that the health system was not able to cope with."Such a situation has arisen now that the patients cannot be provided care at the hospitals as they are running out of beds," the ministry said in a press statement on Friday.This is obviously true in the case of Kathmandu-based Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital where patients exceeding the number of hospital beds have been admitted."We have a total of 60 beds in our hospital but we are providing treatment to 78 patients at the moment," Sagar Kumar Rajbhandari, director of the hospital, told Xinhua on Saturday. "We have five beds in the emergency ward but there are 18 patients there including in the adjoining corridor waiting for the occupied beds to become vacant."In order to control the surging cases, the Nepali government has enforced a lockdown in the Kathmandu valley starting from April 29 for two weeks while similar measures are being adopted in many other parts of the country.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre headed by Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister Ishawar Pokharel on Friday recommended to the cabinet to suspend international flights amid the coronavirus crisis, according to Nepali media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-reports-high-covid-19-cases-govt-says-hospital-beds-shortage-101619878490134.html

Iran has refused to hold direct meetings with U.S. officials.Washington pulled out of the deal in 2018 under President Donald Trump and reimposed sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded as of 2019 by breaching many of the deal's limits on its nuclear activities."We should not expect breakthroughs in the days to come," Russia's ambassador to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Mikhail Ulyanov, told reporters after a meeting of the remaining parties that wrapped up the third round of talks. He was the only official to address reporters."We need simply to continue diplomatic, day-to-day work, and we have all the reasons to expect that the outcome, (the) final outcome, will be successful and it will come quite soon, in a few weeks," he said, adding that talks will reconvene on Friday.The break in talks was widely expected as diplomats said officials from several countries are also involved in the Group of Seven foreign ministers' meeting in London that begins on Monday and ends on Wednesday.Russia is generally one of the more optimistic voices at the talks. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday the talks were in "an unclear place", meaning it was uncertain whether they would lead to an agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-talks-make-progress-and-will-resume-friday-russia-101619883094197.html
01-05-2021||World||New Jersey teacher suspended after profane Floyd comments to class||A New Jersey high school teacher has been suspended with pay after profanity-laced comments to students in his class about George Floyd, the man killed by a Minneapolis police officer.A recording aired by WNBC-TV shows Dickinson High School science teacher Howard Zlotkin talking about Floyd and Black Lives Matter during what was supposed to be a climate change discussion in a landscape and design Zoom class.Zlotkin, who is white, is heard to say people are “whining and crying about Black Lives Matter," and he then refers to Floyd with a profanity as a “criminal" who “got arrested and he got killed because he wouldn’t comply." Another profanity is heard as he continues that Floyd is being treated as a “hero."The video and one taken the next day also included a profanity directed at a student and a vulgar gesture, WNBC reported. The student said Zlotkin grew irate when she and three other students challenged his position, and the four were told to write an essay on “why Black lives should matter” — an assignment not given to other students.Superintendent Franklin Walker told NJ.com that the language used was “unacceptable.” He said the district is investigating the situation and that police have also been notified “because some of it could be at the same level as a hate crime.”“The comments that were made were very biased and he shouldn’t be having that kind of discussion with the children — that had nothing to do with the subject matter in the classroom,” Walker said. “The position that he put the children in certainly was a very uncomfortable one by doing and saying those kinds of things.”The teachers’ union declined comment until it has more information, union president Ron Greco said.Jersey City Public Schools said in a statement late Thursday that the school had been taking statements from students “before proceeding with disciplinary actions" until video from the second day's class surfaced.“The teacher will not have access to students or the school as we proceed," spokesperson Norma Fernandez said in the statement quoted on WNBC. “”We are appalled by the statements, profanity, disrespect and treatment of students.”Zlotkin, who has been at Dickinson High School for 20 years, has also been suspended with pay from his adjunct professor position at Hudson County Community College, NJ.com reported. Spokeswoman Jennifer Christopher said “offensive and derogatory language” violates the college’s anti-harassment policy and professional conduct policy.A message seeking comment was sent Saturday to Zlotkin, who declined comment to the New York Times, citing the investigation, but calling the footage a “very well-edited sound bite" and said he would “love one day to give my side of the story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-jersey-teacher-suspended-after-profane-floyd-comments-to-class-101619884777881.html

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which handles these sales, notified the US congress of the clearance of the deal by the state department on Friday.India already has a fleet of P-8I patrol aircraft, with eight ordered in 2009 and four more in 2016. With six more now, “will allow the Indian Navy to expand its maritime surveillance aircraft (MSA) capability for the next 30 years”, the DSCA said, adding, “India will have no difficulty absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces.”Manufactured by Boeing, P-8I is an Indian variant of P-8s that the company says are designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It does multiple missions and comes equipped with “state-of-the-art sensors, proven weapons systems, and a globally recognised platform”.India’s order for the new P-8Is comes with eight Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Tactical Radio Systems 5 (MIDS-JTRS 5); 42 AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors; 14 LN-251 with Embedded Global Positioning Systems/Inertial Navigations Systems and other elements.“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region,” the DSCA said.Defense purchases from the United States have been increasingly an integral part of growing ties between the two countries. From near zero in 2008, India-US defence trade touched $20 billion in 2020, helped along by major policy upgrades. The US designating India a Major Defence Partner (in 2016) and then granting it same access to defence technology as NATO allies and Australia, Japan and South Korea under Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA) in 2018.And, India has signed all foundational agreements - also called enabling agreements - overcoming years of hesitation: Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) in 2020, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018, Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016, and General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-sale-of-six-more-p-8i-aircraft-for-india-101619879874012.html
01-05-2021||World||Hungary reopens for people holding Covid-19 immunity cards||Hungary on Saturday loosened several Covid-19 restrictions for people with government-issued immunity cards, the latest in a series of reopening measures that have followed an ambitious vaccination campaign.As of Saturday, individuals with the plastic cards may enter indoor dining rooms, hotels, theaters, cinemas, spas, gyms, libraries, museums and other recreational venues. Opening hours for businesses were extended to 11 p.m. and an overnight curfew in place since November will now start later, at midnight.People who have received at least one vaccine dose and those who have recovered from Covid-19 are eligible for the Hungarian immunity cards, which must be presented at establishments before entry. Businesses can be issued heavy fines if they allow non-cardholders to enter.Hungary’s famous thermal baths, a hallmark of its tourism industry, opened their pools, saunas and steam rooms to guests Saturday after nearly six months of closure. Budapest, which operates 12 such spas, opened six of them.Ildiko Szucs, the CEO of Budapest Spas Ltd., told The Associated Press that she thinks the baths will benefit people who have suffered physically and mentally during the pandemic.“The effect of medicinal water on stress management and mental rejuvenation is very important, and we hope as many people as possible will recognize this and visit us,” Szucs said.Speaking from Budapest’s neo-Baroque Szecheyni Baths, the largest medicinal spa in Europe, Szucs said many guests arrived Saturday with proof of vaccination issued by their doctors but had not received their government-issued cards and had to be turned away.“We will try to take action on this matter and, if necessary, ask for an amendment to the legislation...since these guests have already received two vaccinations in many cases,” she said.While millions of Hungarians got the opportunity to return to some semblance of their normal lives with the issuance of immunity cards, organizational problems have meant that many who are eligible did not receive them within eight days of their first shot as planned.Maria and Gabor Gal, a retired married couple, received their first dose on March 21, and their second in early April. But six weeks after their initial shots, they haven’t received their cards.“They told us that the vaccination certificate will come when it comes. Now we’re asking when it will come, because it would be good if we could use it,” Maria Gal, 67, said. “We’re sitting here locked in for a year-and-a-half.”The Hugarian government launched a website and special email address for people waiting for their cards may submit inquiries. Earlier plans indicated a mobile application would be available to provide proof of vaccination, but the system has yet to go online.Hungary has administered 4 million first doses of coronavirus vaccines, reaching about 40% of its population. The country has the second-highest vaccination rate in the European Union and is the only one of the EU’s 27 nations to use vaccines from China and Russia in addition to Western jabs.But a devastating pandemic surge this spring also gave Hungary the world’s highest overall Covid-19 mortality rate per 1 million inhabitants, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country of about 9.7 million people has reported over 27,500 deaths in the pandemic.The whole issue of immunity cards or so-called Covid-19 passports is fraught, with critics saying they discriminate against people in poorer nations who do not have access to vaccines. Hungary is also trying to counter possible EU moves to issue such documents only to people who have received vaccines approved by the European Medicines agency, which so far do not include the vaccines made in China and Russia.Zoos also began admitting guests after nearly six months of mandatory closure. Budapest Zoo spokesperson Zoltan Hanga said the last time the zoological park in Hungary’s capital was shut for so long was during World War II.“This is a big day,” Hanga said. “The zoo is the best when it’s full of visitors, when a lot of people come to get to know the world of animals and have a good time. Finally, the time for this has arrived.”Children under 18 who are accompanied by adult cardholders may enter establishments without a card. At the zoo, lines of parents and eager children formed at cash desks ahead of the opening on Saturday morning.“Now that the restrictions are eased, we can go more places with my child and husband,” said Eva Marozsan, who brought her young son Zoltan to visit the animals. “It was very bad to be closed inside, and now that places are opening, it’s really uplifting for us.”A soccer match in Budapest on Saturday is expected to admit fans holding immunity cards.

01-05-2021||World||Mapping the Afghan war, while murky, points to Taliban gains||Trying to map the long war in Afghanistan has become an increasingly challenging task ahead of the planned withdrawal of all U.S. forces.Since the U.S.-led invasion of 2001 and subsequent overthrow of Afghanistan's Taliban government, insurgent activity shrank, then began to grow again as the conflict stretched on for two decades. Now, as the withdrawal with a summer completion date looms, even American officials acknowledge being publicly in the dark about the Taliban's strength.“By many measures, the Taliban are in a stronger military position now than at any point since 2001, though many once-public metrics related to the conduct of the war have been classified or are no longer produced,” a March report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service warned.That included data offered on the roughly 400 local districts across Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Control of those districts had been a key metric to judge overall control in the country.In its last published report to include that level of detail, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said the Afghan government controlled just 54% of those districts as of October 2018, the lowest number recorded since public tracking began in November 2015. Of the remaining districts, the U.S. government described 34% as contested and 12% as being under insurgent control.In April 2019, the inspector general said the U.S.-commanded NATO Resolute Support mission no longer assessed district-level control, describing them as offering "limited decision-making value to the commander.” But that decision came amid the Trump administration's push for negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar, suggesting military officials shut down the effort to avoid showing how bad things had become, said Bill Roggio, who has been tracking the war for years.Roggio, whose Long War Journal now operates in the Washington-based hawkish think tank called the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, has tracked the conflict for years based on press reports and data he's gathered. He believes half of the country's districts are now contested between the government and the Taliban, with over 120 fully government controlled and more than 70 fully held by the Taliban.But even he acknowledges those numbers represent his best guess. Some districts held by the government swing back and forth depending on Taliban offensives. Others see the government hole up in central headquarters or barracks — and then “the police commander is getting killed in an IED attack when he pulls out of the base,” Roggio said, using an acronym for a homemade bomb.“A lot of cases in these districts that I have contested, the government really only controls the district centers,” Roggio said. “I think that that map actually should look worse than it really is.”Fawad Aman, a deputy spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, disputed Roggio's figures as “not correct and far from reality.” However, he claimed without offering evidence that the Taliban controlled just “more than 10 districts” in Afghanistan in “very remote parts of the country.”Aman's claim is roughly half the lowest estimate of Taliban district control ever offered publicly by the U.S., which came in January 2016.A recent report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported fighting across the country, with some 90,000 people internally displaced since the start of this year alone. Since 2012, some 4.8 million people have been displaced from their homes and not returned in a country of 38 million.Even Kabul, the country's heavily guarded capital, isn't safe. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan showed the most civilian casualties in 2020 from any province came in Kabul, with 255 people killed and 562 wounded.The worst violence came from targeted killings — which are targeting activists, journalists, judges and lawyers since Washington struck its deal with the Taliban. While the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate has claimed some of the slayings, most aren't acknowledged by any group — only adding to the growing sense of unease there.Aman also disputed that Kabul is insecure, citing what he described as regular security force patrols, checkpoints and raids.“The Taliban presence around the capital, Kabul, is less than any time before,” he claimed. “There is no concern for the Kabul people."The U.S. withdrawal, beginning in May, is slated to see all combat troops depart the country after America's longest war. That likely will include the personnel responsible for calling in and guiding airstrikes. Without the strikes, Roggio said the Afghan military likely will face a major offensive it now is too stretched to defend nationwide.And the map will change again.“They’re going to have to consolidate their lines. They’re going to have to abandon the south," Roggio said. "I just don’t see how they survive otherwise. They’ll just be picked apart piecemeal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mapping-the-afghan-war-while-murky-points-to-taliban-gains-101619877186068.html
01-05-2021||World||Covid-hit Russia reports 25% death increase in January-March||Russia's state statistical service says the number of deaths nationwide in the first three months of 2021 was more than 25% higher than the same period a year ago, and it reported thousands more deaths due to Covid-19 in March than tallied by the country's coronavirus task force.More than 583,000 people died in January-March of this year, compared with 460,000 for those months in 2020, the Rosstat agency said in a report issued Friday.The agency did not provide an explanation for the sharply higher death toll, but critics have suggested that Russia underplays the severity of the pandemic in the country.The national coronavirus task force counted more than 12,300 deaths from Covid-19 in March, but Rosstat gave a substantially higher number. The agency said there were 15,003 deaths that month in which the coronavirus was the leading cause, along with 2,454 cases in which Covid-19 was believed to be the leading cause and 1,401 deaths in which Covid-19 influenced the development of other diseases and accelerated death.According to the task force, throughout the pandemic 110,502 people have died in Russia of Covid-19 as of Saturday — 392 of them in the past day. The country has recorded more than 4.8 million confirmed cases.Although Russia has boasted of being the first country to authorise a coronavirus vaccine, the pace of its vaccination program is lagging well behind many other countries.Only about 8% of residents have gotten at least one shot, while 5% have been fully vaccinated. That puts Russia far behind the United States, where 43% of the population has gotten at least one shot, and the European Union with nearly 27%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covidhit-russia-reports-25-death-increase-in-januarymarch-101619876835014.html
01-05-2021||World||WHO approves Moderna Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use||The World Health Organisation has given the go-ahead for emergency use of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine.The mRNA vaccine from the US manufacturer joins vaccines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson in receiving the WHO's emergency use listing.Similar approvals for China's Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines are expected in the coming days and weeks, WHO has said.The greenlight for Moderna's vaccine, announced late Friday, took many months because of delays that WHO faced in getting data from the manufacturer.Many countries without their own advanced medical regulatory and assessment offices rely on the WHO listing to decide whether to use vaccines. UN children's agency UNICEF also uses the listing to deploy vaccines in an emergency like the pandemic.The announcement, however, wasn't likely to have an immediate impact on supplies of Moderna's vaccine for the developing world. The company struck supply agreements with many rich countries, which will have already received millions of doses.In a statement Friday, CEO Stephane Bancel said Moderna was “actively participating in discussions with multilateral organisations, such as COVAX, to help protect populations around the world.”He was referring to a UN-backed programme to ship Covid-19 vaccines to many low- and middle-income countries, based on need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101619870059037.html
01-05-2021||World||South Asians in England at greater risk in second Covid-19 wave, new study finds||Minority ethnic groups in general and South Asians, in particular, had a higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of Covid-19 related hospitalisations, intensive care (ICU) admissions and deaths during the second wave of the pandemic in the UK compared to the first, according to a new observational study of 17 million people.Led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the study published in the medical journal ‘Lancet’ on Friday accounted for a large number of explanatory variables such as household size, social factors and health conditions across all ethnic groups and at different stages of Covid-19, from testing to mortality.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"South Asian groups remained at higher risk for testing positive, with relative risks for hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death greater in magnitude in the second wave compared to the first wave," the study finds.It found that compared with the first wave last year, the relative risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death were smaller in the pandemic second wave earlier this year for all minority ethnic communities compared to white people, with the exception of South Asian groups – covering Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.“Despite the improvements seen in most minority ethnic groups in the second wave compared to the first, it’s concerning to see that the disparity widened among South Asian groups,” said Dr Rohini Mathur from LSHTM and the study’s lead author.“This highlights an urgent need to find effective prevention measures that fit with the needs of the UK’s ethnically diverse population,” she said.After accounting for age and sex, social deprivation was the biggest potential explanatory factor for disparities in all minority ethnic groups except South Asian.In South Asian groups, health factors such as BMI, blood pressure, underlying health conditions played the biggest role in explaining excess risks for all outcomes. Household size was an important explanatory factor for the disparity for Covid-19 mortality in South Asian groups only.Dr Mathur said: “While multigenerational living may increase risk of exposure and transmission (from children or working age adults to older or vulnerable family members), such households and extended communities also offer valuable informal care networks and facilitate engagement with health and community services.“In light of emerging evidence that minority ethnic groups are less likely to take up the COVID-19 vaccine, co-designing culturally competent and non-stigmatising engagement strategies with these communities is increasingly important.”On behalf of NHS England, the research team used the new secure OpenSAFELY data analytics platform to analyse partially anonymised electronic health data collected by general practitioners (GPs) covering 40 per cent of England.These GP records were linked to other national coronavirus-related data sets for the first and second waves of the pandemic – including testing, hospital data and mortality records. Ethnicity was self-reported by participants in GP records and grouped into five census categories (white, South Asian, Black, other, mixed) and then a further 16 sub-groups.“Minority ethnic groups in the UK are disproportionately affected by factors that also increase the risk for poor Covid-19 outcomes, such as living in deprived areas, working in front-line jobs, and having poorer access to healthcare,” notes Dr Mathur.“Our study indicates that even after accounting for many of these factors, the risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death was still higher in minority ethnic groups compared with white people in England."To improve Covid-19 outcomes, we urgently need to tackle the wider disadvantage and structural racism faced by these communities, as well as improving access to care and reducing transmission,” she said.The authors caution that there are some limitations to the study including an inability to capture all potential explanatory variables, including occupation, health-related behaviours, and experiences of racism or structural discrimination.They call for improving the completeness of ethnicity recording in health data to further support the conduct of high-quality research into addressing health inequalities for Covid-19 and beyond.The study, believed to be the largest of its type, was funded by the UK’s Medical Research Council and conducted by scientists from a group of universities including LSHTM and the University of Oxford, along with the National Institute of Health Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-asians-in-england-at-greater-risk-in-second-covid-19-wave-new-study-finds-101619868127436.html
01-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada to ban entry of international students to Ontario province||Canada is all set to suspend entry of international students, including from India, to Ontario, the worst-hit province which is battling the third wave of the coronavirus.According to the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE), an education service provider based in Ottawa, there were 530,540 international students in Canada in 2020, of which the maximum were from India (34 per cent) followed by China (22 per cent).Ontario has the maximum number of foreign students at 242,825 or 46 per cent, it said.During a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government is considering halting the arrival of international students in Ontario, following a request from the province's premier Doug Ford to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the globalnews.ca reported.“Because currently Ontario is the only province to request it, we are happy to work more closely with them,” he said.Trudeau said they will be “reaching out to their officials" to formalise the request.However, there is no clarity as yet on when the change will take effect or how long it will last.International students are currently exempt from Canada's COVID-19 travel rules. All students must be able to provide a valid study permit or a letter of introduction that shows they were approved for a permit, according to CTV news.Ford also called on the federal government to ban non-essential travel after 36 cases of the B.1.617 variant, originally found in India, were identified in the province, the report said.Trudeau reiterated his intentions of working closely with the provinces to quell the spread of the coronavirus and cautioned against any kind of non-essential travel.“We’re engaging with other provinces that are hit hard by this third wave to see how we can help," he said.Canada has so far reported 1.22 million coronavirus cases, including 463,000 in Ontario. Of the total 24,219 fatalities, 8,050 were reported from Ontario.

01-05-2021||World||Kabul on high alert amid 'deadline' for US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan||Kabul security was ramped up on Saturday as the city braced for reaction from the insurgent Taliban as U.S. troops still present under President Joe Biden's orders, beyond the May 1 withdrawal deadline agreed in 2020 with the Trump administration.An increased military presence and security at checkpoints were visible in the Afghan capital, and a security source said the city had been placed on "high alert". Military patrols and security were being increased in main cities around the country, the source said.Under the Trump administration's February 2020 deal with the Taliban, foreign forces were to withdraw from the country by May 1 while the Taliban held off on attacking foreign troops and bases. But President Biden announced last month after reviewing the situation that forces would stay in the country for months beyond May, withdrawing by Sept. 11.Violence against Afghans has escalated starkly in recent weeks, with more than a hundred Afghan security force personnel killed. On the eve of the previously agreed withdrawal deadline, a huge blast in eastern Logar killed dozens as they broke their fast during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan. It was not clear who was behind the attack.The Taliban responded to the Biden administration's move with fiery rhetoric and threatened consequences, boycotting a crucial conference in Turkey scheduled for last month that had been planned to help jumpstart stalling Afghan peace talks in Doha.Since then contacts have been maintained, official and Taliban sources say, in an effort to try to get the Taliban back to negotiating table and agree to the extended foreign troop presence.As of Saturday it was unclear whether concrete progress had been made and there had been no announcement on an extension.THREATS SERIOUSTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter on Saturday that the passing deadline meant "this violation in principle has opened the way for (Taliban fighters) to take every counter-action it deems appropriate against the occupying forces."But he added that fighters were waiting on the decision of Taliban leadership.Earlier in the week Mujahid told Reuters conversations were continuing."Discussions between the U.S. and Taliban and ... within the Taliban's leadership are under way whether to extend that or not," he said.Washington has also warned that if foreign forces were attacked while carrying out the withdrawal they would defend themselves "with all the tools at our disposal".Experts said the Taliban threats should be taken seriously, but a number of factors meant that full-scale attacks against foreign targets could be averted, as the Taliban continued negotiations."We can't rule out attacks," said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. "That said, the Taliban is less likely to attack foreign forces now that it knows there is a specific date when they will be leaving."NEGOTIATIONS ONGOINGIn the lead up to May, sources said there was a flurry of meetings negotiations continued with the Taliban to try to get them to agree to a deadline extension.The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, had met with the Taliban's head of political office, Mullah Baradar, in Doha, a Taliban spokesman said on Friday.Also on Friday, the eve of the May 1 deadline, envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan and the United States held meetings with Taliban officials and Afghan government negotiators in the Qatari capital. The Taliban said they discussed the peace process and their request that Taliban leaders be removed from sanctions lists.Sources also said that a delegation of Taliban political leaders had been in Pakistan's capital Islamabad this week.Two Taliban sources and one official source said negotiations had revolved around the proposed deadline extension in exchange for the United States not getting involved in Afghan military operations against the Taliban; getting the Taliban to commit to re-joining the Turkey conference if they were provided with an agenda on what would be discussed there; and possibly declaring a ceasefire over the upcoming Eid holiday.Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-on-high-alert-amid-deadline-for-us-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101619864896080.html
01-05-2021||World||Diplomats from 5 nations resuming Iran nuclear talks||High-ranking diplomats from China, Germany, France, Russia and Britain are set to resume talks Saturday focused on bringing the United States back into their landmark nuclear deal with Iran.The US will not have a representative at the table when the diplomats meet in Vienna because former President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the country out of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018. Trump also restored and augmented sanctions to try to force Iran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions.U.S. President Joe Biden wants to rejoin the deal, however, and a U.S. delegation in Vienna is taking part in indirect talks with Iran, with diplomats from the other world powers acting as go-betweens.The Biden administration is considering a rollback of some of the most stringent Trump-era sanctions in a bid to get Iran to come back into compliance with the terms of the nuclear agreement, according to information from current and former U.S. officials and others familiar with the matter earlier this week.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, promised Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions has left the Islamic Republic's economy reeling. Tehran has responded by steadily increasing its violations of the restrictions of the deal, such as increasing the purity of uranium it enriches and its stockpiles, in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to pressure the other countries to provide relief.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn’t want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.The Vienna talks began in early April and have included several rounds of high-level discussions. Expert groups also have been working on proposals on how to resolve the issues around American sanctions and Iranian compliance, as well as the “possible sequencing” of the U.S. return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diplomats-from-5-nations-resuming-iran-nuclear-talks-101619860998340.html
01-05-2021||World||Singapore reinstates Covid-19 distancing rules, tightens borders||Singapore will reinstate some social distancing controls and tighten borders with countries that are seeing a persistent rise in coronavirus cases to stem a virus spread in the city.The government will allow fewer people at malls and large stores, and close campsites for two weeks from May 1, according to a statement from the health ministry on Friday. It will reduce the operating capacity of attractions to 50% from 65% for a week from May 7, and urged people to limit social gatherings to two per day and stay home where possible, it said.Visitors and long-term pass holders from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore from May 2. In addition, all travelers from these countries will have their quarantine extended to 21 days. People arriving from Thailand will have to complete quarantine in a dedicated facility for 14 days, it said.“We will continue to review the current suite of measures and will take further steps to tighten and significantly reduce the level of interactions in the community should transmission persist,” the statement said.The move comes as Singapore experiences a higher than usual number of new Covid-19 infections, reporting the most in more than nine months on Thursday. The cases stem from one cluster in one of the country’s biggest hospitals and another from an immigration officer in Changi Airport. On Saturday, the nation reported nine new cases in the local community.Both Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital have reported a high number of patients in their emergency wards on separate Facebook posts since Friday, with Sengkang General Hospital adding that wards are also running at full capacity.Authorities will also close all public places visited by the cases during their likely infectious period for two days for cleaning, and to facilitate testing of staff there. These places include supermarkets, food centers, mosques and a church.For office workers, the government is asking employers to allow them to work from home if they are able to, and avoid social gatherings. This directive comes about a month after authorities relaxed workplace rules to allow more people back to offices.“We know these new restrictions will create inconvenience for everyone,” Lawrence Wong, the minister who co-chairs the virus taskforce, said at a briefing on Friday. “This is the only way we can ensure we slow down the spread of the virus in the community.”Singapore will need to tighten measures against Covid-19 where necessary promptly to avoid going into a second circuit breaker, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at a May Day Rally on Saturday, according to The Straits Times.After months of near-zero new locally-transmitted virus cases, the island nation had been moving toward easing restrictions put in place last year, including moving ahead to revive an air travel bubble with Hong Kong. A combination of virus containment and rolling out vaccines at one of the fastest rates in Asia saw Singapore top Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking this month, dethroning New Zealand for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reinstates-covid-19-distancing-rules-tightens-borders-101619859286323.html

High energy-consuming and high-emission projects that fail to meet environmental standards must be stopped, he added.At a climate summit convened by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, Xi reiterated the nation’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2060. While China will increase coal consumption between now and 2025, it plans to reduce it in the following five-year plan from 2026.China will improve its management of binding targets for environment protection, energy saving and emission reduction, and build a stable fiscal spending mechanism, the Chinese leader said at the Politburo event.The country will provide funds and technology support for developing nations to improve their environment management capabilities, Xi said. China will stick to “the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities” to “firmly protect our development interests,” he added, referring to a notion included in the 2015 Paris climate agreement that put a greater financial burden on the countries most responsible for global warming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-vows-focus-on-emission-cuts-end-energy-inefficient-projects-101619859566498.html

Free arrested leaders," protesters chanted at one of two rallies in the main city of Yangon.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup the along with many other members of her party. The AAPP says more than 3,400 people have been detained for opposing the military.People also rallied in the second city of Mandalay and the southern town of Dawei, media reported.There were no immediate reports of violence.Media reported several small blasts in different places including Yangon late on Friday and on Saturday. There were no immediate reports of casualties and no claims of responsibility.A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment. The military has accused pro-democracy activists of planting bombs.The U.N. special envoy on Myanmar told the Security Council on Friday that in the absence of a collective international response to the coup, violence was worsening and the running of the state risked coming to a standstill, according to diplomats who attended the private meeting.Christine Schraner Burgener briefed the 15-member council from Thailand, where she has been meeting regional leaders. She hopes to travel to Myanmar but the military has yet to approve a visit."The general administration of the state could risk coming to a standstill as the pro-democracy movement continues in spite of the ongoing use of lethal force, arbitrary arrests and torture as part of the military's repression," Schraner Burgener said, according to diplomats.She told diplomats that reports of a continuing crackdown risked undermining momentum toward ending the crisis following a meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on April 25 with the junta leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.Schraner Burgener, expressing concern about rising violence, cited reports of bomb attacks and of civilians, mostly students from the urban areas, getting weapons training from ethnic minority insurgents.UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said Min Aung Hlaing had used the summit as a "propaganda ploy"."Indeed, he tried to appear to be what he is not - a legitimate leader," Andrews said in a post on Twitter."The good news: Those who ARE legitimate are ready to engage: the National Unity Government."Ousted members of parliament from Suu Kyi's party, politicians representing ethnic minorities and democracy activists set up the unity government but it has yet to win the international recognition it says it is due.The U.N. Security Council reiterated its "deep concern" at the situation and its support for Myanmar's democratic transition. The council has issued several statements since the coup but diplomats say Russia and China are likely to prevent any stronger council action against Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protest-march-in-myanmar-continues-three-months-after-coup-as-un-warns-of-standstill-101619850373427.html
01-05-2021||World||Boris Johnson’s popularity at test in a Brexit heartland||The town of Hartlepool in northeast England is the kind of place a Conservative prime minister would ordinarily struggle to find support.One of the most deprived areas of the UK, the blue-collar port saws its steel industry collapse in the 1970s and 80s and the unemployment rate remains among the highest in the country. Politically, it’s backed the Labour Party at every UK election for almost half a century. But then came Brexit.Hartlepool holds a vote on May 6 that will be a critical test for Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his landslide victory in 2019 paved the way to take Britain out of the European Union after years of wrangling.It will be a key indicator of whether Johnson’s initial popularity has survived a pandemic that left Britain with the worst death toll in Europe, and whether Brexit supporters still buy into his promise to “level up” the economy. And now there’s also the question of any damage from a recent scandal over Johnson’s conduct in office that’s engulfed his government. He has suffered a relentless barrage of negative headlines even from usually supportive newspapers.The Conservatives are the bookmakers’ favorite to win the election for the town’s next parliamentarian. Polls from Survation and Ipsos MORI have also put the party in front. That’s mainly as votes from the now defunct Brexit Party at the last election are expected to transfer to Johnson in a Labour northern heartland where a Tory win would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The town backed leaving the EU by a thumping 70%.One such voter is Geoff Carr, who runs a shoe repair business next to a closed-down pawnbroker on Hartlepool’s main shopping thoroughfare. A committed Brexit supporter, Carr says the UK’s Covid-19 inoculation program that’s covered more than half the population vindicates leaving the EU. He will now be voting Conservative.“The vaccine, you can’t fault them for that,” said Carr, 58, in between polishing shoes and serving customers behind a large Perspex screen. “That’s one of the reasons we got out of Europe, so we can make our own decisions.”Hartlepool epitomizes Britain’s post-industrial decline, a forgotten coastal town that’s often more known in Britain for a folklore tale about locals hanging a monkey suspected of being a French spy during the Napoleonic Wars. (The town elected its soccer club’s monkey mascot as mayor in 2002 and he successfully went on to win two more terms.) Many storefronts are boarded up, locals complained the town’s center has been neglected while investment went into its marina.A victory would reinforce Johnson’s position in what used to be called the “red wall” of Labour-voting districts across England’s north. At the last UK election, neighboring Brexit-backing areas such as former mining town Bishop Auckland and Redcar, where a giant steelworks lies defunct on the North Sea coast, defected to the Tories for the first time in decades.The by-election is also just one of the tests facing Johnson on May 6. There are also elections to the Scottish Parliament, where the nationalists look on course for an emphatic win to ramp up pressure for another independence referendum, the Welsh assembly and across English municipalities.“There’s always quite a lot at stake in these kinds of elections, but perhaps the stakes are higher this time around than they’ve been for a few years,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “The sheer number of contests taking place means it’s a kind of Super Thursday, almost equivalent to the U.S. mid-term elections.”Voters will be making their choice as Johnson battles on a number of fronts. First there were incendiary claims made against him by former adviser Dominic Cummings, who questioned his competence and integrity in a lengthy blog post. Then the Electoral Commission said on April 28 it would investigate whether the prime minister appropriately declared any donations that funded the refurbishment of his Downing Street residence.The Labour Party has sought to capitalize on the issue, branding the Tories as a party of “sleaze,” an echo from the 1990s when scandals helped undermine the government and propel Tony Blair into office.But on the streets of Hartlepool voters were either unaware of the controversy or unmoved by it. “There are far more important things going on than who’s got their hands in the till at 10 Downing Street,” said Peter Davison, 66, a retired businessman. “People don’t care in the slightest.”A bigger challenge may be apathy. A life-long Labour voter, Davison won’t be voting because he is disillusioned by politics and it’s not hard to find similar views toward the politics going on 230 miles (370 kilometers) south in London.The majority of people approached on a recent weekday to talk about the election said they weren’t interested in it and didn’t know anything about it. Ale Issmat, a local barber, said he would be voting for the Conservatives, but only because their campaign had brought some customers to his salon.Yet much is at stake for Hartlepool. Like for similar regions, the Brexit vote was a cry for change, to end years of perceived neglect by the government at Westminster following the collapse of manufacturing industries. Johnson’s post-Brexit mantra is to better distribute wealth and opportunity across the UK For its part, Hartlepool has been refocusing its port activity on green energy in recent years. The May 6 vote, along with those across the UK, is also the first real test of Labour leader Keir Starmer’s ability to reignite the party’s fortunes after a catastrophic result in 2019. Starmer’s standing with voters has lagged in recent weeks as Johnson has ridden a wave of good feeling following the country’s successful vaccine roll-out. If Labour isn’t making significant gains, it’s going to be hard to imagine the party will be back in power at the next UK election, said Bale, the politics professor.Labour loyalties, at least, still run deep in the north of England, and for many voters the idea of voting Conservative remains anathema.Evelynne Ray, 72, a retired nurse, blamed the Tories for cuts to local council funding, which she said led to the closure of hospital services. She also blamed Johnson for not locking the country down sooner at the start of the pandemic. If he’d acted more decisively, social restrictions could’ve been lifted months ago, she said.“I’m definitely not a fan of Boris,” Ray said, a disposable face mask tucked under her chin and sitting opposite Hartlepool’s war memorial. “I just don’t like him at all.”Yet with coronavirus restrictions being lifted and more than twice the proportion of the population vaccinated compared with the EU, Johnson has gained some political capital.Nibbling on shortbread and drinking coffee outdoors at a cafe, Barbara and Brian Tunstall expressed sympathy for the prime minister, particularly in light of claims made against him by Cummings, his former chief adviser. “It makes me think a lot worse of Cummings than Johnson,” Brian, 77, said. “I feel sorry for him,” Barbara said. “He’s had a hard old year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-popularity-at-test-in-a-brexit-heartland-101619849685421.html
01-05-2021||World||Canada halts distribution of J&J vaccine||Canada health authorities have halted the distribution of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in the country after it emerged that an active ingredient was made at an American facility that has been flagged by the US’ Food and Drugs Administration.Canada received 300,000 doses of the vaccine manufactured by Janssen,a pharmaceutical owned by J&J, on April 28. However, in a statement released on Friday, Health Canada said these were being withheld and “will only be released for distribution” once it “is satisfied that they meet the department’s high standards for quality, safety and efficacy”.This move came after Health Canada learnt that a drug substance was produced at the Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore, Maryland, which has been inspected by the FDA with the agency noting multiple areas of concerns there.Health Canada noted the substance is the “active ingredient that undergoes further processing before becoming the final product”, the vaccine. “The final Janssen vaccines were manufactured at a different site located outside of the US,” it said.It added, “We will continue to ensure that products coming from the Emergent facility, or any other facility, will only be imported and distributed in Canada if they are of high quality and safe for use.”It said the department is currently working with Janssen and the FDA to obtain all of the information it needs to complete its “assessment, prior to releasing the Janssen vaccines for distribution.”Canada has also received 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made at the same facility and Health Canada said it is also working with them “to ensure the facility meets manufacturing standards, and that all vaccine supplies for Canada are of high quality”.However, the AZ vaccines have already been distributed in Canada and administered across the country. Health Canada asserted that it “remains confident that the 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine imported into Canada from this facility meet quality specifications.”On April 25, Health Canada had stated that the Janssen vaccines anticipated to come into the country this week did not originate from the Emergent facility. The information about the active ingredient came to the department since that statement was issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-halts-distribution-of-j-j-vaccine-101619848551845.html
01-05-2021||World||US formally begins withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, ending its longest war||The United States formally begins withdrawing its last troops from Afghanistan on Saturday, bringing its longest war nearer to an end but also heralding an uncertain future for a country in the tightening grip of an emboldened Taliban.US officials on the ground say the withdrawal is already a work in progress -- and May 1 is just a continuation -- but Washington has made an issue of the date because it is a deadline agreed with the Taliban in 2020 to complete the pullout.The skies above Kabul and nearby Bagram airbase have been buzzing with more US helicopter activity than usual as the pullout gears up, following the start Thursday of a concurrent Nato withdrawal.The prospect of an end of 20 years of US presence comes despite fighting raging across the countryside in the absence of a peace deal.A stark reminder of what remains came late Friday with a car bomb in Pul-e-Alam, south of the capital, killing at least 21 people and wounding 100 more.US president Joe Biden is determined to end what he called "the forever war", announcing last month that the withdrawal of the remaining 2,500 American forces would be complete by the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks."A horrific attack 20 years ago... cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021," he said.Since the US withdrawal deal was struck the Taliban have not directly engaged foreign troops, but insurgents have mercilessly attacked government forces in the countryside and waged a terror campaign in urban areas.The exit of US forces has only exacerbated the fear felt by ordinary Afghans."Everyone is scared that we might go back to the dark days of the Taliban era," said Mena Nowrozi, who works at a private radio station in Kabul."The Taliban are still the same; they have not changed. The US should have extended their presence by at least a year or two," she told AFP.Afghan president Ashraf Ghani insists that government forces -- who for months have carried out most of the ground fighting against the Taliban -- are "fully capable" of keeping the insurgents at bay.He said the pullout also means the Taliban have no reason to fight."Who are you killing? What are you destroying? Your pretext of fighting the foreigners is now over," Ghani said in a speech this week.Worst-case analysisStill, general Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, has not ruled out total chaos."On the worst-case analysis, you have a potential collapse of the government, a potential collapse of the military," he said earlier this week."You have a civil war and all the humanitarian catastrophe that goes with it."Police officer Abdul Malik from the former insurgent bastion of Kandahar said they were prepared."We have to take care of our homeland... We will do our best to defend our soil," he told AFP.The US-led military onslaught in Afghanistan began in October 2001 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.Two decades later, and after the death of almost 2,400 Americans and tens of thousands of Afghans, Biden says the final withdrawal was justified as US forces had now made sure the country cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West.Concerns are high that the Taliban might yet strike at retreating US forces, and in the southern province of Kandahar -- where the foes used to clash regularly -- security sources say several areas are laden with explosives planted by the insurgents."If the Taliban attack retreating US or allied forces, it would be to bloody the nose of a defeated enemy and to humiliate it further," said Afghanistan specialist Nishank Motwani.Andrew Watkins, of the International Crisis Group, said the coming months would see the situation become a more purely local conflict."The United States and its Nato partners are stepping back and giving the two primary sides of this conflict... their first instance to fight with and assess their opponents without the extra factor of the United States," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-begins-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan-ending-its-longest-war-101619846523921.html

The drug is mRNA-based, it has an efficacy of 94.1 per cent, according to WHO estimates.The vaccine can be stored between -25oC and -15oC, but it can also be stored for up to 30 days at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C.The addition of Moderna's shot to the WHO's emergency use listing is a prerequisite for it to be a part of COVAX, the program to disseminate shots to low-income countries. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer the Covid-19 vaccine.The US granted emergency use authorization to the Moderna shot in December, with the European Union following shortly after in January.The authorization comes as the world works to ramp up its coronavirus vaccinations to significantly curb the pandemic over a year after it broke out in Wuhan, China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-gives-emergency-use-authorisation-to-moderna-s-covid-19-jab-101619846061929.html
01-05-2021||World||US exempts students, academics and journalists from India travel ban||University students, some academics and journalists will be exempted from US restrictions on travel from India that go into effect from May 4 because of the surge in Covid-19 cases.Antony Blinken, secretary of state, made these exemptions by extending National Interest Exceptions already in place for travel from Brazil, China, Iran and South Africa, the state department said.“In keeping with the department of state’s commitment to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States, secretary Blinken decided today to apply the same set of National Interest Exceptions to India that he had previously applied to all other regional travel restrictions currently in effect as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the state department.The Biden administration announced restrictions on travel from India earlier on Friday attributing it to “extraordinarily high Covid-19 caseloads and multiple variants circulating in India”. American citizens and permanent legal residents (Green Card holders) are exempted from the ban.The exception announced by the state department to the restriction will apply to students planning to start their college courses in fall, certain academics, journalists, and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by the Covid-19 related restrictions.The number of new Indian students headed for US schools this fall could not be ascertained immediately. But, they are likely to be fewer than in previous years as enrollment of international students decreased by 43% in fall 2020 , according to the International Institute of Education, which has focused on international students since 1919 and partners the US government. The drop was attributed to Covid-19 restrictions and then president Donald Trump’s xenophobic immigration policies.The number of Indian students in the US dropped 4.4% in 2020 to 193,124, according to Open Door, a comprehensive information resource partly funded by the state department.The situation is “very, very serious”, Gayle Smith, state department coordinator of US global effort on Covid-19, said about the situation in India, adding, “India is reporting an increasing number of cases almost every day. And the crisis has not peaked yet. The way this happens in a surge is there’s a lag time between when people are infected, when they become sick, and when they may need care.”New charge de affairs at US EmbassyThe United States on Friday named Daniel Smith as charge de affairs at its embassy in New Delhi, as the top diplomat.Smith is currently serving as director of the Foreign Service Institute and recently served as acting secretary of state and acting deputy secretary of State. He carries the highest Foreign Service rank of career ambassador.“Ambassador Smith’s appointment underscores the United States’ strong commitment to our partnership with the Government of India and the Indian people., the state department said in an announcement, adding, “He will spearhead close cooperation with India to ensure that our countries continue to advance our shared priorities, including overcoming the global pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-exempts-students-academics-and-journalists-from-india-travel-ban-101619846571640.html
01-05-2021||World||US dispatches third set of coronavirus aid to India||The United States on Friday (local time) dispatched the third set of its several emergency Covid-19 relief shipments to India. Arriving in New Delhi with Covid-19 relief supplies from the Dulles International Airport in the national capital region, the carrier is en route to the Indira Gandhi International Airport.The US carrier has onboard oxygen cylinders, test kits and other supplies and is expected to land in New Delhi after a brief haul in Munich according to USAID.On Friday just before the flight's departure the White House's National Security Council coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, Kurt Campbell, Indian Ambassador to the United States Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Director for South Asia in White House's National Security Council Sumona Guha and Jeremy Konyndyk at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) were present at the Dulles airport for a brief press interaction.President Joe Biden sought an update from Campbell on the swiftly evolving situation in India. "I was able to give a sense of what USAID is doing and what it hopes to accomplish, He (President Biden) said great, stay with it," Campbell noted.The senior White House Official also highlighted the exchange between President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the press gaggle calling it a "warm conversation", Campbell asserted.The aircraft deployed from Dulles is the US federal government third flight providing aid to India. The second flight with similar supplies lifts off from California earlier in the day. And flights like these will continue into next week airlifting urgent supplies like oxygen support, personal protective equipment, and rapid diagnostic tests to India."The administration starting from right on top, President Biden reached out and quoted that United States will stand shoulder to shoulder with India and we appreciate that," the Indian envoy Taranjit Sandhu told reporters."I'm sure with friends and partners like the United States we will face this challenge and with God's Grace we will come out if it." Sandhu further added.Earlier on Friday two US government assistance flights arrived in India and the fourth flight with aid is also scheduled to leave for India soon.Earlier this week Biden reaffirmed that US is determined to support India in its efforts to contain the pandemic during the talks. And he quickly deployed resources, and adding oxygen equipment supplies, therapeutics, medics, ventilators and other critical material for vaccine manufacturing.US will be sending supplies worth more than $100 million to India, including 1,000 refillable oxygen cylinders, 15 million N95 masks, and 1 million rapid diagnostic tests. The Biden administration has also redirected its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, which will allow it to make over 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine. So efforts are on till these supplies land at the Indira Gandhi airport.US Department of Defense, USAID, Department of State and the White House are working in sync to provide relief to India."So, while we are we are sending oxygen through some of these airlifts, we are also trying to support an expansion of the medical oxygen supply chain within India, so that there need not to be any sort of reliance on these sorts of foreign shipments of oxygen equipment but rather within what exists within the Indian Health System, that it will be able to meet the needs in a more sustainable way going forward. So that's where we're trying to get to in partnership with our Indian Government counterparts and with the Indian Health System," noted Jeremy Konyndyk from USAID.More than 40 countries including the US have committed to sending vital medical aid, particularly oxygen supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-dispatches-third-set-of-coronavirus-aid-to-india-101619846066945.html
01-05-2021||World||Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi marks third month under house arrest||Myanmar's deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi completed a third month under military-ordered house arrest Saturday -- a period marked by scatter-gun criminal charges and apparent isolation from the chaos engulfing the country.The nation has been plunged into violence since the military deposed the Nobel laureate in a February 1 coup, ending Myanmar's brief tryst with democracy.The resumption of junta rule sparked a wave of protests and a brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, in which security forces have killed more than 750 people, according to a local monitoring group.Charged on six counts including sedition and under Myanmar's official secrets law, Suu Kyi has been denied private meetings with her lawyers.Instead, she has had only a couple of video meetings that were physically monitored by security officials at both ends, her defence team told AFP."We haven't had the chance up to now to meet to get instruction from our client. Without getting instructions from the accused, how can we defend her?" lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told AFP."We are very concerned for the defendant's right to justice."Min Min Soe, another member of the defence team, said on Monday that Suu Kyi is cut off from information about the ongoing unrest at the house where she is being detained in the capital Naypyidaw."I think she is not getting access to watch news and TV. I do not think she knows the current situation," Min Min Soe said.Symbol of Democracy  Suu Kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during previous military rule before her 2010 release and rise to power in elections held five years later.Her international stature diminished following a wave of military violence targeting Buddhist-majority Myanmar's marginalised Muslim Rohingya community that displaced more than a million people, but the coup has returned Suu Kyi to the role of cloistered democracy icon."As somebody who has had an impact on the democracy movement in Myanmar all these years, in that sense, she is irreplaceable," said Moe Thuzar from the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a politics and security research centre."Even if people did not agree with the politics of the National League for Democracy, the way they viewed Aung San Suu Kyi as someone who has led the opposition, someone who has spoken up for democracy in the past, and also, as the child of the country's independence hero, I think those things count for something."Suu Kyi's NLD party built ties with the powerful military during the years of democracy, but the relationship frayed after November's elections.The NLD won a landslide but the military called foul and then seized power when the election commission failed to investigate fraud claims to the generals' satisfaction.Since Suu Kyi's arrest 12 weeks ago, the military has deployed lethal force on the streets to try to crush demonstrations and arrested more than 4,500 people.But the army has been careful to keep her out of sight, even as it has piled up criminal charges -- and corruption allegations -- against her.Even if she is cut off from the movement, her image adorns posters and banners at virtually every protest, and demonstrators demand her release."Mother Suu is old now and she will pass away some time, so we should assume our responsibilities without her," a 33-year-old activist told AFP."As Mom Su believes in us, we also believe in her again, and we will continue fighting until the winning moment of our uprising."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-aung-san-suu-kyi-marks-third-month-under-house-arrest-101619836685292.html
01-05-2021||World||Warrant for Giuliani's phones, computers seeks communications with over a dozen||US investigators are seeking to review Rudy Giuliani's phones and computers for communications with more than a dozen people, including a high-ranking prosecutor in Ukraine, according to a warrant executed at his apartment this week.They also are searching for communications with any US government official or employee relating to Marie Yovanovitch, the US ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted by the Trump administration in 2019, the warrant says.Agents seized more than 10 cell phones and computers from Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office in raids on Wednesday, according to his lawyer, Bob Costello, who read the search warrant to a Reuters reporter.According to the warrant, investigators are looking for evidence that Giuliani acted as an unregistered foreign agent, a violation of lobbying laws.Giuliani said in a statement following the raids that his "conduct as a lawyer and a citizen was absolutely legal and ethical." A spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney's office declined to comment.The list of the people identified in the warrant includes:LEV PARNAS AND IGOR FRUMANUkrainian-born Parnas and Belarus-born Fruman are two Florida-based businessmen who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter before the 2020 presidential election and push to remove Yovanovitch.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused Parnas and Fruman of using a shell company to make an illegal $325,000 donation to a committee supporting Trump's re-election. The men have pleaded not guilty to violating campaign finance laws and other charges. A trial is scheduled for October.A lawyer for Fruman declined to comment. A lawyer for Parnas did not respond to a request for comment.PETRO POROSHENKOA confectionary magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, Poroshenko took power in 2014 and served as the country's president until 2019. At Giuliani's direction, Parnas and Fruman met Poroshenko in February 2019, while he was still in office, and pressed him to announce investigations into Hunter Biden and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election in exchange for a state visit, the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reported.Poroshenko's office told Reuters on Friday that he held two meetings with Giuliani in his capacity as President Donald Trump's "special envoy" during which they discussed Russian aggression, fighting disinformation and how to strengthen the alliance between Kyiv and Washington.GYUNDUZ MAMEDOVMamedov, who currently serves as a high-ranking prosecutor in Ukraine, was a key intermediary in Giuliani's efforts to press Ukraine to open investigations that would tarnish Biden, according to NBC News.He played a role in setting up a meeting between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials, NBC reported. A spokesperson for Mamedov had no immediate comment on investigators looking at communications with Giuliani.VIKTOR SHOKINShokin became Ukraine's general prosecutor in February 2015 and led an investigation into the energy company Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Biden's son Hunter was a board member from 2014 to 2019.Shokin was removed from his job in 2016 following accusations of corruption by Western diplomats.Giuliani told Reuters he met with Shokin over Skype in late 2018.Shokin could not be reached for comment on Friday, according to his lawyer.YURIY LUTSENKOLutsenko succeeded Shokin as general prosecutor. In 2019, Lutsenko told John Solomon, a US columnist, that he had evidence related to the Bidens and Burisma. Later that year Lutsenko told Reuters he found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden’s son in his relationship with the energy firm.Giuliani told Reuters in 2019 that he met with Lutsenko twice early that year."I didn't correspond with Giuliani. I didn't even have his phone (number)," Lutsenko told Reuters on Friday. "We didn't communicate in any regular way."KOSTIANTYN KULYKKulyk, a former Ukrainian prosecutor, also worked on the country's investigations into Burisma. Giuliani told Reuters he met with Kulyk in Paris in 2019. Kulyk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.GLIB ZAGORIYA Ukrainian businessman and former lawmaker, Zagoriy attended a meeting between Giuliani and Lutsenko in January 2019, according to documents released by the US State Department. Zagoriy could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.DAVID CORREIACorreia, another Florida businessman, pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and duping investors in Fraud Guarantee, a company he founded with Parnas that paid Giuliani $500,000. A lawyer for Correia did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.VICTORIA TOENSING AND JOE DIGENOVAToensing and diGenova are married Washington lawyers who helped Giuliani represent Trump in his post-election lawsuits. They represented Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, who is fighting extradition from Vienna on US bribery and racketeering charges. FBI agents raided the couple's home earlier this week and seized a cellphone used by Toensing.Toensing and diGenova did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.JOHN SOLOMONSolomon worked for The Hill, a Washington newspaper and website covering Congress, when he wrote a series of pieces that Yovanovitch testified to Congress were part of a smear campaign against her that Giuliani appeared to be behind. The Hill later said Solomon failed to identify important details about key Ukrainian sources, including the fact that they had been indicted or were under investigation.Solomon did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warrant-for-giuliani-s-phones-computers-seeks-communications-with-over-a-dozen-101619836068310.html

The policy will take effect on Tuesday, May 4,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki had said on Friday.Another Republican lawmaker Jodey Arrington also criticised Biden for this proclamation on travel.“Biden enacting an India travel ban while keeping the border open is like locking your front door, but leaving the back door wide open. I wonder if the Left will accuse him of being xenophobic and anti-Hindu,” Arrington asked.“As Biden bans flights from India, perhaps he should be reminded of a tweet he put out last year. Also, I thought travel bans were xenophobic,” Congresswoman Lauren Boebert said in a tweet.After the then president Donald Trump had imposed travel ban from Europe, Biden then the Democratic presidential candidate, had opposed it.“A wall will not stop coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe – or any other part of the world – will not stop it. The disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet – and we need a plan to combat it,” Biden had said in a tweet on March 12 last year.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, however, supported the travel ban.“I support the Biden Administration’s travel restrictions from India, which many in the Indian American community have called for,” he said.“But what we really need to do is prioritise lives over excess profits. Pfizer and Moderna need to license their vaccine formulas,” Khanna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irrational-republican-lawmakers-criticise-biden-on-travel-curbs-from-india-101619833446178.html
01-05-2021||World||US sees steep drop in national security surveillance during Covid-19 pandemic||The number of targets of secretive surveillance in national security investigations fell sharply last year in large part because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a government report released Friday.The drop in eavesdropping targets under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which among other things empowers the FBI to monitor the communications inside the United States of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power, followed a decline the year before after several years of substantially larger numbers.US officials say the statistics are known to fluctuate from year to year because of various factors, but that in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic "likely influenced target behavior, which in turn may have impacted some of the numbers reported for that year.”“The pandemic was the single event with the biggest impact to human behavior worldwide since the Second World War," said Ben Huebner, the civil liberties chief at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the nation's spy agencies. "That means it also had an impact on our appropriate foreign intelligence targets.”The report from the ODNI is the eighth annual version of a document that was first released in the aftermath of disclosures of classified programs by former contractor Edward Snowden. It is designed to lend transparency to how the government wields some of its most intrusive and powerful national security surveillance powers.Officials who briefed reporters said the restrictions enacted around the world on movement and large gatherings may have decreased the number of potential people or groups to surveil. They declined to elaborate further on how the pandemic affected intelligence gathering.While there has been renewed scrutiny of the FBI's wiretapping authorities arising from the fallout of its investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, there was no discernible change in courts' willingness to approve surveillance warrants or any directive from Trump administration officials not to use those authorities, officials said.The number of surveillance targets, under provisions allowing for surveillance with warrants of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power, dropped from 1,059 in 2019 to 451 last year, according to the report.But targets under a National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program that enables intelligence collection on non-Americans abroad fell slightly last year. The report counts 202,723 targets under the program last year compared with 204,968 the previous year.An opinion released earlier this week from the court overseeing foreign surveillance found “apparent widespread violations” by FBI agents who improperly accessed NSA-obtained material. Judge James Boasberg scolded the FBI for what the agency described as errors but said its practice of querying NSA data could continue with “ongoing monitoring and auditing.”The FBI’s use of its authority to eavesdrop on subjects in terrorism and espionage investigations came under intense scrutiny in late 2019 after the Justice Department inspector general revealed significant errors and omissions in a series of applications targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the investigation into Russian election interference.The FBI subsequently announced dozens of corrective actions aimed at improving the accuracy and thoroughness of its applications.Another politically charged metric cited in the report is the number of times the NSA disclosed, or unmasked, the identity of an American referenced in an intelligence report in response to a specific request from another agency.Such identities are ordinarily concealed before intelligence about surveillance of foreign targets is distributed to administration officials. US officials can ask the NSA to unmask the name if they believe knowing the identity is vital to understanding the intelligence.Unmasking is fully legal and a standard practice in the national security community. But the issue nonetheless became an election-year rallying cry for Trump supporters after the release of declassified documents showing that multiple Obama administration officials had asked the NSA to disclose the name of an American whose identity was concealed in intelligence reports but who was revealed to be Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser.According to the report released Friday, the number of people unmasked in 2020 in response to a request from another agency dropped to 9,354 from 10,012 the year before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-steep-drop-in-national-security-surveillance-during-covid-19-pandemic-101619832776206.html

Detectives and prosecutors in Kanawha County, whose seat is Charleston, will review the case, the police chief said in briefing reporters.Hunt did not announce any action taken against the officers involved or disclose their races.Police body camera footage presented at the news conference begins by showing officers having a conversation with Dickerson as they stood on a sidewalk in the capital city's West Side neighborhood.Hunt said officers arrived after receiving a 911 call that Dickerson had allegedly threatened to stab someone.Less than a minute into the video, which begins at around 12:45 p.m., Dickerson can be seen running into the street after speaking to several officers, yelling at them to get away from him. An officer tells him to drop a knife from his hand, the video shows.Hunt said Dickerson had a bench warrant over a case involving allegations he brandished a weapon at an officer last year.The video shows at least two officers begin to point their firearms at Dickerson as he faces them on the street. “I told y'all the last time to kill me,” he yells at the officers, then turns around and walks down the street, saying "I didn't do nothing wrong."More police cars drive up as he backs away. About two minutes after the start of the footage, more than half a dozen officers surround Dickerson on an empty grassy lot. Dickerson says on video that he is going home when he turns around to face officers and motions toward one of them. At that moment he was shot, gunfire ringing out.“As the officer with the Taser begins to close distance to deploy the Taser, you will see Mr. Dickerson take an aggressive stance,” Hunt said. “When he takes a lunging movement toward our police officers, two officers fire.”Footage shows Dickerson fall to ground. Officers immediately place him on his stomach and attend to the bloody wound on his upper leg as he cries in pain. Hunt said medical services arrived within two minutes.Hunt said not all officers in the department are issued Tasers. He added that the pandemic decreased the opportunity to give officers the required training to carry a Taser.Body camera footage from more than one officer was shown at the news conference, but the clips weren't released otherwise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cops-in-west-virginia-s-charleston-city-shoot-wound-black-man-101619832249523.html

The friends and family of those in Australia are in extreme risk. Tragically, many are contracting Covid-19 and many, sadly, are dying every day," Hunt said.The Australian government will reconsider the restrictions on May 15, he said.India's coronavirus death toll passed 200,000 this week, and cases are nearing 19 million - nearly 8 million since February - as virulent new strains have combined with "super-spreader" events such as political rallies and religious festivals.Australia, which has no community transmissions, on Tuesday introduced a temporary suspension of direct flights from India to prevent more virulent Covid-19 variants entering the country.However, some Australians, including cricketers Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson, returned via Doha."The Government does not make these decisions lightly. However, it is critical the integrity of the Australian public health and quarantine systems is protected and the number of Covid-19 cases in quarantine facilities is reduced to a manageable level," Hunt said.Australia has all but stamped out the coronavirus from its shores after closing its borders to non-citizens and permanent residents in March 2020 to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.Travellers now have to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense, a system that has largely helped Australia to keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low, with just over 29,800 cases and 910 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-bans-arrivals-from-india-says-offenders-face-jail-fines-101619830153845.html
01-05-2021||World||Brazil pharma flags 'retaliation' risk over bill to drop Covid-19 vaccine patents||Brazilian pharmaceutical associations on Friday called for lawmakers to reject a bill that seeks to suspend Covid-19 vaccine patents, saying it could spark international retaliation and reduce medical supplies in Latin America's biggest country.Brazil's Senate passed the proposal on Thursday night, sending it to the lower house for consideration.The bill's backers say the emergency measure is needed due to a shortage of shots and a grave outbreak in Brazil, where over 400,000 people have died from the virus.The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has publicly opposed calls to suspend patent protections, arguing they could endanger talks with vaccine producers.In a joint statement, five of Brazil's leading pharmaceutical associations sided with his administration."The approval of a bill that allows for the weakening of intellectual property could lead to international retaliation and reduce the supply of pharmaceutical inputs," it said. "We cannot support measures that could generate more instability and scenarios that may have irreversible consequences, in the short, medium and long term for Brazil."Brazil has signed vaccine supply deals with AstraZeneca , China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson. AstraZeneca and Pfizer declined to comment, while Johnson & Johnson directed Reuters to the associations' statement. Sinovac did not immediately respond.A senior pharmaceutical executive in Brazil, who was involved in Covid-19 vaccine talks, said the bill was "very poorly thought through" and "sends a poor message."The executive, who asked to speak anonymously due to ongoing relationships with the government, said the legislation could especially hurt U.S. firms, which hampering Brasilia's efforts to improve relations with Washington.In a Friday statement on the bill, Brazil's Health Ministry said the priority is to strengthen the country's infrastructure to produce more vaccines domestically.The presidential press office did not respond to a request for comment.The legislation passed by the Senate would oblige patent holders to provide authorities with all the information needed to produce Covid-19 vaccines and medicines. Then, if the government were to call a state of emergency, they could be produced locally under a government-mandated arrangement.It remains to be seen whether lower house lawmakers will pass the bill. It has not been included on the next week's voting agenda, indicating Brazil lower house speaker Arthur Lira may want to further discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-pharma-flags-retaliation-risk-over-bill-to-drop-covid-19-vaccine-patents-101619828494233.html

India has restricted exports because of a crisis of infections.Moderna announced this week an expansion plan for its production network to boost its capacity to up to 3 billion doses in 2022.The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) already in January had recommended Moderna's vaccine for all age groups 18 and above.Pfizer and its German partner BionTech's shot, also an mRNA vaccine like Moderna's, was the first vaccine to get a WHO emergency use listing in the final hours of 2020.Since then, the WHO has added vaccines from Astrazeneca-SK Bio, Serum Institute of India and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to the list.The Geneva-based health organization is still considering Covid-19 vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac following an extended review, with decisions due by the end of next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-gives-emergency-use-listing-to-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-101619828119340.html

It said that NHS Test and Trace has contacted almost 10 million people since it began.A total of more than 34.2 million people in Britain have been given a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, government statistics showed on Friday. A further 2,381 people had tested positive for the virus, down slightly on the day before.There were 15 new deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test, compared to the 22 deaths recorded on Thursday.Earlier in April, Britain's health ministry said there were no plans to halt rapid coronavirus testing.Britain will buy 60 million more doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's, vaccine, health minister Matt Hancock said earlier this week, in a deal that more than doubles the country's supply of the shot ahead of a booster programme later this year.Britain has now ordered a total of 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, one of three COVID-19 shots being rolled out in the country.Britain, which has a population of 67 million, has deals for 517 million doses of eight different COVID-19 vaccines, some of which remain under development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reducing-size-of-nhs-contact-tracing-workforce-as-covid-19-cases-fall-101619826633910.html

The latter became the first parliament in Europe to do so.In April, the United Kingdom declared China's ongoing crackdown in Xinjiang a "genocide".China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community.

The rule took effect February 1 and was set to expire May 11.The agency said that children up to 2 and people with certain disabilities will continue to be exempted from the mask rule.Violations can carry fines of up to USD1,500 for repeat offenders.Separately, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that the FAA will continue its zero-tolerance policy against disruptive airline passengers as long as the TSA mask rule is in effect.The FAA is seeking much larger civil penalties — some topping $30,000 — against a small number of passengers that it accuses of interfering with airline crews.TSA officials said the mask rule matches health guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC recently said that fully vaccinated people can travel safely, but it still recommends that they wear masks and maintain distance from other people. About 100 million Americans, roughly half the nation's adults, have been fully immunised against Covid-19.Airlines and their unions had pushed for an extension of the federal mask rule as a stronger alternative to airline-imposed rules.“Continuing the TSA enforcement directive for the CDC transportation mask mandate will keep passengers and aviation workers safe,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-extends-face-mask-requirement-on-planes-until-september-101619826094837.html

A spokesman for the insurgent Taliban said in response to Reuters' questions that they were looking into the matter.Violence in Afghanistan has escalated in recent weeks after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the United States would withdraw troops by Sept. 11 to end two decades of foreign military presence.That decision angered the Taliban who had signed a deal with previous U.S. President Donald Trump that specified troops would be gone from the country by May 1 subject to certain security guarantees.Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said 21 people had been killed and 91 wounded and that a rescue and recovery operation was continuing.A provincial health official said just over 60 injured people had been taken to hospital and many students were among the victims.The European Union's delegation to Afghanistan condemned the attack."In the holy month of Ramadan, horrible news on a car bomb in Pul-e-Alam, Logar province, killing and injuring innocent civilians, including students....this is a tragedy for the whole country," it said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bomb-kills-27-in-afghanistan-s-eastern-logar-province-101619822901780.html

A state department spokesperson said this a voluntary authorized departure and not mandatory.“Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of State authorized the voluntary departure, so-called authorized departure, of family members of the embassy – at the US Embassy in New Delhi and the consulates throughout the country,” the spokesperson said at a news briefing.“Authorized departure doesn’t force anyone to leave; it doesn’t require anyone to leave. It gives these family members the option to depart if they wish. Departure, again, is not required.”The United States has also extended the Level 4 “Do not travel” advisory, which Price said, was a “pro forma re-issuance” of a previously issued advisory that had “been in effect, given COVID not only in India but also globally as well”.Price refused to share details of reports of US embassy staff contracting Covid-19. CNN has reported citing sources that there has been a major outbreak at US missions in India. Two locally employed staff members have died and more than 100 tested positive.“It is fair to say that Covid has touched every – just about every element of Indian society, and of course, we do have a large diplomatic presence in India, as you might expect, given our global comprehensive partnership with India,” Price said, adding, “So while I can’t offer any specifics on U.S. embassy employees or family members or locally employed staff, clearly this is a pandemic; this is an outbreak, a surge of cases in India that has left no part of the country untouched.”Asked about the removal and blocking of social media posts critical of the Indian government over the second wave of Covid-19 epidemic, Price said, “Of course, India is a large democracy with whom we share foundational values, and freedom of information, freedom of expression is something we support around the world.”Pushed back by a reporter who asked if freedom of expression and information extended to social media posts that incited violence, the state department spokesperson said that “hate speech, incitement to violence is something that we oppose everywhere”.“But clearly,” he added, “we support freedom of expression, while still calling out and condemning when we see incitement to violence and hate speech.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-restricts-travel-from-india-from-may-4-cites-extraordinarily-high-cases-101619810749882.html
01-05-2021||World||45 dead in stampede at Israel religious festival||At least 45 people were crushed to death overnight on Friday at an overcrowded religious festival in Israel, with some asphyxiated or trampled victims going unnoticed until the PA system sounded an appeal to disperse.Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews had thronged to the Galilee tomb of 2nd-century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai for annual Lag B’Omer commemorations that include all-night prayer, mystical songs and dance.Witnesses said many of the dead were caught in a tightly packed passageway around 3 metres wide after crowds packed the slopes of Mount Meron in northern Israel in defiance of warnings to maintain social distancing against Covid-19.Medics said there had been a stampede in the men’s section of the gender-segregated festival. Casualties included children.Many of the dead had yet to be identified and police asked family members to provide pictures and personal information of those who attended the festival and were still missing to help with the process.Videos posted on social media showed ultra-Orthodox men clambering desperately through gaps in sheets of torn corrugated iron to escape the crush. Bodies lay on stretchers in a corridor, covered in foil blankets.“There was some kind of mess, police, screaming, a big mess, and after half an hour it looked like a scene of a suicide bombing attack, numerous people coming out from there on stretchers,” said 19-year-old festival-goer Hayim Cohen.“We were going to go inside for the dancing and stuff and all of a sudden we saw paramedics from (ambulance service) MDA running by, like mid-CPR on kids,” 36-year-old pilgrim Shlomo Katz told Reuters.An injured man lying on a hospital bed described to reporters how the crush began when a line of people in the front of the surging crowd simply collapsed.“A pyramid of one on top of another was formed. People were piling up one on top of the other. I was in the second row. The people in the first row -- I saw people die in front of my eyes,” he said.People who stayed on the scene through the night questioned how the situation so quickly spiralled out of control, though there had been concern for years about safety risks at the annual event.The Justice Ministry said investigators would look into whether there had been any police misconduct connected to the tragedy.A police spokesperson said overall capacity at Mount Meron was similar to previous years but that this time bonfire areas were partitioned off as a Covid-19 precaution. That may have created unexpected choke-points on foot traffic, Israeli media said.A pilgrim who gave his name as Yitzhak told Channel 12 TV: “We thought maybe there was a (bomb) alert over a suspicious package. No one imagined that this could happen here. Rejoicing became mourning, a great light became a deep darkness.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while visiting the site, called it one of the “heaviest disasters” in Israel’s history and promised a thorough investigation to ensure it did not recur. He called for a national day of mourning on Sunday.The United States and European Union offered condolences.Helicopters ferried injured people to hospitals and the military said search-and-rescue troops were scrambled. With the site cleared, rescue workers collapsed against railings, some weeping as their colleagues comforted them.As rescue workers tried to extricate the casualties, police shut down the site and ordered revellers out. The transportation ministry halted roadworks in the area to enable scores of ambulances to move unhindered. The Mount Meron tomb is considered to be one of the holiest sites in the Jewish world and is an annual pilgrimage site. The event was one of the largest gatherings in Israel since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. Lockdown measures were eased this year amid Israel’s rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme.
