The Global Health Summit, which was organised on Friday by Italy in its role as president of the G20 in partnership with the European Commission, emphasised the urgent need to scale up efforts, including through synergies between the public and private sectors, to enhance timely and equitable access to effective and affordable Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson pledged the vaccines will be provided to low-income countries at production cost and middle income countries at low cost. This includes one billion doses from Pfizer, 200 million from Johnson & Johnson and 100 million from Moderna. Most of these doses will be delivered through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. The European Union will also donate 100 million doses to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, said European Commision President Ursula Von der Leyen, who co-hosted the summit with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. “The pandemic has shown the importance of international cooperation to address the current and any future health crisis. In more general terms, we must look across borders and across disciplines if we are to meet the challenges of our times,” Italian ambassador Vincenzo de Luca said. “These include not only the pandemic but also global inequalities and climate change,” he said, adding this was the spirit of the Rome Declaration adopted at the Global Health Summit. The Rome Declaration sets out a series of mutual reinforcing principles and commitments that will guarantee improved preparedness, a coordinated response, resilience to and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and better preparation for future health emergencies. Within the framework of the Global Health Summit, all participants announced additional pledges aimed at guaranteeing a forceful and coordinated response to the pandemic. “So long as the virus continues to circulate freely worldwide, it can mutate and undermine even the most successful vaccination campaign. The free flow of raw materials and vaccines across borders is essential,” De Luca said. Europe has so far exported about 200 million doses of vaccines to 90 countries. Italy has pledged a new donation of 15 million doses of vaccines to low-income countries before the end of 2021. At the Global Health Summit, Italy also announced a pledge of an additional 300 million euros for equitable distribution of vaccines, and a separate pledge of 200 million euros for initiatives to foster climate and health security in low-income countries. The participants of the Global Health Summit committed to promote and make tangible progress towards the principles of the Rome Declaration by the G20 Summit in Rome in October. In this regard, De Luca said, it will be essential to strengthen the role of multilateral institutions in global health and beyond, starting with the World Health Organization (WHO). “We need to provide WHO with sustainable and predictable funding and enable it to become more effective. It is crucial to ensure that an effective early warning system is in place and that governments can quickly share their best practices to prevent, contain and manage a pandemic,” he said. International scientific collaboration is one of the factors behind the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, and there is a need for better data sharing and greater knowledge transfers to enable widespread and equitable distribution of the fruits of innovation, De Luca said. “Covid-19 vaccines are the product of complex supply chains, which span many countries, each of which is based on its own industrial capacity and expertise,” he said. “We must preserve cross-border trade and eliminate unjustified trade barriers and general export bans.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-j-j-pledge-1-3-billion-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-at-global-health-summit-101621702319083.html

Eisenhower decided to rely initially on conventional weapons.The 1958 crisis ended when Communist forces halted artillery strikes on islands controlled by Taiwan, leaving the area under the control of Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek.China considers Taiwan to be a rebel province that will one day return to the mainland's fold, by force if necessary.Washington has recognized Beijing since 1979, but maintains relations with Taipei and is its most important military ally.- Tensions remain high -In recent months the Chinese air force has increased incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone.The United States also frequently conducts what it calls "freedom of navigation" operations in the flashpoint Taiwan Strait waterway.US President Joe Biden is expected to announce his strategy toward China soon, and calls are growing for him to make a clear public commitment to defend Taiwan militarily.A US law requires Washington to help the island defend itself in the event of a conflict, but the United States has pursued a policy of "strategic ambiguity" for decades, refraining from clearly stating what circumstances would lead it to intervene militarily on Taiwan's behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-considered-nuclear-strike-on-china-in-1958-over-taiwan-documents-show-101621698695874.html

In addition, transport companies will only be allowed to bring German citizens back into the country.Germany now classifies Britain as a “virus variant area,” the country’s highest risk category, following a recommendation from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), according to the foreign ministry.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that she is deeply concerned about the spread of the variant first detected India.“This variant seems to be even more aggressive than the British mutation,” Merkel said after the G-20 World Health Summit on Friday. “That means we will have to be careful.”Germany had recently eased strict lockdown measures after the incident rate dropped below 100 in most areas. Britain, too, was removed from Germany’s list of risky areas after a fast-paced vaccination campaign and tough lockdowns massively reduced case numbers.The decision to classify Britain as the highest risk area again might effect the presence of Merkel’s delegation at the three-day G-7 summit in Cornwall, which is scheduled to begin on June 11. Journalists have been advised not to travel to the U.K. to cover the event because they would be forced to quarantine afterward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-imposes-travel-curbs-on-uk-due-to-virus-variant-from-india-101621695889716.html
22-05-2021||World||How the Covid variant from India exposed Britain’s weaknesses||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was slow to ban travel to India, even as cases of a dangerous Covid-19 variant in the world’s second most populous country surged. Scientists and advisers now fear the U.K. has exposed its vulnerability, and the question is if the government machine can move fast enough when the next strain arrives.Officials privately suspect Johnson’s team was reluctant to close the border to travelers from India for political reasons with post-Brexit ties around the world high on the economic agenda. There were also concerns the country didn’t have the infrastructure in place to cope with the sheer number of people wanting to return to the U.K.This week, ministers confirmed the variant discovered in India had taken hold in 86 separate parts of Britain, including areas of northwest England and Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow. While Johnson says there’s no evidence so far that the arrival of the new strain will mean lockdown rules have to remain for longer, he has already warned a delay to lifting restrictions might be needed.Germany said late Friday it will impose fresh restrictions on the U.K. Starting Sunday, travelers from the U.K. will have to spend two weeks in quarantine upon arrival even if they test negative for the virus. In addition, transport companies will only be allowed to bring German citizens back into the country.The U.K. has registered Europe’s highest death toll from the pandemic, though has rolled out its fastest vaccination program. Yet as the government promises a return to as close to normal as possible next month, the country appears to be in familiar territory after a succession of reversals with rules eased and then tightened again. “We need to be able to react more quickly,” said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. “We cannot wait till there is absolutely no doubt that a serious hazard exists either in a U.K. local authority or in a travel destination.”In late March, as the pandemic in India worsened, Johnson’s officials still regarded the risks as manageable. His senior adviser, Edward Lister, was picking his way through the heat and smog of Mumbai. The 71-year-old had been dispatched to help nail down agreements with Narendra Modi’s government—from medical supplies to defense—in preparation for a high-profile visit by Johnson the following month.For the British prime minister, the trade trip was meant to have been a defining moment. It was due to be his first foreign mission since he led the U.K. out of the European Union, and a stepping stone to negotiations for full free trade agreement—a key prize of Brexit.According to one official briefed on the discussions, Johnson was under pressure from diplomats and aides to press ahead with the trade mission, despite the risks. It is a suspicion that has caused concern among government scientific advisers, according to one person involved.About a week before the trip, the rate of infections started to rise, though it was no worse than in some other countries, another official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pakistan was “running much hotter” than India, the person said. Johnson’s visit had already been canceled once and Lister’s preparatory work had been a success. Everything was arranged.The government denies that the desire to keep the trade mission live played any part in the decision not to add India to the red list of countries that are riskiest for travel.The decision-making Covid-O committee of top officials met to discuss which countries should be added to the red list. On April 2, it was announced that Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on it, but India was kept under a “watching brief,” according to a person familiar with the matter.One official involved said ministers had to rely on the data that was available, and that was incomplete. “Political judgments are taken at the place where the science stops and doesn’t have all the answers,” the official said.But it wasn’t just an absence of information on the scale of the risk that kept India off the red list at that meeting. There were also concerns that the wave of Britons arriving home from India would swamp airports, making it harder for Border Force officials to process passengers’ passports and Covid status, according to officials.One person involved in the discussions said fears were raised that there would not be enough beds available in hotels to quarantine passengers arriving from India if the country had been put on the red list sooner.A U.K. government spokesperson said officers will continue to carry out 100% health checks on passengers at the border to protect the public. “While we do this, wait times are likely to be longer and we will do all we can to smooth the process,” the spokesperson said. That will include electronic passport gate upgrades over the summer and deploying extra Border Force officers.The Department of Health said the traffic-light system for travel is based on regular scrutiny of the latest scientific data, the Joint Biosecurity Centre’s risk assessment and wider public health factors.On April 14, Johnson’s office announced that the India trade trip has been scaled back from four days to just one. Five days later, with the pandemic in India looking increasingly bleak, Downing Street canceled the visit and finally put the country on the red list. The new measures, though, didn’t take effect until April 23—a move that one official says was intended to help ease the strain on border staff.“It should have been on the red list from day one,” said Hunter at the University of East Anglia. “To compound that by giving people four days to rush back—those two things together were really inappropriate.” As the debate raged in Westminster last week, the government insisted it had acted in line with the scientific advice and the data available at the time. Extending restrictions would be a major blow to businesses. It would also cause a political headache for Johnson, who has said he never wants another lockdown, and jeopardize the U.K.’s recovery. No date has been set for Johnson to make his trip to India. Whenever it is rescheduled, the row over the red list decision will hang over officials organizing the logistics. In the words of one person involved last time: “Nobody realized how bad it was getting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-covid-variant-from-india-exposed-britain-s-weaknesses-101621695812797.html
22-05-2021||World||Two-state ‘only answer’ to Israel-Palestine conflict: US prez||US President Joe Biden has said a two-state solution was the “only answer” to the Israel-Palestine conflict emphatically reiterating decades-old US policy that had enjoyed an indifferent to no backing from his predecessor, Donald Trump.On Friday, Biden also made it clear that “there will be no peace” in the region if Israel’s right to exist as an independent Jewish nation was not acknowledged and accepted.President Biden was speaking at a joint news briefing with visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a day after Israel and Hamas declared an unconditional ceasefire ending an 11-day conflict, which the United States had helped to resolve through “quiet, relentless diplomacy”. US efforts included upwards of 80 phone calls made by its officials to their counterparts in the region, and six between Biden and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.During the 11-day conflict, President Biden had come under increasing pressure from within his party, especially progressives who were critical of Israel, to do more. “There is no shift in my commitment to the security of Israel. Period. No shift, not at all,” Biden said in response to a question if there was a shift in Democratic party, against Israel. “The shift is that we still need a two-state solution. It is the only answer. The only answer,” he added.“My party still supports Israel,” Biden said, adding, “Let’s get something straight here. Until the region says unequivocally, they acknowledge the right of Israel to exist as an independent Jewish state, there will be no peace.”US commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and Palestine to co-exists as two separate countries - had waned considerably under Trump, who had moved the US even closer to Israel by changing several decades old policies, such as recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.“I’m looking at two-state and one-state and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like,” Trump had said in 2017. And in 2020, he unveiled a peace plan that proposed a “realistic two-state solution”, which made Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides, the “undivided” capital of Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twostate-only-answer-to-israel-palestine-conflict-us-prez-101621697098516.html
22-05-2021||World||New voter ID rules in many US states raise concerns of fraud, ballot rejection||When voters in Florida and Georgia want to vote by mail in next year’s races for governor, they will have to make sure they take one more step to ensure they receive a ballot: providing their identification.Just two states had ID requirements in 2020 for voters requesting a mailed ballot. This year, Republicans across the country have zeroed in on mail voting and enacted new limits on a process that exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.In addition to Florida and Georgia, legislation to require additional identification for mail voting was introduced in Arizona, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas, according to information compiled by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voter access.Republicans, seizing on false claims by former President Donald Trump of widespread fraud in last year's White House election, say identification is needed for mailed ballots to deter fraud and improve confidence in elections. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Courts rejected multiple claims by Trump and his allies, a coalition of federal, state and local election officials called it the most secure election in U.S. history, and Trump’s own attorney general said he had seen nothing that would change the outcome.Critics say adding ID requirements to request a mailed ballot is not only unnecessary but creates one more opportunity for voters to make a mistake that could leave them unable to vote absentee. Identification, they say, is already required when registering to vote and when voting in person for the first time.When ID also is required to cast a mailed ballot, as is now the case in Georgia, critics say it will only result in more ballots being rejected. It also is expected to disproportionally affect poor, minority and college-age voters -- groups more likely not to have an ID or to have one with a different address.“Every additional requirement you add will lead to more ballot rejections, people who inadvertently fail to comply or don’t comply correctly with those requirements,” said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU’s School of Law, which supports expanded voter access.A Republican proposal in Michigan has drawn particular concern from Democrats because it would require voters to submit a printed copy of their ID when requesting a mailed ballot. Although the state’s governor, a Democrat, is likely to veto any voting restriction, the state has a unique process that could allow this and other voting bills to become law if enough citizens petition for it and the GOP-controlled Legislature passes it.Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has pushed back against GOP claims that IDs are more secure than the current process, which relies on matching a voter's signature on ballot applications or return envelopes to the signature on file at the election office.“There is no evidence this change reduces or deters fraud,” Benson said. “It actually makes it harder to detect fraud because those seeking to fraudulently request an absentee ballot need only to submit a copy of a fake ID to do so, whereas it’s much more difficult to forge a signature.”The Michigan Senate's majority leader, Republican Mike Shirkey, has said voters favor ID requirements and that it was important to ensure registered voters are Michigan residents. “The best way to do that is through a state-issued ID,” he said.Benson noted that 130,000 of some 7 million registered voters in Michigan don’t have a state ID or driver’s license. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, said that one-quarter of Black residents in his city don’t own a car and many don’t have printers at home.“If your family has got a car, has got a personal computer, has got a printer copier at home, these bills are not so bad,” Duggan said. “This is what is wrong: They have constructed a series of bills that a poorer family without computers, without a car, has a far harder time voting than the other families. This is voter suppression at its core.”Voter ID requirements have long been a flashpoint in the battle over voting, with past efforts focused on rules surrounding in-person voting. As of 2020, 36 states had ID requirements for voting at polling places, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Most allow a wide range of nonphoto identification such as a bank or utility statement. Many states allow voters to sign an affidavit under penalty of perjury that they are who they say they are.Democrats have said they are not opposed to ID requirements as long as multiple forms of identification are accepted and there is an option for voters to sign an affidavit should they not have an ID or forget to bring it to the polls. Federal legislation being pushed this year by Democrats in Congress would make an affidavit mandatory in any state with a voter ID law.What’s new this year are the additional ID requirements to request or submit mailed ballots. Previously, only Alabama and Wisconsin required identification to request a mailed ballot.Under a recently signed law, Florida voters will have to provide their driver’s license number, state ID number or last four digits of their Social Security number to request a mailed ballot. In South Dakota, those seeking to vote by mail must submit a copy of a photo ID or a notarized oath.Georgia's new elections law requires voters to provide their name, date of birth, address and driver’s license or state ID card number when requesting an absentee ballot and when returning it.Georgia state Sen. Brian Strickland, a Republican whose district is south of Atlanta, told reporters last month that the goal of the requirement was to move away from having to rely on local election officials to match voter signatures on file to applications and ballots, which he described as “not a workable process.”“This was a big complaint we heard from both sides,” Strickland said.Georgia's secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, said he has long supported an ID requirement. He said he has faced lawsuits from both Democrats and Republicans over signature matching, and said the process is subjective."When you go to photo ID, it’s very objective,” he said.In response to challenges by Democrats, legal settlements in several states have assured voters they will have an opportunity to fix problems that arise with a missing or mismatched signature.The Georgia law already is facing multiple court challenges, including one claiming the ID requirement creates the potential for fraud and identity theft. The required personal identification information can be easily stolen, creating the possibility for ballots to be requested and cast using voters’ names and information without their knowledge, according to a federal lawsuit filed by a group of county election board members, voters and others.Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat who represents a metro Atlanta district, said the legislation was built on lies spread by Trump and his allies and will end up harming voters.“At the end of the day, we can’t ignore the origins of the bill, the intent behind it and how a lot of these new provisions can be used to invalidate the will of the voter,” Jordan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-voter-id-rules-in-many-us-states-raise-concerns-of-fraud-ballot-rejection-101621691271659.html

In an investigation notice published on Thursday, the CDC said that 163 cases of confirmed illness have been reported across 43 states. Out of the reported cases, the median age of sick people was 24 and 58 per cent of those were female.The US health agency noted that the true number is likely to be much higher since many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella. “Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with backyard poultry is making people sick,” the report said, adding that 81 people, out of 92 interviewed by state and local public health officials, reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick."You can get sick from touching your backyard poultry or anything in their environment and then touching your mouth or food, and swallowing Salmonella germs," the CDC said.Also Read | CDC chief wants unvaccinated people to be ‘honest with themselves’. Here’s whySalmonella causes diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps and some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or a headache. The symptoms of the bacterial infection usually start within 6 hours to 6 days after infection and last 4-7 days. The CDC issued an advisory on what backyard flock owners should do in order to prevent the disease.“Don’t kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don’t eat or drink around them. This can spread Salmonella germs to your mouth and make you sick,” the investigation notice said.The CDC has advised owners to wash their hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam. It also asked to not let children younger than 5 years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry as they are more likely to get sick from germs like Salmonella. As per an estimate by the CDC, Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalisations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-kiss-or-snuggle-cdc-warns-poultry-owners-amid-salmonella-outbreak-101621689096939.html
22-05-2021||World||Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine 80% effective against B1.617.2 variant: UK study||Two doses from either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine are over 80 per cent effective in preventing infection from the B1.617.2 variant of Covid-19, first discovered in India, a new UK government study has reportedly found.The Oxford/AstraZeneca two-dose vaccine is also being produced by the Serum Institute of India as Covishield and being administered among the adult population in India to protect against the deadly virus.The UK findings are said to be based on data from Public Health England (PHE) and have also revealed that the two doses provide 87 per cent protection from the B.117 variant, first discovered in Kent region of England and also considered highly transmissible.According to ‘The Telegraph’ newspaper, the latest study's findings were presented to a meeting of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) this week.The latest PHE statistics released earlier this week show that case numbers of the B1.617.2 variant had risen by 2,111 over the past week to hit 3,424 cases across the country."I think it's clearly growing, which anyone can see from the numbers as they are reported week by week,” Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of Covid-19 genomics at the Sanger Institute, told the BBC."If I had to put a guess today it would be 20 or 30 per cent rather than 50 per cent (more infectious than the Kent variant). But there is still uncertainty, 50 per cent might be a reasonable worst case scenario," he said, in reference to the rate of transmissibility of the variant of concern (VOC) first detected in India.Meanwhile, PHE officials are also closely monitoring a variant under investigation (VUI) in the Yorkshire region of England, which is showing high transmissibility.It comes as the National Health Service (NHS) further expanded its vaccination programme and announced that it will open bookings for people aged 32 and 33, adding to the over-34s cohort, from Saturday.NHS England said that the third expansion of eligibility in just one week comes as over four in 10 adults have now had both jabs.“Only days after we extended the offer of a vaccine to 34 and 35 year olds, we are now rolling out the invite to 32 and 33 year olds - an incredible step forward in the biggest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“This is truly a testament to the heroic work of our amazing NHS and care staff, volunteers and local authorities across the country who have helped deliver over 50 million jabs at lightning speed across England, keeping us on track to offer a vaccine to everyone by July,” he said.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has, meanwhile, said that it is ramping up testing and genome sequencing of sewage and waste water in the drive to track and trace all variants of Covid-19, including the B1.617.2 variant.A new laboratory in Exeter, south-west England, opened last month dedicated to analysing wastewater, making it one of the biggest wastewater processing labs in the world.Increased genomic sequencing of sewage samples are expected to provide more clues to where variants of concern may be circulating undetected in communities. It can pick up evidence of variants from infected people and continue to monitor sewage after surge testing has ended in an area.“Sequencing wastewater samples provides an additional detection system for variants of concern, enabling us to respond more effectively to outbreaks and better protect citizens,” said Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries.“This innovative programme supports the work of Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace to help us understand where the virus may be circulating undetected,” she said.Wastewater samples are taken from around 500 locations in England and sent to the laboratory at Exeter Science Park. Environment Agency scientists analyse the samples to quantify the amount of Covid-19 present.“As infections fall and we head out of national restrictions, analysing wastewater to detect variants early on is important to help local authorities and NHS Test and Trace act quickly to stop variants from spreading in communities,” said Programme Lead at the Joint Biosecurity Centre Dr Andrew Engeli.The experts said that without the need to rely on individuals coming forward for swab tests, this kind of monitoring in a catchment area is able to pinpoint outbreaks to smaller areas and neighbourhoods. There are also pilots analysing the wastewater from specific institutions, such as within the food supply chain and prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxfordastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-80-effective-against-b1-617-2-variant-uk-study-101621687539016.html

22-05-2021||World||Some Covid-19 vaccines help nations exit the pandemic faster than others||With hundreds of millions of people now vaccinated against Covid-19, the coronavirus outbreak should begin to die down in places where a large chunk of the population has been inoculated. But that isn’t happening everywhere.Instead, two paths are emerging: In countries such as Israel, new Covid cases are declining as vaccinations spread, while in other places like the Seychelles -- which has fully inoculated more of its population than any other nation -- infections continue to increase or even reach new highs.One reason for that may be the different types of vaccine being used. Evidence derived from the expanding global inoculation rollout indicates that the messenger RNA shots developed by Moderna Inc. or Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE are better at stopping people from becoming contagious, helping reduce onward transmission -- an unexpected extra benefit as the first wave of Covid vaccines were intended to stop people from becoming very sick.Other vaccines, while effective in preventing acute illness or death from Covid, appear not to have this extra perk to the same degree.“This will be an increasing trend as countries start to realize that some vaccines are better than others,” said Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in South Australia. While the use of any vaccine “is still better than nothing,” he said, some doses “may have little benefit in preventing spread, even if they reduce the risk of death or severe disease.”Studies of millions of people in Israel vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot show the mRNA doses prevented more than 90% of asymptomatic infections -- those who contract the virus but show no symptoms. That’s important, said Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, because a vaccine’s ability to stop asymptomatic infection “is the determinant of whether or not herd immunity is possible.”Also Read | World’s most vaccinated country is witnessing Covid-19 surge worse than India. What does it mean?Herd immunity is typically achieved when the virus can no longer find any vulnerable hosts in order to keep spreading.Which vaccines a country can secure could therefore affect everything from policy about mask-wearing and social distancing to lifting border restrictions and reviving economies, given the influence that daily case counts have on government decisions. For individuals it may determine how soon they regain pre-pandemic freedoms.The differences in effectiveness are already leading to preferred brands in countries where more than one vaccine is available. In the Philippines, immunization centers have been instructed not to announce which shots are being given after a crowd turned up at one location hoping to get access to the Pfizer shot.Mask FreeIn the U.S., nearly 40% of the population has been fully vaccinated, mostly with mRNA shots, and the number of new cases each day has dropped by more than 85% in the past four months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month said those who are fully vaccinated can gather without masks or social distancing.“If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing things you have stopped doing because of the pandemic,” said CDC director Rochelle Walensky, “we have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy.”A similar trajectory is evident in Israel, which fully vaccinated nearly 60% of its population with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and has gradually lifted restrictions as new cases declined to fewer than 50 a day, from more than 8,000 at the beginning of this year. Qatar and Malta are also witnessing a decline in new cases after giving around 30% of their populations two doses of mostly mRNA vaccines.The results provide further evidence of the surprise efficacy of the new mRNA shots; the pandemic is the first time this vaccine technology is being widely used. They work by delivering genetic codes that instruct the human body to make proteins of the virus that in turn stimulate an immune response.Also Read | Coronavirus: World’s most-vaccinated nation Seychelles sees tourism pick-upThe existing mRNA shots require ultra cold storage, limiting their accessibility to countries with poor transport and storage infrastructure.That’s one reason why most countries, though, are relying predominantly on non-mRNA shots ranging from the adenovirus vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc, to those from Chinese developers Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. that use an inactivated form of the virus. These more traditional vaccine types have shown efficacy rates of between 50% to 80% in preventing symptomatic Covid in clinical trials, compared with more than 90% for mRNA ones. There’s little data regarding their ability to prevent onward transmission, but signs are emerging that it may be much lower.“Real-world evidence is difficult to compare as it is captured at different times, in different populations, in different places that may have different levels of Covid-19 infection and with different variants of the virus in circulation,” said an AstraZeneca statement.The statement pointed to newly released real-world data from the U.K. as evidence of the shot’s benefits: two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, said Public Health England on Thursday.This is higher than the 66.7% efficacy rate found in clinical trials, though data is not yet available on the vaccine’s ability to prevent asymptomatic infection in the real world.Sinopharm didn’t immediately respond to queries for this story.An archipelago in the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles has fully vaccinated about 65% of its population with AstraZeneca and Sinopharm shots, yet weekly new infections increased rapidly this month, with 37% of those patients having already received their two doses. The surge led authorities to close schools, cancel sporting events and ban household gatherings. Among fully inoculation people, around 60% received the vaccine from Sinopharm and the rest got AstraZeneca’s shot.In Chile in South America, the steady ramp-up in vaccination using mostly Sinovac’s shot didn’t prevent the number of new daily cases from almost doubling in mid-April from a month earlier, despite administering enough doses to cover 30% of the population. Authorities had to reintroduce a lockdown across the country in late March.But in the case of both countries, the type of vaccine available seems to be only one of many factors affecting the spread of the disease. Policy failures in places that reacted too slowly to impose restrictions, or lifted them prematurely, have been a major contributor, as has speed of diagnosis and access to medical facilities. Different transmission rates of virus variants also play a part.Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan said transmission increased in his country after the nation’s world-beating vaccine roll-out caused people to let down their guard.The uptick in infections in Chile was attributed by Sinovac’s Chief Executive Officer Yin Weidong to the nation prioritizing elderly people in their initial vaccination efforts. “It’s normal that the country sees a resurgence of infections as social activities increase among the younger people who are mainly not inoculated,” he said in a May 11 interview.* Note: Data for Pfizer and Sinovac vaccine is from real world studies in Israel and Chile respectively, while that for AstraZeneca is from its clinical trials.Variant ThreatWhat seems clear is that all the approved doses reduce the incidence of people becoming severely ill or dying from the disease -- the primary goal of a vaccine. That takes pressure off hospitals and medical resources. Most new Covid patients in the Seychelles, for example, are only experiencing mild symptoms, according to the nation’s president.This is a crucial first step for countries without access to mRNA vaccines, said Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland. After using available vaccines to crush the number of severe cases, countries can stamp out remaining infection with shots that curb transmission once they become available.Another possibility is that vaccination along with the spread of mild cases could also end up building so-called herd immunity, said Ben Cowling, head of the University of Hong Kong’s department of epidemiology and biostatistics. “The places with less immunity against infection but more immunity against severe disease will see circulation of the virus causing mainly mild infections, boosting immunity to a higher level.”Experts say a lot remains unknown and so-called breakthrough infections -- where people who received shots still get Covid -- do occur, even with mRNA vaccines. It’s also not yet fully known how well the different kinds of shots perform against the different variants of the virus.A study conducted in Qatar among some 260,000 people who completed two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine showed the mRNA shot’s effectiveness at preventing infections caused by the South African variant dipping to 75%.The improvements in the U.S and Israel came before those places were affected by concerning new strains, which include variants that have emerged in Brazil and India.“I would be careful about over-interpreting the data,” said Petrovsky at Flinders University, who points out that no head-to-head studies -- where shots are tested against each other -- have been performed to identify the best vaccines. For the mRNA shots, “data on their effects on transmission is very limited.”In the end, it may need the development of new, modified versions of the vaccines to finally win the war against Covid, said Petousis-Harris. Some vaccine developers are working on nasal spray inoculations, which can prevent the virus from taking hold in the respiratory track, thus cutting off infection at its entry point.“We’ve got some super vaccines that are beyond expectation,” she said. “We’ve learned a lot and so imagine what the next one is going to look like.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-covid-19-vaccines-help-nations-exit-the-pandemic-faster-than-others-101621683617650.html
22-05-2021||World||Two Covid vaccine doses needed for strong protection against B.1.617.2 variant found in India: Report||Both doses of two-dose regimen Covid-19 vaccines are needed to provide strong protection against symptomatic infection from the virus variant first identified in India, according to a Financial Times report based on UK government research. The B.1.617.2 variant has raised severe concern around the world as health experts are increasingly wary about the vaccine efficacy against the new variant which has now become the second most dominant variant in Britain after B.1.1.7 strain. The United Kingdom has detected 3,424 cases of B.1.617.2 variant across the country as of May 12.Public Health England (PHE) data on vaccine efficacy, presented on Friday to the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), suggested that two vaccine doses provide 81 per cent protection against the B.1.617.2 variant, reported FT, quoting two officials briefed on the preliminary data. One dose of the Covid-19 vaccine offered 33 per cent protection against the virus variant, per FT.The data from the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines showed that while a single Covid shot offered 51 per cent protection against the B.1.1.7 variant, both doses provided 87 per cent protection. This means a single dose of Covid vaccine provides 35 per cent less protection against B.1.617.2 as compared with the variant first detected in the UK.Also Read | Why the gap between Covaxin doses has not been extended, Centre explainsEarlier on Thursday, PHE, citing new analysis, announced that two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine provide around 85-90 per cent protection against symptomatic disease. British health secretary Matt Hancock said that the new data shows the vaccine saves lives and protects people from ending up in hospital with Covid-19. However, the UK health agency didn’t provide data on vaccine efficacy against B.1.617.2 variant.“Public Health England scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant of Sars-Cov-2. We will be publishing the results of this evaluation in due course,” PHE was quoted by FT as saying.Meanwhile, a virologist has warned that the spread of new variants, including the one discovered in India, is concerning because of the possibility that it could escape vaccine immunity. Speaking at BBC Breakfast, Dr Chris Smith said that the variants of concern could increase the number of cases as a significant proportion of the UK population hasn’t been fully vaccinated yet.“The more variation there is, the more chances we’re going to see the vaccines stop working,” he added.The government of India recently increased the gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine, a version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed by Serum Institute of India (SII), to 12-16 weeks. “Based on the available real-life evidences, particularly from UK, the Covid-19 Working agreed for increasing the dosing interval to 12-16 weeks between two doses of Covishield vaccine," the health ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-covid-vaccine-doses-needed-for-strong-protection-against-variant-found-in-india-report-101621681161772.html

Mountaineering was closed last year due to the pandemic.Nepalese officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday. Other climbing teams have not announced any Covid-19 infections among their members or staff. Several climbers have reported testing positive after they were brought down from the Everest base camp.Furtenbach said most teams on the mountain were not carrying virus testing kits, and that before his team pulled out, they had helped conduct tests and had confirmed two cases.Most teams are still at base camp, hoping for clear weather next week so they can make a final push to the summit before the climbing season closes at the end of the month, Furtenbach said.In late April, a Norwegian climber became the first to test positive at the Everest base camp. He was flown by helicopter to Kathmandu, where he was treated and later returned home.Nepal is experiencing a virus surge, with record numbers of new infections and deaths. China last week canceled climbing from its side of Mount Everest due to fears the virus could be spread from the Nepalese side.Nepal reported 8,607 new infections and 177 deaths on Friday, bringing the nation's totals since the pandemic began to more than 497,000 infections and 6,024 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climbing-guide-says-at-least-100-coronavirus-cases-on-everest-101621680850385.html

Pakistan wants a peaceful resolution of the Palestine issue.The brutal fighting between the two countries killed at least 243 Palestinians, including 66 children. On the other hand, 12 people were killed in Israeli, including two children and an Indian national, Al Jazeera reports.Demonstrators in Chaman could be seen waving signs that said "Free Palestine", while a major road connecting the capital Islamabad to the neighbouring city Rawalpindi was blocked, reported Geo News.On April 22, three people were killed and 13 others got injured in an explosion in the parking lot of a hotel, which was hosting the Chinese ambassador, in Balochistan's capital Quetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-islamist-political-party-leaders-killed-in-bomb-blast-in-balochistan-report-101621678045547.html
22-05-2021||World||Why do we get shots in the arm? It’s all about the muscle||Millions have rolled up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine, but why haven’t they rolled up their pants legs instead? Why do we get most shots in our arms?As an associate professor of nursing with a background in public health, and as a mother of two curious kids, I field this question fairly often. So here’s the science behind why we get most vaccines in our arm.It’s worth noting that most, but not all, vaccines are given in the muscle – this is known as an intramuscular injection. Some vaccines, like the rotavirus vaccine, are given orally. Others are given just beneath the skin, or subcutaneously – think of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. However, many others are given in the muscle.But why is the muscle so important, and does location matter? And why the arm muscle – called the deltoid – in the top of the shoulder?Muscles have immune cellsMuscles make an excellent vaccine administration site because muscle tissue contains important immune cells. These immune cells recognize the antigen, a tiny piece of a virus or bacteria introduced by the vaccine that stimulates an immune response. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine, it is not introducing an antigen but rather administering the blueprint for producing antigens.The immune cells in the muscle tissue pick up these antigens and present them to the lymph nodes. Injecting the vaccine into muscle tissue keeps the vaccine localized, allowing immune cells to sound the alarm to other immune cells and get to work.Once a vaccine is recognized by the immune cells in the muscle, these cells carry the antigen to lymph vessels, which transport the antigen-carrying immune cells into the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes, key components of our immune system, contain more immune cells that recognize the antigens in vaccines and start the immune process of creating antibodies.Clusters of lymph nodes are located in areas close to vaccine administration sites. For instance, many vaccines are injected in the deltoid because it is close to lymph nodes located just under the armpit. When vaccines are given in the thigh, the lymph vessels don’t have far to travel to reach the cluster of lymph nodes in the groin.Muscles keep the action localisedMuscle tissue also tends to keep vaccine reactions localized. Injecting a vaccine into the deltoid muscle may result in local inflammation or soreness at the injection site. If certain vaccines are injected into fat tissue, the chance of irritation and inflammation reaction increases because fat tissue has poor blood supply, leading to poor absorption of some vaccine components.Vaccines that include the use of adjuvants – or components that enhance the immune response to the antigen – must be given in a muscle to avoid widespread irritation and inflammation. Adjuvants act in a variety of ways to stimulate a stronger immune response.Yet another deciding factor in vaccine administration location is the size of the muscle. Adults and children ages three and older tend to receive vaccines in their upper arm in the deltoid. Younger children receive their vaccines mid-thigh because their arm muscles are smaller and less developed.Another consideration during vaccine administration is convenience and patient acceptability.Can you imagine taking down your pants at a mass vaccination clinic? Rolling up your sleeve is way easier and more preferred. Infectious disease outbreaks, as in flu season or amid epidemics like COVID-19, require our public health system to vaccinate as many people as possible in a short time. For these reasons, a shot in the arm is preferred simply because the upper arm is easily accessible.All things considered, when it comes to the flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine, for most adults and kids, the arm is the preferred vaccination route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-do-we-get-shots-in-the-arm-it-s-all-about-the-muscle-101621676949567.html

The former Soviet Union landed a craft in 1971, but it lost communication seconds later.The 240-kg (530-pound) Zhurong, which has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera, will study the planet's surface soil and atmosphere.Powered by solar energy, Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any subsurface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration of the Martian surface.China's uncrewed Tianwen-1 spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year. After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the Red Planet in February where it had been in orbit since.On May 15, the landing capsule carrying the rover separated from Tianwen-1 and touched down on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia.The first images taken by the rover were released by the Chinese space agency on Wednesday.Tianwen-1 was one of three probes that reached Mars in February.US rover Perseverance touched down on Feb. 18 in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000 km (1,240 miles) from Utopia Planitia.Hope - the third spacecraft to arrive in February - is not designed to land. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is orbiting above Mars, gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.Perseverance and Zhurong are among three robotic rovers operating on Mars. The third is NASA's Curiosity, which landed in 2012.NASA's InSight, which arrived on the surface of the planet in 2018 to study its interior, is a stationary module.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-zhurong-rover-takes-first-drive-on-surface-of-mars-101621672577620.html

Sharif was inside his office at the time of the incident, it also reported.They were stopped at the entrance of the office after which they were questioned about the purpose of their visit. They said that they had an appointment with Nawaz Sharif, ANI reported citing local media.Dubbing the incident "cowardly and sinister", Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders have claimed that the assailants tried to enter his office with a "sinister” intention.Of the four men, three were wearing hoodies and their face was covered with a mask. The fourth person was donning a suit and was without a face mask, according to the ANI report.The four assailants immediately fled the site after security officials called the police. Local police have registered a criminal case against the four.Sharif's daughter and vice-president of PML-N, Maryam Nawaz took to Twitter to condemn the incident. "Those who toyed with Nawaz Sharif's life during his detention have not stopped yet... May God not give anyone a lowly and cowardly enemy," she said in a post on the micro-blogging site.Resorting to gross CRIMINALITY in the face of political frustration and defeat. Peoples voice will not be silenced by low life 3rd rate criminals.#NawazSharif is the voice of the people of Pakistan and will not be silenced, Insha’Allah.

People's voice will not be silenced by low life 3rd rate criminals. Nawaz Sharif is the voice of the people of Pakistan and will not be silenced," she added in the following tweet.Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the Opposition in Pakistan's national assembly, also condemned the incident. He said that attackers "seemed to be armed." He also called on London police to investigate the matter from all angles.Strongly condemn cowardly attempt to barge into the office of Hussain Nawaz where Mian Nawaz Sharif was also present. They seemed to be armed and clearly had a sinister design but thankfully, could not succeed. London police must investigate the incident from all angles.In September last, Sharif made a fiery speech against the Pakistani military's alleged involvement in the government. A week later, protesters criticising his speech, gathered outside his family's residential apartment in Avenfield House and raised slogans against him. They also hurled abuses and swear words at him, Pakistan's daily, Dawn had reported.Sharif made the speech via video conferencing from his office on September 20. The speech also provoked a debate in the country over the military's alleged interference in civilian governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-men-try-to-enter-ex-pak-pm-nawaz-sharif-s-office-in-london-pml-n-leaders-allege-sinister-intention-101621671617017.html
22-05-2021||World||New vibe at White House: Hugs are in; masks are (mostly) out||A smiling crowd of unmasked people filling the largest room in the White House. A visiting head of state welcomed with pomp, circumstance and handshakes. A 94-year old Medal of Honor recipient receiving a joyous hug from Vice President Kamala Harris.The White House is springing back to life.Thanks to growing availability of the coronavirus vaccine and a recent relaxation of federal guidance on masks and distancing, the Biden administration is embracing the look and feel of pre-pandemic days on Pennsylvania Avenue. More West Wing staffers are turning up there for work and more reporters will be doing so as well, as the White House spreads the message that a return to normal is possible with vaccinations.There are lingering concerns about safety and mixed messaging — the same contradictions and confusions that are popping up across a nation that is gingerly re-opening. But the images of a reopened, relaxed White House stand in striking contrast to the days when it was the site of several Covid-19 outbreaks last year, a sign of just how far the pandemic has begun to recede in the United States."We're back," White House press secretary Jen Psaki declared at Friday's daily briefing. “I can confirm we're a warm and fuzzy crew and we like to hug around here.”The changes within the White House over the past week were swift and sweeping. Hugs were in, masks were (mostly) out. There was no need to stand six feet apart. And no one seemed to enjoy the shift more than Biden, the most back-slapping and tactile of politicians.The president had been happy to announce the relaxed mask guidance when he appeared in the Rose Garden on May 13 without a mask, just hours after the CDC said those who are fully vaccinated don't need to wear masks in most settings.That cheerfulness carried over this past week into a series of larger public events that would have been out of bounds earlier in Biden's presidency.For the second straight day, the White House on Friday opened the East Room –- the executive mansion's largest room –- to scores of outside guests. Smiling broadly, Biden awarded the Medal of Honor for the first time as commander in chief, giving it to 94-year-old retired Col. Ralph Puckett Jr. for acts of bravery during the Korean War some 70 years ago.The White House timed Friday's ceremony to coincide with the visit of South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, who joined Biden at the event before their policy meetings. Both world leaders repeatedly clasped Puckett's hands and crowded in for a photo with the war hero's extended family.A day earlier, an even larger group of lawmakers and other guests were on hand to witness Biden sign legislation to counter an alarming spike in crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, were among the lawmakers trading hugs and kisses.“The nicest part is being able to shake hands again and to see people's smiles,” Collins marveled at one point.Afterward, lawmakers who helped shepherd the legislation through Congress surrounded Biden as he signed the measure into law. The president also engaged in an act that had largely disappeared from official Washington during the pandemic: He shook hands with a few guests before leaving.Earlier that day, he had welcomed the newest Kennedy Center honorees to the White House for a visit that marked the return of celebrity wattage to the property.By multiple accounts from Kennedy Center Honors recipients, the White House event was high-spirited, with Biden seemingly thrilled to have visitors.Debbie Allen called the president, “so engaging and open. He spent a lot more time with us than I expected.”Joan Baez said the official visit “turned into a jolly romp,” included a tour of the Rose Garden and culminated in Baez singing for Biden.Due to social distancing guidelines, the number of journalists allowed inside the White House shrunk once the pandemic hit, with the briefing room only about a quarter full for Psaki's daily question-and-answer sessions.Capacity is slated to go to 50 percent soon, with the goal of a full return by summer. The daily Covid-19 testing requirement for staff and most journalists was also expected to soon be waived for the fully vaccinated. And the parking spaces around the West Wing and Eisenhower Executive Office Building have been fuller as of late.Psaki said the effort to return to a more normal vibe was part of "continuing to open the White House up, the people's house up to the American people.”But questions remain about protocol.Abiding by the safety guidelines is a matter of the honor system. And Psaki acknowledged Friday that the White House did not have plans to verify vaccination status. Members of the administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have continued, at times, to offer confusing guidance on exactly when, and by whom, a mask should still be worn.Yet in most ways, the mood has changed dramatically.The first image that Americans saw of Biden at the White House as president was on Inauguration Day, as he sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office wearing a mask. Aiming to draw a stark contrast with the Trump White House, which took a cavalier attitude toward the virus within the building, the Democratic administration consistently erred on the side of caution, at times exceeding precautions recommended by the CDC.For months, Biden had privately groused that the pandemic prevented him from having face-to-face meetings with lawmakers and world leaders alike, and he chafed at having to conduct diplomacy by Zoom.On Friday, the White House unfurled all of its traditional in-person pageantry for Moon's visit and the two men were able to sit across from each other in the State Dining Room and, later, answer questions before a mask-free audience of diplomats, officials and reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-vibe-at-white-house-hugs-are-in-masks-are-mostly-out-101621662104735.html
22-05-2021||World||Biden admin backs dating sites to boost plateauing vaccination campaign in US||A Covid-19 vaccine can save your life and get you a date.The Biden White House on Friday threw its support behind - somewhat awkwardly - vaccination features introduced on dating apps such as Tinder, Match and Hinge.“We have finally found the one thing that makes us all more attractive: a vaccination,” Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to President Joe Biden on coronavirus response, said at a White House briefing.Vaccinated people are 14% more likely to get a date, he added, citing data from OKCupid, a dating app.These sites plan to - or have already - introduce a feature that allows users to display badges announcing they are vaccinated and filter out respondents who are not.More than 161 million Americans have been vaccinated, receiving at least one dose of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines or one and final of single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That is 57.6% of the eligible population, 12 and older now, and 48.6% of the total population.The number of shots administered every day is plateauing in many American states, and vaccine hesitancy is now seen as key hurdle by public health experts and officials.The Biden administration has tried various initiatives to overcome it, and encourage Americans to get inoculated, starting with the president and the first lady Jill Biden getting their shots publicly on live telecast. Their predecessors Donald Trump and Melania Trump got theirs’ quietly and unannounced, in keeping with the former president’s reluctance to acknowledge publicly the magnitude of the threat posed by SARS-Cov2, the virus that causes Covid-19, despite being fully aware of it privately.The Biden administration has made it possible for Americans to find a vaccination centre within 8km of wherever they live and has announced that Lyft and Uber are offering free rides to these centres, and back.Slavitt insisted it is an initiative of the dating apps, but the New York Times reported citing unidentified officials that the White House rallied the apps to participate.Dating apps have 50 million Americans among their users. And, the Biden administration finds that an effective way to broaden its vaccination effort.“Social distancing and dating were always a bit of a challenging combination,” Slavitt said, announcing the industry-wide vaccine feature.He added: “So today, dating sites like Bumble, Tinder, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, BLK, Chispa, Plenty of Fish, and Badoo are announcing a series of features to encourage vaccinations and help people … meet people who have that universally attractive quality: They’ve been vaccinated against Covid-19.”The awkward part of the announcement? “Alright, got through that,” said Slavitt, after announcing the initiative, relieved seemingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-backs-dating-sites-to-boost-plateauing-vaccination-campaign-in-us-101621658755719.html

22-05-2021||World||China asserts it will pick heir to Dalai Lama||China on Friday said that it will choose the successor to the India-based Dalai Lama through the process of “drawing lots from the golden urn”, with the candidate subject to approval of the Chinese government. A policy paper released on Friday all but ruled out the scope for the 14th and current Dalai Lama to himself choose his successor.Citing historical precedence, the paper said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other “living Buddhas” has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance was passed during the Qing Dynasty, between 1644 and 1911.“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of drawing lots from the golden urn, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the government of China,” said the paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”.The Dalai Lama, who is 85, had fled to India in 1959 following a crackdown on an uprising by the people of Tibet.The Tibetan leader was granted political asylum in India and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamsala since then.In 2017, the Chinese foreign ministry had told HT about the process it would follow on the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be conducted according to religious rituals and historical conventions, including drawing lots from the golden urn in front of the Shakyamuni (Buddha) statue at Jokhang temple in Lhasa, which embodies the Buddhist spirit,” the ministry had said, adding, “(and) not by what the 14th Dalai Lama has said”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asserts-it-will-pick-heir-to-dalai-lama-101621649276426.html
22-05-2021||World||WHO: Covid deaths 2 to 3 times higher||The official death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be a “significant undercount”, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, estimating that the true figure of direct and indirect deaths could be “two to three times higher”.Presenting its annual World Health Statistics report, the WHO estimated that total deaths from the pandemic in 2020 were at least 3 million or 1.2 million more than the 1.8 million figure officially reported.By May 20, 2021, WHO statistics showed around 3.4 million people had died globally as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, although the real figure could be much higher, the WHO said.With the rising death toll in Latin America and in Asia as new variants spread, the death toll “would truly be two to three times higher”, said Samira Asma, the WHO’s assistant director-general in its data and analytics division. “So I think safely about 6-8 million deaths could be an estimate,” Asma told a virtual press briefing.Meanwhile, severely ill Covid patients in Africa are more likely to die than those on other continents, which could be because of a lack of critical care equipment, a study has said. The study was done jointly by experts from Groote Schuur Hospital and University of Cape Town.On the vaccine front, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Asia is facing a supply crisis, with Nepal and Bangladesh having run out of shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-covid-deaths-2-to-3-times-higher-101621649324869.html

Gaza City was quiet under a cover of clouds, with a thin column of smoke wafting into the skies after Israeli airstrikes came to a halt.Palestinians celebrateCelebrations were seen on Gaza’s streets in the minutes after the truce began as cars honked their horns and guns were fired in the air, while in the occupied West Bank, joyful crowds also took to the streets.In Gaza, five more bodies were pulled from the rubble, taking the death toll to 243, including 66 children. The Israeli military said a soldier was killed as well as 12 civilians.Despite the truce, Israeli police fired stun grenades at Palestinian worshippers near Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Friday.

22-05-2021||World||Gaza media building owner complains to ICC: Lawyer||The owner of a Gaza building housing international media that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike is lodging a complaint with the International Criminal Court, his lawyer said.The complaint by Jawad Mehdi says that the attack on May 15 which flattened Jala Tower, housing the offices of US news agency Associated Press and Al Jazeera television, was a "war crime".The filing, a copy of which was seen by AFP, comes after the chief prosecutor of the ICC said last week that "crimes" may have been committed during the recent violence between Israel and the Palestinians."The owner of this building, who is a Palestinian, has mandated his lawyers to file a war crime complaint with the International Criminal Court," lawyer Gilles Devers said in a statement.Devers told AFP outside the court, where around 10 pro-Palestinian protesters were gathered, that Israel could show "no military objective" for the attack."We hear a lot that this tower could have been destroyed because there was equipment or an armed resistance team. This is something that we totally deny after studying the case," Devers said."International law is that you can only harm civilian property if it is used for military purposes, and that was not the case. So we say it today in front this court and in this complaint."Devers said the complaint would be formally sent to the court by email later Friday.Israel claimed that Hamas military intelligence units were in the building.Mehdi said at the time that an Israeli intelligence officer warned him he had one hour to ensure the building was evacuated before a missile slammed into the 13-storey building.The ICC has no obligation to consider complaints filed to its prosecutor, who can decide independently what cases to submit to judges at the court.The ICC had already opened an investigation in March into possible war crimes in the Palestinian Territories by both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups since 2014.The move infuriated Israel which is not a member of the court, while Palestine has been a state party to the ICC since 2015.Prosecutor Bensouda said last week that she noted with "great concern the escalation of violence" in the West Bank and Gaza "and the possible commission of crimes under the Rome Statute," which founded the ICC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-media-building-owner-complains-to-icc-lawyer-101621643257539.html
22-05-2021||World||Joe Biden vows to help 'rebuild' Gaza, insists on two-state solution||President Joe Biden on Friday pledged to help organize efforts to rebuild Gaza and said creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel is the "only answer" to the conflict.Biden also said he had told the Israelis to stop "intercommunal fighting" in the flashpoint city of Jerusalem.However he stressed "there is no shift in my commitment, commitment to the security of Israel" and added that until the region "unequivocally" acknowledges Israel's existence "there will be no peace."The idea of a two-state solution -- with a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel and Jerusalem as their shared capital -- has been the cornerstone of decades of international diplomacy aimed at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.US policy under Donald Trump was criticized as being blatantly pro-Israel and ignoring the Palestinians.A Mideast peace plan devised by Trump's adviser and son in law Jared Kushner was billed as providing for a two-state solution. But that blueprint envisioned a Palestinian state with only limited sovereignty and Israel maintaining security over that state.The plan was rejected out of hand by Palestinian leaders.Biden on Friday insisted on a full-blown two state remedy."There is no shift in my commitment to the security of Israel, period, no shift, not at all," he said."But I tell you what there is a shift in. The shift is that we still need a two-state solution. It is the only answer, the only answer," Biden stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-help-rebuild-gaza-insists-on-two-state-solution-101621642277820.html
22-05-2021||World||South Korea's Moon meets Joe Biden, hails 'America's return'||South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed “America’s return” to the world stage after his meeting with President Joe Biden on Friday and said both leaders pledged to work closely toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.Moon came to Washington seeking renewed diplomatic urgency by the US on curbing North Korea’s nuclear program, even as the White House signaled that it is taking a longer view on the issue. High on Biden's list for the meeting as well: coordination in vaccine distribution, climate change and regional security concerns spurred by China.Their meeting was only Biden's second in-person session with a foreign leader because of the coronavirus pandemic.Their formal talks in the afternoon ran long, Biden said, noting his staff interrupted repeatedly to warn they were over time. “But I enjoyed the meeting so much that it caused us to move everything back,” Biden said, as he highlighted the two countries’ “long history of shared sacrifice.”Moon said “The world is welcoming America’s return,” an oblique reference to former President Donald Trump's attempts to disengage on some aspects of American diplomacy.The White House announced last month that it had completed a review of North Korea policy and Biden would veer from the strategies of his two most recent predecessors, rejecting both Trump’s deeply personal effort to win over North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Barack Obama’s more hands-off approach.But the administration has yet to detail what its third-way effort to try to prod the North to abandon its nuclear program will look like.Moon started his day at the White House complex by meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris and top Biden advisers. Moon also participated in a Medal of Honor ceremony for Ralph Puckett, a 94-year-old Army veteran who was celebrated for his gallantry during the Korean War more than 60 years ago.“Without the sacrifice of veterans including Colonel Puckett ... freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea,” said Moon, who hailed Puckett as “true hero.”Moon, who will leave office next May, is eager to resume stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang and between Seoul and Pyongyang. But the Biden administration, which confirmed in March that it had made outreach efforts to the North without success, has been less enthusiastic about the idea of direct negotiations in the near term.Asked Thursday whether Biden was open to holding direct talks with Kim, as Trump did twice, press secretary Jen Psaki demurred.“I don’t expect that to be top on his agenda,” she said of Biden.Still, Moon made clear before the meeting that he would nudge Biden to renew diplomatic efforts with the North.“I will not be pressed by time or become impatient during the remainder of my term," Moon told reporters this month. “However, if there is an opportunity to restart the clock of peace and advance the peace process on the Korean Peninsula, I will do everything I can.”A senior administration official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and briefed reporters on Moon’s visit on the condition of anonymity, sidestepped questions about whether the administration was willing to offer North Korea sanctions relief to begin dismantling its nuclear and ballistic weapons programs.The official said the US was hoping to chart a “flexible” way forward, well aware of where past efforts went awry.Biden was also expected to use the meeting to press South Korea to adopt a more ambitious 2030 target for curbing carbon emissions and to urge Seoul to do more to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.Moon was expected to seek Biden’s assistance with helping South Korea boost its coronavirus vaccine supply. South Korea has vaccinated only about 5% of its population.Biden also wanted Moon to take a strong stance on China's activity toward Taiwan and other provocative moves Beijing has made in the region. Biden has sought to rally Pacific allies to coordinate on China, which Biden sees as the United States' fiercest economic competitor.Biden, in the early going of his presidency, has spoken out about concerns with Beijing's trade policies and human rights record and has also highlighted regional allies' concerns about an increasingly assertive Chinese military.Biden has taken note of Japan's concerns that China's growing military activity and broad territorial claims present a security threat. Japan is locked in a dispute with China over Beijing’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. He's also looked to strengthen relations with India, which has been tested by a military standoff with China along their disputed border in eastern Ladakh.But South Korea could be more reluctant to speak out about China, an important trading partner that it also sees as key in dealing with the Kim regime.Michael Green, who served as senior director for Asia on the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said South Korea's situation is difficult.“This South Korean policy of strategic ambiguity is proving increasingly awkward and almost untenable for Seoul because other middle powers that are not the US or Japan ... are adjusting their China policies,” said Green, who is senior vice president for Asia and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Moon on Thursday visited Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington and laid a wreath at a memorial to Americans killed during the Korean War. He also visited the US Capitol to meet with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-moon-meets-joe-biden-hails-america-s-return-101621632072935.html
22-05-2021||World||FBI employee accused of storing classified documents at home||An FBI employee has been indicted on charges that she stored classified documents and other national security information at home over the course of more than a decade, the Justice Department said Friday.Kendra Kingsbury, 48, is accused of having unauthorized possession of a broad swath of sensitive government documents, including materials that describe sources, methods and operations and that contain information about operatives such as a suspected associate of Osama bin Laden.Kingsbury worked as an intelligence analyst in the FBI's Kansas City office for 12 years until her suspension in December 2017. The two-count indictment, filed in the Western District of Missouri, alleges that during that time, Kingsbury illegally removed documents she was granted access to at work and stored them at home.Though Kingsbury held a top-secret security clearance and was assigned to squads covering a range of crimes and threats, she did not have a “need to know” the information in most of the documents, prosecutors say.According to the indictment, the records Kingsbury stored at home included details about specific investigations, sensitive human source operations, intelligence gaps with regard to terrorist organizations and foreign intelligence services, and information about the FBI's technical capabilities. The materials also discuss al-Qaida members, including a suspected bin Laden associate, prosecutors say.The indictment does not provide a reason for why Kingsbury mishandled the documents, nor does it accuse her of having transmitted the information to anyone else. The Justice Department declined to elaborate beyond the indictment on Friday.“The breadth and depth of classified national security information retained by the defendant for more than a decade is simply astonishing,” Alan E. Kohler Jr., the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division, said in a statement.The case underscores the risk to national security posed by “insider threats,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said in a statement.Court documents do not identify a lawyer for Kingsbury, of Dodge City, Kansas. A message left at a phone number connected to her was not immediately returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-employee-accused-of-storing-classified-documents-at-home-101621631095444.html
22-05-2021||World||Princes William, Harry hit out at BBC for ‘deceit’ in obtaining Diana interview||Britain’s Prince William accused the BBC of failing his mother Princess Diana and poisoning her relationship with Prince Charles after an inquiry found a journalist for the broadcaster deceitfully obtained an interview with her in 1995.William’s rebuke to the public broadcaster comes after a report published on Thursday said the inquiry found that BBC journalist Martin Bashir used deceit to win a sensational 1995 interview with Diana, and that the broadcaster covered up the deception.The inquiry’s report has prompted the British government to warn the broadcaster of potential action.During the “Panorama” interview with Bashir, watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain, Diana shared details of her crumbling marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as well as admitting to adultery.“It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents’ relationship worse and has since hurt countless others,” William, 38, said in a statement.In a separate statement issued at the same time, William’s brother Harry drew broader aim at the media and the “ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices [which] ultimately took her life”.Diana died in a high-speed car crash while being chased by paparazzi photographers in Paris at the age of 36 in 1997.The BBC set up the investigation, headed by former senior judge John Dyson, in November following allegations from Diana’s brother Charles Spencer that he had been tricked into introducing her to Bashir.Dyson’s report found that Bashir had shown Spencer fake bank statements suggesting that Diana was being bugged by the security services and that two senior aides were being paid to provide information about her.After it was aired, Bashir repeatedly lied to his bosses about how the interview was obtained, the report said. As questions continued, BBC managers failed to scrutinise his version of events properly and covered up facts about how Bashir had secured the interview.The BBC has written to Buckingham Palace to apologise.Bashir apologised for the fake statements, but said he stood by his evidence from 25 years ago and he did not believe they had prompted Diana to give the interview.Britain’s culture secretary Oliver Dowden, whose brief includes media, said an independent inquiry into the affair highlighted “damning failings at the heart of the BBC”, which is publicly funded. Ministers would now “consider whether further governance reforms at the BBC are needed”, as talks approach for renewal of its royal charter covering its running and regulation, he added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “I hope very much the BBC will be taking every possible step to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.”The BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan on Thursday said blanket criticism from government ministers to the future king and his brother left the BBC “severely injured, probably scarred”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princes-william-harry-hit-out-at-bbc-for-deceit-in-obtaining-diana-interview-101621623133750.html
