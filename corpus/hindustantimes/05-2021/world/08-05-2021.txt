During a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the 27 EU member states, the two sides also unveiled an ambitious connectivity partnership to foster public and private investments in connectivity projects and take up joint projects in Africa, Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific. This is only the EU’s second such partnership after a similar arrangement with Japan. The two sides didn’t specify any timeframe for negotiations on the agreements on trade, investment protection and geographical indications, saying a high-level mechanism led by India’s commerce minister and the EU trade commissioner would steer the negotiations and decide timelines. The agreement on resumption of trade negotiations, which were started in 2007 and suspended in 2013 after major differences on issues such as market access and mobility of Indian professionals, was described by secretary (West) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry as the “most important outcome” of the summit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three pacts will be negotiated “in parallel at the same time so that we move forward rapidly”. “Both sides have worked intensively over the last few months to arrive at a common understanding. The decisions are a result of the political desire on both sides to harness the full potential of our economic engagement and work towards an early post-Covid-19 recovery,” Swarup said. At a news briefing in Porto after the summit, Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel were lukewarm towards the proposal by India and South Africa for relaxing norms of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for vaccines. They expressed doubts as to whether such a move will help global access to vaccines and instead called on countries currently manufacturing doses to ramp up production and delivery. Swarup told a separate news briefing in New Delhi that Modi had requested the EU’s support for a TRIPS waiver on vaccine-related patents to ensure equitable access for the entire world, especially after the US had backed the move recently. “The EU’s support at WTO for this waiver will ensure that we can scale up the vaccine production for equitable and global access and save lives,” Swarup said. “We will be watching the evolving EU position on this particular issue.” Both Michel and Von der Leyen expressed solidarity and support for India to counter a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections, which has seen daily cases crossing the 400,000-mark in recent days, but made it clear the EU didn’t think a waiver of patents will produce significant and immediate results. The EU, they said, would back any effort that can lead to an increase in vaccine production and delivery in the short term. “Nevertheless, in the short term, many of us think that this may not be the magic solution. That’s why we want to keep a close eye [on it] and keep discussing this issue,” Michel said, acknowledging the only way out of the Covid-19 crisis is to immunise the global population. Von der Leyen noted the EU is open to discussions on waiver of patent protections but said: “These are important topics to discuss but we should be aware of the fact that these are topics for the long term. It’s not a topic for the short term or medium term, and therefore, we should not lose sight of the main urgencies now, which is ramping up vaccine production as quickly as possible and ensuring that they are fairly and evenly distributed.” She instead suggested other vaccine-producing countries should follow the EU’s example of exporting 50% of its total production of 400 million doses to 90 countries. Other countries should also support the WHO-backed COVAX facility and invest in global vaccine manufacturing capacities. In this regard, Von der Leyen said EU member states were investing in scaling up vaccine manufacturing capacities in Africa, and even thinking of deploying container-based vaccine laboratories that can train the workforce in African countries and transfer knowledge for providing safe and effective vaccines. The EU leaders stressed they had assured the Indian prime minister of solidarity and support, and pointed to the oxygen-related gear, medicines and other equipment worth 100 million euros donated by 17 member states. In his initial remarks at the summit, Modi explained the rationale for a stronger relationship with the EU and all its member states and described the strategic partnership between the two sides as a “force multiplier for the global good”. On the economic front, the two sides agreed to have dedicated dialogues on WTO issues, regulatory cooperation, market access issues and supply chain resilience. The high-level trade and investment dialogue will monitor progress on these decisions. The two sides also discussed how technology should be used for the welfare of the people while being rooted in democratic values. They also emphasised the need for secure networks and agreed to cooperate on global standards in new and emerging technologies such as 5G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-eu-to-resume-negotiations-on-three-trade-related-agreements-101620497409646.html
08-05-2021||World||Angela Merkel hopeful on Europe summer travel even without Covid-19 vaccination||Europeans can look forward to traveling this summer, if coronavirus cases keep declining further on the continent, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday.While the European Union (EU) is developing a vaccine certificate valid throughout the 27-nation bloc, summer vacations abroad should be possible again even for people who haven't had their shots against the coronavirus, she said.“If you look at the low incidence (of Covid-19) that some of our European partner countries already have,...then I'm very hopeful that we can also generally afford to do what was possible last summer, too," Merkel said.She cited the sharp drop in Covid-19 cases in Portugal in recent months after the country imposed a drastic lockdown.Portugal had one of the highest infection rates worldwide in January, but by Friday the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases stood at 3.3 per 100,000 inhabitants - about a quarter of the rate in the United States.Merkel said that Germany also appears to have broken its most recent outbreak.“Step by step, more will be possible in Germany, too, wherever the incidence drops, and that will hopefully be the case for all of Europe,” she said.Merkel spoke to reporters in Berlin, from where she took part remotely in a two-day EU summit that discussed, among other issues, the effort to develop a “green certificate” that would facilitate travel across the region this summer. Even if case numbers drop, some countries will likely impose restrictions - such as mandatory testing and quarantine - for travelers who can't prove they've been vaccinated or recovered from infection.EU leaders discussed the technical requirements for such a certificate, which would record a person's vaccine status, and outstanding questions about how to treat people who received vaccines that weren't approved for use in the bloc.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Saturday that the certificate was on track to be launched in June.So far, about 30% of adults in the EU have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-hopeful-on-europe-summer-travel-even-without-covid-19-vaccination-101620494285803.html
08-05-2021||World||Archaeologists discover remains of 9 Neanderthals near Rome||Italian archaeologists have uncovered the fossilized remains of nine Neanderthals in a cave near Rome, shedding new light on how the Italian peninsula was populated and under what environmental conditions.The Italian Culture Ministry announced the discovery Saturday, saying it confirmed that the Guattari Cave in San Felice Circeo was “one of the most significant places in the world for the history of Neanderthals.” A Neanderthal skull was discovered in the cave in 1939.The fossilized bones include skulls, skull fragments, two teeth and other bone fragments. The oldest remains date from between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago, while the other eight Neanderthals are believed to date from 50,000-68,000 years ago, the Culture Ministry said in a statement.The excavations, begun in 2019, involved a part of the cave that hadn’t yet been explored, including a lake first noted by the anthropologist Alberto Carlo Blanc, who is credited with the 1939 Neanderthal skull discovery.Culture Minister Dario Franceschini called the finding “an extraordinary discovery that will be the talk of the world.”Anthropologist Mauro Rubini said the large number of remains suggest a significant population of Neanderthals, “the first human society of which we can speak.”Archaeologists said the cave had perfectly preserved the environment of 50,000 years ago. They noted that fossilized animal remains found in the cave - elephant, rhinoceros and giant deer, among others - shed light on the flora and fauna of the area and its climactic history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/archaeologists-discover-remains-of-9-neanderthals-near-rome-101620494075379.html
08-05-2021||World||EU invites 'concrete' US plan on lifting patents for Covid-19 vaccines||Europe on Saturday passed the ball back to Washington in a debate over Covid vaccine patents, pushing the US for a concrete proposal and a commitment to export much-needed jabs.Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking after a summit of EU and Indian leaders, said the EU had exported much of its own production and that America should follow suit."Now that a further part of the American population has been vaccinated, I hope that we can come to a free exchange of components and an opening of the market for vaccines," she said.European Council chief Charles Michel said the bloc was ready to discuss a US offer to suspend patent protection on vaccines -- once the details are clear."We are ready to engage on this topic, as soon as a concrete proposal would be put on the table," Michel said at an EU summit in Portugal that discussed that subject, among others.He added that the EU had doubts about the idea being a "magic bullet" in the short term and encouraged "all the partners to facilitate the export of doses."France's scepticism was plain, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring "patents are not the priority".A debate on the issue could be "a very good idea," Macron suggested, but he added: "I call very clearly on the United States to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production."The key to producing vaccines more quickly for poor countries and developing countries is to produce more, to lift export bans."Italy's prime minister, Mario Draghi, echoed that."Before getting to the liberalisation of vaccines, other simpler things should be done, such as removing the export block that today the US firstly and the UK continue to maintain," he said."This, I would say, is the first thing to do," he said. "The fact of liberalising the patents, even temporarily, does not guarantee the production of the vaccine."While at the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a contract with drugs giant Pfizer/BioNTech for up to 1.8 billion doses of their patented vaccine had been concluded. Part of that supply is for EU exports to countries in need.Influential voices support the push to waive patents, not least that of Pope Francis, who criticised putting "the laws of the market or intellectual property above the laws of love and the health of humanity".The World Health Organization, India and South Africa have all called for patents to be temporarily suspended.- 'Global cooperation' needed -The EU leaders' comments came on the second day of an summit that featured a bilateral meeting between the EU and India, where authorities on Saturday said the pandemic killed 4,000 people in a single day.In a joint statement, both sides said "global cooperation" was needed to fight the pandemic and they "supported universal, safe, equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments"."The vaccination process is not a race amongst countries but a race against time," they said, underlining the EU's contributions to the WHO-backed Covax facility and India's role producing many of the vaccine doses distributed around the world.EU officials briefing journalists in Brussels on the issue of waiving patents said the hoarding of crucial ingredients needed for vaccines was a larger obstacle than patent protection.The United States is not in a position to export Covid vaccine doses to countries in need because contracts it signed with vaccine-makers prevent their use outside of America, and the Defense Production Act restricts exports until Americans are vaccinated first.That contrasts with the EU, which has sent more than 200 million doses abroad -- as many as it kept for itself -- prompting von der Leyen to describe the bloc as "the pharmacy of the world".EU officials are worried that Washington's gambit to get around its own blockage by invoking a suspension of patents will end up painting Brussels as a villain if it does not follow suit.An EU official briefing journalists on the complexities on the issue said on Friday that lifting patents, by itself, "will not fix things".Technology transfer and training a vaccine-making workforce were also necessary, the official said.Even if all those elements were in place, it would still take up to a year for a factory to start producing copycat vaccines.bur-rmb/dc/wdbPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-invites-concrete-us-plan-on-lifting-patents-for-covid-19-vaccines-101620492439617.html
08-05-2021||World||EU tells Biden to export Covid-19 vaccines now and worry about patent later||European Union leaders urged U.S. President Joe Biden to lift restrictions on exports of Covid-19 vaccines to address the desperate needs of developing countries before embarking on complex discussions about whether patent waivers might also boost supply in the longer term.Gathering in Porto, Portugal on Friday and Saturday shortly after the U.S. suggested suspending intellectual property rights to boost the supply of Covid shots, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi appealed in unison to the U.S. president to follow the EU example and start shipping significant numbers of vaccines. They argued that any patent waiver will only increase supply in the long term and the world needs a faster solution.“I hope that now that large parts of the American society have been vaccinated we will come to a free exchange of components and opening of the market for vaccines,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin after dialing in remotely to the summit talks. “Europe has always exported a big part of its production to the world and that should now become the regular case.”Vaccine manufacturers in the EU have exported about half of the 400 million shots they’ve produced whereas the U.S. has gobbled up nearly all of the doses produced on its soil. According to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, the U.S. has now fully vaccinated a third of its population while in India, where the virus is raging out of control, only 2.5% of the population is fully immunized.“We should not lose sight of the main urgencies for now, which is ramping up vaccine production as quickly as possible and ensuring they are fairly and evenly distributed,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters following the talks.The U.S. has sent 4.2 million AstraZeneca shots -- which aren’t authorized for use in the U.S. -- to Mexico and Canada and says it plans to ship another 60 million of those doses by the end of June. The doses are undergoing a safety review. Pfizer Inc. has also begun fulfilling non-U.S. orders from its U.S. production, but hasn’t said how many doses it has shipped or which countries have received them.“The European Union is the only continental, democratic region of this world that is exporting on a large scale,” von der Leyen said.French President Emmanuel Macron reprimanded the U.S. and the U.K. on Friday for blocking the export of shots and the raw materials needed to make them.“Today the Anglo-Saxons are blocking many of these ingredients and these vaccines,” Macron said. “Today 100% of the vaccines produced in the U.S. go to the American market.”Echoing similar comments from Berlin on Thursday, he said sharing intellectual property isn’t the immediate issue. “You can give IP to labs who don’t know how to produce it, and they won’t produce it tomorrow,” Macron said.No Patent ProblemsEU officials are skeptical that the U.S. proposal can meaningfully address the vaccine shortage, arguing that there has been no example so far of intellectual-property protections limiting supply. WTO negotiations could take many months or longer, the officials said.Instead, the priority should be scaling up manufacturing capacity by freeing up supply chains, exports of key inputs and ingredients, the EU officials said. Crucially, they should work to connect companies with the patents and know-how to produce the vaccine with any spare manufacturing capacity around the world.Nevertheless, Biden’s move has proved popular within his Democratic Party and could ultimately serve as leverage over pharmaceutical companies.Jeff Zients, the president’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Friday that supporting a waiver is “the right thing to do” but that the waiver alone won’t give the world enough vaccine.“That’s why we will continue to ramp up our efforts -- working with the private sector and all possible partners -- to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution around the world and increase, as you point out, the important supplies, the raw materials, the equipment needed to make the vaccines,” Zients said in Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-tells-biden-to-export-covid-19-vaccines-now-and-worry-about-patent-later-101620487772404.html
08-05-2021||World||Bomb targeting Afghan school in Kabul kills at least 30, injures dozens||A bomb exploded near a girl's school in a majority Shiite district of west Kabul on Saturday, killing at least 30 people, many them young pupils between 11 and 15 years old, Afghan government spokesmen said. The Taliban condemned the attack apparently aimed at civilians, and denied any responsibility.The explosion is being investigated, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian who added the death toll could rise further.Ambulances were rushing to evacuate wounded from the scene of the blast near Syed Al-Shahda school, in the Shiite majority neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said.Residents in the area said the explosion was deafening. One, Naser Rahimi, told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, although there was no official confirmation of multiple blasts. Rahimi also said he believed that the sheer power of the explosion meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.While no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, previous brutal attacks in the same neighborhood have been claimed by the Afghan Islamic State affiliate.The radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.In Dasht-e-Barchi, angry crowds attacked the ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.Images circulating on social media purportedly showed bloodied school backpacks and books strewn across the street in front if the school, and smoke rising above the neighborhood.At one nearby hospital, Associated Press journalists saw at least 20 dead bodies lined up in hallways and rooms, with dozens of wounded people and families of victims pressing through the facility.Outside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.Both Arian and Nazari said that at least 50 people were also wounded, and that the casualty toll could rise. The attack occurred just as the fasting day came to an end.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime. Mujahid also accused Afghanistan's intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.The Taliban and the Afghan government have traded accusations over a series of targeted killings of civil society workers, journalists and Afghan professionals. While IS has taken responsibility for some of those killings, many have gone unclaimed.IS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.Even as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.Earlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.The attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.The top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some “bad possible outcomes” against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-kills-at-least-25-people-near-school-in-afghan-capital-101620483914410.html

However, he emphasised it was also a 'very risky period' as we see during this period a kind of shopping frenzy."We are today in the midst of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic," he said adding the public alone could make the battle against the virus successful by strictly following Covid-19 SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-imposes-10-day-countrywide-lockdown-from-may-8-to-tackle-covid19-101620482424325.html

What does it mean?||Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, announced the reopening of borders for tourists in March to revive its economy which is heavily reliant on the tourism industry. The archipelago kicked off an aggressive vaccination drive to inoculate its population of nearly 100,000 and soon became the world’s most vaccinated country.Seychelles began vaccinating its population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) using a donation of China's Sinopharm vaccines from the United Arab Emirates. Later, the island nation used the Covishield vaccines, a version of AstraZeneca’s shot manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).As per the latest data, more than 60 per cent of Seychelles’ population has been fully vaccinated and around 70 per cent has been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The percentage of the fully vaccinated population is more than other vaccine giants like Israel and the United Kingdom.In spite of these impressive vaccination figures, Seychelles this week reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases per capita, worse than a country like India which has not even 3 per cent of its population fully vaccinated. According to Our World in Data, the latest rolling 7-day average for daily new Covid-19 cases per capita in Seychelles is more than twice India’s.Seychelles has reported nearly 7,000 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic but it’s a big deal for a country with a population of less than 100,000. Earlier this week, the archipelago announced new measures, including shutting down schools and cancelling sporting activities, for two weeks to curb the infection. Peggy Vidot, Seychelles’ health minister, told a press conference that the Covid-19 situation in the country is critical right now despite all the “exceptional efforts”.Experts have been watching the situation in Seychelles closely for what it says about the effectiveness of vaccines. According to a Washington Post report, the surge in new cases may confirm that the Covid-19 vaccines being used in the country “have comparatively low effectiveness.” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Post that the situation in Seychelles is making a critical case to “consider the effectiveness of some vaccines and what range we have to reach to meet herd immunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-most-vaccinated-country-is-witnessing-covid-19-surge-worse-than-india-101620481772947.html
08-05-2021||World||India's role as a global player will expand: PM Modi, Portuguese PM||India's role as a major regional and global player is set to expand over the coming years and its journey with the European Union in search of new routes of political, economic and technological cooperation will continue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Costa said on Saturday.In a joint op-ed piece in Politico, they said the India-EU leaders' meeting is an opportunity to expand cooperation in new areas of decisive importance for the development of contemporary societies and economies."India's role as a major regional and global player is set to continue to expand over the coming years, and a strengthened partnership would offer Europe an opportunity to diversify relations in a strategic region of the world," Modi and Costa said.In the virtual India-EU leaders' meeting on Saturday, the two sides are expected to announce the resumption of negotiations for a free trade agreement after a gap of eight years, besides resolving to further broadbase their ties."The journey together between the EU and India will be continued and advanced as of tomorrow in search of new routes of political, economic and technological cooperation, with enormous potential for mutual benefits," the two prime ministers said.Modi and Costa said the India-EU meeting will provide new impetus to the partnership that will have a positive effect on international trade and investment."The meeting is a chance to expand cooperation between the EU and India in new areas of decisive importance for the development of contemporary societies and economies: the digital transition, connectivity, mobility, health, the energy transition and climate action," they said.The two leaders mentioned that the EU is India's biggest trading partner and the second-largest destination for Indian exports, adding the two-way trade has increased 72 percent in the last decade."It is the right time to resume negotiations toward an ambitious and balanced trade agreement capable of acting as a key driver for sustainable growth and jobs creation, both for India and Europe," they said."Apart from everything else, an EU-India agreement would send a powerful signal to the world in support of the benefits of international trade cooperation," they added.The two prime ministers noted that a similar rationale applies to investment."The negotiation of an EU-wide investment protection framework would provide greater stability and certainty to companies from India and EU to expand their presence in each other's markets," they added.Modi and Costa said India-EU relations have always been marked by mutual support and solidarity which was evident during the coronavirus pandemic when both have supported each other and the rest of the world."India extended medical supplies to Europe earlier and now the EU has extended assistance to India as it experiences a second wave of COVID-19," they said.The two prime ministers also said that Portugal and India have always played a unique role in bringing the two continents together, both in the distant and recent past.Modi and Costa also said that Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore travelled extensively in Europe in different periods of his life."The great poet was a staunch believer in the principles of mutual understanding between peoples and in India's mission to bring together the East and the West," they said."He wrote frequently about the meeting of Europe and India, to which he attributed deep cultural, political and even personal significance:“I have felt the meeting of the East and the West in my own individual life,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-role-as-a-global-player-will-expand-pm-modi-portuguese-pm-101620479273221.html
08-05-2021||World||EU agrees potential 1.8 billion-dose purchase of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union cemented its support for Pfizer-BioNTech and its novel COVID-19 vaccine technology Saturday by agreeing to a massive contract extension for a potential 1.8 billion doses through 2023.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that her office “has just approved a contract for a guaranteed 900 million doses" with the same amount of doses as a future option.The new contract, which has the unanimous backing of the EU member states, will entail not only the production of the vaccines, but also making sure that all the essential components should be sourced from the EU.The European Commission currently has a portfolio of 2.6 billion doses from half a dozen companies. “Other contracts and other vaccine technologies will follow,” von der Leyen said in a Twitter message.Pfizer-BioNTech had an initial contract of 600 million doses with the EU.Saturday’s announcement also underscores the confidence the EU has shown in the technology used for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is different from that behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The active ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is messenger RNA, or mRNA, which contains the instructions for human cells to construct a harmless piece of the coronavirus called the spike protein. The human immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign, allowing it to mount a response against the virus upon infection.The announcement of the huge contract extension comes as the European Union is looking for ways to meet the challenges of necessary booster shots, possible new variants and a drive to vaccinate children and teenagers.America’s Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech have already said that they would provide the EU with an extra 50 million doses in the 2nd quarter of this year, making up for faltering deliveries of AstraZeneca.In contrast to the oft-criticized Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, von der Leyen has said that Pfizer-BioNTech is a reliable partner that delivers on its commitments.Two weeks ago, the EU launched legal proceedings against AstraZeneca for failing to respect the terms of its contract with the 27-nation bloc.The AstraZeneca vaccine had been central to Europe’s immunization campaign, and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries. But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and they have held the company responsible for partly delaying their vaccine rollout.So far, von der Leyen said, the EU has made some 200 million doses available to its 450 million citizens while almost as many have been exported from the bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agrees-potential-1-8-billion-dose-purchase-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101620473218260.html
08-05-2021||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine nod ‘milestone’: WHO China chief||The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) decision to validate the first Chinese Covid-19 vaccine represents a “milestone”, the UN agency’s China chief has said, adding that it could spur 15 more Covid jabs in development here to pursue the same path.The WHO on Friday gave the green light to China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally.It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get the UN health agency’s backing though China has already vaccinated millions of people at home, since last year, and in dozens of other countries with it.It was also the first time the WHO had given emergency use approval to a Chinese vaccine to be used globally for any infectious disease.In a statement issued on Saturday, Gauden Galea, WHO’s representative to China called it a “milestone achievement”. “One vaccine has received EUL (emergency use listing) but we know that there are over 15 additional Covid-19 vaccines in advanced development in China. Today’s milestone achievement should spur other manufacturers to pursue this route and add to the global vaccine arsenal,” Galea said.“The successful EUL application is built on years of training and research by Chinese scientists, and decades of investment, coordinated efforts, and reform on the part of the government, national regulators, and the manufacturers themselves,” Galea said.Calling it a “highly anticipated WHO EUL listing of the vaccine”, Galea said it shows both at home and abroad that the vaccines are of assured quality, safe for use, and meets WHO’s requirements for efficacy.A WHO EUL is a pointer to an individual country’s drug regulator that a product is safe as well as effective.It also allows it to be included in Covax, a global programme to provide vaccines to be channelised for poor countries.“This (Sinopharm listing) expands the list of Covid-19 vaccines that Covax can buy and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval, and to import and administer a vaccine,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing on Friday.Until now, the WHO had only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna to be used during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Galea pointed out the importance of and the need for Covid-19 vaccines reaching poorer countries.“Around the world, more than a billion vaccine doses have been administered. Among those, 100 million were administered in April - but only 1% (1 million doses) went to low-income countries. The rest - 99 million doses - went to high- and middle-income countries,” he wrote.In May, 2020, President Xi Jinping had pledged to make Chinese vaccines a global good.“Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries,” Xi had said at the opening of the 73rd session of the World Health Assembly via video link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-nod-milestone-who-china-chief-101620474188085.html

Debate around the issue erupted anew on Wednesday when US President Joe Biden supported the idea, provided it was done through the World Trade Organization (WTO).The time taken to get a WTO agreement and to build expanded vaccine-making capacity would mean that such a waiver would not provide a quick fix, sceptics say."On intellectual property -- we don't think that in the short term that it is a magic bullet, but we are ready to engage on this topic as soon as a concrete proposal would be put on the table," Michel said.Officials said that during Friday's summit talks, Germany - home to BionTech which holds a patent on the highly effective mRNA vaccine together with Pfizer - argued strongly against the idea of waiving patent rights.Portugal, Estonia, Belgium and Ireland were also sceptical but Greece backed the waiver idea, as did Italy, which was in favour of time-limited and geographically targeted measures.EU officials say Europe is one of the biggest exporters of coronavirus vaccines in the world, with some 200 million doses shipped out to 90 countries -- the same number of shots that Europe has distributed among its own citizens.French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking to reporters before Saturday's talks, said that with Covid-19 vaccines the world could try to emulate what was done years ago with medicines against HIV, when such medicines became too expensive for poor nations."We need to start a debate today about doing exactly as we did at the time of HIV, where the intellectual property was a source of blockage, it should be possible to lift it, but in a limited way," Macron said.He stressed that any action should not financially punish the companies that came up with the vaccine technology. The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, called on Friday on the United States and other major vaccine producers to export what they make. Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference discussions on the waiver would not produce a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the short- to medium-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sceptical-on-waiving-patent-rights-to-covid-19-vaccines-but-ready-to-discuss-proposal-101620470048250.html

China launched a Long March-5B rocket on April 29 carrying the first module of its new space station into Earth's orbit. While multi-stage rockets typically fall back before getting into Earth’s orbit, this one went into orbit and has to come back into the atmosphere.The rocket’s 18-tonne main segment is now in a free-fall but Beijing has downplayed fears of damage. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday told reporters that the upper stage of this rocket has been deactivated, insisting that most of its parts will burn up upon re-entry and the probability of causing harm on the ground is extremely low.The argument that the debris will just splash down into the ocean, given that the planet is 70 per cent water, was also put forward. Florent Delefie, an astronomer at the Paris-PSL Observatory, told news agency AFP that there will be big pieces left over due to the size of the rocket. "The chances of debris landing on an inhabited zone are tiny, probably one in a million," he said.However, the latest prediction by the US military, which is tracking the rocket segment, is not encouraging, according to CNN. The US military has predicted that the debris will fall in Turkmenistan in Central Asia around 7pm Eastern Time on Saturday (4.30am IST on Sunday), per CNN.Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told AFP that there is a real chance of damage to whatever it hits, suggesting an outside chance of a casualty. This is not the first time that a Chinese rocket has caused concerns for inhabitants on Earth. In 2020, debris from another Long March rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, a West African country, causing structural damage. But the crash didn’t result in any injuries or deaths."Having a ton of metal shards flying into the Earth at hundreds of kilometres per hour is not good practice, and China should redesign the Long-March 5B missions to avoid this," McDowell added.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-predicts-time-place-of-chinese-rocket-debris-crash-report-101620470619139.html
08-05-2021||World||Pope Francis backs waivers on intellectual property rights for vaccines||Pope Francis on Saturday supported waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, backing a proposal by US President Joe Biden that has been rebuffed by some European nations, including Germany.In a speech to a global fundraising concert to promote fair access to vaccines, the pope said the world was infected with the "virus of individualism"."A variant of this virus is closed nationalism, which prevents, for example, an internationalism of vaccines," he said in the pre-recorded video message."Another variant is when we put the laws of the market or of intellectual market or intellectual property over the laws of love and the health of humanity," he added, recalling the heavy death toll the coronavirus had inflicted on the world.His comments came in the middle of a debate over whether pharmaceutical companies should waive patent protection for Covid-19 vaccines.Biden backed such a move on Wednesday, heeding calls from India, South Africa and more than 100 other countries.However, many European countries, led by Germany and France, distanced themselves on Friday from the suggestion, arguing that key to ending the Covid-19 pandemic was making and sharing vaccines more quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-backs-waivers-on-intellectual-property-rights-for-vaccines-101620468377187.html

The court had acted on a petition from Sharif, who pleaded that as a cancer survivor he now needed treatment outside of Pakistan.The court order drew criticism from Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government, which said it would explore legal options to stop Sharif from leaving. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government had not received any application from Sharif or his party asking that he be taken off the black list.Sharif faces corruption charges in three separate court cases. He leads his brother’s Pakistan’s Muslim League party after Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was disqualified from office.The ex-premier and elder Sharif, convicted of corruption, lives in exile in London. He was released from prison in 2019 on bail to seek medical treatment abroad but never returned home.Shahbaz Sharif was released on bail last month on a court order, about seven months after he was arrested by an anti-graft body over alleged involvement in money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-leader-shahbaz-sharif-prevented-from-leaving-country-101620464543878.html

The company transports 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products through 5,500 miles (8,850 km) of pipelines.Colonial Pipeline says it transports 45% of East Coast fuel supply.The company learned of the attack on Friday and took systems offline to contain the threat, it said in the statement. That action has temporarily halted operations and affected some of its IT systems, it said.The company has engaged a third-party cybersecurity firm to launch an investigation, and Colonial has contacted law enforcement and other federal agencies, it said.Colonial did not give further details or say for how long its pipelines would be shut.Reuters reported earlier on Friday that Colonial had shut its main gasoline and distillate lines.During the trading session on Friday, Gulf Coast cash prices for gasoline and diesel edged lower.Both gasoline and diesel futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose more than crude prices during the day. Gasoline futures gained 0.6% to settle at $2.1269 a gallon, while diesel futures rose 1.1% to settle at $2.0106 a gallon.Longer-term price effects will depend on the amount of time that the lines are shut. If barrels are not able to make it onto the lines, Gulf Coast prices could weaken further, while prices in New York Harbor could rise, one market participant said.Colonial significantly shut down its gasoline and distillate lines during Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf Coast in 2017.During that time, spot Gulf Coast gasoline prices rose to a five-year high, while diesel prices rose to around a four-year high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-pipeline-operator-shuts-major-fuel-line-after-cyber-attack-101620463453990.html

The most recent example is Covid-19, which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Health experts and advocates have directly connected terms like the "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" to the recent increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans," the SAJA said.The association encouraged journalists to exercise care in their ongoing coverage of the coronavirus surge in India and said it was available to foster fair and accurate coverage of the South Asian community."SAJA recommends applying the same guidance to any current or future variants of the coronavirus," it said.B.1.617, known as the 'double mutant' -- this name comes from two notable mutations found in other variants that appeared together for the first time in this new strain and first detected in western parts of India, the letter stated.At present, B.1.617 and B.1 are the major strains identified from the samples of south India from the positives of the April month data, which is very infectious and is also spreading in the younger age groups apart from the adults.With a total of 4,14,188 new Covid-19 cases being recorded in the last 24 hours, India again reported its highest single-day spike on the second consecutive day. With this, the cumulative count of cases in the country reached 2,14,91,598, informed the Union Health Ministry.The country registered 3,915 new Covid-related deaths which took the total death toll in the country further up to 2,34,083.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saja-advises-news-firms-against-using-india-variant-term-for-new-covid-strain-101620442173880.html

Palestinian sources said Shalabi is a dual US national.On Wednesday, Israeli troops killed a 16-year-old Palestinian when they opened fire on protesters throwing petrol bombs, also in the West Bank.And clashes have broken out between police and demonstrators in the east Jerusalem Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood -- fuelled by a years-long land dispute between Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlers.AFP correspondents said around 100 protesters again rallied Friday night in the neighbourhood, with officers using stun grenades and water cannon to disperse them.The incidents in Sheikh Jarrah and around Damascus Gate -- a key entry point to the Old City -- left many wounded, the Red Crescent said, adding to the toll of around 22 wounded in confrontations earlier in the week.Israeli police also said they made 26 arrests between Wednesday and Thursday.Meanwhile in Jordan -- home to a large Palestinian population -- hundreds rallied Friday, chanting "we will die for Sheikh Jarrah".The nation administered the West Bank, including mostly Arab east Jerusalem, until the 1967 Six-Day War and remains the custodian of Muslim holy sites in the city.Earlier this year, a district court ruled four Palestinian homes in Sheikh Jarrah legally belonged to Jewish families.The Jewish plaintiffs claimed their families lost the land during the war that accompanied Israel's creation in 1948, a conflict that also saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced.The Sheikh Jarrah families have provided evidence that their homes were acquired from Jordanian authorities, who controlled east Jerusalem from 1948 to 1967.Israel's Supreme Court is to hold a new hearing in the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-160-injured-in-clash-between-israeli-police-palestinians-at-jerusalem-s-al-aqsa-mosque-101620440630170.html

Meanwhile, ICU bed occupancy has fallen to 78.3 percent in the state from over 91 percent on April 1.Sao Paulo was in the red phase from March 6 to 23, moving to the transition phase and gradually opening up activities as according to hospital availability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sao-paulo-extends-covid-restriction-phase-but-eases-commercial-activity-101620440096801.html

Kami Rita and 11 other Sherpa guides reached the summit at about 6pm, tourism department official Mira Acharya said. They are the first climbers to reach the summit this year and were fixing the ropes on the icy route so that hundreds of other climbers can scale the peak later this month.Everest was closed to climbing last year on its southern side, which is in Nepal, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Climbing permits were issued this year to 408 foreign climbers.Rita, 51, first scaled Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since then. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success of the hundreds of climbers who head to Nepal each year seeking to stand on top of the 8,848.86m mountain.In addition to the 25 times he’s reached the top of Everest, Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse.He was at Everest’s base camp in 2015 when an avalanche swept through, killing 19 people. After that tragedy, he had come under intense family pressure to quit mountaineering.Forty-three teams have been permitted to scale Everest during this year’s spring climbing season. Each May, there are usually only a few windows of good weather at the summit during which climbers can attempt to scale the peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-kami-rita-scales-everest-for-record-25th-time-101620436534090.html

Alcohol will be banned at outdoor sporting events.When asked if the opening could cause a spike in infections in the city, Sheinbaum said a number of factors could prevent that happening, including rising vaccination rates, discipline of citizens, warmer weather and a large number of previously infected citizens who could help generate herd immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-city-to-allow-open-air-events-amid-fall-in-covid-19-cases-101620432901368.html
08-05-2021||World||European Commission calls on United States and others to export their vaccines||The European Commission called on Friday on the United States and other major Covid-19 vaccine producers to export what they make as the European Union does, rather than talk about waiving intellectual property rights to the shots.Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders that discussions on the waiver would not produce a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the short- to medium-term."We should be open to lead this discussion. But when we lead this discussion, there needs to be a 360 degree view on it because we need vaccines now for the whole world," she said."The European Union is the only continental or democratic region of this world that is exporting at large scale," von der Leyen said.She said about 50% of European-produced coronavirus vaccine is exported to almost 90 countries, including those in the World Health Organization-backed COVAX program."And we invite all those who engage in the debate of a waiver for IP rights also to join us to commit to be willing to export a large share of what is being produced in that region," she said.Only higher production, removing exports barriers and the sharing of already-ordered vaccines could immediately help fight the pandemic quickly, she said."So what is necessary in the short term and the medium term: First of all vaccine sharing. Secondly export of vaccines that are being produced. And the third is investment in the increasing of the capacity to manufacture vaccines."Von der Leyen said the European Union had started its vaccine sharing mechanism, citing delivery of 615,000 doses to the Western Balkans as an example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-commission-calls-on-united-states-and-others-to-export-their-vaccines-101620432125383.html
08-05-2021||World||Britain free of coronavirus by August, says outgoing vaccine task force chief||The new coronavirus will no longer be circulating in Britain by August, the government's departing vaccine taskforce chief Clive Dix told the Daily Telegraph on Friday."Sometime in August, we will have no circulating virus in the UK", Dix said, adding that he believed the vaccine booster programme could be pushed back to early 2022.The government is looking at which Covid-19 vaccines would offer the best booster shot for vulnerable people later this year.Dix told the Telegraph https://bit.ly/2RAIAhM that he expects everybody in the UK to have been vaccinated at least once by the end of July, by which time "we'll have probably protected the population from all the variants that are known."The UK has administered over 51 million vaccines and has been the second quickest country to give a first dose to at least half its adult population.British officials said people under 40 should be offered an alternative to Oxford/AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine where possible due to a small risk of blood clots.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)said the advice reflected low levels of coronavirus infection in Britain and the availability of other vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna.Dix, who was appointed as interim leader of the task force in December, stepped down from his role last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-free-of-coronavirus-by-august-says-outgoing-vaccine-task-force-chief-101620432297761.html

This year authorities have eased rules to lure back foreign adventurers and have issued climbing permits to more than 400 people, a new record. But the warmer weather that ushers in safer conditions for scaling Nepal’s snow-capped peaks has coincided with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections, with active cases in the country rising six-fold in the last two weeks.Norwegian climber Erlend Ness spent two nights sleeping in his tent at base camp last month, unsure of what was making him ill. “I was evacuated to Kathmandu and was tested. My result was positive for Covid,” he told AFP. “I think I’m not the only one...” he said. Fellow climber Gina Marie Han-Lee decided to abandon her expedition last week over fears the disease was spreading around base camp, she said on Facebook on April 29. Officials at a clinic near the camp say more than 30 people have been flown off the camp in recent weeks. But the government has denied that any Covid-19 case was confirmed on Everest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-scales-mt-everest-at-least-30-evacuated-in-recent-weeks-101620422328757.html
08-05-2021||World||US President Joe Biden says he is confident of meeting Russia's Putin soon||US President Joe Biden said on Friday he expected to be able to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon and the White House said ongoing differences between the United States and Russia would not need to be resolved in advance of a summit.Biden told reporters at the White House he wanted to meet Putin despite Russia's build-up of military forces near Ukraine."It does not impact my desire to have a one-on-one meeting and you'll notice he had more troops before. He's withdrawn troops," he said.Asked about meeting Putin in June, he said: "I'm confident we'll be able to do it. We don't have any specific time or place. That's being worked on."The United States has said it supports Ukraine amid what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week called Moscow's "reckless" troop build-up.Biden and his advisers would like to add a summit with Putin in a third country while the US president is in Europe in mid-June for a Group of Seven meeting in Britain and talks with NATO allies in Brussels.But negotiations with the Russians on staging the summit are continuing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters."We're working through the question of some logistics - place, location, time, agenda, all the specifics - that was always going to happen at a staff level. It's really up to them what they want to achieve," she said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cited by Russian news agency TASS as saying Russia was studying the possibility of a Putin-Biden meeting."We continue to analyze the situation," TASS quoted Peskov as saying when asked whether the Russian side has officially agreed to the proposed summit.The United States has a number of grievances with Russia, including its treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. But Psaki said these grievances do not need to be resolved in advance of a Biden-Putin summit."Obviously, human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, values are all issues the president, Secretary (of State Antony) Blinken, National Security Adviser (Jake) Sullivan raised with their counterparts. But the invitation to have a discussion and have a meeting was not offered with the prerequisite that every issue is resolved in advance. We expect we will still continue to have disagreements," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-says-he-is-confident-of-meeting-russia-s-putin-soon-101620421325515.html
08-05-2021||World||China's rocket out of control but risk of damage low, say experts||China's rogue rocket is in an uncontrolled free-fall towards Earth and no one knows where or exactly when it will burn through Earth's atmosphere, but the risk of debris hitting an inhabited area remains very small, experts told AFP Friday.What happened?On April 29, China launched the first module of its "Heavenly Palace" space station, a milestone in Beijing's ambitious plan to establish a permanent human presence in space.The module was propelled by a powerful Long March 5B rocket, whose first stage is currently descending Earthward.If Chinese ground engineers have no control over the booster stage's trajectory, it is not due to a technical failure or some unexplained glitch. The rocket was designed that way.From a low Earth orbit, bodies are drawn gradually by gravity towards the surface of the planet.Such objects are usually consumed by heat as friction from an increasingly dense atmosphere increases on approach.But the Long March rocket is so massive -- up to 18 tonnes -- that is it unlikely to burn up entirely."Given the size of the object, there will necessarily be big pieces left over," said Florent Delefie, an astronomer at the Paris-PSL Observatory."If the rocket is composed of materials that don't separate on re-entry, it's even riskier," he added. "That would appear to be the case for the Long March 5B."This was no doubt clear to Chinese flight engineers."The Chinese should have anticipated a controlled re-entry with a retrorocket, which is what the Russian did when they removed the Mir station from Earth orbit," explained Nicolas Bobrinsky, head of engineering and innovation at the European Space Agency.Likely scenarios?Given the rocket's altitude -- 150 to 250 kilometres -- its re-entry is very difficult to anticipate.Because lower levels in the atmosphere are more prone to variations in density, "we can't really say exactly when that will happen," Bobrinsky said.As of late Friday, European time, it was forecast that re-entry would happen between 21:00 GMT Saturday and 0700 GMT Sunday. That range will continue to narrow in the coming hours."But even one hour before impact, the level of uncertainty will be high," Bobrinsky said.One thing is sure: the spent booster is orbiting on an inclination to the equator of about 41 degrees. This means that any debris will fall within 41 degrees North and 41 degrees South, which includes the tropics and a generous band on either side.Greece, Spain and north Africa are within that belt, as are most of the United States and China. France and Germany lie outside it.The most likely landing zone is water, simply because nearly three-quarters of the surface of the planet is covered by oceans."The chances of debris landing on an inhabited zone are tiny, probably one in a million," said Delefie.Even if fragments of the rocket do land on buildings, the speed of impact will be relatively slow at about 200 kilometres per hour (125 miles per hour). By comparison, a meteorite can reach speeds of 36,000 km/hr as it hurtles towards Earth.Has this happened before?In 2020, debris from another Long March rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, causing structural damages but no injuries or deaths.Since the launch of the first satellite in 1957 by the Soviet Union, tonnes of rocket stages, satellites and instruments have been sent into space.NASA estimates that there are about 34,000 objects of at least 10 centimetres (four inches) in diameter circling Earth's today.Since the beginning of the space age more than 60 years ago, some 6,000 objects have made an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, and only once has any debris struck a human being. Even then it did not result in injury, according to Stijn Lemmens, an expert at ESA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-rocket-out-of-control-but-risk-of-damage-low-say-experts-101620420935974.html
08-05-2021||World||Canada says ready to discuss IP waiver on Covid-19 vaccines||Canada is ready to discuss an intellectual property rights (IP) waiver for Covid-19 vaccines and will not block one even though it stresses the importance of protecting patents, officials said on Friday.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday threw his support behind waiving IP rights for Covid-19 vaccines. Any such waiver would have to be negotiated through the World Trade Organization (WTO)."We've been working with partners at the WTO to find a consensus-based solution and are ready to discuss proposals, in particular for Covid-19 vaccines," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters.Biden's proposal angered pharmaceutical companies. Firms working on vaccines have reported sharp revenue and profit gains during the crisis.Canadian International Trade Minister Mary Ng earlier said that Ottawa firmly believed in the importance of protecting IP."I can assure you Canada is not interfering or blocking. Canada is very much working to find a solution," said Trudeau, who did not give details of the Canadian negotiating stance.Ng said Ottawa recognized how much the pharmaceutical industry had done to innovate Covid-19 vaccines, adding that many barriers to access were unrelated to IP, such as supply-chain constraints.Canada is trying to quell a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic that is pushing some healthcare systems to breaking points, particularly in the western provinces of Alberta and Manitoba.Manitoba officials said they were postponing some non-urgent surgeries to open space for Covid-19 patients and planned to announce tougher public health restrictions as daily cases soared to a near-record high.The U.S. state of Montana will offer vaccines to around 2,000 Alberta truckers who regularly cross the border, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said.Truckers will get vaccinated at a post being set up just south of the border, using Montana's surplus Johnson & Johnson vaccines.The scheme mirrors an agreement that Saskatchewan and Manitoba reached with North Dakota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-says-ready-to-discuss-ip-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccines-101620413448052.html
08-05-2021||World||Unsure Covid-19 vaccine waiver will help, some EU leaders call for more exports||European leaders voiced increasing skepticism Friday that a US proposal to lift patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines would solve the problem of getting shots into the arms of people in poorer countries, with some instead calling for more exports of the doses already being produced.While activists and humanitarian groups have cheered the Biden administration’s decision and urged others to follow suit, European Union leaders are hammering home the message that any benefit from a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections would be long in coming. Instead, they've taken the US, in particular, to task for not sharing more vaccines with the rest of the world.“You can give the intellectual property to laboratories that do not know how to produce it. They won’t produce it tomorrow,” said French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit in Portugal, even though he has also said he would agree to waive the protections.EU officials insist rewriting rules in the World Trade Organization could take months or even a year, and say they've found few examples — if any — that intellectual property issues are what's holding up the rollout of vaccines.Supporters of a patent waiver have argued it would allow more factories around the world to produce the shots, increasing the supply, especially in poorer countries. The decision ultimately is up to the 164-member WTO, and if just one country votes against a waiver, the idea will fail.Macron said the key issues are really donations and exports — an argument also made by the pharmaceutical industry — and he said the United States should do more on that front.The US does not have an export ban on vaccines nor does it prohibit the export of ingredients for the shots. But the federal government controls hundreds of millions of doses manufactured in the country under the terms of its contracts with drug makers, and is first in line for some raw materials produced by US suppliers.The US has sent Canada and Mexico about 4 million doses from its stockpile of vaccines from AstraZeneca — which hasn't yet applied for authorization in the US — and it plans to begin exporting as many as 60 million doses in coming months. Last week, the US also redirected some raw materials used for AstraZeneca to India as part of its relief efforts for the hard-hit country.Macron boasted, however, that almost half of the doses produced on in the European Union — or about 200 million — have been allowed to be exported.“We are the most generous in the world of developed nations,” he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that the US is going to “work with international partners, with the pharmaceutical companies to up the supply, to get as much supply out to the global community as possible.”WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala echoed some of the sentiments expressed by European leaders at a virtual conference Friday, noting that lifting patent protections could help expand fair access to vaccines but might not be the most “critical issue” in expanding vaccine production.Other key steps include reducing restrictions on the export both of vaccines and the ingredients needed to make them, sharing the know-how behind the shots, training manufacturing personnel and increasing manufacturing capacity globally.Meanwhile, Germany, a research powerhouse with strong biotech and pharmaceutical sectors, spoke out against waiving the protections — and also urged more exports.“The main issue is not the question of patents. The main issue is the question of production capacity," German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, noting that producing vaccines like one developed by German firm BioNTech — and manufactured with Pfizer —is very complicated.Instead, he stressed that developed countries whose vaccination campaigns are going well should export more shots.“We’ll be exporting a lot more," he said. “I can only welcome if the United States change their policy and make vaccination doses available for other countries.”Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer and director of the Health Justice Initiative in South Africa, welcomed the Biden administration’s announcement but said it’s “eight months too late.”“We can’t basically wait for months for this waiver to be finalized,” she said. Hassan said the countries that have “overordered” vaccines are “ironically blocking the waiver and the ability of people in low income parts of the world to access the vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsure-covid-19-vaccine-waiver-will-help-some-eu-leaders-call-for-more-exports-101620412289227.html
08-05-2021||World||WHO approves China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use||The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday gave the green light to China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally.It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get the UN health agency’s backing though China has already vaccinated millions of people at home, since last year, and in dozens of other countries with it.“On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined,” the WHO said.“Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because preliminary data and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.”Until now, the WHO had only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna to be used during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“This afternoon, the WHO gave emergency use listing to Sinopharm, Beijing’s Covid-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy, and quality,” WHO DG Tedros Ghebreyesus said at a twice-weekly webinar on Covid-19.“The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, or SAGE, has also reviewed the available data, and recommends the vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, with a two-dose schedule,” he said.“This expands the list of vaccines that COVAX combined, and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval,” he was quoted as saying by the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua.The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group.“The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk,” said Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant-director general for Access to Health Products.“We urge the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX facility and contribute to the goal of more equitable vaccine distribution,” Simao was quoted as saying.The WHO emergency use listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX facility vaccine supply, also allowing countries to expedite their regulatory approval to import and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the population.The listing assesses the quality, safety, and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, and risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.The EUL, according to the WHO, assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions, the WHO said.Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told Global Times that the WHO approval will allow Chinese vaccines to reach more developing countries through international purchase or donations, and it will also be helpful for some EU members’ emergency use of Chinese vaccines.“The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings,” said the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-china-s-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101620409561848.html
