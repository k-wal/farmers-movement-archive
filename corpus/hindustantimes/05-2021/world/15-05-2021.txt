Mohammed, 23 and wearing a "Free Palestine" t-shirt, told AFP.As a cold rainstorm settled over the city toward evening, many protesters left, leaving a large group of mostly young men facing off against ranks of officers who held their ground on a stretch of boulevard.A handful of garbage bins were set on fire and rocks and other projectiles were hurled toward police, but no arrests were reported.Ban 'unacceptable'The march was banned Thursday over concerns of a repeat of fierce clashes that erupted at a similar Paris march during the last war in 2014, when protesters took aim at synagogues and other Israeli and Jewish targets."We all remember that extremely troubling protest where terrible phrases like 'death to Jews' were yelled," Mayor Anne Hidalgo told AFP on Friday, welcoming a "wise" decision to ban the march.But Walid Atallah, president of the Association of Palestinians in Ile-de-France, the region encompassing Paris, accused the government of inflaming tensions with the ban."If there were genuine risks of public disorder, of serious problems, they would have prohibited it right away," he told a press conference ahead of the march."They banned it at the last minute -- it's unacceptable," he said.Similar protests in Germany and Denmark this week have degenerated into clashes leading to several arrests.The protest had originally been called to mark the Nakba, as Palestinians call the "catastrophe" of Israel's creation in 1948, which turned hundreds of thousands into refugees.But a Paris court upheld the ban Friday, saying the "international and domestic context" justified fears of unrest "that could be as serious or even worse than in 2014".Protests around FranceInterior Minister Gerard Darmanin also called for similar bans in other cities if necessary, and officials prohibited marches in Nice, where around 150 people gathered nonetheless, and in some Paris suburbs."We don't want scenes of violence, we don't want to import a conflict onto French soil, we don't want eruptions of hate on our streets," government spokesman Gabriel Attal said Saturday in Marseille.But no incidents were reported as around 22,000 people nationwide gathered for dozens of protests and marches, including in several other cities like Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux.Critics accuse France of being too favourable towards Israel in the latest conflict, which has seen a barrage of rocket fire from Gaza met with Israeli artillery and air strikes.The ban has caused a split among French politicians, with President Emmanuel Macron's centre-right party and the right-wing opposition supporting the move, but leftists calling it an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression.Macron's office said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, offering his "condolences for the victims of the rocket fire claimed by Hamas and other terrorist groups."The statement said Macron urged a return to peace and "his concern about the civilian population in Gaza".France has the largest Muslim population in Europe, with an estimated five to six million people.It also has the largest Jewish population worldwide after Israel and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/free-palestine-tensions-in-paris-as-pro-palestinian-protesters-take-to-streets-101621102700971.html
15-05-2021||World||Myanmar frees Japanese journalist as gesture to Tokyo||An arrested Japanese reporter returned home Friday after being released by Myanmar's ruling junta in what it called a gesture of friendship to Japan.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Yuki Kitazumi was released after efforts by Japanese diplomats and others. The reporter boarded a plane at Yangon's airport and landed in Japan on Friday night.Kitazumi, a freelance journalist and former reporter for Japan’s Nikkei business news, said in brief comments at the airport that he learned of his release the night before and was told to pack his bag in 10 minutes.“As a journalist I wanted to stay in Yangon and keep reporting, but I had to come back, and that is my regret,” he said. He said he hopes to keep telling the world about what’s happening in Myanmar.The military seized power on Feb. 1, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. It has faced large, constant popular opposition, which it has tried to suppress by using force that has cost hundreds of lives and by muzzling the news media.Myanmar's army-run Myawaddy TV said Kitazumi was arrested on April 18 for “inciting” anti-military civil disobedience and riots.“Although the journalist is a lawbreaker, the case will be closed and he will be released at the request of the Special Envoy of the Japanese Government for National Reconciliation in Myanmar, in view of the close ties and future relations between Myanmar and Japan," the junta said in a statement read on TV.Japan has criticized the military government’s deadly crackdown on opposition but has taken a milder approach than the United States and some other countries that imposed sanctions against members of the junta.Kitazumi was also charged with violating visa regulations. He was the first foreign journalist to be charged under a statute which the state press has described as aiming at “fake news.”He has posted reports and views about developments in Myanmar on Facebook. Hours before his arrest, he posted a video showing Myanmar citizens gathering at a Tokyo temple to pay tribute to people killed by Myanmar security forces trying to quell protests.Kitazumi had been detained briefly by police in late February while covering pro-democracy protests in Myanmar.The announcement that he had been granted clemency came a day after a military court sentenced a Myanmar journalist, Min Nyo, to three years in prison on similar charges.Min Nyo is a correspondent for the Democratic Voice of Burma, an online and broadcast news agency which has continued to operate despite being banned by the junta.A statement issued by DVB said Min Nyo was covering a March 3 anti-junta protest in the town of Pyay, 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Yangon, when he was arrested and severely beaten by police.About 80 journalists have been arrested since the military's takeover. Roughly half are still detained and most of them are being held under charges similar to the one for which Min Nyo was convicted, as are many activists opposed to the military regime.Rights group Amnesty International said Min Nyo’s case showed the ruthlessness of the junta and the risks faced by journalists reporting on the junta’s abuses.“Min Nyo’s conviction must be quashed, and he should be released immediately -– along with all other journalists, activists and human rights defenders imprisoned and detained solely for their peaceful opposition to the military coup,” the group's deputy regional director, Emerlynne Gil, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-frees-japanese-journalist-as-gesture-to-tokyo-101621102066322.html

The annual festival lasts about a month and draws tens of thousands of people.But this year, only around a hundred hand-picked devotees were allowed to pull the chariot for just a few meters (yards), as riot police sealed off the neighbourhood to prevent any spectators from entering.The Himalayan nation is experiencing a coronavirus surge, with record numbers of new infections and deaths. Authorities imposed a lockdown across most of the country last month, and extended it in recent days by another two weeks.The agreement to drastically scale back the festival came after consultations among local politicians, officials, security forces, priests and organisers. Many devotees stayed home and celebrated with feasts and rituals with their families.Last spring, the statue was built but remained parked because of virus restrictions until September, when thousands of protesters defied a lockdown to take part in the festival. Several people were injured as police in riot gear blocked protesters as they moved the chariot, dousing them with water cannons and firing tear gar. The protesters threw stones at the police.The festival is held in the belief that it will to please gods so they can provide for a generous rainfall, a good harvest and prosperity. It’s thought to have been held for more than 1,350 years.Nepal, with a population of around 30 million, has reported 447,704 confirmed coronavirus cases and 4,856 deaths.On Friday, China canceled attempts to climb Mount Everest from its side of the world’s highest peak because of fears of importing Covid-19 cases from neighboring Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-scales-back-hindu-chariot-festival-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101621097730438.html
15-05-2021||World||Two main contenders sign up for Iran's presidential election||Two of the main contenders to become Iran's president, hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi and former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, registered on Saturday to run in next month's election.The June 18 election to succeed President Hassan Rouhani is seen as a test of the legitimacy of the country's clerical rulers who are hoping for a high turnout. Rouhani is barred by term limits from running again.But voter interest may be hit by rising discontent over an economy that has been crippled by U.S. sanctions reimposed after Washington exited a nuclear deal between Iran and major powers three years ago.Raisi is a 60-year-old mid-ranking cleric in Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim establishment. Appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as head of the judiciary in March 2019, he has emerged as one of the country's most powerful figures and a contender to succeed Khamenei.Larijani, a former nuclear negotiator and an adviser to Khamenei, is hoping to secure backing from both moderates and hardliners and bridge the gap between them."I have come as an independent to the stage to make changes in the executive management of the country and to fight poverty, corruption, humiliation and discrimination," Raisi was quoted as saying in a statement by local media before registering.“I have come to form a strong people’s government for a strong Iran” with the help of “the brave youth,” Raisi said, apparently alluding to recent comments by Khamenei who said he expected a “capable and energetic government” to come to power.The judiciary chief lost to Rouhani in the 2017 presidential election.Reformists and rights activists say they are alarmed by Raisi's background as a hardline judge, especially during the 1980s when he was one of four judges who imposed death penalties on thousands of political prisoners.Raisi said his government “will not lose one moment to lift the oppressive sanctions”.First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, a moderate ally of Rouhani, also registered to run.Registration of candidates ended on Saturday, after which entrants will be screened for their political and Islamic qualifications by the 12-member Guardian Council vetting body, which has in the past disqualified many moderates and reformers. Six of the members of the hardline body are named by Khamenei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-main-contenders-sign-up-for-iran-s-presidential-election-101621095798417.html

All AP employees and freelancers evacuated the building safely.AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt has released the following statement:We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP’s bureau and other news organizations in Gaza. They have long known the location of our bureau and knew journalists were there. We received a warning that the building would be hit.We are seeking information from the Israeli government and are engaged with the U.S. State Department to try to learn more.This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time.The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-will-know-less-about-what-is-happening-in-gaza-says-associated-press-101621088897295.html

Kenya has relied solely on Covax, a global alliance aimed at providing equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, for its immunisation program.Covax provided the African nation with over a million doses of Covidshield, a version of the AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Kenya has used up almost all the available doses and the suspension of vaccine export by India has brought the immunisation drive in the country to a grinding halt.According to Our World in Data, less than two per cent of the Kenyan population has received one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and with the June delivery under Covax already in doubt, the country is looking to an uncertain future. With having such a low percentage of the Kenyan population received Covid jab, that too with the only dose of two-dose regimen, it is still above the overall percentage of the vaccinated African population, indicating that the situation in other countries is worse.Dr Ahmed Kalebi, a pathologist and founding partner at LancetGroup Laboratories, East Africa, told CNN that the Covid catastrophe in India is a red flag for the whole world. While the third world countries, Kalebi said, struggled to contain previous Covid waves, they might witness “something worse if something is not done”. He urged wealthier nations to rethink their vaccination strategy as they are now moving swiftly to inoculate lower-risk groups, including children and adolescents.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended expanded usage of Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds after the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorisation. Kalebi said that vaccination of teenagers “makes no sense” when vulnerable groups and potential superspreaders across the world haven’t been inoculated.“These are likely the breeding grounds for new super variants. It is a global village. None of us is safe until all of us are safe,” he warned.The World Health Organization (WHO) has also criticised the vaccination strategy of rich nations, saying the world is witnessing “moral catastrophe”. During a press briefing on Friday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted that vaccine supply in lower- and lower-middle-income countries has not been enough to vaccinate even their health care workers.“I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to COVAX,” said Dr Tedros.In early March, a study suggested that different virus variants of concern appear to be converging through mutations towards a “super variant” that would make the fight against Covid-19 difficult. The researchers from the US, UK, Sweden, and South Africa noted that the emergence and rapid rise in prevalence of three independent SARS-CoV-2 "501Y lineages'' prompted renewed concerns about the “evolutionarily capacity of the virus to adapt to both rising population immunity, and public health interventions such as vaccines and social distancing.”“[W]e find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages,” the study, published as a preprint, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenyas-top-scientist-warns-of-super-variants-as-india-halts-vaccine-supply-101621085044468.html
15-05-2021||World||'Nihao Mars': China's Zhurong rover makes history, touches down on red planet||China's probe to Mars touched down on the Red Planet Saturday to deploy its Zhurong rover, state media reported, a triumph for Beijing's bold space ambitions and a history-making feat for a nation on its first-ever Martian mission.The lander carrying Zhurong completed the treacherous descent through the Martian atmosphere using a parachute to navigate the "seven minutes of terror" as it is known, aiming for a vast northern lava plain known as the Utopia Planitia.It "successfully landed in the pre-selected area", state broadcaster CCTV said in a special television programme dedicated to the mission called "Nihao Mars" ("Hello Mars").The official Xinhua news agency cited the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in confirming the touchdown.It makes China the first country to carry out an orbiting, landing, and roving operation during its first mission to Mars -- a feat unmatched by the only other two nations to reach the Red Planet so far, the United States and Russia.President Xi Jinping sent his "warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all members who have participated in the Mars exploration mission", Xinhua reported.China has now sent astronauts into space, powered probes to the Moon, and landed a rover on Mars -- the most prestigious of all prizes in the competition for dominion of space.The three-month mission - Zhurong - named after a Chinese mythical fire god, arrived a few months behind America's latest probe to Mars -- Perseverance -- as the show of technological might between the two superpowers plays out beyond the bounds of Earth.Six-wheeled, solar-powered, and weighing roughly 240 kilograms (530 pounds), the Chinese rover is on a quest to collect and analyse rock samples from Mars' surface.In a message published Saturday evening on the social network Weibo, the Zhurong greeted its "Earth friends"."I'm still inside the landing pod," a post on its official account said. "Can't wait to find out what's on Mars."The launch of China's Tianwen-1 Mars probe which carried the rover last July marked a major milestone in China's space programme.The spacecraft entered Mars' orbit in February and after a prolonged silence state media announced it had reached the "crucial touchdown stage" on Friday.The landing was set to be a nail-biter for the China National Space Administration, with state media describing the process of using a parachute to slow descent and buffer legs as "the most challenging part of the mission".It is expected to spend around three months there taking photos and harvesting geographical data.The complicated landing process is called the "seven minutes of terror" because it happens faster than radio signals can reach Earth from Mars, meaning communications are limited."The distance was too far away that the spacecraft has to do it totally by itself," said Chen Lan, an independent analyst specialising in China's space programme. "If there was something wrong, people on the Earth have no way to help."Several US, Russian, and European attempts to land rovers on Mars have failed in the past, most recently in 2016 with the crash-landing of the Schiaparelli joint Russian-European spacecraft.The latest successful arrival came in February when US space agency Nasa landed its rover Perseverance, which has since been exploring the planet.The US rover launched a small robotic helicopter on Mars which was the first-ever powered flight on another planet.China has come a long way in its race to catch up with the United States and Russia, whose astronauts and cosmonauts have decades of experience in space exploration.It successfully launched the first module of its new space station last month with hopes of having it crewed by 2022 and eventually sending humans to the Moon.Last week a segment of the Chinese Long March 5B rocket disintegrated over the Indian Ocean in an uncontrolled landing back to Earth.That drew criticism from the United States and other nations for a breach of etiquette governing the return of space debris to Earth, with officials saying the remnants had the potential to endanger life and property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nihao-mars-china-s-zhurong-rover-makes-history-touches-down-on-red-planet-101621085964213.html
15-05-2021||World||US does not have a hidden Covid-19 vaccine stockpile ready to send abroad||Why isn’t the US sharing its extra vaccine doses with the rest of the world? America led the world in buying up the messenger RNA vaccines that have proven most effective against Covid-19. It’s now starting to lead the world in not using them. Across the US, there are more than 27 million unused Moderna Inc. doses and 35 million from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s led to calls by prominent public health voices to pack America’s surplus in dry ice and ship it to places like India, where the outbreak is still raging.“You're seeing supply exceed demand here and you just know there are excess doses,’’ said Monica Gandhi, a physician and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who authored a letter with more than two dozen colleagues calling on the US to ship spare Moderna doses to India. As American vaccinations slow and doses accumulate, the US is at a health, ethical and diplomatic crossroads. China is exporting more doses than any other country, lifting its international profile and adding to its influence. Should the US continue to buy and distribute millions of mRNA vaccines a week, targeting them at people who are in no hurry to be vaccinated or who are lower-risk? Or should it pare back its orders and free up drugmakers to send more doses to other countries in need?Press HarderWhile it might seem simple to box up the spares and send them out, the reality is far more complex. There is no stockpile of tens of millions of Moderna doses in a warehouse, ready to go. Most unused US doses are scattered across tens of thousands of locations: state facilities, local pharmacies, vaccination sites and other locations. Gathering and sending them out of the country would be unmanageable, and undercut the US domestic effort.Pfizer is already sending some shots manufactured in the US overseas. And there may be millions more unused doses from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc available to send out in the coming weeks or months; the exact date is unknown. But with the Biden administration rolling back pandemic guidelines on masking, in part to get vaccine fence-sitters to roll up their sleeves, there’s little indication the US strategy of ensuring more-than-ample supply at home will change any time soon. “When you’re winning, you press harder,” Andy Slavitt, the senior adviser to the White House’s Covid Response Team, told reporters this week. The US goal continues to be vaccination of 70% of adults before July 4, he said. Vaccines of ChoiceThe two-dose mRNA vaccines have shown the highest efficacy rates of those cleared for use around the globe. They are also the most challenging to store and ship, and have been bought up primarily by wealthier countries. They’ve become the vaccines of choice for Americans, because of their availability and their perceived superiority.Pfizer’s shots have also been cleared for people ages 12 to 15, making them critical to the domestic effort to vaccinate teens. It may soon be authorized for even younger children, who are at relatively low risk from Covid, reducing what’s available for more defenseless populations abroad. “If we were truly interested in taking an ethical approach to vaccination, we would have vaccinated the most vulnerable people wherever they live, but that's not the political reality,” said Richard Besser, a pediatrician and former acting director for the CDC. “Each country is focused on protecting its own,” and that means turning to American children first, said Besser, who’s now CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.To understand how many extra shots the US actually has, it’s necessary to understand how its vaccine supply chain actually works. Moderna’s shipments are overseen by the federal government. When the company finishes making doses, it gives possession to distributor McKesson Corp., which stores them and sends them on to vaccination sites. As of April 12, Moderna had handed over 117 million doses. It’s producing 40 million to 50 million doses a month, which means that as of this week, it’s delivered about 157 million to 167 million. About 140 million of those doses have already been shipped out to vaccine locations and states, according to the CDC.If another 10 million are on order or in transit — about what ships each week — that leaves just 7 million to 17 million doses that haven't been sent around the country already to vaccine sites. The government contract with Moderna also says that the government may not use or authorize use of its vaccine order “unless such use occurs in the United States and is protected from liability under a declaration issued under the Public Readiness and Emergency.’’ Biden would have to strike a deal with Moderna or find a way around that clause to share his doses.McKesson declined to comment, and the US Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. A person familiar with the company’s efforts described the production estimates as in-line.Pfizer, the only other US manufacturer of mRNA vaccines, controls its own distribution. The company is committed to delivering 220 million doses to the US by the end of May. More than 170 million doses have already been dispatched, and the drugmaker is producing more than the US orders each week. That excess, according to a person familiar with the matter, is already being sold abroad, mostly in North and South America, including to hard-hit places like Brazil. Canada, Mexico and Uruguay have all said they’re receiving Pfizer doses. As its manufacturing capacity grows, Pfizer plans to sell even more doses overseas, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has said. Because of the way the company’s deal with the US is structured, it doesn’t need permission to do so after meeting its domestic obligations. This path, manufacturing more doses than needed in the US, is almost certainly the road to getting more mRNA vaccines abroad. Donation StopgapUnfortunately, even if unused US inoculations were sent abroad, they would likely make barely a dent in the need. The globe needs billions of vaccines, not millions, and the places that are in crisis now may burn through their outbreaks before help could arrive.“The donation piece is in many ways a stopgap,” said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention, who also signed onto the letter urging the sharing of Moderna doses. “This would be an initial supply to get emergency relief underway. It’s barely a Band-Aid, but as we understand it, it’s product that’s available and it could be deployed for good.”The next several weeks will be telling in terms of US needs — and what could be available for export. Many states have freshened their campaigns with incentives like cash lotteries for people who haven’t yet gotten shots. Colorado has requested the maximum number of doses every week, according to the state health department. Its pace of vaccinations has remained relatively steady at about 50,000 doses a day, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Other states are paring down. After peaking at almost 600,000 doses at its peak in April, Illinois’ most recent request was just 8,510, according to the state. It’s also sending unused doses to areas where local demand is higher. The Biden administration has said that over the next months it will send out approximately 60 million AstraZeneca doses that haven’t been cleared for US use. There are also tens of millions of J&J vaccines that may become available, likely as the American campaign winds down. Those are the vaccines the US doesn’t need or want. But they are likely what it will give.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-does-not-have-a-hidden-covid-19-vaccine-stockpile-ready-to-send-abroad-101621083796092.html

"The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today."The Israeli military has said during nearly a week of intense conflict that its strikes on buildings in Gaza are aimed at hitting targets used by Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the enclave.Hamas militants have fired more than 2,000 rockets at Israel during the latest violence. Palestinians medics say, at least 139 people, including 39 children, have been killed in Gaza. Israel has reported nine dead, including two children.Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus rejected the notion that Israel was seeking to silence the media. "That is totally false, the media is not the target," he told Reuters.Conricus called the building a legitimate military target, saying it contained Hamas military intelligence. He said Hamas may have calculated that by placing their "assets" inside a building with news media offices in it "they probably hoped that would keep them safe from Israeli attack".Al Jazeera also carried a report on the strike on its English-language website.It quoted journalist Safwat al-Kahlout as saying: “I have been working here for 11 years. I have been covering many events from this building, we have lived personal professional experiences. Now everything, in two seconds, just vanished.”Asked why the entire building was destroyed, Conricus said there was no way of destroying only the Hamas targets. Those, he said, "occupied several floors in the building.... it was deemed necessary to take down the whole building."The tower had a large telecommunications antenna on its roof, video footage showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-tower-housing-ap-al-jazeera-collapses-after-missile-strike-report-101621081974328.html
15-05-2021||World||Vaccines ‘almost certainly less effective’ against B1.617.2 transmission: Expert||The vaccines being administered to protect against Covid-19 are “almost certainly less effective” against preventing the transmission of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India, a leading UK scientist who advises the country’s vaccination programme said on Saturday.Professor Anthony Harnden, from the University of Oxford who is the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said it was important to approach the easing of lockdown in England with “utmost caution” as it remains unclear exactly how much more transmissible the variant detected in India is.But he reiterated that there is no evidence so far of increased severity of illness or that the particular mutation of the coronavirus evades the vaccine.“The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease but we don’t think they’re less effective against severe disease. But in combination with being less effective against mild disease, they’re almost certainly less effective against transmission,” Prof. Harnden told the BBC.“We don’t know how much more transmissible it is yet. All the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that it evades the vaccine. So, at the moment, on the basis of the evidence we are doing the right thing, coolly, calmly continuing with Monday, but keeping everything under review,” he said, in reference to the next stage in the easing of lockdown that begins in England from Monday.His comments follow UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Downing Street press conference on Friday evening, when he focussed on the “important unknowns” related to the B1.617.2 variant, which is believed to be largely behind India’s devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We believe this variant is more transmissible than the previous one – in other words it passes more easily from person to person – but we don’t know by how much,” said Johnson.“I am told that if it’s only marginally more transmissible, we can continue more or less as planned.But if the virus is significantly more transmissible, we are likely to face some hard choices. We are going to be learning a lot more in the coming days and weeks about that,” he said, in an indication that a planned June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown measures is likely to change.He also pointed to the “good news” that so far there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines being administered by the National Health Service (NHS), which includes the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine being deployed in India as Covishield, will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness and hospitalisation.“So I believe we should trust in our vaccines to protect the public whilst monitoring the situation very closely. Because the race between our vaccination programme and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter,” he said.Under the UK's action plan laid out to tackle the B1.617.2 variant of concern (VOC) first identified in India, all over-50s and the most vulnerable groups are to be offered their second Covid-19 vaccine dose earlier than scheduled.Appointments for a second dose of a vaccine will be brought forward from 12 to eight weeks for these groups.Those aged under 50 will continue to get their first dose, with their second dose at 12 weeks, as has been the deployment strategy so far.“We have implemented measures at record pace to get on top of this new variant and control the spread. Everyone has a role to play in this effort – accept the invitation to get a jab when it comes, and if you live in one of the areas where we’ve introduced surge testing, get your free PCR test. Let’s work to fight this together,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The move will be supported by targeted new activity to accelerate vaccine uptake amongst eligible cohorts in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, among the 15 most affected areas from the B1.617.2 VOC.Public health officials are being backed up by the Army in some of these hotspots to distribute coronavirus tests door-to-door as part of the drives.“This move is a belt-and-braces approach to ensure as many people as possible have the full protection a vaccine has to offer – make sure to book in your jab when contacted,” said Nadhim Zahawi, UK Vaccine Deployment Minister.The government's Scientific Group for Emergencies (SAGE) believes B.1.617.2 VOC could be up to 50 per cent more transmissible than one first recorded in the southeast England region of Kent last year, which is the UK's dominant strain.The latest data on the B1.617.2 variant, published by Public Health England (PHE) on Thursday, shows the number of cases across the UK has risen from 520 last week to 1,313 cases this week.Most cases are in the north west of England, with some in London.Britain, which has recorded 128,000 coronavirus deaths since the pandemic hit last year, has seen new infections fall sharply and daily deaths in single figures in recent days.Under a pre-set lockdown easing roadmap, most businesses are set to resume full activity from Monday.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also following similar patterns, though the Scottish government has kept the city of Glasgow and the northern area of Moray under restrictions because of rising case numbers of the B1.617.2 VOC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-almost-certainly-less-effective-against-b1-617-2-transmission-expert-101621081186602.html
15-05-2021||World||CDC’s new mask change as a surprise, creates confusion for businesses||For a nation mired in a pandemic for more than a year, the biggest step toward a return to normal came suddenly, even to President Joe Biden.After warning the country on Monday to stay vigilant amid the threat of coronavirus variants, the president found himself three days later striking a different tone, celebrating that the US had already reached a sort of finish line.Late Wednesday evening, Biden’s White House learned from Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that vaccinated Americans could safely shed the face masks that have become a staple of their wardrobes in almost all occasions.That decision -- the most momentous yet in the nation’s battle against Covid-19 -- was kept under wraps among a small circle of top White House aides that night as they began making arrangements for the president to address the watershed moment the following day.Thursday’s announcement not only turned the page on painful social restrictions brought on by the pandemic, but also eased tensions around public health directives that have sowed acrimony and division over the past year, largely because of resistance among Republicans.“Free at last,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after the CDC lifted its masking guidance.But the decision also sparked confusion, as businesses weighed whether to immediately scrap mask requirements even though they have no way of knowing whether their staff and customers are vaccinated.While it appeared abrupt, the decision was the result of weeks of mounting evidence on the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines collected by the CDC. The agency has erred on the side of caution throughout the pandemic, drawing criticism for doing so even as the number of vaccinated Americans soared.Just six weeks ago, Walensky warned of “impending doom” amid a rise in infections, hospitalizations and deaths. But then a string of research began streaming in, showing that public health experts’ worst fears weren’t materializing.After making her decision on Wednesday, Walensky briefed Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra that afternoon before telling the White House around 9 p.m. She and other health officials held television appearances that night and gave no hint of the coming change.‘Spectacularly Effective’ VaccinesThe White House has said it was Walensky’s decision, made “not by us, not by the White House, not by the president, to be very clear,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. “Even here, only a small number of people knew” ahead of the announcement, she said.Biden’s remarks Thursday afternoon were a late addition to his public schedule issued the night before.Walensky understood she’d be criticized regardless, one official familiar with her thinking said -- some would say she moved too fast while others would say she moved too slow. She viewed her job as weighing the science and then deciding, the official said.“The CDC is a science-based organization. They accumulate data and they make decisions based on the data,” Anthony Fauci told MSNBC on Friday. “As more and more data come in, it becomes clear how spectacularly effective these vaccines are.”After the CDC announced the change on Thursday, White House staff immediately began removing their own masks, even before Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a maskless press event in the Rose Garden that afternoon.Following the event, an aide announced over the White House press area’s loudspeaker: “Enjoy your maskless lives.”Research AdvancementsOn Thursday, Walensky cited research -- from as early as March 29 and as recently as May 6 -- showing good news in three main areas. First, the real-world effectiveness of vaccines was holding up, showing that their protections weren’t lower outside of a clinical trial setting.Secondly, Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine was found to offer protection against two variants of the virus, a string sign that mutations wouldn’t substantially circumvent the protection.Finally, one study showed lower viral loads in cases where vaccinated people did get sick, and another showed no secondary transmission among vaccinated people who contracted Covid-19. Those results allayed fears among health officials who had worried that vaccinated people could still spread the virus.Another study, released Friday, found that the Pfizer and Moderna Inc. vaccines were 94% effective at stopping symptomatic cases in healthcare workers. Walensky called that research pivotal to her decision.Armed with that knowledge -- along with data showing a drop in cases and a surge of vaccinations and vaccine supply -- Walensky made her biggest call yet as CDC director: Telling vaccinated Americans that they can set aside their masks in gatherings small or large, indoors or out.“I am cautiously optimistic that we’re seeing this great, great endpoint in sight, but I think we really do have to be humble and say that this virus, this pandemic has given us twists and turns so we can’t get our eye off the ball,” Walensky told NBC in an interview on Friday.‘Get Vaccinated’Walensky served as chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital before being tapped by Biden for the CDC role, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation. That thrust her immediately into the public eye, while other top officials, including Becerra and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, faced weeks-long delays in confirmation.Walensky’s announcement on Thursday set off a cascade of revisions to other CDC guidance -- ranging from transportation to education -- and raises questions for businesses, churches and other organizations about how quickly to return to normal, what safety measures to have in place, and how to know who’s vaccinated. It also dangled the promise of a return to normal for people who have been hesitant to get the vaccine.“The rule is very simple: Get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do,” Biden said Thursday.Health officials including Fauci and Biden’s Covid adviser Andy Slavitt have said the announcement wasn’t specifically intended as an inducement to get vaccinated.“People may interpret it that way, but I don’t think that’s what drove the CDC,” Slavitt told Bloomberg Television on Friday. “What that will cause people to do hopefully, who haven’t been vaccinated, is to understand the vaccinations work.”With roughly 54% of US adults not fully vaccinated and children below the age of 12 still not eligible for shots, risks of another outbreak among at least some Americans remain.“Ultimately, we know that this virus is an opportunist, and where there are low rates of vaccination, it will emerge again,” Walensky told NBC on Friday. But, she said, “we needed to take this first step.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-s-new-mask-change-as-a-surprise-creates-confusion-for-businesses-101621080316050.html
15-05-2021||World||Cairn Energy sues Air India to enforce $1.2 billion arbitration award: Report||Cairn Energy has sued India's flagship carrier Air India to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award that it won in a tax dispute against India, according to a US District Court filing reviewed by Reuters.The move ratchets up pressure on India's government to pay the sum of $1.2 billion plus interest and costs that the British firm Cairn was awarded by an arbitration tribunal in December. The body ruled India breached an investment treaty with Britain and said New Delhi was liable to pay.Cairn filed the lawsuit on Friday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to make Air India liable for the judgment that was awarded to Cairn. The lawsuit argued that the carrier as a state-owned company, is "legally indistinct from the state itself"."The nominal distinction between India and Air India is illusory and serves only to aid India in improperly shielding its assets from creditors like (Cairn)," the filing said.Air India did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.However, a senior government official, who asked not to be named, said the government and Air India had not received any formal notice of such a suit."As and when any such notice is received. The government or concerned organisation shall take all necessary steps to defend against any such illegal enforcement action," the official said, adding that New Delhi has engaged a team ready to defend against any enforcement action initiated by Cairn anywhere in the world.Cairn's move could potentially jeopardise India's attempts to divest the state-owned carrier this year. New Delhi said in December that it had received multiple expressions of interest after it moved to privatise the loss-making entity.The senior government official noted New Delhi has filed an appeal against the arbitration award, and added "the government is confident that the award will be set aside".Cairn had since January, however, begun taking steps to identify Indian assets overseas against which it could enforce the award including bank accounts, aircraft and even ships. It had also started registering its claim against India in courts in the United States, Great Britain, Netherlands and Canada.Reuters last week reported that India had asked state-run banks to withdraw funds from their foreign currency accounts abroad, fearing Cairn might sue to seize the funds.'LITTLE PROGRESS'Cairn had said previously it was pursuing a settlement with India, but in the interim it has also been laying the grounds to seize Indian assets should talks fail.Commenting on the suit, a company spokesman on Saturday said that Cairn was taking the necessary legal steps to protect shareholder interests in the absence of a resolution.He said that "Cairn remains open to continuing constructive dialogue with the Government of India" to reach a settlement.An Indian official told Reuters last week, talks between New Delhi and the company were making "little progress" and noted that India's directive to state-run banks to withdraw foreign currency funds sitting overseas showed the government is worried that Cairn may move quickly to seize assets.It is unclear whether the suit against Air India could serve as a means for Cairn to seize Air India aircraft that land on U.S. soil.Earlier this year, a Malaysian court allowed the seizure of a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft that landed in Kuala Lumpur, after Dublin-based AerCap had filed suit in a British court over unpaid dues. The jet was released nearly two weeks later after the two sides reached an amicable settlement.Air India is the only Indian carrier that flies long-haul flights to destinations in the United States and Canada. The frequency of its overseas flights has recently been impacted as the second wave of the pandemic that has hit India, has prompted nations to restrict, or ban travel from the South Asian nation.(Reporting by Euan Rocha and Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Aditi Shah and Aftab Ahmed in New Delhi; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cairn-energy-sues-air-india-to-enforce-1-2-billion-arbitration-award-report-101621078672685.html
15-05-2021||World||Chinese authorities restrict religious practices of Tibetans in Lhasa during holy month||Tibetans in Lhasa have been instructed to restrict certain religious practices during the holy month called 'Saga Dawa', in what appears to be yet another move by Chinese authorities to curb the religious freedom of the Buddhist population.According to the Phayul news portal, this decision was notified in a circular sent by the Lhasa City Buddhist Association on May 9 ahead of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar which began on Wednesday, which Buddhists consider sacred.The reason for the order is premised on the risk of spreading coronavirus. But, the Lobby and activist group International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), believes that the real aim is to further restrict Tibetans religious freedom."While coronavirus prevention measures are valid as the pandemic continues to afflict the world, the Lhasa authorities seem to be using them as a pretext to continue reducing space for Tibetan Buddhists to practice their faith during this holy month," the US-based group said.The constitution of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which cites the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), states that citizens "enjoy the freedom of religious belief," but limits protections for religious practice to "normal religious activities," without defining "normal," according to the 2020 Report on International Religious Freedom released by the US State Department earlier this week.The report said CCP regulations allow only Chinese citizens to take part in officially approved religious practices and stipulate religious activity "must not harm national security."It further said CCP regulations control all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, including religious venues, groups, personnel, and schools, and prohibit "accepting domination by external forces," which authorities said included Tibetans in exile, particularly the Dalai Lama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-authorities-restrict-religious-practices-of-tibetans-in-lhasa-during-holy-month-101621070686251.html
15-05-2021||World||Search for tiger 'India' continues in Texas as alleged owner returns to jail||While a Texas man who police allege is the owner of a tiger that frightened residents after it was seen briefly wandering around a Houston neighborhood was ordered back behind bars on Friday, the animal’s whereabouts remain a mystery.An all-day court hearing Friday didn’t reveal any new information on the tiger’s whereabouts as Houston police say about 300 tips they’ve so far received haven’t panned out.Police allege Victor Hugo Cuevas is the owner of the tiger, a 9-month old male named India, and he is facing a charge of evading arrest after authorities allege he fled from Houston officers who responded to a call about a dangerous animal on Sunday night.After a court hearing in a separate case Cuevas, 26, is facing in neighboring Fort Bend County, his attorney, Michael W. Elliott, reiterated his client doesn’t own the tiger. Elliott said he only knew the first name of the owner, that he has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to find India and that Cuevas only wants for the animal to be safe.“We want to find India. Somebody knows where India is at. Hopefully the cat is still doing well,” Elliott said.At a separate news conference in Houston earlier Friday, police Cmdr. Ron Borza said some of the tips officers have received on the tiger’s possible location have been “a little bit crazy.”“We know the group of people that are involved in the exotic animal trade here in Houston ... We have visited all of them and no luck so far,” Borza said.Investigators believe the tiger has likely been passed around between six and eight different locations in Houston in an effort to hide it but that the animal is probably still in the city, Borza said.Carole Baskin, from the Netflix’s docuseries “Tiger King,” has offered a $5,000 reward for the tiger’s safe return.At the time of his arrest on Monday for allegedly evading Houston police, Cuevas was already out on bond for a murder charge in a 2017 fatal shooting in Fort Bend County. Cuevas has maintained the shooting was self-defense, Elliott said. Cuevas had been released on a separate bond for the evading arrest charge on Wednesday.During a court hearing Friday, Fort Bend County prosecutor Christopher Baugh asked Cuevas be held without a bond for the murder charge, alleging the incident with the tiger showed Cuevas “has a total disregard for the public safety.”State District Judge Frank J. Fraley did not grant the request, but instead revoked Cuevas’ current $125,000 bond and issued a new bond for $300,000. It was the fifth time that Cuevas’ bond had been revoked in the murder case.Borza said that Cuevas and his attorney have not cooperated with Houston police in the search for the tiger but “maybe if he goes to jail he’d be more cooperative with us. We’ll see how that goes.”During Friday’s court hearing, Waller County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Wes Manion testified he lives in the Houston neighborhood and was alerted about the tiger by a neighbor.Manion testified he interacted with the tiger for about 10 minutes to make sure it didn’t go after someone else and that Cuevas came out of his house yelling, “Don’t kill it” and that it was his tiger.“He approached the tiger, grabbed it by the collar, kissed its forehead,” Manion said.The deputy said he identified himself to Cuevas and told him not to leave after he loaded the animal in the back of a white Jeep Cherokee but that Cuevas fled the scene just as Houston police arrived.During the court hearing, Elliott argued Cuevas was not aware that Houston police wanted to question him and that he only left because he feared for the tiger’s safety because Manion had been aggressive. Elliott said the tiger’s release was an accident as it likely jumped a fence.Elliott also said Cuevas did nothing illegal as Texas has no statewide law forbidding private ownership of tigers and other exotic animals. Tigers are not allowed within Houston city limits under a city ordinance unless the handler, such as a zoo, is licensed to have exotic animals.After the court hearing, Elliott described the tiger as more of a pet, like a dog, and that Cuevas would occasionally take care of the animal for its owner. Elliott provided copies of pictures that showed Cuevas cuddling with the tiger and kissing it.Elliott said Cuevas, who is a mixed martial arts fighter and has also worked as a barber, first met the tiger’s owner after buying a dog from him and that the man later informed him he had other animals, including the tiger.“This (tiger) is loved like a dog. Victor’s love for this cat ... is real,” Elliott said.Elliott said he did not know if Cuevas would be able to post his new bond but if he is again released, Cuevas will do all he can to find the tiger and have it live the rest of its life in a wildlife preserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-tiger-india-continues-in-texas-as-alleged-owner-returns-to-jail-101621070425180.html
15-05-2021||World||Israeli airstrike on Gaza home kills 10, mostly children||An Israeli air raid in Gaza City killed at least 10 Palestinians, mostly children, early Saturday in the deadliest single strike since the battle with Gaza's militant Hamas rulers erupted earlier this week. Both sides pressed for an advantage as cease-fire efforts gathered strength.The latest outburst of violence began in Jerusalem and has spread across the region, with Jewish-Arab clashes and rioting in mixed cities of Israel. There were also widespread Palestinian protests Friday in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces shot and killed 11 people.The spiraling violence has raised fears of a new Palestinian “intifada,” or uprising at a time when there have been no peace talks in years. Palestinians were set to mark Nakba (Catastrophe) Day on Saturday, when they commemorate the estimated 700,000 people who fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. That raised the possibility of even more unrest.U.S. diplomat Hady Amr arrived on Friday as part of Washington's efforts to de-escalate the conflict, and the U.N. Security Council was set to meet Sunday. But Israel turned down an Egyptian proposal for a one-year truce that Hamas rulers had accepted, an Egyptian official said Friday on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.Also Read | Israeli military 'tricks' Hamas with vague media statement on Gaza offensiveSince Monday night, Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, which has pounded the Gaza Strip with strikes. In Gaza, at least 126 people have been killed, including 31 children and 20 women; in Israel, seven people have been killed, including a 6-year-old boy and a soldier.Rocket fire from Gaza and Israel’s bombardment of the blockaded Palestinian territory continued into early Saturday, when an airstrike on a three-story house in a refugee camp in Gaza City killed eight children and two women from an extended family.Mohammed Abu Hatab told reporters his wife and five children had gone to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday with relatives. She and three of the children, aged 6 to 14, were killed, while an 11-year-old is missing. Only his 5-month-old son Omar is known to have survived.Children's toys and a Monopoly board game could be seen among the rubble, as well as plates of uneaten food from the holiday gathering.“There was no warning," said Jamal Al-Naji, a neighbor living in the same building. “You filmed people eating and then you bombed them?" he said, addressing Israel. "Why are you confronting us? Go and confront the strong people!”Explained: How Israel-Palestine hostilities peaked & the human cost of violenceShortly afterward, Hamas said it fired a salvo of rockets at southern Israel in response to the airstrike.A furious Israeli barrage early Friday killed a family of six in their house and sent thousands fleeing to U.N.-run shelters. The military said the operation involved 160 warplanes dropping some 80 tons of explosives over the course of 40 minutes and succeeded in destroying a vast tunnel network used by Hamas.Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said the military aims to minimize collateral damage in striking military targets. But measures it takes in other strikes, such as warning shots to get civilians to leave, were not “feasible this time.”Israeli media said the military believed dozens of militants were killed inside the tunnels. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups have confirmed 20 deaths in their ranks, but the military said the real number is far higher.Gaza’s infrastructure, already in widespread disrepair because of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007, showed signs of breaking down further, compounding residents’ misery. The territory's sole power plant is at risk of running out of fuel in the coming days.The U.N. said Gazans are already enduring daily power cuts of 8-12 hours and at least 230,000 have limited access to tap water. The impoverished and densely populated territory is home to 2 million Palestinians, most of them the descendants of refugees from what is now Israel.The conflict has reverberated widely. Israeli cities with mixed Arab and Jewish populations have seen nightly violence, with mobs from each community fighting in the streets and trashing each other’s property.In the occupied West Bank, on the outskirts of Ramallah, Nablus and other towns and cities, hundreds of Palestinians protested against the Gaza campaign and Israeli actions in Jerusalem. Waving Palestinian flags, they trucked in tires that they set up in burning barricades and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers. At least 10 protesters were shot and killed by soldiers. An 11th Palestinian was killed when he tried to stab a soldier at a military position.In east Jerusalem, online video showed young Jewish nationalists firing pistols as they traded volleys of stones with Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, which became a flashpoint for tensions over attempts by settlers to forcibly evict a number of Palestinian families from their homes.On Israel’s northern border, troops opened fire when a group of Lebanese and Palestinian protesters on the other side cut through the border fence and briefly crossed. One Lebanese was killed. Three rockets were fired toward Israel from neighboring Syria without causing any casualties or damage. It was not immediately known who fired them.The tensions began in east Jerusalem earlier this month, with Palestinian protests against the Sheikh Jarrah evictions and Israeli police measures at Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a mount in the Old City revered by Muslims and Jews.Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem late Monday, in an apparent attempt to present itself as the champion of the protesters.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Hamas will “pay a very heavy price” for its rocket attacks as Israel has massed troops at the frontier. U.S. President Joe Biden has expressed support for Israel while saying he hopes to bring the violence under control.Hamas has fired some 2,000 rockets toward Israel since Monday, according to the Israeli military. Most have been intercepted by anti-missile defenses, but they have brought life to a standstill in southern Israeli cities, caused disruptions at airports and have set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-airstrike-on-gaza-home-kills-10-mostly-children-101621068675269.html

That's the process we are following, and we will continue to follow."Two more Royal Australian Air Force repatriation flights to the Northern Territory are scheduled this month, with about 1,000 people planned to return by the end of June. About 9,000 Australians in India have registered with the federal government, requesting to return home.The government aims to more than double the capacity of the quarantine facility in Howard Springs, 25 km (16 miles) southeast of the city of Darwin, so that it can cope with the arrival of 2,000 people every two weeks from June.India has reported more than 300,000 infections a day over the past three weeks, overwhelming its health care system and leaving many without hospital beds, oxygen and adequate treatment.By contrast, Australia has been one of the world's most successful countries in curbing the pandemic, with snap lockdowns, border closures and swift contact-tracing. It has reported just under 29,950 coronavirus infections and 910 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-repatriation-flight-lands-in-australia-after-india-travel-ban-ends-101621068649167.html
15-05-2021||World||Taiwan raises alert level after sudden surge in Covid-19 cases||Taiwan ordered stricter social distancing measures for its capital and surrounding areas on Saturday after a sudden spike in coronavirus cases in a place that has so far weathered the pandemic comparatively unscathed.Authorities raised the alert level for Taipei and New Taipei City after 180 new domestic coronavirus infections were confirmed, up from 29 cases the previous day.The new restrictions mean no more than five people can gather indoors and 10 outdoors -- but authorities stopped short of ordering a total lockdown.Schools, government offices, workplaces and most businesses can stay open as long as social distancing measures can be maintained and masks are worn at all times."We will closely monitor in the next few days the development of the epidemic and adjust (closures) accordingly," health minister Chen Shih-chung said.Taiwan has been hailed as a global leader in containing the Covid-19 pandemic, with just 1,500 cases, 12 deaths and minimal social distancing needed once its initial outbreak was quelled.As a result, the island was one of the few industrialised economies to grow last year.The latest measures come a day after authorities ordered an indefinite closure of entertainment venues in the wake of the widening outbreak.The order covers bars, dance clubs, karaoke lounges, nightclubs, saunas and internet cafes as well as hostess clubs and teahouses.Municipal facilities including libraries and sports centres will also be closed.A similar cluster centred on a hospital led to the suspension of large-scale Lantern Festival events during the Lunar New Year in February.That outbreak was quickly brought under control.But the current cluster appears to be larger and more widespread.Taiwan has ordered millions of vaccine doses from Moderna and AstraZeneca.Only a small number of the latter have arrived and until this week public take-up of the vaccine scheme had been very low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-raises-alert-level-after-sudden-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101621067151041.html
15-05-2021||World||Israeli military 'tricks' Hamas with vague media statement on Gaza offensive||Early Friday, just after midnight, the Israeli military put out an ominous statement to the media: “IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip.”The vaguely worded statement set off frenzied speculation that Israel had launched a ground invasion of Gaza — a much-feared scenario that would mark a bloody escalation of this week’s operation against Hamas militants. Some reporters were even told outright the incursion had begun.Hours later, the military issued a “clarification.” There were no troops inside Gaza. But by then, several major news outlets had erroneously reported the ground offensive was underway.While the army attempted to play down the incident as a misunderstanding, well-placed Israeli military commentators said the media had been used as part of an elaborate ruse to lure Hamas militants into a deadly trap that may have killed dozens of fighters.“They didn’t lie,” said Or Heller, a veteran military correspondent on Israel’s Channel 13 TV. “It was a manipulation. It was smart and it was successful.”This is how it unfolded:Late on Thursday, after days of airstrikes, Israel announced it was calling up thousands of reservists and amassing troops along the border ahead of a possible ground invasion. In another sign of escalation, Israel began firing artillery shells across the border at targets inside Gaza, according to residents.In previous rounds of fighting, ground incursions have resulted in widespread destruction in Gaza and heavy casualties on both sides.That set the stage for the late-night deception. According to Heller, Israel began scrambling forces along the border in what appeared to be final preparations for an invasion. Then came the announcement to the media, issued simultaneously in Hebrew and Arabic on Twitter. There followed alerts in major outlets, including the New York Times, that the invasion was underway.The Israeli moves sent Hamas fighters rushing into defensive positions in an underground network of tunnels known as “the Metro,” according to Heller and other Israeli reports.Israel called in 160 warplanes and bombarded the tunnels for 40 minutes, the military said. Heller said it was his understanding that scores of militants had been killed, though he said it was impossible to say.“What we saw tonight was a very sophisticated operation that had a media aspect to it,” Heller said.Hamas has not commented on the incident, and it was impossible to confirm the Israeli reports.Heller said veteran Israeli correspondents, who have close ties to the military and in many cases have served themselves, knew that there was no way Israel was sending troops across enemy lines at this stage. Heller and other military correspondents even put out statements on Twitter assuring the jittery public that there was no ground operation.The Associated Press, based on its analysis of the army’s statement, phone calls to military officials, and on-the-ground reporting in Gaza, concluded there was no ground incursion and did not report there was one.But others said the military had misled them or even lied when asked to clarify the initial statement and its ambiguous use of the word “in.” Some felt the foreign media had been turned into an accessory of sorts.Felicia Schwartz, the correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, said she alerted news of a ground offensive after receiving explicit confirmation from Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman.In a statement posted on Twitter, she said Conricus “told me directly, `There are ground troops in Gaza.’ That was the basis for a first story saying so. He retracted that statement two hours later and I changed the story to reflect that, and that is noted in the text and will be corrected.”Speaking to reporters on Friday morning, Conricus blamed an “internal miscommunication.”“These things can sometimes happen in the midst of a complex operation with many moving parts and with an unclear picture of what was happening,” he said. “As soon as I understood that I had the wrong information, I updated the relevant people with a clarification.”But some correspondents still had questions.“If they used us, it's unacceptable. And if not, then what's the story — and why is the Israeli media widely reporting that we were duped?” said Daniel Estrin, NPR's correspondent in Jerusalem, who was also told by the military that an invasion had begun.Militaries around the world have long used deception and trickery against their enemies. Two years ago, the Israeli military reportedly faked the injuries of soldiers at the scene of a Hezbollah missile strike, going so far as to evacuate them in bandages to a hospital in a helicopter.According to reports at the time, the army staged the injuries to trick Hezbollah into thinking it had inflicted casualties and therefore agree to a cease-fire.Friday’s misleading statement further strained what has often been a rocky relationship between the IDF and the foreign media.Peter Lerner, a former military spokesman to the foreign media, said the Israeli public, in general, has long felt the international media focus too heavily on the Palestinian side of the story while minimizing Israeli concerns and suffering -- and the army is similarly inclined.Lerner said he felt it was unlikely the military intentionally lied, but the damage was done regardless.“Your currency is credibility,” he said. “I think this is a crisis of that credibility in the way it’s being portrayed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-military-tricks-hamas-with-vague-media-statement-on-gaza-offensive-101621067264735.html
15-05-2021||World||Chinese spacecraft lands on Mars||An unmanned Chinese spacecraft landed on Mars on Saturday, making China only the second country after the US to successfully land on the red planet.China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft, currently in orbit around Mars, dropped its lander and rover - named Zhurong after a Chinese mythological god of fire - on the surface of the planet early on Saturday, completing a critical stage of the ongoing mission, described by Chinese state media as “extremely complicated with no ground control”.The probe landed on a site on a vast lava plain known as Utopia Planitia, “leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time”, official news agency Xinhua reported.The entry, descent and landing (EDL) took around nine minutes, during which the speed of the craft was reduced from 20,000km per hour to zero, the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) , the developer of the lander-rover combo of Tianwen-1, told Chinese state media.The China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement that its rover Zhurong had successfully landed on Mars after “nine minutes of terror”, which is how Nasa describes the time interval when scientists on Earth have no control over the rover because of communication delays.Tianwen-1, consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, was launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the coast of southern China’s Hainan island on July 23, 2020.Tracking the course of the spacecraft, the Xinhua report said that in the early hours of Saturday, the spacecraft began to descend from its parking orbit, and the entry capsule enclosing the lander and rover separated from the orbiter at about 4am.“After flying for approximately three hours, the entry capsule hurtled towards the red planet and entered the Mars atmosphere at an altitude of 125km, initiating the riskiest phase of the whole mission,” the report added.Around 100 metres above the planet’s surface, the craft hovered to identify obstacles and measured the slopes of the surface. “Avoiding the obstacles, it selected a relatively flat area and descended slowly, touching down safely with its four buffer legs.“Earlier, research showed the landing site might be the edge of an ancient ocean or lake in the early history of Mars. Chinese scientists are looking for more evidence of water-ice and will share the data with their international counterparts.”Last month, China sent to space a key module for its permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.The module, sent to orbit by a rocket, can provide electricity, and accommodate three astronauts for up to six months.In a commentary published on Saturday, Xinhua said China was “not looking to compete for leadership in space” but was committed to “unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity’s peaceful use of space”.Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with US rover Perseverance touching down on February 18; Hope - the third spacecraft that arrived on Mars in February this year - is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.“The first successful landing ever was made by Nasa’s Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year. A Mars probe launched by the former Soviet Union landed in December 1971, but communication was lost seconds after landing,” Reuters said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-spacecraft-lands-on-mars-101621060563128.html

He felt unwell after work, developing a fever and runny nose, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic where he received a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Covid-19.His test result came back positive the next day.SPS said it immediately ceased kitchen operations at Institution A5 and started contact tracing among staff and inmates upon confirmation of his infection.All close contacts of the man have been isolated or placed in quarantine pending issuance of a quarantine order, said the service.Affected inmates will serve their quarantine orders in prison, isolated from the rest of the inmate population. Staff, vendors and volunteers will serve theirs at MOH's designated quarantine facility.As a precautionary measure, activities including family visits, counselling sessions and non-critical hospital appointments have been halted in Institution A5 where the chef worked, said SPS.The country has so far reported more than 61,500 coronavirus cases and 31 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-singapore-to-test-5-000-inmates-at-changi-prison-101621057442740.html
15-05-2021||World||Top military official responsible for Canadian vaccination programme fired||The military official responsible for the logistics of Canada’s Covid-19 vaccination programme has been fired after coming under an investigation.Major-General Dany Fortin was seconded to the public health agency of Canada as vice-president for logistics and operations in November last year, as the country prepared to launch its vaccination drive.However, in a sudden announcement on Friday, a spokesperson for the department of national defence said he had “left” the assignment “pending the results of a military investigation”. Details of the reasons for the investigation were not revealed.Fortin was appointed to the critical position by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Fortin was also in charge of establishing and supervising the national operations centre, which is the logistics hub of the vaccine programme.His departure comes even as the Canadian armed forces is facing an institutional crisis over misconduct allegations that have claimed the last two chief of defence staff, the senior-most officer, and have also embroiled the minister of national defence Harjit Sajjan as well as officials of the prime minister’s office.General Jonathan Vance resigned in January amidst allegations of impropriety of a sexual nature, and is facing an investigation. Sajjan has come under severe criticism in this matter after the military ombudsman of the time revealed that the defence minister was informed of improper conduct with a subordinate in 2018. Earlier this month, an advisor to PM testified before the house of commons defence committee that she was aware of the allegations. Vance’s successor admiral Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian forces national investigation service.While, it is not known whether either or neither of these investigations are linked to Fortin’s exit, his absence could have an impact on the delivery of vaccinations across the country. As the logistics chief, he led a campaign that has resulted in over 50% of Canadians receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-military-official-responsible-for-canadian-vaccination-programme-fired-101621057563063.html

While China has mostly curbed domestic transmission of the coronavirus, Nepal is experiencing a surge with record numbers of new infections and deaths.Also Read: Giripremi’s Jitendra Gaware summits Mt Everest; his 2nd 8K-m peak in less than a monthChina had issued permits to 38 people, all Chinese citizens, to climb the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) -high mountain this spring. Nepal has given permission to 408 people. Climbing was not allowed from either side last year because of the pandemic.In Nepal, several climbers have reported testing positive for Covid-19 after they were brought down from the Everest base camp.The month of May usually has the best weather for climbing Everest. Scores have reached the summit this week and more are expected to make attempts later this month once the weather improves. Two climbers have died on the Nepalese side, one Swiss and one American.China earlier said it would set up a separation line at the peak and prohibit people on its side from coming into contact with anyone on the Nepalese side.

15-05-2021||World||126 dead, 950 injured in Gaza as Israel continues air strike||Israeli fighter jets hit targets in central Gaza overnight, the army said Saturday, after a day of deadly violence rocked the West Bank and unprecedented unrest persisted inside Israel.Despite intensifying diplomatic efforts to ease five days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, Israel's air force struck several sites in the strip overnight, while rockets again tore towards the Jewish state.Overall Palestinian fatalities from strikes on Gaza have reached 126 -- including 31 children -- with 950 injured.Israel, which is also trying to contain an outbreak of internal Jewish-Arab violence, is facing a conflict in the Palestinian territories unlike any in its recent history.Its bombardment of Gaza began Monday in response to rocket fire towards Jerusalem from Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the enclave.More than 2,000 rockets have been fired at the Jewish state since Monday, killing nine people, including a child and a soldier, with more than 560 people injured.Israel's response has seen it hit nearly 800 targets, including a massive assault Friday on a Hamas tunnel network dug under civilian areas.Towers and homes were levelled, forcing Gaza families to seek shelter in schools and mosques, ahead of another possible bombardment."All the children are afraid and we are afraid for the children," said Kamal al-Haddad, who fled with his family to a UN-supported school in Gaza City.Early Saturday, the Israeli army said it had hit a Hamas "operation office" near the centre of Gaza City, with additional overnight strikes targeting what the military called "underground launch sites".Air raid warnings continued to wail in southern Israel early Saturday.The fighting in blockaded Gaza, the worst since a 2014 war, exploded following hostilities in east Jerusalem, the Israeli-annexed part of the city Palestinians claim as their capital.Fresh overnight tensions hit the east Jerusalem area of Shuafat, where young, masked Palestinian protesters set debris on fire as Israeli police responded with tear gas.- West Bank unrest - The West Bank saw fierce fighting on Friday, with the Palestinian health ministry saying 11 people were killed by Israeli fire.A Palestinian security source said the fighting was the "most intense" since the second intifada, or uprising, that began in 2000.Violence on Fridays in the West Bank is a traditional facet of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the latest clashes are closely linked to the events in Jerusalem and Gaza.From Ramallah to Hebron and across the territory occupied by Israel since 1967, Palestinians hurled stones, Molotov cocktails and other projectiles.Israeli forces hit back with rubber bullets and, in some instances, live rounds."It would be shameful to remain quiet with what's going on in Gaza," said Oday Hassan, 21, who was protesting in Al-Birah.The health ministry said more than 150 had been wounded in the West Bank, as it appealed for blood donations.At the least one of the Palestinians killed was shot dead after attempting to stab a soldier north of Ramallah, said the Israeli army, which early Saturday reported an additional attempted knife attack during "a violent riot" in Nablus.- Intercommunal violence -Within Israel, an unprecedented wave of mob violence has seen Arabs and Jews savagely beat each other, with both synagogues and mosques set alight.More than 750 people have been arrested this week, police said.In one of the most shocking episodes of the intercommunal violence, a far-right Jewish mob beat a man they considered an Arab in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv on Wednesday, leaving him with serious injuries.In the north, where Israel remains technically at war with neighbouring Lebanon and Syria, tensions were also rising.The army said it "fired warning shots towards a number of rioters who crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory" on Friday, forcing them back into Lebanon.Israel's arch-enemy, the pro-Iranian Shiite group Hezbollah, announced one of its members, 21-year-old Mohamad Kassem Tahan, was killed by the Israeli shots.Three rockets were later launched at Israel from southern Syria, where Hezbollah is present, but there was no immediate confirmation of a link between the events.- 'Not over yet' -The UN said the Security Council would meet Sunday to address Gaza.US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr arrived in Israel on Friday as part of mediation efforts.Amr will hold talks both with Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and encourage a "sustainable calm", State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter said.But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no indication that Israel was ready to ease its campaign."I said we'd deliver heavy blows to Hamas and other terror groups, and we're doing that," Netanyahu said."They're paying and will continue to pay dearly for that. It's not over yet."Israel estimates that more than 30 leaders of Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have been killed.It has hit sites it describes as military targets such as Hamas bomb-making facilities and the homes of senior militant commanders.The UN said 10,000 Gazans had been forced from their homes by the bombardment.Several international airlines cancelled flights amid the Gaza rocket fire, while many incoming flights have been diverted from the main airport near Tel Aviv.bur-bs/reb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-continues-air-strike-as-palestinian-death-toll-climbs-to-126-101621052753415.html
15-05-2021||World||Neera Tanden lands senior Biden admin position after Senate rebuff||Neera Tanden will start on Monday as a senior adviser to President Joe Biden in the White House two months after her cabinet nomination ran into trouble in the Senate.Tanden, a veteran Democrat, will be tasked with preparing the administration’s response to any fallout from a challenge mounted by Republicans to the healthcare act in the Supreme Court, and the US Digital Service, which works to make the government more accessible online, according to news reports.There has been no White House announcement of the appointment, but news reports said Tanden starts work on Monday.President Biden had appointed Tanden earlier to head the Office of Management and Budget, a key department with broad oversight over the entire federal government. If confirmed, she would have become the first Indian-American to hold a cabinet position in the federal government (Republican Nikki Haley had held a cabinet-rank position as ambassador to UN).Misgivings about her nomination began to be expressed immediately about tweets she had posted and since removed. She had targeted Bernie Sanders, an independent Senator who caucuses with Democrats, over his challenge to Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential nomination, and Republicans.The final blow, however, came from a fellow Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin, whose vote in an evenly split Senate would be critical. He killed her chances by announcing his opposition to her nomination citing her “overtly partisan statements”.The White House withdrew Tanden’s nomination shortly saying it was doing so at her request.But President Biden made it clear he would find a place for her in his administration in some other capacity.Ron Klain, a long-time associate of the president and his chief of staff, is understood to be Tanden’s strongest ally in the White House. He had lobbied hard to bolster support for Tanden’s nomination and was widely expected to ensure she landed a position in the Biden White House despite the Senate rebuff. She does not require Senate confirmation as senior adviser.Tanden joins a battery of nearly 30 Indian Americans - or more - in the Biden administration that include Vivek Murthy, who is doing a second stint as surgeon general; Vinay Reddy, director of the president’s team of speechwriters; and Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council, a White House agency that advises the president on domestic and global economic policy.Tanden had served as a senior adviser for health reform at the US Department of Health and Human Services entrusted with developing policies and provisions of the Affordable Care Act, then president Barack Obama’s signature law that is now called Obamacare. She went on to head a liberal thinktank centre for American Progress and was seen as a contender for a cabinet berth in a Hillary Clinton administration.Tanden was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who had divorced when she was five. She and her brother were raised by their mother single-handedly and the family went through some bad times - Tanden has spoken of them relying on food coupons - government support - to get by.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neera-tanden-lands-senior-biden-admin-position-after-senate-rebuff-101621052403233.html

Michelle Lujan Grisham said that getting vaccinated is crucial to a safe future, with the statewide vaccination rate recently surpassing 50% for eligible residents 16 and over.“We are close and getting closer. But that all depends on New Mexicans continuing to protect themselves and their community by getting vaccinated,” she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-us-new-mexico-adopts-cdc-guidance-on-facemasks-101621048366131.html
15-05-2021||World||China's unmanned spacecraft lands on surface of Mars||An uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the Red Planet.The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, "leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time," Xinhua said.The craft left its parked orbit at about 1700 GMT Friday (0100 Beijing time Saturday). The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said.It said the landing process consisted of "nine minutes of terror" as the module decelerates and then slowly descends.A solar-powered rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections. Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera.The rover will study the planet's surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar.Tianwen-1, or "Questions to Heaven", after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is China's first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in 2011 failed to leave the Earth's orbit.The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March 5 rocket.After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the Red Planet in February where it had been in orbit since.If Zhurong is successfully deployed, China would be the first country to orbit, land and release a rover in its maiden mission to Mars.Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with US rover Perseverance successfully touching down on Feb. 18 in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000 km away from Utopia Planitia.Hope - the third spacecraft that arrived at Mars in February this year - is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.The first successful landing ever was made by NASA's Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year.

15-05-2021||World||UK to speed up 2nd dose vaccination for people above 50 years of age to check spread of Indian Covid-19 variant||A rise in cases of the Indian coronavirus variant could "pose serious disruption" to Britain's reopening plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Friday.England will take the next step of reopening on Monday as planned, but the final stage, currently scheduled for June 21, could be in doubt."I do not believe we need to delay our roadmap," said Johnson.But, "this new variant could pose a serious disruption to our progress," he said, adding "We will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe."The health ministry said the B1.617.2 variant is "beginning to spread increasingly rapidly" in northwest England and to a lesser extent in London, "and decisive action is being taken to further control its spread".Second doses of vaccines will be accelerated for the over-50s and the clinically vulnerable in a bid to keep the strain at bay, Johnson told the press briefing.Surge testing and possible local restrictions are also in the mix after infections of the variant rose from 520 last week to 1,313 this week, officials said.The government is waiting on data that will indicate if the new variant is more transmissible than other strains currently circulating before deciding on its next step, said Johnson.Scientists believe it is more transmissible, but are unsure of by how much, revealed Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty.If only slightly, the country will reopen as planned, said Johnson.But if there is evidence of uncontrollable spread and the threat of increased pressure on NHS then more restrictions are likely, he added.'Trust our vaccines' Britain has driven down cases over the last few months thanks to a succesful vaccine campaign, and officials are optimistic they will be effective against the variant."So far, there is no evidence that our vaccine will be less effective against serious illness and hospitalisations," said the prime minister, adding the country was "in a different position from the last time we faced a new variant.""We should trust in our vaccines... while monitoring the situation very closely," he said.The government last month added India, which is experiencing a devastating wave of deaths from Covid-19, to a travel red list, meaning travellers from the country have to quarantine in hotels on arrival in Britain.In the northwest English city of Bolton, which has a sizeable population of South Asian origin, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door testing is also on offer.Britain has been gradually reopening its economy, after months of coronavirus restrictions.On Monday, indoor mixing will resume in England, including in pubs and restaurants.Deepti Gurdasani, senior lecturer in epidemiology at Queen Mary's University London, said that must now be postponed."Further, we may have to actually strengthen restrictions a bit more to get on top of this, because we need to remember this is actually growing with current restrictions in place and growing rapidly," she told Times Radio.The Indian variant is also triggering concern in Scotland and Wales, which administer their own health policy.Scotland announced on Friday it was going ahead with its next stage of reopening on Monday, except in Glasgow, where restrictions will remain unchanged due to a rise in cases of the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-speed-up-2nd-dose-vaccination-for-people-above-50-years-of-age-to-check-spread-of-indian-covid-19-variant-101621046273871.html
15-05-2021||World||West Bank erupts in protest amid more Israel-Hamas fighting||Turmoil from the battle between Israel and Hamas spilled over into the West Bank on Friday, sparking the most widespread Palestinian protests in years as hundreds of young demonstrators in multiple towns clashed with Israeli troops, who shot and killed at least 11 people.Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip continued into early Saturday, when an airstrike on a house in Gaza City killed at least seven Palestinians — the highest number of fatalities in a single hit. That strike came a day after a furious overnight barrage of tank fire and airstrikes that wreaked destruction in some towns, killed a family of six in their house and sent thousands fleeing their homes.The Israeli military said the operation involved 160 warplanes dropping some 80 tons of explosives over the course of 40 minutes and succeeded in destroying a network of tunnels used by Hamas to elude airstrikes and surveillance.Also Read| Israel-Palestine conflict: Attacks rise, wounds deepenIsrael appeared determined to inflict as much damage as possible on Gaza’s Hamas rulers before international efforts for a cease-fire accelerated. Since Monday night, Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, which has pounded the Gaza Strip with strikes. In Gaza, at least 126 people have been killed, including 31 children and 20 women; in Israel, seven people have been killed, including a 6-year-old boy and a soldier.Houda Ouda said she and her extended family ran frantically into their home in the Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, seeking safety as the earth shook in the darkness.“We even did not dare to look from the window to know what is being hit,” she said. When daylight came, she saw the destruction: streets cratered, buildings crushed or with facades blown off, an olive tree burned bare, dust covering everything.The latest airstrike targeted a three-story house on the edge of a refugee camp. Said Alghoul, who lives nearby, said Israeli warplanes dropped at least three bombs on the home without warning residents in advance.“I could not endure and ran back to my home,” he said. Rescuers called a bulldozer to dig through the rubble for survivors or bodies.Also Read| Israel sends air, ground troops to Gaza as conflict intensifiesShortly afterward, Hamas said it fired a salvo of rockets at southern Israel in response to the airstrike.The conflict, which was sparked by tensions in Jerusalem during the past month, has reverberated widely. Israeli cities with mixed Arab and Jewish populations have seen daily violence, with mobs from each community clashing and trashing each other’s property. New clashes broke out Friday in the coastal city of Acre.In the occupied West Bank, on the outskirts of Ramallah, Nablus and other towns and cities, hundreds of Palestinians protested against the Gaza campaign and Israeli actions in Jerusalem. Waving Palestinian flags, they trucked in tires that they set up in burning barricades and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers. At least 10 protesters were shot and killed by soldiers. An 11th Palestinian was killed when he tried to stab a soldier at a military position.In east Jerusalem, online video showed young Jewish nationalists firing pistols as they traded volleys of stone with Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, which became a flashpoint for tensions over attempts by settlers to forcibly evict a number of Palestinian families from their homes.On Israel's northern border, troops opened fire when a group of Lebanese and Palestinian protesters on the other side cut through the border fence and briefly crossed. One Lebanese was killed. Three rockets were fired toward Israel from neighboring Syria, but they either landed in Syrian territory or in empty areas, Israeli media said. It was not immediately known who fired them.The spiraling violence has raised fears of a new Palestinian “intifada,” or uprising, at a time when the peace process has been virtually nonexistent for years. The tensions began in east Jerusalem earlier this month, with Palestinian protests against the Sheikh Jarrah evictions and Israeli police measures at Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a mount in the Old City revered by Muslims and Jews.Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem late Monday, in an apparent attempt to present itself as the champion of the protesters. In the conflict that spiraled from there, Israel says it wants to inflict as much damage as it can on Hamas’ military infrastructure in Gaza.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Hamas would “pay a very heavy price” for its rocket attacks. Israel called up 9,000 reservists Thursday to join its troops massed at the Gaza border.An Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had turned down an Egyptian proposal for a one-year cease-fire that Hamas had accepted. The official, who was close to Egypt’s talks with both sides, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal negotiations.On Friday, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel-Palestinian affairs, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel as part of an attempt by Washington to de-escalate the conflict.US President Joe Biden gave a show of support to Netanyahu in a call a day earlier, saying “there has not been a significant overreaction” in Israel’s response to Hamas rockets. He said the aim is to get a “significant reduction in attacks, particularly rocket attacks.”Hamas has fired some 2,000 rockets toward Israel since Monday, according to the Israeli military. Most have been intercepted by anti-missile defenses, but they have brought life to a standstill in southern Israeli cities, caused disruptions at airports and have set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.Rafat Tanani, his pregnant wife and four children, ages 7 and under, were killed after an Israeli warplane reduced their four-story apartment building to rubble in the neighboring town of Beit Lahia, residents said. Four strikes hit the building, Rafat’s brother Fadi said. The building’s owner and his wife also were killed.“It was a massacre,” said Sadallah Tanani, another relative. “My feelings are indescribable.”When the sun rose Friday, residents streamed out of the area in pickup trucks, on donkeys and on foot, taking pillows, blankets, pots and pans and bread. Thousands took shelter inside 16 schools run by the United Nations relief agency UNWRA, agency spokesman Adnan Abu Hasna said.Mohammed Ghabayen, who took refuge in a school with his family, said his children had eaten nothing since the day before, and they had no mattresses to sleep on. “And this is in the shadow of the coronavirus crisis,” he said. “We don’t know whether to take precautions for the coronavirus or the rockets or what to do exactly.”Israeli military officials cheered the operation as a successful blow against the tunnel network. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said 160 warplanes operated in a “synchronized manner” for about 40 minutes as part of the operation.He said the military aims to minimize collateral damage in striking military targets. But measures the military takes in other strikes, such as warning shots to get civilians to leave, were not “feasible this time.”Military correspondents in Israeli media said the military believed dozens of militants were killed inside the tunnels. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups have confirmed 20 deaths in their ranks, but the Israeli military said the real number is far higher.“We turned the tunnels which they thought were death traps for our soldiers into traps for them.” Reserve Air Force Col.

More than a dozen people were wounded.No group has so far claimed the attack and the Taliban denied responsibility.Afghans have been cautiously enjoying a rare respite from violence following the start of a three-day truce between Taliban militants and Afghan forces which began Thursday, after weeks of intense fighting."The death toll has jumped to 12 killed, including the imam of the mosque, and 15 others are wounded," said Ferdaws Framurz, a spokesman for the Kabul police, updating an earlier toll.A spokesman for the interior ministry said the explosives were placed in the mosque ahead of the prayers.The governor of southern Uruzgan province, Fazel Ahmad Shirzad, meanwhile accused the Taliban of twice violating the ceasefire by attacking security forces on Friday -- a day after landmine blasts killed several civilians in Kunduz, according to officials there.The blast comes after US and Afghan officials on Friday said the United States had pulled out completely from a major southern air base in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.US airstrikes were launched from the base just last week to help Afghan forces push back a major Taliban offensive in the south.Washington, backed by NATO, has pledged to withdraw all foreign troops and end America's longest war by September.Concerns over transfer of base Kandahar was the birthplace of the Taliban and has in recent months seen intense clashes between the resurgent militants and Afghan forces.The US embassy in Kabul confirmed on Twitter that US forces had "completed the transition of Kandahar Airfield to Afghan forces this week".Khoja Yaya Alawi, a spokesman for the Afghan army in Kandahar, said they were waiting for an official handover, but that the last US troops "left the base on Wednesday".An Afghan army officer at Kandahar Airfield, who asked not to be named, told AFP that government forces would be left exposed by the pullout."It is now going to be very difficult for us to conduct operations," he said. "Our aircraft can't fly at night so the night operations are going to be difficult."Afghan military analyst Kabir Darwish said the "Afghan air force does not have enough capacity to replace the US".Despite the withdrawal, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call to President Ashraf Ghani promised "steadfast support" for Afghan forces as he condemned the recent attacks, the State Department said.A number of smaller bases have already been handed over to Afghan forces.The airfield was formerly the second largest base for US and international troops in Afghanistan, and the first airfield where US forces were stationed after the fall of the Taliban in 2001.It was also the centre of the biggest drone operation by US special forces. At its peak the base had about 26,000 US and NATO personnel.The military has for years been steadily decreasing its presence there, accelerated after Washington struck a deal with the Taliban last year to completely withdraw from Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.But the US missed the May 1 deadline, extending it to September 11 -- a move which angered the Taliban.Although fighting between US forces and the Taliban has stopped since the landmark agreement last year, battles rage daily between Afghan government forces and the militants.On Saturday, a series of blasts outside a girls' school in Kabul killed more than 50 people, mostly teenage girls.Ceasefires in the past have largely held, in what is widely thought to be an exercise by the Taliban leadership to prove it has control over the myriad factions across the country that make up the hardline movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-killed-in-afghanistan-mosque-ceasefire-calm-shattered-101621039176665.html
15-05-2021||World||UK fraud agency probes Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta's Greensill links||The business empire of Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta, including its financing arrangements with bankrupt Greensill Capital U.K., is being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, the agency said Friday.The SFO said in a statement that it is investigating suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering within Gupta Family Group Alliance, including links to Greensill, the supply chain finance firm that went bankrupt earlier this year. Because this is an active investigation, the agency said it won't be providing any further comment on its probe.Gupta’s companies were among the main clients of Greensill before its collapse in March. Their reliance on Greensill stoked concerns over their financial health when it went under. Liberty Steel, which employs 5,000 people, has sought a government bailout in the wake of Greensill's collapse.Greensill’s model worked by positioning itself between businesses and their suppliers. It would immediately pay invoices that suppliers gave to their customers, for a fee. In effect, it gave suppliers certainty by ensuring that they didn't have to wait for months for payment.The relationship between Gupta's companies and Greensill has been in the spotlight over the past few weeks. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an adviser to Greensill that involved him lobbying his contacts in government and in the civil service, has been caught up in the fallout of the firm's bankruptcy,On Thursday, Cameron testified before lawmakers on his activities for Greensill, which he insisted was motivated by a desire to help support British workers and businesses “in the economic turmoil caused by Covid” and not by the prospect of making millions from his Greensill shares.Opposition parties are calling for tougher rules on contacts between business representatives and government officials, saying Britain’s laxly enforced lobbying regulations leave the door open to corruption.The Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's financial regulatory body, has already announced a formal investigation into Greensill’s collapse after receiving allegations that it said were “potentially criminal in nature.”The Financial Times newspaper has previously reported that Gupta’s companies handed suspicious invoices to Greensill, which the finance company paid for. In response, GFG Alliance said the invoices were for products it expected to perhaps sell in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-fraud-agency-probes-liberty-steel-owner-sanjeev-gupta-s-greensill-links-101621038726603.html

15-05-2021||World||'India's Covid-19 situation hugely concerning': WHO chief||India's Covid-19 situation remains hugely concerning, with several states continuing to see a worrying number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday, warning that the pandemic's second year will be "far more deadly" than the first for the world.Ghebreyesus added that the WHO is responding to the Covid-19 surge in India and has shipped thousands of oxygen concentrators, tents for mobile field hospitals, masks and other medical supplies."India remains hugely concerning, with several states continuing to see a worrying number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths," he said at the daily media briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"And we thank all the stakeholders who are supporting India," the WHO Director-General said.India is in the midst of a deadly wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with 3,43,144 people testing positive for the virus on Friday, taking the country's caseload to 2,40,46,809. The death toll stands at 2,62,317.India's Covid-19 tally crossed the 10 million mark on December 19 and in under six months it has doubled, surpassing the grim milestone of 20 million cases on May 4.Ghebreyesus pointed out that the emergency-like situation was not restricted to India.“Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Egypt are just some of the countries that are dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalisations,” he said adding that some countries in the Americas still have high numbers of cases and as a region, the Americas accounted for 40 per cent of all Covid-19 deaths last week.There are also spikes in some countries in Africa. “These countries are in heightened response mode and WHO will continue to provide support in all ways possible,” he said.Noting that Covid-19 has already cost more than 3.3 million lives across the world, Ghebreyesus said, "We’re on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first.”He lamented that vaccine supply remains a key challenge and that saving lives and livelihoods with a combination of public health measures and vaccination – not one or the other - is the only way out of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-19-situation-hugely-concerning-who-chief-101621037244560.html
15-05-2021||World||Israel-Palestine conflict: Attacks rise, wounds deepen||Israel faced a widening conflict on Friday, as deadly violence escalated across the West Bank amid a massive aerial bombardment in Gaza and unprecedented unrest among Arabs and Jews inside the country.The West Bank clashes, described as among the most intense since the second intifada that began in 2000, left 10 people dead from Israeli fire, the Palestinian health ministry said, as overall fatalities from strikes on Gaza rose to 122.Palestinian armed groups in the enclave have launched more than 1,800 rockets at Israel since Monday, killing nine people, with sirens wailing across the country throughout the week.The Israeli army said its overnight assault on Gaza involved fighter jets and tanks hitting a Hamas tunnel network dug under civilian areas.The bombardment saw huge fireballs turn the night sky orange. Towers and homes were levelled, while rockets tore through the skies towards Israel.Gazan families sought shelter at a school, fearing another barrage. “All the children are afraid and we are afraid for the children,” said Kamal al-Haddad, who fled with his family to a UN-backed school in Gaza City. Umm Raed al-Baghdadi, who also fled her home, said Gazans “who have been in war since childhood... cannot bear it anymore”.Israeli soldiers massed on the edge of the blockaded territory, but the army’s overnight statement that a ground invasion had commenced proved false.The Gaza death toll includes 31 children, and 900 were injured, authorities said, while the Israeli fatalities count one child and one soldier.The UN said its Security Council would meet on Sunday to address Gaza, while China accused the US of “ignoring the suffering” of Muslims, after Washington stopped the council from meeting on Friday.Israel said hundreds of the rockets fired towards its territory, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, had been intercepted.In a late development, a Lebanese protester who was hit when Israeli troops fired shots at the Lebanon-Israel border, succumbed to his wounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-conflict-attacks-rise-wounds-deepen-101621036469603.html
15-05-2021||World||Neera Tanden hired as Biden adviser after budget nomination scuttled||President Joe Biden has appointed longtime Democratic policy aide Neera Tanden as a senior White House adviser after her earlier nomination for budget director was scuttled by Senate opposition.Tanden’s role will include planning for potential health policy changes if Republicans succeed in their efforts to strike down the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss the job before it was formally announced. Tanden will also be involved in a review of the US Digital Service, a technology unit that works out of the White House, the official added.The post, which was reported earlier Friday by CNN, is a staff position that does not require Senate confirmation.In early March, she withdrew from consideration to be director of the Office of Management and Budget after it became clear she didn’t have the votes to be confirmed. Senators’ objections to her nomination were rooted in her use of Twitter, where she’d spent years posting comments that were critical of her political opponents, including supporters of independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and as well as prominent Republicans.Several of those targets then had her nomination in their hands.Tanden led the liberal Center for American Progress for nearly a decade after working on the Obama administration’s health-care overhaul.“Neera’s intellect, tenacity, and political savvy will be an asset to the Biden administration as she assumes a new role as senior adviser to the president,” the center’s founder, John Podesta, said in a statement. “While we will be sorry to lose her considerable policy expertise and leadership at the Center for American Progress—an organization which we founded together in 2003 — I am exceptionally thrilled to see her step into a new position serving this White House and the American people.”Before joining Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, Tanden spent more than a decade working for Bill and Hillary Clinton. She held domestic policy roles in the Clinton White House, eventually becoming an aide to Hillary Clinton and joining the then-first lady’s 2000 campaign for a New York Senate seat. Tanden was legislative director in Clinton’s Senate office and policy director on her 2008 presidential campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neera-tanden-hired-as-biden-adviser-after-budget-nomination-scuttled-101621031145707.html
15-05-2021||World||Lab-grown virus theory must be taken seriously: Scientists||The origin of the novel coronavirus is still unclear and the theory that it was caused by a laboratory leak needs to be taken seriously until there is a rigorous data-led investigation that proves it wrong, a group of leading scientists said.Covid-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, has killed 3.34 million people, cost the world trillions of dollars in lost income and upended normal life for billions of people."More investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic," said the 18 scientists, including Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge, and Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center."Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable," the scientists including David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford, said in a letter to the journal Science.The authors of the letter said the World Health Organization's investigation into the origins of the virus had not made a "balanced consideration" of the theory that it may have come from a laboratory incident.In its final report, written jointly with Chinese scientists, a WHO-led team that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that a lab leak was "extremely unlikely" as a cause.But there are myriad different ideas about the origin of the virus including a series of conspiracy theories."We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data," the scientists said, adding that an intellectually rigorous and dispassionate investigation needed to take place."In this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus—often at great personal cost."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labgrown-virus-theory-must-be-taken-seriously-scientists-101621028505097.html
