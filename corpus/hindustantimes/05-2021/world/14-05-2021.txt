Almost 26% had a different employer, and the remaining 11% were out of a job.The historically high level of churn, or rate of change, underscores the colossal challenge of bringing back millions of people to the labor market as the economy reopens.Millions of workers who lost their jobs in the spring of 2020 were back at work in March this year, and the paper implies that the recovery is largely due to people finding new jobs, rather returning to their old employers.“Shocks in the initial months of the pandemic may have permanently destroyed a large share of employer-worker matches, many of which may have been highly productive,” the authors wrote. “Because highly productive matches are costly to find, the economic disruption induced by Covid-19 may have induced persistent reductions in productivity and employment.”For people who had been at their job for less than two years before the pandemic, the churn was much higher, according to the study. Almost 62% had separated from their workers a year later, versus about 16% for those who had been employed by the same firm for at least a decade.This could help explain the current labor shortage, especially in the restaurant, entertainment and hotel industries, which lost the most jobs during the pandemic and are now struggling to hire fast to meet brisk demand. Turnover is traditionally high in those sectors.All economic crises result in job losses. But the most striking difference during the pandemic is that a quarter of workers had a new employer a year after Covid-19 hit, said Bick and Blandin, who use a benchmark US Census Bureau population dataset as the basis of an online survey to collect labor data in real-time. That’s almost twice as large as the next highest rate, about 13% in 1997.“Generally, some amount of labor market churn is healthy because it indicates employers and workers alike feel confident they can find the right job and employee match,” said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the employment site Glassdoor. “However, churn is currently elevated due to the lingering hangover from the ongoing pandemic. We’re nowhere near a recovered labor market where workers are quitting out of confidence rather than need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-three-us-workers-changed-or-lost-jobs-in-past-year-101621015756845.html
14-05-2021||World||B.1.617 Covid variant, first detected in India, threatens UK reopening plans: PM||The UK will speed up its coronavirus vaccine program to combat a surge in cases of the India variant after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the new strain could derail his plan to end lockdown.Speaking in London, the premier announced the gap between first and second doses will be cut to eight weeks from 12 for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable. Anyone over 40 who hasn’t yet come forward for a shot will also be prioritized. While plans to allow people to mix indoors and travel overseas will go ahead from Monday, there is a real danger that the final stage of ending pandemic restrictions on June 21 could be delayed, Johnson said.“I have to level with you that this new variant could pose a serious disruption to our progress,” the premier at a press conference in London. “The race between our vaccination program and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter.”The grim assessment is a sobering moment for the UK which has been riding a wave of upbeat news on the success of its vaccine rollout, with two-thirds of adults now having received at least one dose.Danger AheadIt is also a political headache for the premier, who is facing opposition from members of Parliament his own Conservative party to any moves to delay unlocking the economy. Johnson has defended his “cautious” approach to ensure that lifting restrictions, saying he wanted each step to be “irreversible,” making the lockdown at the start of the year the country’s last.The number of confirmed infections of the India strain more than doubled in the past week to 1,313 from 520, according to Public Health England. There has been a particular cluster of cases in northwestern English towns of Bolton, Blackburn and Darwen.While there’s no evidence the India variant can evade vaccines, there are signs that it spreads more easily than the Kent mutation which ran rampant in the UK at the start of the year, prompting a third national lockdown.Advisers warned they expect the India strain to become dominant in the UK over time. There’s a “realistic possibility” that the new variant is 50% more transmissible than the current dominant strain of coronavirus, according to a paper released on Friday from the government’s scientific advisors.If that’s the case and the UK proceeds with its plans to unlock, it could “lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalization,” the document said.Johnson said the government expects to press ahead with the next phase of easing restrictions on Monday because the overall numbers of India cases are low. Monday’s relaxation in the rules will bring the return of international leisure travel, and the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors.But he warned that if the India strain is “significantly more transmissible we are likely to face some hard choices” about what happens next. He appealed to the public to continue to get tested for free twice a week and to stick to social distancing rules.“It’s very clear now we are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus as well for some time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/b1617-covid-variant-first-detected-in-india-threatens-uk-reopening-plans-pm-101621015186191.html

She told Goyal the US support for the waiver and text-based negotiations at the WTO is a part of the Biden-Harris administration’s “comprehensive effort to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution around the world”.Tai announced US support for the proposal last week under mounting pressure from other WTO member countries and democrats at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/access-to-covid-19-vaccines-india-us-hold-talks-on-waiver-at-wto-101621015080493.html

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticised the move by some rich countries to vaccinate lower risk groups, calling it a “moral catastrophe.” Dr Tedros highlighted that vaccine supply in lower- and lower-middle-income countries has not been enough to vaccinate even health care workers.“In January, I spoke about the potential unfolding of a moral catastrophe. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing this play out,” the WHO chief told a press briefing.“In a handful of rich countries, which bought up the majority of the vaccine supply, lower-risk groups are now being vaccinated,” he added, in a criticism apparently directed towards the United States which is now planning to vaccinate 12- to 15-year-olds.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday recommended expanded usage of Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds after the Food and Drug Administration authorised its emergency use for that age group. CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said in a statement that though most children with Covid-19 have mild or no symptoms, some children can get severely ill and require hospitalisation.“This official CDC action opens vaccination to approximately 17 million adolescents in the United States and strengthens our nation’s efforts to protect even more people from the effects of Covid-19,” the statement read.Also Read | Covid-19 pandemic to be 'far more deadly' this year, WHO warnsDr Tedros recalled how the health agency was labelled by some as alarmist when it warned about the threat of vaccine nationalism. The fact that so many health workers, who have been fighting the pandemic for more than a year, are still not immunised against the deadly virus is a “sad reflection on the gross distortion in access to vaccines across the globe,” he lamented.“I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to COVAX,” said the WHO director-general, adding that, at present, only 0.3% of vaccine supply is going to low-income countries.Dr Tedros termed the Covid-19 situation in India “hugely concerning” as several states continue to record a “worrying number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths.” He said that the UN health agency has shipped thousands of oxygen concentrators, tents for mobile field hospitals, masks and other medical supplies to help India in its fight against Covid-19. He went on to add that it’s not only India that has emergency needs as countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam are also dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-slams-countries-for-vaccinating-kids-urges-to-donate-jabs-to-poor-nations-101621010032631.html
14-05-2021||World||Covid-19 pandemic to be 'far more deadly' this year, WHO warns||World health experts issued a grim warning Friday that the second year of Covid-19 was set to be "far more deadly", as Japan extended a state of emergency amid growing calls for the Olympics to be scrapped."We're on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first," said the World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The mood also darkened in Japan where the coronavirus state of emergency took in another three regions just 10 weeks before the Olympics, while campaigners submitted a petition with more than 350,000 signatures calling for the Games to be cancelled.With Tokyo and other areas already under emergency orders until the end of May, Hiroshima, Okayama and northern Hokkaido, which will host the Olympic marathon, will now join them.The move to combat a fourth wave putting Japan's medical system under strain comes with public opinion firmly opposed to holding the Games this summer.Kenji Utsunomiya, once candidate for Tokyo governor, urged Games organisers to "prioritise life" over ceremony as he submitted the petition to capital authorities.The pandemic has killed at least 3,346,813 people worldwide since the virus first emerged in late 2019, according to an AFP tally of official data.There was bad news for Taiwan too with the capital indefinitely closing down entertainment venues, libraries and sports centres in the wake of an outbreak of infections first detected among pilots.The island has been a global leader in containing the pandemic, with just 1,290 confirmed cases and 12 deaths.Taipei's decision, effective from Saturday, covers bars, dance clubs, karaoke lounges, nightclubs, saunas and Internet cafés as well as hostess clubs and teahouses.- Sputnik vaccines reach India -India meanwhile started deploying Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, the first foreign-made shot to be used in the country that has been reeling from an explosion in cases and deaths.The first token batch of Sputnik vaccines -- reportedly 150,000 doses -- arrived on May 1 and a second delivery is expected in the next few days.A number of leading India-based drugmakers have agreements for local production of Sputnik V with the aim to produce over 850 million doses of the jab per year.India has been adding roughly as many new Covid cases daily as the rest of the world put together.More than 260,000 Indians have died, according to official figures.But in Europe, tourist hotspots are opening up.Greece kickstarted its tourism season on Friday, hoping to reverse last year's miserable summer."I hope to forget this damn Covid," said Jil Wirries, a 28-year old student from Hanover, Germany, collecting luggage on the island of Crete."Everything is terrible in Germany... people are depressed... I'm so happy to be here."France and Spain launched tourism campaigns this week too while Italy said Friday it was scrapping a quarantine requirement for visitors from the EU, Britain and Israel who test negative for the coronavirus.And in the US, the top health agency on Thursday said it was lifting mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people.- 'Milestone' -Biden declared a major victory in the battle against the virus that has seen more than 580,000 Americans die."I think it's a great milestone, a great day," he said.Some, however, said they would continue to wear their masks out of caution."I'm still going to wear a mask inside," said Mubarak Dahir, a 57-year-old tourist in the capital Washington, visiting from Florida. "I think it's premature, it's a little dangerous to believe that we are that far already."Almost 60 percent of US adults have now received one or more doses, while cases are falling fast, down to a seven-day-average of 38,000 or 11 per 100,000.And the US campaign to vaccinate adolescents aged 12-to-15 began Thursday in earnest following the authorisation of the Pfizer vaccine in this age group.But Friday, the WHO urged wealthy countries to stop vaccinating children and instead donate doses to poorer nations."I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to Covax," said WHO chief Tedros.- Portugal to let fans in -Covid continues to sow turmoil in the world of sport, with the May 29 Champions League Final between Manchester City and Chelsea shifted from Istanbul to Porto.Portugal announced Friday that British tourists and football fans will be allowed in.The Turkish Grand Prix, which was only drafted onto the Formula One calendar as a replacement for the cancelled Canada GP two weeks ago, was itself axed on Friday.Formula One chiefs announced they will instead return to the sport's safe haven of Austria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-to-be-far-more-deadly-this-year-who-warns-101621007473002.html
14-05-2021||World||US House panel reaches agreement to form bipartisan commission on January 6 riot||The top Democratic and Republican members of the House Homeland Security Committee have reached an agreement on legislation to form a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The measure had stalled amid partisan differences.Under the terms of the agreement announced Friday, the commission would have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, five from each party. It would have subpoena power and be charged with issuing a final report by Dec. 31, along recommendations to prevent future attacks.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the legislation could be considered by the House “as soon as next week,” along with a spending bill to pay for security improvements to the Capitol. Lawmakers are considering how to toughen security after hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters pushed past police on Jan. 6, broke in through windows and doors and sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives. The commission bill also needs Senate approval.For months, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been at odds over the scope and makeup of the commission with GOP leaders — including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell — saying the investigation should focus not just on the Jan. 6 insurrection, but also on violence after the death of George Floyd while in police custody.It’s unclear how many Republicans will vote for the commission. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said after the announcement that he had not read the details yet and did not signal whether he would support it.The insurrection is an increasingly fraught subject in the House GOP conference. While almost every Republican member condemned the violent mob that day, and many criticized Trump for his role in egging them on, a growing number of them have downplayed the attack as time has gone on. At a h earing investigating the siege this week, several members denied that there was an insurrection at all.The House impeached Trump one week after the insurrection for telling his supporters to “fight like hell” in a speech just before the attack. The Senate acquitted him in February.Like the 9/11 Commission that investigated the terrorist attacks on the U.S. a decade ago, the commission will granted authority to issue subpoenas to secure information to carry out its investigation, but it requires the agreement of both the chairman and vice chairman of the commission, or through a majority vote.“It is imperative that we seek the truth of what happened on January 6 with an independent, bipartisan 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack,” Pelosi said.House Homeland Security Chairman Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said lawmakers “owe it to the Capitol Police” to conduct a thorough investigation of the attack.“Inaction — or just moving on — is simply not an option," Thompson said. “The creation of this commission is our way of taking responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol."Thompson negotiated the bill with Republican John Katko of New York. Katko was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-panel-reaches-agreement-to-form-bipartisan-commission-on-january-6-riot-101621005392584.html
14-05-2021||World||Trump tightens grip on Republican party||Former US president Donald Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican party, engineering the election of an ally to a key leadership position in the House conference on Thursday as he plans, according to a report, to start addressing rallies next month.Elise Stefanik, a Trump ally, was easily elected chair of the House Republican conference with the strong backing of the former president. She will be the No 3 Republican in the House, replacing Liz Cheney, who was among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him in January and whose ouster was driven by the former president.“Congratulations to Elise Stefanik for her Big and Overwhelming victory!” Trump said. He had given her “complete” and “total” endorsement earlier and had reiterated support for her on Thursday, on election eve, and attacked her opponent Chip Roy.Since leaving office, the former president has sought to retain a tight grip on the Republican party, after fending off initial backlash triggered by his role in inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, which houses both chambers of the Congress. Critics and opponents have been forced to fall in line, such as Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican; or give up, such as Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican; or who have been ousted or sidelined, such as Cheney.Unlike past US presidents, who retire from public life mostly, Trump has kept himself in, through statements fired at the same rate as posts on Twitter and Facebook, before the social media platforms banished him. He has also done interviews on friendly TV networks such as Fox and Newsmax.And now New York Post, another supportive media outlet, has reported that Trump plans to start addressing his signature rallies, with two planned for June and on around July 4 holiday. His team is said to be working on the details of the venue and timing.Trump has not yet revealed his plans for another run for the White House, but he told a news publication last week that he is “enthused” by the possibility of it. His favourability ratings remain high among Republicans - at 82% and77%, according two recent polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tightens-grip-on-republican-party-101621005360244.html
14-05-2021||World||House Republicans elect Trump defender Elise Stefanik to No. 3 post after Liz Cheney's ouster||Republicans vaulted Rep. Elise Stefanik into the ranks of House leadership Friday, electing an ardent Donald Trump defender in hopes of calming their searing civil war over the deposed Rep. Liz Cheney's unremitting combat with the former president.Stefanik, R-N.Y., a moderate turned Trump loyalist who's given voice to many of his false claims about election fraud, was elected as expected to the No. 3 post that Cheney, R-Wyo., held for over two years.Backed by Trump and the House’s top two Republicans, Stefanik defeated challenger Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, by 134-46 in a secret ballot vote conducted behind closed doors. A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Roy was a prohibitive long shot whose candidacy seemed a signal to GOP leaders that hard-right Republicans expect a robust voice moving forward.Stefanik, 36, gives Republicans a chance to try changing the subject from the acrimonious fight over the defiant Cheney by installing a Trump loyalist — and one of the party’s relative handful of women in Congress — in a visible role.But GOP schisms are unlikely to vanish quickly. Many hard-right conservatives have misgivings about Stefanik’s centrist voting record, tensions remain raw over Trump’s taut hold on the party and Cheney’s rancorous ouster, and Cheney has said she will remain a vocal foe of Trump.Also Read | Liz Cheney faces blowback for vote to impeach TrumpAt a time when Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans are trying to pull the party away from him, Stefanik reaffirmed her view of his importance, underscoring his continued sway within the party.“Voters determine the leader of the Republican Party, and President Trump is the leader that they look to," she told reporters after the vote. She added, “He is an important voice in the Republican Party and we look forward to working with him.”Stefanik thanked her colleagues after her election, citing the Revolutionary War battlefield at Saratoga, New York, near her home. Describing themes similar to those Republicans often emphasize, Stefanik said Americans there fought for “liberty, freedom and a limited government,” according to a person who provided the comments on condition of anonymity.Trump issued a statement congratulating Stefanik, adding, “The House GOP is united and the Make America Great Again movement is Strong!"Roy had said he was running because Stefanik's voting record was too moderate and he didn't want Republicans to affirm the party leader's chosen candidate without a fight. After the vote, he downplayed GOP divisions.“We had a great spirited debate," he told reporters. He added, “Now we’re going to get busy, pointing out how the Democratic Party is destroying America.”Republicans booted Cheney out of leadership this week for repeatedly rebuking Trump for encouraging supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and for his lie that his 2020 reelection was stolen from him by fraudulent voting.She has defiantly said she will continue lambasting Trump, who remains potent within the GOP, and would work to defeat him should he mount a 2024 bid to return to the White House.Stefanik got an early start lining up votes to succeed Cheney, a decisive factor in leadership races. She’s also backed by Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., plus two of the House’s most influential conservatives: No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and an ambitious GOP force in her own right, was among 10 House Republicans who voted this year to impeach Trump for inciting the Capitol riot. Since then, she’s battled Trump often and many Republicans ultimately turned against her, arguing that the dispute was a damaging distraction.Stefanik has told colleagues she’d serve in the leadership job only through next year, according to a GOP lawmaker and an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity last week to discuss internal conversations. After that, she’d take the top GOP spot on the House Education and Labor Committee, which some consider a more powerful position because it can produce legislation on important issues.Stefanik is a four-term lawmaker from an upstate New York district that in the past four presidential elections backed both Trump and Barack Obama twice. She was a Trump critic during his 2016 campaign, calling his videotaped comments on sexually assaulting women “just wrong” and at times avoiding stating his name, local news reports said.Her voting record is among the most moderate of all House Republicans’, according to conservative groups’ ratings. She opposed Trump’s marquee 2017 tax cuts and his efforts to divert budget funds to build a wall along the Mexican border.She hurtled to GOP prominence — and Trump’s attention — by defending him in 2019 during his first impeachment over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to produce political dirt on Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender at the time.She has remained a Trump booster and joined him in casting doubt on the validity of the 2020 election, despite findings by judges and local officials that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Hours after the Capitol attack, she voted against formally approving Pennsylvania’s state-certified electoral votes.Trump reiterated his support for Stefanik and opposition to Roy on Thursday. Roy ran afoul of Trump in January when he voted to formally certify Trump’s Electoral College defeat, saying the Constitution left “no authority for Congress” to overrule states’ handling of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-gop-elects-trump-defender-elise-stefanik-to-no-3-leadership-position-101621003246756.html

Catherine Lacavera, V-P, Legal at Google, said in a blog post that a fair immigration system is necessary to preserve America’s “laudable history" of welcoming immigrants from different parts of the world and “to fuel a virtuous cycle of innovation.”“Unfortunately, an impending court case is putting both at risk at the most inopportune moment,” wrote Lacavera, an immigrant herself.The spouses of H-1B visa holders, a majority from India and China, receive H-4 visas and only in certain cases, they can apply for an employment authorization document. Earlier, the work permit was usually given to H-4 visa holders where their H-1B spouses were well on track to receive a permanent resident card, also known as a green card.Also Read | Lawsuit filed against delay in processing of EADs for H-1B spouses and L1 visasBut decades of backlog in green card prompted the Obama administration, in 2015, to introduce the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. It proved extremely useful for families struggling to survive on a single income. However, Save Jobs USA, a group of IT workers who claim they lost jobs to H-1B workers, filed a lawsuit the same year to end the issuing of H-4 EAD for such spouses of H-1B visa holders.The lawsuit was delayed as the previous administration, under President Donald Trump, considered rescinding the H-4 work rule. But the axe never came and the US department of homeland security (DHS) formally withdrew the move after President Joe Biden took office. Now both the plaintiffs and the Biden administration are seeking summary judgement in the case.Also Read | Biden administration to let H-1B spouses work: What it meansLacavera said that the H-4 EAD program provides work authorization to spouses of more than 90,000 H-1B visa holders, of which 90 per cent are women. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has already disproportionately impacted women and ending this program would only make things worse, she added.“To support this important program, we are leading an amicus brief with nearly 30 companies and organizations to preserve and protect the H-4 EAD program,” Lacavera announced, adding that it would otherwise hurt families and undercut the US economy at a critical moment.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said that the company is proud to support the immigrants working in the US. Taking to Twitter, Pichai, an immigrant from India, said that they have joined 30 other companies to protect a program that “spurs innovation, creates jobs and opportunities, and helps families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-leads-30-companies-to-preserve-work-permit-for-h-1b-spouses-101621001574707.html
14-05-2021||World||Russia declares independent media outlet VTimes 'foreign agent'||Russia's justice ministry on Friday declared online news outlet VTimes a "foreign agent" media organisation, a move that will require it to label itself as such and subject it to increased scrutiny by the authorities.VTimes was set up last year by a group of journalists who quit Vedomosti, a top Russian business newspaper, after accusing their new editor-in-chief of introducing pro-Kremlin censorship.VTimes and its publisher, Alexander Gubsky, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia uses the "foreign agent" designation to label foreign-funded organisations it says are engaged in political activity. The term carries negative Soviet-era connotations and subjects those designated to heightened bureaucratic scrutiny.It requires outlets to publish 24-word disclaimers saying their publications are distributed by a media outlet "fulfilling the function of a foreign agent".Last month Russia applied the label to Meduza, a popular independent news site, in a move the company says is destroying its business and hindering its ability to practise journalism.U.S. broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has also received the designation and has been fined heavily for flouting it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-declares-independent-media-outlet-vtimes-foreign-agent-101620996705581.html
14-05-2021||World||UK may ‘flex’ vaccine program to curb spread of coronavirus variant from India||The U.K. could speed up vaccinations in districts that have seen surges in Covid-19 infections linked to the highly transmissible India variant, in a bid to prevent the disease getting out of control again.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold a press conference at 5 p.m. Friday, with the focus expected to be on vaccinations and testing rather than imposing local lockdowns to contain outbreaks at this stage.Cases of the B.1.617.2 strain -- the variant that originated in India -- have risen to 1,313 from 520 over the past week, according to Public Health England. While there is no evidence it is able to evade the vaccines, PHE assessed it is “at least as transmissible” as the so-called Kent variant that took hold in December, precipitating the U.K.’s third lockdown in January.Johnson has vowed to proceed with easing the national lockdown in England from Monday, with people allowed to meet indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants. But the recent rise in infections could mean he is forced to delay plans to lift all legal limits on social contact on June 21.The premier said Thursday he is “anxious” about the spread of the variant.Tory ConflictAny slowing of the lockdown easing “roadmap” would risk putting Johnson into conflict with members of his own Conservative Party, who have been agitating for a faster reopening amid a vaccination program that’s one of the most advanced in the world.Surge testing is already being carried out in areas including Bolton, in northwest England, and parts of London. Local leaders in Greater Manchester and Lancashire have been calling for “surge vaccinations” to ensure younger people are protected.The government has repeatedly pointed to guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, which prioritizes older age groups over the young. The national program is currently reaching people in their late 30s.The Department for Health and Social Care said late Thursday ministers are considering bringing forward planned second vaccine doses for eligible groups.Rapid RolloutAt present, the U.K. allows for up to 12 weeks between first and second doses. Almost 36 million people have had their first dose, of whom almost 19 million have had a second dose. That leaves 17 million people whose second doses could be brought forward if the government decides to change policy.“While there is no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine, the speed of growth is concerning,” the department said. The government “will not hesitate to take further action if necessary,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement.That could include local restrictions or “flexing” the vaccination program, Zahawi told Sky News Friday. “But we think that the roadmap for Monday remains in place because the vaccines are delivering because they’re keeping people out of hospital.”From Monday, cinemas and theaters in England will also be allowed to reopen, and international holidays will no longer be illegal.Wales will also ease restrictions Monday, and people will be able to go on overseas holidays. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said his “strong advice” is that “this is the year to stay at home and enjoy all that Wales has to offer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-may-flex-vaccine-program-to-curb-spread-of-coronavirus-variant-from-india-101620996382975.html

The officials afflicted by Havana syndrome include US diplomats, spies and defence officials who were on overseas assignments.According to the US daily, three officers from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had reported serious symptoms since December 2020, requiring treatment at the Walter Reed military hospital in Washington. These health incidents first came to light in late 2016 when US embassy staff in Havana, Cuba, began to report an unusual set of symptoms, with some of the cases beginning with the sudden onset of loud noise.A year later, a US diplomat in the Chinese city of Guangzhou started experiencing unexplained symptoms, including headache and memory problems. The US State Department had requested the National Academy of Sciences to assess the cause and the latter came up with a report that suggested the mysterious head injuries were consistent with the use of directed microwave energy.“The committee felt that these acute symptoms were more consistent with a directed radio frequency (RF) energy attack, and explored possible related mechanisms,” the report said.The number of cases reported in the NYT is around 70 more than previously acknowledged. Quoting sources in the Pentagon, the report hinted at the possible involvement of Russian military intelligence agency GRU behind some of these episodes.Also Read | Mysterious injuries suffered by US diplomats in China, Cuba likely caused by microwave energy: StudyThe US lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee recently said that the cases appear to be increasing and the committee was investigating the suspected “directed" radio frequency attacks. The CIA has created a cell to collect more information on these suspected attacks.Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Marco Rubio, who led the committee, issued a statement late last month, saying the pattern of attacking "our fellow citizens serving our government appears to be increasing". The two senators noted that it was “important "to better understand the technology behind the weapon responsible for these attacks”, welcoming the renewed probe by the CIA."Ultimately we will identify those responsible for these attacks on American personnel and will hold them accountable," they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-confirm-130-cases-of-havana-syndrome-as-cia-probes-cause-report-101620992580555.html

To be honest, they don’t give a damn about the lives of these people, but the people of Glasgow do,” Aamer Anwar, a Pakistani-origin human rights lawyer, told ‘ITV News’.“This city is built on the backs of refugees, people who’ve given their blood, sweat and tears to build this city. We stand firmly with these men,” he said.Lakhvir Singh spoke in Punjabi about how he feared for what would happen when the officers took them into custody in the van and tearfully thanked the people of his neighbourhood for turning out to support them.The duo then walked down the street with Anwar towards the local mosque, with the estimated hundreds gathered cheering and clapping, waving placards that read “refugees are welcome”.Videos posted across the social media channels showed protesters chanting “Leave our neighbours, let them go” and “Cops go home” during the nearly eight-hour-long standoff.This is the moment that People Power forced the release of Sumit Sehdev and Lakhvir Singh.They were detained following a Home Office Immigration raid during Eid - with the power of solidarity and humanity the people of Glasgow mobilised and said NO pic.twitter.com/bDCKI0UwdF"The Home Office needs to ask itself hard questions after today. Doing this on Eid, in the heart of our Muslim community, and in the midst of a serious Covid outbreak was staggeringly irresponsible — but the even deeper problem is an appalling asylum and immigration policy,” said Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Twitter, who had appealed directly with the UK Home Office to stand down.A Home Office statement said the operation was “conducted in relation to suspected immigration offences”.Eventually, Police Scotland said it had to make an operational decision to protect the “safety, public health and well-being” and the two men were released on bail and returned home to their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-indian-men-freed-from-detention-van-after-protest-in-scotland-101620992544818.html
14-05-2021||World||Singapore moves back towards Covid-19 lockdown as cases surge||Singapore is returning to the lockdown-like conditions it last imposed a year ago, banning dining-in and limiting gatherings to two people, as a rising number of untraceable virus infections pressures one of the most successful places in the world at Covid containment.For four weeks from May 16 to June 13, gathering sizes as well as household visitors will be cut to a maximum of two people from five people now, working from home will be the default, and food places can only do takeaways and deliveries, the health ministry said in a statement on Friday. The resurgence is also putting a highly-anticipated travel bubble with Hong Kong in doubt.The Singapore dollar extended its decline after the announcement of the new rules. The city’s benchmark stock index bucked Asia’s positive trend to sink as much as 3.2%, the most since June last year, before ending 2.2% lower. Shares linked to travel and consumption were among the biggest losers, with bellwether Singapore Airlines Ltd. sliding as much as 7.3%.“A pattern of local unlinked community cases has emerged and is persisting,” the statement said. “We need to act decisively to contain these risks as any one leak could result in an uncontrolled resurgence of cases.”The country recorded 24 new virus cases locally on Friday, with more than half coming from a cluster originating from Changi Airport. The number of unlinked infections -- the most concerning to officials as they signal undetected spread in the community -- has risen to 15 in the past week from 7 in the week before, the health ministry had said Thursday.While the numbers are far smaller than ongoing outbreaks in countries like the US that are charging ahead with opening up, the flareup is a major setback by Singapore standards, as the city-state is one of handful of “Covid havens” that had previously nearly eliminated the pathogen domestically. These places are now struggling to find a path to re-open as their vaccination drives lag major western economies.The new rules are the most restrictive since Singapore went into a so-called circuit breaker partial lockdown in April last year, where schools and most workplaces were closed except for essential services and key economic sectors. Officials at a briefing on Friday emphasized the need to stay at home and only go out for absolutely necessary errands, and said they will review the measures after two weeks.New Rules Amid Upcoming Big EventsThe return to near-lockdown in Singapore puts in doubt high-profile global initiatives meant to showcase its control of the virus. An long-gestating air travel bubble with Hong Kong, set to start May 26, is now unlikely to go ahead on schedule. Singapore was also scheduled to host the Shangri-La Dialogue early next month, which organizers say they remain committed to, and the Davos-based World Economic Forum in August.The new rules Singapore will have for the next month include:Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Friday authorities are testing more intensively and trying to ring-fence transmissions, and the stricter restrictions are needed to stop more cases from happening. “The new measures will be difficult for everybody,” Lee said in his Facebook post.Hong Kong Travel BubbleOfficials in both cities have signaled that the highly anticipated bubble, first scheduled to start last November, will be delayed again in light of the outbreak in Singapore.Transport minister Ong Ye Kung said at a Friday briefing that it’s very likely that Singapore “may not meet the criteria” for the arrangements to go through; the government will make an announcement early next week on the bubble’s fate after reviewing local cases.According to the terms of the agreement, the travel bubble will be closed for two weeks if the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local cases is more than five in either city. It’s currently just above 2 in Singapore and near zero in Hong Kong.There’s a “high chance” the air travel bubble may not go ahead as scheduled, Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said Friday, citing Singapore authorities. Yau said he will speak to Singapore’s new transport minister S. Iswaran early next week.Job SupportGiven the new ban on dining-in, the Singapore government will increase job support subsidies for food and beverage firms as well as waive rental for one month for hawker stall and coffee shop tenants.It is also stepping up virus testing from May 15, and will start using rapid test kits for people with symptoms at health centers.On Thursday, the number of new local cases rose to 24, the highest since July last year. Changi Airport is now the single biggest cluster of Covid cases, with 46 linked to the aerodrome, raising fears that travelers have spread the pathogen to airport staff despite strict post-arrival quarantine regulations.The government closed the airport terminals and connecting Jewel shopping mall to the public for two weeks from May 13, though it remains open for air travel. It has also been testing workers in the facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-moves-back-towards-covid-19-lockdown-as-cases-surge-101620989676042.html
14-05-2021||World||Committed to open, stable supply chain of goods: China||Beijing on Friday said it is committed to an open and stable supply chain of goods, days after India’s Hong Kong envoy complained of high prices of medical supplies and snapping of regular freight flights from China.The Chinese foreign ministry did not comment on the disruption of freight flights from China to India but said the sudden surge in demand for medical equipment in India has also contributed to the rising prices of medical goods.The ministry’s response comes after Priyanka Chauhan, India’s consul general in Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) earlier this week that soaring prices of medical goods like much-in-demand oxygen concentrators and cargo flight disruptions were slowing supply arrivals from China to India.Chauhan said New Delhi’s expectation at this point is that the supply chain should remain open and product prices should remain stable. ‘China is committed to smooth global industrial and supply chains and hopes that all parties can work together to ensure stability of global industrial and supply chains instead of disrupting the openness and stability of these chains for political purposes,” ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said responding to a question on Chauhan’s comments.Hua’s comments on keeping the global supply chain open also comes in the backdrop of India keeping out Chinese companies including telecom giant Huawei from 5G trials, a move criticised by Beijing as discriminatory.On the issue of rising prices of medical goods being sourced from China, Hua said demand and the shortage of certain kinds of raw material were contributing to the price escalation.“Just taking oxygen concentrators as an example, the demand in India has soared by several times in just a short period of time and the raw materials are also in shortage. Further, the Indian side has also raised their demand through different channels, which has led to excessive demand in the market and driven up prices,” Hua said.“The Chinese manufacturers even have to import some of the raw materials from other countries. We have faced similar problems before. We hope all parties can work together to ensure openness and stability of the supply chains,’’ she said.India has a strong demand for raw and auxiliary material for vaccine production, she said, adding: “Since the beginning of this year Chinese companies have provided more than 10 tons to India and more than 20 tons are expected to be delivered in May and June.”China, she said, is concerned about the epidemic situation in India and feels for “…what the Indian people are going through. China was among the first countries to offer help and support to India”.“We have been encouraging and guiding our companies to facilitate India’s procuring of epidemic prevention materials. Many Chinese companies and NGOs have also been offering help to India in their own ways.”In April, China exported over 26,000 ventilations and oxygen concentrators to India, more than 15,000 monitors and nearly 3,800 tons of medicine materials and drugs.“The relevant Chinese companies have received orders from India for more than 70,000 oxygen concentrators and are stepping up their production for early delivery”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/committed-to-open-stable-supply-chain-of-goods-china-101620990659082.html
14-05-2021||World||As B1.617.2 Covid variant spreads rapidly in parts of UK authorities enhance vaccination, increase testing||The case numbers related to the B1.617.2 variant of Covid-19, first identified in India, have more than doubled within a week in the UK, resulting in further surge testing and enhanced vaccine measures to be deployed in parts of the country where the strain is beginning to spread “increasingly rapidly”.Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday that its latest analysis shows the number of cases of the highly transmissible variant first detected in Maharashtra has risen from 520 last week to 1,313 cases this week. Most cases are in the northwest of England, with some in London, and additional measures are being put in place to "rapidly break chains of transmission".UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the health authorities are monitoring the situation “very carefully” and will not hesitate to take further action if necessary, indicating that the roadmap to lifting all lockdown measures from June 21 may have to be reassessed.“This data demonstrates why our swift and decisive measures are in place. Everyone has a part to play in controlling this variant, from participating in surge testing, to following the rules, to getting the jab,” said Hancock.“We are committed to working with local areas and deploying our world-leading genomic sequencing to get this variant under control. We are supporting areas where the cases of this variant are rising,” he said.The minister said it is imperative that people who live in one of the 15 areas currently covered by surge testing processes get a free PCR test and everyone who’s eligible needs to come forward and get their vaccine.PHE said that while there is no “firm evidence” yet to show this variant has any greater impact on the severity of disease or that it evades vaccines, the "speed of growth is concerning".UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the authorities are looking at how to best utilise the vaccine roll-out to protect the most vulnerable in the context of the current epidemiology, including the possibility of bringing forward the second doses for the most vulnerable in some of the most affected areas.Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, one of the hotspots of the variant, has also called for a speeding up in the age eligibility criteria for vaccines in the affected areas. The National Health Service (NHS) is now offering a jab to all over the age of 38.“Cases of this variant are rising in the community and we are continuously monitoring its spread and severity to ensure we take rapid public health action,” said Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 Strategic Response Director at PHE.“Testing and isolating when required not only limits spread, it helps us to better understand how the variant behaves in the community which is vital to taking effective and proportionate action moving forward…"The way to limit the spread of all variants is the same. Keep your distance, wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, cover your nose and mouth when inside, keep buildings well ventilated and meet people from other households outside,” she said.The variant was confirmed as a "Variant of Concern" by PHE on May 7 after a rise in cases and evidence of spread in some areas. Since then across the northwest of England, significant work is underway with local councils and partners.In Bolton, mobile testing units have been deployed and door to door PCR testing has been offered to 22,000 residents. A vaccine bus has been established in the heart of the community to increase vaccine uptake as part of a wider drive.PCR testing, whole genome sequencing and enhanced contact tracing are being used throughout London to target the many small dispersed clusters. All positive tests in London with a high enough viral load are also being prioritised for genomic sequencing to check for variants, and surge testing can begin immediately if it is needed.Taking this community-led approach has already proved effective in reducing transmission of variants in London to date, PHE said.To help identify variant cases, surge testing is being deployed in 15 areas across England to suppress transmission, with more than 800,000 additional PCR test kits distributed.According to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), over 4,400 cases and over 14,000 close contacts have been traced and instructed to self-isolate.Over 200 existing test sites and 130 schools have distributed test kits, with Mobile Testing Units deployed to provide PCR testing for people without symptoms.The public is also being urged to continue to take up the offer of two free rapid tests a week, to help identify asymptomatic cases. Anyone who does test positive in this way should take a follow-up PCR test, which can be sent for genome sequencing to help catch new variant cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-b1-617-2-covid-variant-spreads-rapidly-in-parts-of-uk-authorities-enhance-vaccination-increase-testing-101620985970267.html
14-05-2021||World||‘Amazing’: Pilots, passenger uninjured after two planes collide midair||The pilot of an airplane that collided with another midair near Denver requested emergency landing for engine failure, not knowing that his plane was nearly ripped in half, according to air traffic control audio. Miraculously, both planes landed and no one was hurt, officials said.The planes were getting ready to land at a small regional airport in a Denver suburb on Wednesday when they collided, according to the National Transportation Safety Board and South Metro Fire Rescue.The pilot that requested emergency landing was the only person aboard a twin-engine Fairchild Metroliner that landed at Centennial Airport despite major damage to its tail section. The plane is owned by a Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which operates cargo aircraft.“Looks like the right engine failed so I’m gonna continue my landing here,” the pilot said in an audio clip with air traffic control.The second plane, a single-engine 2016 Cirrus SR22, was rented by Independence Aviation, the company said in a statement. Its pilot successfully deployed an airframe parachute system designed by Cirrus Aircraft to slow the craft’s descent after a collision.The Cirrus plane had a pilot and one passenger on board when the pilot deployed a red-and-white parachute and drifted down to a safe landing in a field near homes in Cherry Creek State Park, Arapahoe County sheriff’s Deputy John Bartmann said.“Every one of these pilots needs to go buy a lottery ticket right now,” Bartmann said. “I don’t remember anything like this — especially everybody walking away. I mean that’s the amazing part of this.”The National Transportation Safety Board has four people investigating the accident, the federal agency said in a statement.“We are working to understand how and why these planes collided,” said John Brannen, lead NTSB investigator for the accident. “It is so fortunate that no one was injured in this collision.”As of Thursday, Brannen had interviewed both pilots and an NTSB air traffic control specialist had listened to recordings from air traffic control. They plan to interview the air traffic controllers who worked with both pilots, according to the statement.NTSB said it will publish a preliminary report in the next two weeks but it expects the entire investigation to take 12 to 18 months.The Independence-operated Cirrus had departed Centennial at 9:21 a.m. Wednesday, flew northward near Fort Collins and was returning to Centennial when the collision occurred.The Key Lime Air cargo flight took off from Salida, a city more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) southwest of Denver, at 9:56 a.m. and landed at Centennial at 10:25 a.m.June Cvelbar told the KUSA TV station that she witnessed the collision while walking in a state park.“I saw two planes in the sky. I saw a larger green plane, which I thought was a tow plane, along with what I thought was a glider being towed by it. I heard a noise but didn’t realize that the two planes had collided," she told KUSA in an email.Cvelbar said she saw the green plane fly off and shortly after saw the smaller plane deploy its parachute. She said she initially thought it was a training exercise.“When I realized that the small plane was going down I ran toward it. The pilot and his passenger were up and about,” Cvelbar said.Shelly Whitehead told KCNC-TV that she was in her kitchen when she heard a loud bang that sounded like a firecracker. She ran out onto her patio and saw the plane that deployed the parachute coming down in the field behind her house.“I thought, ‘Is it somebody just jumping out of a plane?’ And then I realized the parachute was attached to a plane,” she said. “I thought for sure they weren’t going to make it out of there.”Both Key Lime Air, a passenger and cargo charter company, and Independence Aviation, a flight school and aircraft rental firm that owns the Cirrus airplane, are based outside Centennial Airport, one of the busiest general aviation airports in Colorado.Authorities did not immediately identify the people who were in the planes.“At this time, we are allowing the NTSB and FAA to conduct their investigation,” said a statement issued by Derek Severns of the Cirrus Platinum Training Center, a pilot training center.The National Transportation Safety Board said on Twitter that it was sending staff to investigate. Key Lime Air will cooperate with the investigation, the company said in a statement.Federal Aviation Administration records show aircraft operated by Key Lime Air have been involved in three fatal crashes.In 2016, a Key Lime Air charter plane on a nighttime flight from Panama City, Florida, to Albany, Georgia, crashed after possibly breaking up in midair as the lone pilot on board tried to navigate severe weather near Camilla, Georgia.In 2001, a Key Lime Air flight crashed about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the southern Colorado town of Pagosa Springs, killing two people on board.In 2000, two pilots aboard a Key Lime Air Piper were killed after crashing near Kiowa, Colorado, southeast of Denver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazing-pilots-passenger-uninjured-after-two-planes-collide-midair-101620984930446.html

The CPN-UML is the largest party with 121 seats in the 271-member House of Representatives.At present 136 votes are needed to form a majority government.If the parties fail to form a new government in line with Article 76 (5) or the Prime Minister elected under this provision does not secure the vote of confidence again, the sitting Prime Minister can recommend the President to dissolve the parliament and announce the date to hold general elections within the next six months.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kp-sharma-oli-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-of-nepal-101620984258300.html

It will be the first passenger flight between the two countries since Australia imposed a travel ban on April 30.Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell said “a number” of passengers booked to fly would not board the flight in New Delhi on Friday because they had tested positive for COVID-19.“I’m disappointed, as are those Australians who will not be on today’s flight,” O’Farrell told Australian Broadcasting Corp.“My team across India has worked hard to assist them, to get bookings on this flight, because they are vulnerable,” O’Farrell added.There are 10,000 Australian citizens and permanent residents registered with Australian authorities in India as wanting to come home. Almost 1,000 were classified as vulnerable and the Australian government was giving them priority.More than 40 of the passengers booked on the first flight out tested positive to the virus and around 30 had been rejected because they were considered close contacts, said an Australian official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.Nine Network News reported that 48 had tested positive and 24 would be left behind because they were considered close contacts.The flight will land on Saturday in the northern Australian city of Darwin from where the passengers will be taken to a remote quarantine camp.O'Farrell said the empty seats could not be filled because of the strict health checks that Australia is imposing.“We're in the middle of a COVID crisis here in India and it takes at least 24 hours if not longer to get the results of a test,” O'Farrell told Nine.“So the idea of being able to have people that could quickly take the place is a bit harder than it seems,” he added.O’Farrell said the rejected passengers would be eligible for future flights once they get health clearances.The Australian government plans to fly the next repatriation flight on May 23. Six government-chartered flights, each with a 150-passenger capacity, are expected to return Australians from India before the end of May.Australia doesn’t expect scheduled international flights to return to normal until mid-2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-passengers-scheduled-to-arrive-in-australia-from-india-grounded-101620983738123.html
14-05-2021||World||Diplomats, donors concerned about sex abuse reports at WHO||British, European and American diplomats and donors have voiced serious concerns about how the World Health Organization handled sex abuse allegations involving its own staff during an outbreak of Ebola in Congo, as reported this week by The Associated Press.On Tuesday, the AP published an investigation documenting that senior WHO management was informed of multiple sex abuse allegations involving at least two of its doctors during the epidemic in 2018.A notarized contract obtained by the AP showed that two WHO staffers signed off on an agreement between WHO’s Dr. Jean-Paul Ngandu and a young woman he allegedly impregnated in Congo. In it, Ngandu promised to pay the young woman money, cover her pregnancy costs and buy her a plot of land. The contract was made “to protect the integrity and reputation of the organization,” Ngandu said.“The U.K. has a zero tolerance approach when it comes to sexual exploitation and harassment — and that extends to all international organizations that we fund,” said Simon Manley, the U.K.’s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva. “We are speaking with WHO and other major donors as a matter of urgency to establish the facts." Britain is WHO's second biggest donor, after the U.S.The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment.Also Read | WHO chief Tedros says will work with member states on panel findingsWHO has declined to comment on the specific allegations reported by the AP and said it is waiting for the results of a panel created last October to investigate sexual abuse during the Congo outbreak involving WHO staffers.“What’s alarming is that WHO seems to be keeping this abuse quiet and not publicly condemning these allegations,” said Clare Wenham, an assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, who has studied gender and funding issues at WHO. “There's a lot of talk about giving WHO more money but I don't think any government should be committing to that until we know it's an organization we can trust."The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the agency's third-largest funder, said it expects U.N. agencies to conduct thorough investigations into sexual abuse as quickly as possible.“Our role as a funder is to hold organizations that receive grants from the foundation to the highest standards of transparency and accountability, and to insist that they take steps to prevent misconduct in the future,” the foundation said.Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said the ultimate responsibility for WHO’s Ebola response lies with director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The AP found that one of the doctors accused of sexual harassment, Boubacar Diallo, bragged about his relationship to Tedros, who mentioned Diallo during a speech in January 2019. The AP spoke with three women who said Diallo offered them WHO jobs in exchange for sex; Diallo denied the claims.“I find it hard to believe Tedros would have known about these allegations and done nothing,” Gostin said. “The (director-general) must meet the highest ethical standards so we must understand what he knew and when he knew it. ... Dr. Diallo may have used his relationship with Tedros as leverage in sexual exploitation, but it would not be Tedros’ fault if he wasn’t aware of it.”Gostin said WHO staffers who were aware of sexual misconduct claims but failed to act should be punished.Balazs Ujvari, a spokesman for the European Commission, said it would “thoroughly monitor the investigations” by the AP. He said the commission is ready to review or suspend funding "for any partner who is not living up to the required high ethical and professional rules and standards.” Last year, the European Commission gave WHO about 114 million euros ($138 million).The World Bank said it is “deeply concerned” about the new sex abuse allegations at WHO. The bank paused its negotiations with Congolese authorities for new financing to agencies, including WHO, last year when reports of general sex abuse during the Ebola outbreak surfaced.“We review our relationship with any organization whose standards are in question,” the World Bank said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diplomats-donors-concerned-about-sex-abuse-reports-at-who-101620982290616.html

The incidence rate had peaked at nearly 170 in late April.Some German states have already begun easing restrictions, and others are likely to follow in the coming days, if infections remain at this level. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s controversial lockdown law, which mandated tougher restrictions for most of the country, allows curbs to be loosened if the incidence rate falls below 100 for five consecutive days.With infections falling and immunizations accelerating, German authorities have become increasingly optimistic that Europe’s largest economy can relax limits on movement, including reopening outdoor dining and easing restrictions on non-essential stores. The country has already widened privileges for people who have been fully vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-curbs-set-to-ease-after-covid-cases-fall-below-key-level-101620975906113.html
14-05-2021||World||Origins of Covid-19 need to be investigated further, leading scientists say||The origin of the novel coronavirus is still unclear and there is not yet enough evidence to say conclusively if it occurred naturally or was caused by a laboratory leak, a group of leading scientists said in a letter.The novel coronavirus, which emerged in China in late 2019, has killed 3.34 million people, cost the world trillions of dollars in lost income and upended daily life for billions of people."More investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic," said the 18 scientists, including Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge and Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center."Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable," the scientists including David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford, said in a letter to the journal Science.The authors of the letter said the World Health Organization's initial investigation into the origins of the virus had not made a "balanced consideration" of the theory that it may have come from a laboratory incident."We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data," the scientists said, adding that an intellectually rigorous and dispassionate investigation needed to take place."In this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus—often at great personal cost."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/origins-of-covid-19-need-to-be-investigated-further-leading-scientists-say-101620973107605.html
14-05-2021||World||‘Covid Zero’ havens find reopening harder than taming coronavirus||A smattering of places, mainly across the Asia Pacific region, have seen breathtaking victories in the battle against Covid-19 by effectively wiping it out within their borders. Now they face a fresh test: rejoining the rest of the world, which is still awash in the pathogen.In some ways, the success of “Covid Zero” locations is becoming a straitjacket. As cities like New York and London return to in-person dealmaking and business as usual -- tolerating hundreds of daily cases as vaccination gathers pace -- financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong risk being left behind as they maintain stringent border curbs and try to stamp out single-digit flareups.After a brutal 18 months that claimed 3.3 million lives worldwide, nations like China, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand have suffered fewer deaths during the entire pandemic than many countries, even highly vaccinated ones, continue to log in a matter of days.That achievement has allowed people to have largely normal lives for much of the past year. Some haven’t even had to wear masks. But sustaining this vaunted status has also required stop-start lockdown cycles, near-blanket bans on international travel and strict quarantine policies. The few travelers permitted to enter have had to spend weeks in total confinement, unable to leave a hotel room.Now that mass inoculation drives are allowing other parts of the world to normalize and open up to international travel, experts and residents are starting to question whether walling off from Covid is worth the trade-off, if implemented long-term.“The whole world is not going to be Covid Zero,” said Rupali Limaye, director of behavioral and implementation science at the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. “That’s not an option here.”Aggressive reactions to tiny caseloads may seem overblown to observers in countries facing thousands of infections a day, but the aim is to snuff out coronavirus before more disruptive restrictions like months-long lockdowns are needed -- and largely the strategy has worked. Still, the slower pace of vaccination in these places, and the threat of new variants, has meant that measures have become more and more onerous.New York currently logs 95 new daily cases per million people, and the U.S. has just lifted its mask mandate for those vaccinated. Singapore found just 4.2 new cases per million on Thursday, boosting locally acquired cases to the highest level since July last year, and is returning to restrictions it last imposed a year ago, banning dining-in and limiting gatherings to two people. The resurgence is also putting its highly-anticipated travel bubble with Hong Kong in doubt.Meanwhile, Taiwan recorded 16 local cases on Wednesday -- a daily record high -- and promptly restricted access to gyms and other public venues. In Hong Kong, anyone living in the same building as a person infected with a new Covid variant was required to spend as much as three weeks in government isolation until the policy changed last week. Australia has said that it likely won’t open its international borders until the second half of 2022.“Because we have been so successful, we are even more risk-averse than we were before,” said Peter Collignon, a professor of infectious diseases at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra.“We are very intolerant of letting any Covid come into the country,” he said. “The fear has almost gotten out of proportion to what the risk is.”Paying the PriceContinued isolation is the price these places will have to pay to maintain this approach in the longer term, as other parts of the world learn to tolerate some infections as long as medical systems aren’t overwhelmed.Most experts agree that the virus is unlikely to disappear completely. Instead, it is expected to become endemic, meaning it will circulate at some level without sparking the deadly outbreaks seen since late 2019.To maintain zero infection rates, these economies will have to implement measures that are harsher and more strict, said Donald Low, professor at the Institute of Public Policy of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.“This is neither wise nor tenable for much longer,” he said. “All this puts the places that have done well to suppress Covid-19 so far at a serious disadvantage as their societies -- not having been exposed to the possibility of Covid-19 becoming endemic -- are not willing to accept any relaxation of measures that may put their health at risk.”Meanwhile, many countries -- particularly those in the west that are awash in vaccines -- are starting to reopen.Travelers from England and Scotland will be permitted to visit a dozen countries without quarantining from 17 May. In the U.S., where about 35,000 people were diagnosed with the virus on May 12, the strict quarantine rules that prevented the import of the pathogen to Covid Zero countries never existed. Most states are starting to lift their pandemic restrictions and 25 have removed them completely.For Hong Kong and Singapore, the drawbacks of maintaining an elimination strategy as financial centers like London and New York City re-open may be significant. As aviation hubs and financial centers, both cities’ economies are particularly reliant on travel, compared to export-led economies such as China and Australia that can stomach being shut for longer. In 2019, Hong Kong was the world’s most popular city with international visitors -- even after months of political unrest -- while Singapore came in fourth place. London was at No. 5 and New York at No. 11.Vaccination LagA major obstacle to reopening is the slow vaccine rollout in these Covid havens, due to a combination of supply limitations and citizens’ lack of urgency about fronting up for shots.China has administered enough vaccinations for about 12% of its population. In Australia, the figure is 5% and in New Zealand, just 3%. Meanwhile, more than one-third of the U.S. -- and more than one quarter of the U.K. -- is fully protected, as those countries’ failure to mitigate the spread of Covid meant vaccination was prioritized.In places with very few infections, the public hasn’t developed the searing fear of the virus that emerged in the U.S., Europe, India and Brazil, where many families were cut off from dying loved ones or left unable to visit elderly relatives in care facilities.In fact many residents fear the vaccine more than the virus. Reports of routine side effects including fever and injection-site pain, as well as rare and potentially deadly complications like blood clots, have put people off. The lack of an immediate threat from Covid means some people would rather wait until the vaccines are more progressed.New VariantsNot everyone agrees that elimination can’t be pursued long-term. For Michael Baker, professor of public health at the University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand, the approach’s benefits are evident in how deaths in the country -- from any cause -- actually dropped in 2020.“The evidence is overwhelming for zero Covid if you can achieve it,” he said. “If there had been the commitment to having elimination as the first option, we may have been able to eliminate it entirely and avoided this global disaster.”He’s still hopeful that the strategy will be more broadly adopted with the help of vaccination, so that coronavirus will follow the measles model rather than an endemic one.“With the measles approach, you largely stop outbreaks in every country that has high coverage,” he said.Nonetheless, Covid havens face a growing dilemma. If vaccinations don’t pick up pace, they risk being stuck in a perpetual cycle, unable to move past the pandemic.“If their vaccination rates are low, that further jeopardizes their ability to open up,” Low said. “If so, the earlier ‘victory’ of these places over Covid-19 would have been a Pyrrhic one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-zero-havens-find-reopening-harder-than-taming-coronavirus-101620971213618.html
14-05-2021||World||Myanmar junta declares martial law in town after attacks on bank, police||Myanmar's junta has declared martial law in a town in Chin State after blaming "armed terrorists" for attacks on a police station and a bank, state media reported on Friday, amid an upsurge in fighting between the military and ethnic rebels in border areas.In the face of widespread opposition, the junta has struggled to retain order amid daily protests in cities and fighting in border states since overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi to end tentative steps towards democracy.The unrest in the town of Mindat on Wednesday and Thursday involved about 100 people using homemade guns to attack a police station and about 50 targeting the Myanmar Economic Bank, the state Myanmar News Agency reported.It said that the security forces had repelled the attack without suffering any casualties.A document declaring the imposition of martial law in the town in Chin State, which borders India, was posted in The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state newspaper.Reuters could not independently confirm the state media reports on the situation in Mindat.But a document posted on social media by local media claiming to be from a rival anti-junta administration in the Mindat area said the declaration of martial law was invalid.It also said that the fighting was triggered by the army breaking a promise to release seven civilians detained during recent protests.A spokesman for the Chinland Defence Force, a newly formed militia, said it was behind the latest fighting and confirmed the authenticity of the document."They (the junta) can no longer rule the city except in some areas where they have bases. They have no control in the rural areas," said the spokesman, who said that one fighter from the force was killed and that clashes were continuing with the army bringing in reinforcements.A spokesman for the junta could not immediately be reached for comment.In a further sign of continuing defiance of military rule, video on social media showed pro-democracy supporters chanting "We believe that we gonna win, we must win, we must win" as they marched in Myanmar's commercial hub of Yangon on Friday.With 788 people killed in a brutal suppression of protests by security forces, according to an advocacy group, some supporters of the ousted government have sought military training with insurgents that have battled the military for decades in border regions.Reuters is unable to independently verify casualties and the military has imposed restrictions on the media, internet services and satellite broadcasts.Fighting has intensified in some border areas since the Feb. 1 coup, with ethnic militias stepping up attacks, overrunning military posts and downing a military helicopter.Formed a week ago by the National Unity Government opposed to the generals, a group called the People's Defence Forces has enlisted support from ethnic armed groups that have long regarded Mynamar's military as their greatest foe.Called to arms since the coup, their fighters have ambushed security forces and assassinated junta-appointed administrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-declares-martial-law-in-town-after-attacks-on-bank-police-101620970147154.html
14-05-2021||World||Air Canada extends suspension of flights to India till June 22||While the 30-day ban on flights from India over Covid-19 surge announced by Canada is due to end next week, Air Canada’s suspension of services will continue till the third week of June.Air Canada is now only accepting booking beginning in late June, as a spokesperson for the airline told Global News that they “have further extended the suspension of flights from India until June 22”.“We did this in anticipation of the existing suspension of flights between the two countries being extended,” the spokesperson added.Prior to the suspension, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi in an air corridor arrangement that came into place last summer.The move in April by the Canadian Government was precipitated by increasing pressure upon it to act on this matter after multiple cases of the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 detected in India were reported in Canada.While that will expire on May 21, it is unlikely to be lifted immediately by Transport Cabana, the department handling aviation, due to the continuing surge in coronavirus cases in India, and mounting demand from provincial governments in Canada to even restrict domestic air travel.Transport Canada had issued its directive last month to “suspend all commercial and private passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days, effective 23.30 EDT April 22, 2021”.Meanwhile, passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey.A statement released by Transport Canada, the ministry responsible for aviation, said, “These measures will help manage the elevated risk of imported cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern into Canada during a time of increasing pressure on our health care system.”Since that ban came into effect, there have been continued reports of infections detected aboard flights originating in the United States, Europe, China, Japan, Central America, the Middle East, and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-canada-extends-suspension-of-flights-to-india-till-june-22-101620969477538.html
14-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada considers B.1.617 as a ‘variant of concern’||Days after the World Health Organization (WHO) designated it a variant of concern or VOC, Canadian health authorities are now considering the B.1.617 mutation of Covid-19 in the same category.The variant, which was first detected in India, was added to the Public Health Agency of Canada’s VOC list on Thursday.In its Outbreak Update, the agency said that it was “following the variants of concern first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1) and India (B.1.617)”. It added, “Monitoring for genetic changes in the virus allows us to better understand the potential impact of the mutations.”In a statement issued on Thursday, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam noted the WHO earlier this week based on “increased negative impacts compared to other circulating virus variants”.She said, “Early findings of the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group indicate that this variant appears to have higher rates of transmission; as well, preliminary evidence suggests the variant may be associated with reduced effectiveness to some Covid-19 treatments.”Tam also noted that VOCs “can be associated with more severe illness and increased risk of death”.She pointed that out that such variants now represent “a majority” of Covid-19 cases in Canada, and the UK variant is present in all provinces and territories and accounts for more than 95% of VOCs sequenced to date.However, she added that “regardless of which variants are circulating, vaccination, in combination with public health and individual measures work to reduce spread”.She said that Canada has so far recorded 28 cases of adverse reactions related to the AstraZeneca vaccine, involving blood clots (thrombosis) with low levels of blood platelets.As some Canadian provinces, led by Ontario, have paused administration of the vaccine for first doses, Tam said that while generally, vaccine series are completed with the same vaccine, in some cases, they can be completed with a different one.She said that it “may be possible that using a different vaccine type could result in a greater immune response, providing broader protection against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-considers-b-1-617-as-a-variant-of-concern-101620967737386.html
14-05-2021||World||Imperative for India to collaborate with other countries on Covid vaccine: Fauci||Dr Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration's top medical adviser on Thursday (local time) said that it is imperative for India to collaborate with other countries, and companies to ramp up its vaccine production capability to vaccinate country's huge population against Covid-19.Calling India as one of the best vaccine producer in the world, the leading American infectious disease expert said,"It's a very very large country with a population of about 1.4 billion people, you only have a couple of percentage of the people who are fully vaccinated and over about 10 per cent or so that have at least one dose so you've got to work out arrangements with other countries, other companies at the same time as ramping up your own capability of making vaccines because as we all know, India is one of the best if not the biggest vaccine producer in the world."As several countries have announced support for India's response to a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections that has hit healthcare facilities across the country, Dr Fauci told ANI in an exclusive interview: "There was the immediate issue that needs to be addressed as taking care of the people that are already infected. Getting better supplies of oxygen, oxygen cylinders, oxygen generators, PPEs, therapies like Remdesivir and things like that; the things that the US has helped with, but then probably in the intermediate and long run, you've got to figure out a way how to get as many vaccinations, administered to the people of India as possible."Noting that the B.1.617 mutant first detected in India has been found in over 40 countries including the US, he said, "in the ongoing crisis, the rich countries have a moral responsibility to assist those countries that don't have the capability of doing that, particularly the low and middle-income countries."Dr Fauci, who is the Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is also the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden.Regarding the use of vaccine passports in post-pandemic travel, the infectious diseases expert said that they are not going to be mandated by the US government, is likely not to go forward with them, but also noted that several airlines may say that they will not include persons who don't have vaccination verification.Speaking on resuming travel with India, Fauci told ANI: "It is really going to depend on the level of infection right now. India has a very very high level of infection and that would mean that it would be very very difficult to resume travel there right now."India is currently dealing with a second COVID-19 wave that has swept through the nation, straining the country's health infrastructure and overburdening frontline medical workers.Several countries around the globe including the UK, Russia, and the US have extended support to India as it continues to struggle with the increase in its health infrastructure needs.The Union Health Ministry on Thursday informed that 17.72 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in India till now."Ten states account for 66.73 per cent of the cumulative doses given so far in the country. More than 34 lakh beneficiaries of age group 18-44 vaccinated under Phase-3 of Vaccination Drive," said Joint Secretary of Union Health Ministry Lav Agarwal.The country had started the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16 with two vaccines -- Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).The vaccination drive for those between 18 and 45 years of age started in many parts of the country from May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imperative-for-india-to-collaborate-with-other-countries-on-covid-vaccine-fauci-101620959258647.html
14-05-2021||World||Chinese firm's Covid-19 drug claims draw scientists' skepticism||Chinese biotech firm Kintor Pharmaceutical Limited [9939.HK] saw its stock price jump by more than 20% the day after it announced on April 25 that it had "completed the first patient enrollment and dosing" in a late-stage U.S. clinical trial of its experimental COVID-19 treatment.It was the company's latest announcement about the progress of the drug, Proxalutamide. The Hong Kong-listed company's stock price has nearly quadrupled since March 1 as some analysts wrote about the big sales potential for a COVID-19 treatment. Kintor has seen its market capitalization soar to HK$23.4 billion ($3 billion) from HK$6.6 billion ($850 million) on March 1.But the company had not dosed any patients at all as of early May, according to the doctor Kintor identified as its principal clinical trial investigator in documents it posted on a U.S. trials website. The doctor - California-based gastroenterologist Zeid Kayali - also told Reuters he was "not in charge" of the trial, contradicting what the company had said in the documents describing the study. Kayali declined further comment, referring questions to Kintor.Told of Kayali's comments, Kintor Chief Financial Officer Lucy Lu said Kayali was merely one of its trial investigators. She declined further comment on the firm's announcement on patient dosing. Lu declined as well to name a different principal investigator, or the institution overseeing the trial, calling that information "confidential."Companies are not obligated to release such information. But many pharmaceutical firms routinely provide details about who is leading their clinical trial and which research organization or medical institution is responsible for ensuring patient safety and scientific validity.Kintor's lack of transparency, along with inconsistencies in the company's statements, raise a "red flag" about the company's claims, said Stephen Ostroff, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief scientist and two-time acting FDA commissioner.Another red flag: Kintor has repeatedly touted a Brazilian study of Proxalutamide that claimed an effectiveness rate so high that Ostroff and other pharmaceutical specialists say it is hard to believe.The Brazil study said Proxalutamide showed a 92% reduction in mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which Ostroff said would be "breathtakingly extraordinary" if true.Alexandre Cavalcanti, director of Sao Paulo's HCor Research Institute, called a presentation of the study's findings by its authors "amateur" and said its claimed reduction of mortality risk is too high to be credible in light of a global struggle to find effective COVID-19 treatments.STOCK GETS A BOOSTProxalutamide does not have regulatory approvals and is not available for sale. The Brazil study of the drug has not been peer-reviewed or published, but the authors released a short presentation of its results during a March news conference. Kintor promoted their findings."Based on the positive results ... we expect Proxalutamide could become an important tool in the global fight against COVID-19," Kintor's Chief Executive Tong Youzhi said in a statement announcing the Brazilian results on March 11.That same day, Kintor's stock price jumped by nearly 9%.Lu, Kintor's CFO, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about the criticisms of the Brazil study and Kintor's claims about its U.S. trial.One of the study's authors, Brown University dermatology professor Carlos Wambier, dismissed its critics and called its results "very encouraging."In an April 2 client note, analysts from Beijing-based brokerage China Renaissance cited Kintor's progress reports as evidence of the "potentially wider application of Proxalutamide." They gave the stock a "buy" recommendation and set a target price of HK$50.75. Kintor's stock now trades at about HK$66, having reached a record high HK$82 in late April."The stock price is majorly driven by the COVID-19-related clinical progress," said Sam Hu, analyst at CMB International in Hong Kong.One of the study's authors is a consultant hired by a Brazilian Health Ministry official who is an ally of the country's President Jair Bolsonaro. The president is a vaccine skeptic and a critic of masks and lockdowns who has promoted discredited COVID-19 remedies such hydroxychloroquine. The health official, Helio Angotti, assigned a team of consultants to find evidence to support Bolsonaro's unfounded medical claims.Angotti declined to comment. Bolsonaro's office did not respond to written questions from Reuters. The consultant who co-authored the Proxalutamide study, Ricardo Zimerman, did not respond to requests for comment.RESEARCH AND POLITICSLu said Kintor is in talks with Brazilian federal health regulator Anvisa about conducting its own clinical trial. Anvisa said in a statement that Kintor had not filed any formal request to conduct a trial, but did not comment on any talks between the regulator and the company.Two Anvisa staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned the results of the Brazilian Proxalutamide study, saying the authors' results presentation contained no detailed data or evidence. One of the Anvisa staffers characterized the presentation as more marketing than science. Brazil's Health Ministry, in a March technical note, concluded that "the available evidence for the drug is still incipient," with limited information on safety and outcomes.Kintor originally conceived of Proxalutamide as a cancer treatment, before pivoting to COVID-19. Lu told Reuters that the FDA had allowed the firm to progress to a Phase III trial, skipping Phases I and II, after evaluating its previous oncology studies and the Brazil research. She declined to share any documentation from the FDA outlining that permission.The FDA declined to comment on Kintor or its COVID-19 drug.Ostroff said it was concerning and atypical that Kintor used earlier-stage oncology trials, along with the questionable Brazil study, as shortcuts to a Phase III COVID-19 trial. The company's answers to basic questions about its clinical trial, he added, were evasive."Most pharmaceutical companies, especially related to COVID-19, will be quite open about what sorts of trials they're doing," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-firm-s-covid-19-drug-claims-draw-scientists-skepticism-101620958233229.html

14-05-2021||World||Prince Harry thought about quitting royal life in his 20s||Prince Harry compared his royal experience to being on “The Truman Show” and “living in a zoo.”The Dutch of Sussex said during a Thursday episode of the “Armchair Expert” podcast that he contemplated quitting royal life on several occasions while in his 20s. He spoke candidly with host Dax Shepard about keeping his relationship with Meghan a secret and dealing with the U.K. media scrutiny.Harry thought his life was like the 1998 Jim Carrey film “The Truman Show.” The film tells a story about Truman Burbank’s life being televised through hidden cameras while encountering people who were hired actors.Harry said it was a heavy burden and he struggled to deal with being a member of the royal family. He feared that his pregnant wife and son, Archie, would have to deal with the spotlight the same way his late mother, Princess Diana, had to deal with the enormous attention.In 1997, Diana died in a car crash at the age of 36 in Paris while being pursued by paparazzi.“I don’t want this job, I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to be doing this. Look what it did to my mum,” the 36-year-old Harry said.In a previous interview, Harry said the royal family cut him off financially at the start of 2020 after he announced plans to step back from his roles. But he was able to afford security for his family because of the money his mother left behind.Harry and Meghan’s departure from royal duties began last year over what they described as the British media's intrusions and racist attitudes toward the duchess. He criticized some American media outlets but said they are an improvement over the ones in the U.K.He feels more liberated after he and his family moved to California.“Living here now I can actually lift my head and actually feel different,” said Harry, who added he’s able to take Archie for bicycle rides. “You can walk around feeling a little bit more free.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-thought-about-quitting-royal-life-in-his-20s-101620954310620.html
14-05-2021||World||Oli reappointed as Nepal PM as Oppn fails to muster majority to form new govt||K P Sharma Oli, in his capacity as leader of the largest political party in Nepal's Parliament, was reappointed as Prime Minister on Thursday night after the Opposition parties, riddled by factionalism, failed to secure majority seats to form a new government.President Bidya Devi Bhandari reappointed CPN-UML Chairman Oli, 69, as Prime Minister, three days after he lost a crucial trust vote in the House of Representatives.The Office of President in a press statement on Thursday evening said that President Bhandari reappointed Oli as Prime Minister in his capacity as leader of the largest political party in the House of Representatives as per Article 78(3) of the Constitution of Nepal.President Bhandari will administer the oath of office and secrecy to Oli at a ceremony at Shital Niwas on Friday.The president had asked the Opposition parties to come up with the support of majority lawmakers to form a new government by 9 pm Thursday after Oli, lost the vote of confidence in the House on Monday.Oli's appointment came shortly after Office of President said that no two parties or more than two parties came to lay claim to forming coalition government by the given deadline that expired at 9 PM.Oli will now have to take a vote of confidence at the House within 30 days, failing which, an attempt to form a government under Article 76 (5) would be initiated. Should both the steps fail, the House may face another dissolution and the country will move towards the direction of early elections.Political parties were engaged in hectic negotiations to form a coalition government under Article 76 (2) for the past three days, but failed to bear any fruit.Until Thursday, Nepali Congress president, who got backing from CPN-Maoist Centre chairman Pushpakamal Dahal "Prachanda" was hopeful to get sufficient votes in the House to stake his claim as the next Prime Minister.But as Madhav Kumar Nepal took a U-turn after his last-minute meeting with Oli, Deuba's dream to become the next Prime Minster was shattered.The dissident faction led by Madhav Nepal within the CPN-UML, with their 28-member strength in Parliament had earlier decided to resign enmasse from the Parliament paving way for Deuba to claim for the post of Prime Minister.On the other hand, Janata Samajwadi Party was also divided on the issue of extending support to Deuba as the next Prime Minister.Upendra Yadav, President of JSP had assured Deuba to extend support, but Mahanta Thakur, another president of the party, who has backing from 17 out of 32 Lawmakers, rejected Upendra's idea.The CPN-UMl, headed by Oli is the largest party with 121 seats in the House of Representatives. However, Oli, needs to prove majority through a vote of trust in the Parliament within a month of his re-appointment.Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre have 61 and 49 seats in the lower house. Their combined strength was 110, which is insufficient to win majority vote.At present 136 votes are needed to form a majority government.Oli withdrew the action taken against four UML leaders including Nepal and assured to address their other demands. If 28 UML MPs had resigned, the total strength of the House would have been reduced to 243. Currently there are 271 valid members in the House. If they had resigned only 122 votes would be sufficient to stake claim for majority government.Earlier, Baburam Bhattarai, a senior leader of JSP-N, said all parties needed to form a new national coalition government and hold elections in one year.Bhattarai said such a government should not be led by a former prime minister or the current prime minister.Bhattarai said such a government should be run based on a common minimum programme, should resolve the COVID crisis, and ensure economic relief packages, constitution amendment, and truth and reconciliation.Given the parties’ strengths and particularly the factional feuds in the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi, many say the current numbers game is just a futile exercise and that the country, which has had eight different governments in a decade, would sooner or later head towards early polls, the Kathmandu Post reported.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls. Known for his pro-China stance, Oli had earlier served as the country's prime minister from October 11, 2015 to August 3, 2016 during which Kathmandu's ties with New Delhi had strained.Nepal's COVID-19 cases reached 431,191 as 8,842 fresh cases were reported in the past 24 hours on Thursday. As many as 214 more deaths were also logged, taking the national toll to 4,466.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oli-reappointed-as-nepal-pm-as-oppn-fails-to-muster-majority-to-form-new-govt-101620951467234.html

Because as great as this announcement is, we don't want to let up. We all know how tough this virus us. The safest thing for the country, is for everyone to get vaccinated," he said.Biden spoke about the hundreds of thousands of deaths and the lives upended for millions more as they missed family gatherings and important rituals.The Democrat then heaped praise on ordinary Americans who, he said, had met the challenge head on -- and better than in some other countries."You've endured all this. When your country asked you to get vaccinated, you did. The American people stepped up. You did what I consider to be your patriotic duty. That's how we got to this day. As president, I can say I'm pleased... but not surprised," he said."As the virus tragically rages in other countries, as other nations, even wealthy nations, are mired in the challenges of slow vaccine rollout and poor economic conditions, things are very different here."Biden noted that coronavirus cases are down in 49 of 50 states, saying deaths were down 80 percent to their lowest level since April 2020, when the disease was just taking a grip.However, "it's going to take a little more time," he said. "Most people under the age of 65 aren't vaccinated yet."Although pleading for patience, he invited those vaccinated to once again experience the pleasure of smiling."Take your mask off. You've earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world: greeting others with a smile," he said."As tough as this pandemic's been, we will get through it. We will rebuild our economy, reclaim our lives and get back to normal," he said."Laugh again, we'll know joy again and we'll smile again. Now, we'll see one another smile, look at the smiles on other people's faces."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-lifting-of-indoor-mask-rule-great-day-101620950697066.html
14-05-2021||World||Prince Harry says moved to US to 'break cycle' of family 'pain and suffering'||Prince Harry moved his wife and son to California to break a family cycle of "pain and suffering" after realizing his father Prince Charles "treated me the way he was treated," he said in an interview released Thursday.The remarks comes in the wake of Harry and Meghan's explosive television interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which they raised allegations of racism in the royal family, and said Charles had cut them off financially.Harry told "Armchair Expert" podcast host Dax Shephard that while he did not blame his father, he had resolved to avoid making the same mistakes with his own children."When it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure that I break that cycle," said Harry."There's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway. And as parents we should be doing the most we can to try and say, "You know what? That happened to me, I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen to you," he added.Harry said that once he began thinking about his father's own upbringing, he came to realize that the Prince of Wales had not had it easy, being brought up as a royal."So that means that he's treated me the way that he was treated. Which means, 'how can I change that for my own kids?' And well, here I am," the prince told Shephard."I've now moved my whole family to the US."The allegations made in Harry and Meghan's earlier interview with Winfrey in March have plunged the monarchy into its biggest crisis since the death of William and Harry's mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.Harry and Winfrey will collaborate again for mental health documentary series "The Me You Can't See" premiering May 21 on Apple TV .Promoting that forthcoming series, Harry told Shepherd he had realized that he did not want his royal duties in his early 20s, in part because of "what it did to my mom.""The three major times I felt completely helpless -- one when I was a kid in the back of the car with my mom being chased by paparazzi, two was in Afghanistan in an Apache helicopter, and then the third one was with my wife," he said.Harry and Meghan now live in Montecito, around an hour north of Los Angeles, and are expecting a daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-says-moved-to-us-to-break-cycle-of-family-pain-and-suffering-101620950023514.html
14-05-2021||World||Colonial hacker group’s dark web site no longer accessible||The dark web page belonging to the ransomware group accused of attacking Colonial Pipeline Co. attack has gone down.The FBI and cybersecurity experts identified DarkSide as the group behind the Colonial attack that forced the company to shut down operations, triggering fuel shortages in parts of the U.S. Some evidence has linked DarkSide’s operations to Russia and other Eastern European countries.It’s not clear if the site is down because of a technical snafu, which aren’t uncommon on the dark web, or some action by law enforcement or the group itself, which is facing the wrath of the U.S. government. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data; the groups sometime steal data too. The hackers then ask for a payment to unlock the files or return the stolen data.DarkSide maintains at least eight domains or websites on the dark web. One is a public-facing website used by DarkSide and its hackers-for-hire to name and shame victims who’ve ignored or refused the group’s ransom demands. The other seven sites are used by the group to host the data they’ve stolen.Four of those seven domains are also down. Three are loading blank, white pages. One simply reads, “Darkside CDN.” CDN stands for content delivery network. A separate site used as a payment gateway is still operational.Dark web researchers speculated that the outage could be DarkSide’s effort to duck law enforcement given the turmoil caused by the attack. “DarkSide is likely going to go quiet and rebrand itself, as we’ve observed with other dark net ransomware operators in the past when they became targets of law enforcement,” said Mark Turnage, co-founder of DarkOwl, a dark web and cyber research firm.Some ransomware groups maintain pages on the dark web where they post stolen documents to pressure victims into paying or list the names of companies that have refused their demands. DarkSide’s site posted what appeared to be three new victims on its site as recently as May 12, as they continued to leak new data on the site for existing digital hostages.In a message posted after the Colonial attack, the group hinted at contrition and that a “partner” might be to blame. Like some other ransomware groups, DarkSide offers to sell its malware to others in what is known as “ransomware-as-a-service.”“We are apolitical. We do not participate in geopolitics,” the message said. “Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society. From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”(Updates with details about darkweb payment site in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colonial-hacker-group-s-dark-web-site-no-longer-accessible-101620948604511.html

from the Hamas-run enclave in a conflict that has now claimed over 100 Palestinian lives."Israeli planes and troops on the ground are carrying out an attack in the Gaza Strip," the Israeli army said in a brief message.The escalation was confirmed by army spokesman John Conricus, although he did not specify the scale of the operation.As the violence intensified, Israel security forces scrambled to contain deadly riots between Jews and Arabs, with projectiles also fired on Israel from Lebanon.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was "deeply concerned about the violence in the streets of Israel", voicing support for a United Nations Security Council meeting "early next week" on the crisis."We believe that Israelis and Palestinians deserve equal measures of freedom, security, dignity and prosperity," Blinken said.There were intense artillery exchanges Thursday night, and AFP reporters saw Israeli troops assembling at the security barrier.Balls of flames rose high into the sky after strikes smashed into densely packed Gaza.Dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza towards the southern Israeli coastal cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon, and in the vicinity of Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport."We are prepared, and continue to prepare for various scenarios," Conricus said, describing a ground offensive as "one scenario".In Gaza, AFP photographers said people were evacuating their homes in the northeastern part of the enclave ahead of possible Israeli attacks, with Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, warning of a "heavy response" to a possible ground incursion.- 'Massive reinforcement' -With the conflict showing no signs of easing, Israel has been rocked by an unprecedented wave of mob violence, in which both Arabs and Jews have been savagely beaten and police stations attacked.Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a "massive reinforcement" to suppress the internal unrest.The heavy bombardments coincided with the start of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, and saw the faithful pray at mosques and amid the rubble of Gaza's collapsed buildings.Israel's air force launched multiple air strikes, targeting locations linked to Hamas, with the air force saying jets had struck a "military compound" of the group's "intelligence headquarters".At least 103 people have been killed since Monday, including 27 children, and more than 580 wounded, the health ministry in Gaza said.Heavy bombardments have brought down entire tower blocks.Inside Israel, seven people have been killed since Monday, including one six-year-old, after a rocket struck a family home.- 'Preventing pogroms' -The Israeli military said earlier it had hit targets in Gaza more than 600 times while 1,750 rockets were fired from the enclave.Hundreds of rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system.Three rockets were also fired from southern Lebanon towards Israel, landing in the Mediterranean Sea, Israel's army said.A source close to Israel's arch-enemy Hezbollah said the Lebanese Shiite group had no link to the incident.The military escalation was triggered by weekend unrest at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews.The disturbances, in which riot police had repeatedly clashed with Palestinians, has been driven by anger over the looming evictions of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of east Jerusalem.The surging tensions sparked clashes in many of Israel's mixed towns where Jews live alongside Arabs, who make up about 20 percent of the country's population.Nearly 1,000 border police were called in to quell the violence, and over 400 people were arrested.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said inter-communal violence in multiple towns was at a nadir not seen for decades, and that police were "literally preventing pogroms".- 'Two-front battle' -Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said police were increasing their use of force, warning of the "option" of deploying soldiers in towns.Israeli far-right groups have clashed with security forces and Arab Israelis, with television footage Wednesday airing footage of a far-right mob beating a man they considered an Arab in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, leaving him with serious injuries.In Lod, which has become a flashpoint of Arab-Jewish clashes this week with an Arab resident shot dead and a synagogue torched, a gunman opened fire Thursday at a group of Jews, wounding one.Netanyahu said the violence was "unacceptable"."Nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews, and nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs," he said, adding Israel was fighting a battle "on two fronts".Amid the rocket fire, Israel's civil aviation authority said it had diverted all incoming passenger flights headed for Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport to Ramon airport in the south.Hamas announced it had also fired a rocket at Ramon, in a bid to stop all air traffic to Israel.Israeli media said the rocket missed its target, but a number of international airlines cancelled flights amid the aerial

14-05-2021||World||US lifts most mask guidance in key step back to post Covid normalcy||President Joe Biden took his biggest step yet toward declaring victory over the coronavirus pandemic -- as public health officials said fully vaccinated Americans can ditch their masks in most settings, even indoors or in large groups.“Today is a great day for America in our long battle with coronavirus,” Biden said in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, calling the US vaccination program an “historical logistical achievement.”The guidance shift Thursday is a turning point in the fight against Covid-19 and comes as US caseloads fall and vaccinations rise. It signals a broad return to everyday life, and is also a bet that any surge in spread from relaxed guidelines won’t be enough to reverse progress in inoculations. The administration also used it as a further incentive for vaccination.“The rule is very simple: Get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do,” Biden said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the change in guidance while citing growing evidence that vaccines are effective against variants and outside of clinical trials, and fully vaccinated people are at low risk to spread the virus to someone else.“Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor or outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing,” said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. “If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment when we can get back to some sense of normalcy.”The CDC guidance spelled out ample exceptions, however, that signal the era of masks isn’t over yet. The agency still recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks on “all planes, buses, trains and other forms of public transportation,” as well as in health care settings, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, and where required by state and local governments, or businesses.And masks are still recommended for people who are partially vaccinated -- those who’ve not yet waited two weeks from their final dose -- or who haven’t gotten a vaccine, including children. The announcement was first reported by the Associated Press.The CDC’s guidelines are suggestions for behavior but they don’t have the force of law. Ground-level decisions on when and where masks must be worn will now rest with states, local governments and businesses, which will have to decide whether to maintain or relax their masking mandates, and what mix of carrots and sticks they will use to compel compliance.‘Free At Last’Yet even with the exceptions, the announcement represents a watershed moment. Only six weeks ago, Walensky had warned of “impending doom” as cases, hospitalizations and deaths rose. Thursday’s guidance was met in Washington with sighs of relief, as lawmakers in Congress and staff at the White House almost immediately dropped their masks. “Free at last,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.About 59% of American adults have received at least one shot, while 45% have received both. The Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE was cleared for use in children ages 12 to 15 years old this week, fueling the inoculation campaign. New daily Covid-19 cases, meanwhile, have been declining for weeks. Still, the pace of vaccinations has slowed from highs of a month ago, raising concerns about whether hesitancy will impede widespread protection in the population.Biden has set a goal of 70% of adult Americans receiving at least one vaccine shot by July 4, another symbolic milestone. Biden has said he hopes the country will be able to mark its annual Independence Day holiday by ridding itself of the virus.Still, even as the situation in the US improves, the pandemic is raging in some vaccine-starved nations. Biden faces growing calls to share US vaccine supply as the virus explodes in India, Brazil and other countries. The US administration has claimed nearly every dose made on U.S. soil so far, though says it will soon share 60 million AstraZeneca doses with other nations.Masks outdoorsThe most recent CDC guidance represents a major shift for the typically cautious agency, including from its own recommendations just weeks earlier. In late April, federal health officials said fully vaccinated Americans could drop their masks when exercising, dining and socializing outdoors in small groups, as well as when gathering indoors with other fully vaccinated people.Some question whether the guidance is premature, as only 35% of the US population is fully vaccinated, and an entire population group -- children under age 12 -- doesn’t yet qualify for a shot.“I think it’s really important that the CDC has changed their guidance and is finally demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccines,” said Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s Health Commissioner. “However, it seems that they’ve gone from one extreme to another.”The CDC considers someone fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose -- either two weeks after the second dose of vaccines from Moderna Inc. or Pfizer, or two weeks after receiving the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Some Republican senators pressed Walensky on the agency’s guidance for fully vaccinated people at a hearing Tuesday, with Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, expressing concern about the pace at which the CDC was releasing recommendations.“The American people have just lost patience with us, with you guys,” Cassidy said. “I just ask you to kind of be aware of their frustration and get a little real time into updating these things.”Biden has steadily delivered a more optimistic tone on the pandemic, while warning regularly that the US isn’t yet out of the woods. He has launched what he calls a “new phase” of the vaccination program, which emphasizes rural clinics, pharmacies and mobile sites instead of mass vaccination clinics, as demand for shots wanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-lifts-most-mask-guidance-in-key-step-back-to-normal-101620941459599.html
14-05-2021||World||Texas lawmakers approve abortion ban as early as 6 weeks||Texas would ban abortions after as early as six weeks — before many women even know they are pregnant — and allow private citizens to enforce the rule through civil lawsuits against doctors and others under a measure given final approval by state lawmakers Thursday.The Senate vote sends the bill to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it into law. That would bring Texas in line with about a dozen other GOP-led states that have passed so-called “heartbeat bills" that federal courts have mostly blocked. The Texas measure is also likely to draw a swift legal challenge from abortion rights groups.The bill would ban abortions after the first detection of an embryonic “heartbeat.” Advanced technology can detect an electric signal flutter as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, even though the embryo isn’t yet a fetus and doesn’t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, medical experts say.A unique provision in the Texas bill prohibits state officials from enforcing the ban. Instead, it allows anyone, even someone outside Texas, to sue a doctor or anyone else who may have helped someone get an abortion after the time limit, and seek financial damages of up to $10,000 per defendant.“The Texas Heartbeat Act is novel in approach, allowing for citizens to hold abortionists accountable through private lawsuits. No heartbeat law passed by another state has taken this strategy. Additionally, the bill does not punish women who obtain abortions,” said Rebecca Parma, Texas Right to Life senior legislative associate.Critics say that provision would allow abortion opponents to flood the courts with lawsuits to harass doctors, patients, nurses, domestic violence counselors, a friend who drove a woman to a clinic, or even a parent who paid for a procedure.And they argue that it would violate state constitutional requirements that civil lawsuits can be filed only by impacted parties. Under the bill, a person filing the lawsuit would not need any personal connection to the abortion in question.The bill has been opposed by medical groups.“Texas has now joined the new wave of extreme abortion bans passed this year across the U.S.,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “This bill essentially opens the floodgates to allow anyone who is hostile to abortion to sue doctors and clinics, consuming their resources and forcing them to shut down. We will pursue all legal options to prevent this law from taking effect.”Texas law currently bans abortion after 20 weeks, with exceptions for a woman with a life-threatening medical condition or if the fetus has a severe abnormality.Proponents of these so-called “heartbeat bills” are hoping for a legal challenge to eventually reach the US Supreme Court, where they look for the conservative coalition assembled under President Donald Trump to end the constitutional right to abortion protected under the high court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-lawmakers-approve-abortion-ban-as-early-as-6-weeks-101620940967057.html
