They also said the guidelines weren't mandatory and that the mixed messaging could undermine efforts to keep a lid on the virus by creating unnecessary confusion.In last week’s updated guidance, the government recommended that people within eight localities, including Hounslow in west London, the city of Leicester and the northwest towns of Blackburn and Bolton, shouldn’t meet up indoors or travel outside their areas unless it is for an essential matter, such as going to work.Keir Starmer, the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, accused the government of behaving in an “utterly shameful” fashion by not informing people in areas affected.“Local lockdowns are the wrong approach for both public health and local economies,” he said.In response, the government says it was just putting on the record the guidance that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has presented in the past couple of weeks during the spread of the so-called Indian variant, which critics say was seeded by a too-lax border policy.“We want the whole country to move out of these restrictions together and we’re trusting people to be responsible and act with caution and common sense as they have done throughout the pandemic,” vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told lawmakers.He insisted that the onus was on personal responsibility and that the government is still intending to take a national approach to lifting restrictions.In a joint statement, the directors of public health in the eight areas affected said government officials confirmed there are “no local lockdowns” and that everyone is working together to boost testing, vaccinations and to support those people who have to go into quarantine.The government's strategy over the past couple of months of lockdown easing has been to lift restrictions on a national basis, though it hasn't ruled out the possibility of local measures if needed.Restrictions across England — and the rest of the U.K. — have been lifted over the past few weeks as the number of coronavirus infections has fallen sharply in the wake of a strict lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines. Among many changes, the most recent easing has seen pubs and restaurants reopen to customers indoors and the number of people allowed to meet up outdoors increased to 30.The next easing is planned for June 21 and is intended to involve the lifting of all social restrictions. However, Johnson has warned that it could be pushed back if the new variant spreads widely. A decision on that date is set to be announced on June 14.Though new cases in the U.K. remain low at around 2,500 a day, against nearly 70,000 at one point in January during the peak of the second wave, they have been inching up slightly in recent weeks.That's raised concerns that the so-called Indian variant, which is thought to be more transmissible, is taking off at a time when restrictions have been eased and many younger people have yet to receive a dose of vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-accused-of-reintroducing-covid-restrictions-on-the-sly-101621959925475.html

A police spokesman didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Journalist Philip Crowther, who was shooting live video from 38th and Chicago, reported hearing as many as 30 gunshots about a block east of the intersection. Crowther said a storefront window appeared to have been broken by a gunshot.“Very quickly things got back to normal,” Crowther said. “People here who spend a significant amount of time, the organizers, were running around asking, ‘Does anyone need a medic?’ It seems like there are no injuries."Police said they responded to reports of gunfire at about 10:10 a.m. at the 3800 block of Elliot Ave. South. Callers told police that a vehicle was seen speeding away from the area.Soon after, someone went to Abbott Northwestern Hospital with a gunshot wound. The victim was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and it’s believed the injury is not life-threatening. It wasn't immediately clear if that person was injured in the shooting near George Floyd Square.The intersection has been barricaded since soon after George Floyd's death and quickly turned into a memorial — and also a challenging spot for the city, with police officers not always welcome.Informally dubbed George Floyd Square, it was being transformed Tuesday into an outdoor festival on the anniversary of his death, with food, children's activities and a long list of musical performers.“We're going to be turning mourning into dancing,” rapper Nur-D tweeted. “We're going to be celebrating 365 days of strength in the face of injustice.”Also Read | ‘Your legacy will last forever': Leaders, celebs mark George Floyd’s death anniversaryFloyd, 46, who was Black, died on Memorial Day 2020 after then-Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, pinning him to the ground for about 9 1/2 minutes. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted last month of murder and faces sentencing June 25. Three other fired officers still face trial.The “Rise and Remember George Floyd” celebration, including a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m., caps several days of marches, rallies and panel discussions about his death and where America is in confronting racial discrimination.Many members of the Floyd family are scheduled to be in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, in a private meeting with President Joe Biden, who called family members after the Chauvin verdict and pledged to continue fighting for racial justice.Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said he hoped Biden will renew his support for policing reform named for George Floyd that would ban chokeholds and no-knock police raids and create a national registry for officers disciplined for serious misconduct.“Now is time to act,” Crump said Tuesday on CNN. “Not just talk but act.”Floyd’s brother Philonise, appearing alongside Crump, said he thinks about George “all the time.”“My sister called me at 12 o’clock last night and said ’This is the day our brother left us,'” he said, adding: “I think things have changed. I think it is moving slowly but we are making progress.”Nur-D, whose real name is Matt Allen, took to the Minneapolis streets in the days after Floyd's death, often providing medical assistance to protesters who were shot or gassed in confrontations with police. He eventually founded an organization, Justice Frontline Aid, to support safe protest.He described the past year as “like we've lived 20 years inside of one" and hoped that people would feel “honesty and a real sense of togetherness” during Tuesday's celebration at what's informally known as George Floyd Square.“If you're angry, you can be angry. If you're sad, you can be sad,” Nur-D said in a follow-up interview. “If you're feeling some sense of joy over the verdict and some sort of like step in the right direction, and you want to celebrate that, do that as well.”The event was organized by the George Floyd Global Memorial. Angela Harrelson, an aunt of Floyd's and a member of the board of directors, said the organization has stockpiled 3,000 items surrounding Floyd's death — things like artwork left behind in the square — and will display some of them in a pop-up gallery.Separately, the Floyd family announced the launch of a fund that will make grants to businesses and community organizations in the neighborhood where he died, as well as broader grants “encouraging the success and growth of Black citizens and community harmony.” The money comes from $500,000 earmarked as part of the city's $27 million civil settlement for the Floyd family earlier this year.The event at George Floyd Square was due to start at 1 p.m., the same time Gov. Tim Walz asked Minnesotans to pause for a moment of silence to honor Floyd. Walz asked that the moment last for 9 minutes, 29 seconds – the length of time that prosecutors say Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck.Walz’s proclamation says Chauvin’s guilty verdict was a step in the right direction, “but our work to dismantle systemic racism and discrimination has not ended. True justice for George Floyd will come only through real, systemic change to prevent acts like this from happening again — when every member of every community, no matter their race, is safe, valued, and protected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunshots-heard-near-george-floyd-square-on-anniversary-of-death-101621959909516.html
25-05-2021||World||Indian-origin British MP takes time off work for mental health reasons||An Indian-origin Member of Parliament, who is also Britain’s youngest MP in the House of Commons, on Tuesday announced on social media that she will be taking "several weeks" off her parliamentary work for mental health reasons.Nadia Whittome, born in the UK to a Punjabi father and representing her birthplace of Nottingham in central England for the Opposition Labour Party since her win in the December 2019 General Election, said she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and had tried to balance her full-time work with the condition but had now been advised by her doctor to take time off.The 24-year-old, traditionally referred to as the “Baby of the House” in the Commons as its youngest member, said she had decided to be open about her “mental health struggle” to help others talk about similar issues.“Over recent months, I have been battling some persistent health issues. Until now, I have been attempting to manage them alongside continuing with my full time work as an MP," Whittome said, in a statement posted on Twitter.Unfortunately, it has become clear that this is not feasible and I have been advised by my doctor that I need to take several weeks off in order for my health to improve," she said.The MP added that she feels it is important for her to be honest that it is mental ill-health she is suffering from – specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).“One in four people will experience mental health problems each year, but there is still a great deal of shame and stigma surrounding it. Through being open about my own mental health struggle, I hope that others will also feel able to talk about theirs, and that I can play a small role in creating greater acceptance and facilitating healthier discussions around this issue," she said.On the advice of my doctor, I'm going to be taking some time away from work for health reasons.Constituents should continue to contact my office as normal - my staff will be there to assist you.My full statement is below. pic.twitter.com/0CMDxc8OYlShe thanked the Labour Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his political secretary Jenny Chapman for their "kindness" as she asked her constituents to continue reaching out to her "fantastic" staff as normal, who would support their needs until she returns to the job she loves.Starmer wished her well, adding: "I respect Nadia's bravery in speaking openly about her mental health and I look forward to welcoming her back to Parliament."At the peak of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, Whittome had returned to her previous role of a care-worker on a part-time basis and said she would donate the salary from her role at the ExtraCare retirement home to a local Covid-19 support fund.Following her election in 2019, she had promised to donate a large part of her MP salary to her local community, stating at the time that she hoped it "sparks a conversation about earnings".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-british-mp-takes-time-off-work-for-mental-health-reasons-101621950388488.html
25-05-2021||World||‘Your legacy will last forever': Leaders, celebs mark George Floyd’s death anniversary||People around the world on Tuesday marked the first death anniversary of George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis, US. Floyd, 46, died after Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for about nine and a half minutes. Chauvin was convicted last month of murder and faces sentencing on June 25.While police brutality against people of colour, especially those from the Black community, has been a growing matter of concern in the United States, George Floyd’s death became a watershed moment in American history with a rejuvenated Black Lives Matter movement. The video of Floyd’s murder sparked outrage across the world which only intensified as more details about the incident emerged.A transcript of the minutes leading to George Floyd’s death showed he uttered “I can’t breathe” more than 20 times and was told by Chauvin to stop “yelling”. Black Lives Matter protests, which at times turned violent, received unprecedented support from politicians, celebrities, as well as business leaders who highlighted the disproportionate risk that Black people face in the law enforcement and justice system.Observing the death anniversary of George Floyd, US state secretary Antony Blinken said that the nation must face the reality of racism at home in order to be a credible force for human rights around the world. Taking to Twitter, Blinken said, “By addressing our shortcomings openly and honestly, we live up to the values that we stand for worldwide.”Also Read | Biden hosts George Floyd family on anniversary of shocking murderFormer US president Barack Obama said that hundreds more Americans have died in encounters with police since the murder of George Floyd but the year has also given “reasons to hope.” In a series of tweets, the first and only Black president in American history asserted that “more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago.”“When injustice runs deep, progress takes time. But if we can turn words into action and action into meaningful reform, we will, in the words of James Baldwin, 'cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it,'” he added.US senator Elizabeth Warren said that she’s committed to keeping the fight to pass the ‘George Floyd Justice in Policing Act’, a civil rights and police reform bill drafted by Democrats, as a step towards cementing the "unshakeable truth that Black Lives Matter." The NBA's social justice coalition has also called on the Senate to pass the bill to honour the memory of Floyd and "others who have been victims of police brutality."“A year ago today we didn’t know his name, but now it’s forever etched in our consciousness: #GeorgeFloyd,” tweeted iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey.Formula One champion Sir Lewis Hamilton said that George Floyd wasn't supposed to die that day and the “impact of his life and its unfair ending remains with us.” “What does justice mean for a daughter who lost her dad? For a woman who lost her partner? For a man who lost his brother? What does justice mean when a man's life is stolen because of nothing more than the colour of his skin?” the British racing driver asked rhetorically. "Rest in peace, George Floyd. Your time here was cut far too short. Your legacy will last forever," he added.pic.twitter.com/KhxV2emIcxHere are some of the reactions marking George Floyd’s death anniversary:﻿It’s been a year since those horrifying 8 minutes and 46 seconds stole George Floyd’s life. Today, I am thinking of this clip of his daughter Gianna, and all the young people out there who have seen so much, but refuse to give up hope. pic.twitter.com/VclaQksysoToday, we honor George Floyd’s life and mourn with his family. One year after his murder, we remain dedicated to rooting out systemic racism and police violence against people of color, and building a nation free of oppression that respects the human dignity of every person.Today marks a year since George Floyd was murdered. My heart is with his family — and all Black and Brown families who have had a loved one taken from them by the police.George Floyd's life mattered. Let's honor it with action — organizing to end police brutality. pic.twitter.com/MrMXDiJN2rTo John Lewis, the effects of the protests following George Floyd’s murder were clear.“People will never, ever forget what happened and how it happened,” he said. ”And it is my hope that we are on our way to greater change."That’s my hope too.

25-05-2021||World||'You have bomb onboard': Belarus suggested diverted Ryanair flight to land in Minsk||Belarus air traffic control told a Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight there was a bomb on board and suggested it divert to Minsk, according to a transcript released by the transport ministry Tuesday.The forced grounding of the European passenger flight Sunday sparked a global outcry with EU-based carriers cutting air links with Belarus and European leaders warning of fresh sanctions.The aviation department of the Belarus transport ministry released a transcript of what it says was the conversation between Minsk airport and the Ryanair pilot."We have information from special services that you have bomb on board and it can be activated over Vilnius," Minsk air traffic control said, recommending that the aircraft make a landing.The pilot then questioned the origin of the bomb threat, to which Minsk said airport security had received it via email.Belarus several times suggested that the plane land in Minsk saying it was "our recommendation".On Monday however Belarus authorities said that the decision to land in Minsk was made independently by the pilot and that he had the option of going to either Poland or Ukraine.They also said the bomb threat supposedly came from the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in an email addressed to Minsk airport. They reiterated this claim in Tuesday's statement.The transport ministry also said Tuesday that representatives of international agencies were invited for "further consideration of the circumstances" of the incident.The invited organisations are the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Air Transport Association, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the EU and US Civil Aviation Authorities.The Ryanair aircraft travelling from Athens to Vilnius had an opposition activist on board who was arrested in Minsk airport after all passengers disembarked for a security check.Roman Protasevich, 26, fled Belarus in 2019 to the EU from where he co-ran the Nexta Telegram channels, a key Belarus opposition media that helped mobilise protesters.Belarusian state TV late on Monday broadcast a short video of Protasevich confirming that he was in prison in Minsk and "confessing" to charges of organising mass unrest.His allies however say the video was made under pressure from authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-have-bomb-onboard-belarus-suggested-diverted-ryanair-flight-to-land-in-minsk-101621949017650.html

In simple terms it enciompasses nuclear weapons, missiles, anti-satellite weapons, and anti missile defence.The joint statement issued after the meeting makes it clear that both the countries want to work towards normalizing ties and keeping in touch with each other on critical global issues.This normalisation of ties suits India as it is a close ally of both US and Russia with Patrushev being a key interlocutor with Indian NSA Ajit Doval. According to the statement, the US-Russia NSA meeting was a logical continuation of the recent discussions held in Reykjavik between Secretary of State Blinken and Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov."At the meeting, both sides agreed that a normalisation of the US-Russian relations would be in the interest of both countries and contribute to global predictability and stability" the statement said. Patrushev is a close and trusted aide of President Putin, just as Sullivan is the NSA to President Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russia-to-work-towards-strategic-stability-china-is-the-elephant-in-the-room-101621948355739.html
25-05-2021||World||US demands new ‘transparent’ probe into Covid origin as Fauci ‘not convinced’||The United States on Tuesday called for a “transparent” second phase of investigation into the origins of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the route of introduction to the human population. In a video message to the 74th World Health Assembly (WHA), US health secretary Xavier Becerra advocated that international experts should be given independence to fully assess the source of the virus, which has claimed more than 3.4 million lives so far.An international team of experts visited Wuhan in January to probe the origins of the virus and identified two most likely scenarios that caused SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the human population, including the one involving intermediary host species. The hypothesis of introduction through a laboratory incident had gained a lot of traction in the early days of the outbreak but the global study, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), deemed it “extremely unlikely.”"Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based, and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak," Becerra told the annual ministerial meeting of the WHO.Also Read | We need Taiwan as observer at WHA and Covid investigation, says USWhile Becerra didn’t mention China directly, his call for a transparent and independent investigation came days after top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci raised doubt over the preliminary findings. At a virtual event hosted by Poynter Institute on May 11, Fauci was asked whether he was convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.”"I am not convinced...I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened," said Fauci, director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-demands-new-transparent-probe-into-covid-origin-as-fauci-not-convinced-101621947084550.html

If Moderna gets the same treatment, its authorization would come in early July.Most children with Covid-19 develop only mild symptoms or no symptoms. Yet children remain at risk of becoming seriously ill, and they can spread the virus. Widely vaccinating 12- to 18-year olds could allow U.S. schools and summer camps to relax masking and social distancing measures suggested by the CDC.“We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents," Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said in a statement.Also Read | Moderna, Pfizer said they’ll deal only with Centre, not states: Delhi govtModerna's trial evaluated the vaccine in 3,732 adolescents aged 12 to 17, two thirds of whom got the vaccine and one third of whom got a placebo. The main goal was to produce an immune response on par with that seen in the company's large, Phase 3 trial in adults, which was 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19.Two weeks after the second dose, researchers found no cases of Covid-19 in the vaccine group compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100%, based on case definitions from the company's adult trial.Using a case definition from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which requires only 1 Covid-19 symptom, the vaccine was found to be 93% effective, suggesting the vaccine may be protective against cases with milder symptoms, the company said.The researchers found no new safety issues. The most common side effects after the second dose were headache, fatigue, body aches and chills.The company said it is still accumulating safety data. All study participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second dose to determine long-term protection and safety.Moderna said it plans to submit the data to a peer-reviewed publication. The company is currently testing its vaccine in children as young as 6 months of age.In addition to the United States, Pfizer's vaccine is also authorized for use in younger teens aged 12 to 15 in Canada and Algeria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-found-safe-effective-in-kids-as-young-as-12-101621944733361.html
25-05-2021||World||Blinken pledges US aid to build Gaza without helping Hamas||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Tuesday to “rally international support” to aid Gaza following a devastating war there while keeping any assistance out of the hands of its militant Hamas rulers, as he began a regional tour to shore up last week’s cease-fire.The 11-day war between Israel and Hamas killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused widespread destruction in the impoverished coastal territory. The truce that came into effect Friday has so far held, but it did not address any of the underlying issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, something Blinken acknowledged after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“We know that to prevent a return to violence, we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges. And that begins with tackling the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and starting to rebuild,” he said.“The United States will work to rally international support around that effort while also making our own significant contributions.” He added that the U.S. would work with its partners “to ensure that Hamas does not benefit from the reconstruction assistance."Blinken will not be meeting with Hamas, which does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and which Israel and the U.S. consider a terrorist organization.Blinken addressed the larger conflict, saying "we believe that Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely, to enjoy equal measures of freedom, opportunity and democracy, to be treated with dignity.”But the top U.S. diplomat faces the same obstacles that have stifled a wider peace process for more than a decade, including a hawkish Israeli leadership, Palestinian divisions and deeply rooted tensions surrounding Jerusalem and its holy sites. The Biden administration had initially hoped to avoid being drawn into the intractable conflict and focus on other foreign policy priorities before the violence broke out.Netanyahu, meanwhile, is fighting for his political life after a fourth inconclusive election in two years. He faces mounting criticism from Israelis who say he ended the offensive prematurely, without forcibly halting rocket attacks or dealing a heavier blow to Hamas.Netanyahu hardly mentioned the Palestinians in his remarks, in which he warned of a “very powerful" response if Hamas breaks the cease-fire.Netanyahu spoke of “building economic growth” in the occupied West Bank, but said there will be no peace until the Palestinians recognize Israel as a “Jewish state.” The Palestinians have long objected to that language, saying it undermines the rights of Israel’s own Palestinian minority.The war was triggered by weeks of clashes in Jerusalem between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site revered by Jews and Muslims that has seen several outbreaks of Israeli-Palestinian violence over the years. The protests were directed at Israel’s policing of the area during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers.The truce remains tenuous since tensions are still high in Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian families is not yet resolved.The evictions were put on hold just before the Gaza fighting erupted, but the legal process is set to resume in the coming weeks. Police briefly clashed with protesters at Al-Aqsa on Friday, hours after the cease-fire came into effect.Adding to the tensions, an Israeli soldier and a civilian were stabbed and wounded in east Jerusalem on Monday before police shot and killed the assailant in what they described as a terrorist attack.Then, early Tuesday, a Palestinian man was shot and killed by undercover Israeli forces near the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to the Wafa news agency. Pictures circulating online appeared to show the man bloodied and lying in the street. The Israeli army referred questions to the Border Police, which did not respond to requests for comment.Blinken will head to Ramallah later Tuesday to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has no power in Gaza and was sidelined by recent events. Abbas heads the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank but whose forces were driven from Gaza when Hamas seized power there in 2007.Abbas, who called off the first Palestinian elections in 15 years last month when it appeared his fractured Fatah movement would suffer an embarrassing defeat, is seen by many Palestinians as having lost all legitimacy. A crowd of worshippers at Al-Aqsa chanted against the Palestinian Authority and in support of Hamas on Friday.But Abbas is still seen internationally as the representative of the Palestinian people and a key partner in the long-defunct peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organization, the umbrella group led by Abbas, recognized Israel decades ago, and the Palestinian Authority maintains close security ties with Israel.Blinken will also visit neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which have acted as mediators in the conflict. Egypt succeeded in brokering the Gaza truce after the Biden administration pressed Israel to wind down its offensive.The administration had been roundly criticized for its perceived hands-off initial response to the deadly violence, including from Democratic allies in Congress who demanded it take a tougher line on Israel. Biden repeatedly affirmed what he said was Israel’s right to defend itself from rocket attacks from Gaza.The administration has defended its response by saying it engaged in intense, but quiet, high-level diplomacy to support a cease-fire.Blinken has said the time is not right for an immediate resumption in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but that steps could be taken to repair the damage from Israeli airstrikes, which destroyed hundreds of homes and damaged infrastructure in Gaza.The narrow coastal territory, home to more than 2 million Palestinians, has been under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from importing arms, while the Palestinians and human rights groups view it as a form of collective punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-pledges-us-aid-to-build-gaza-without-helping-hamas-101621942348907.html
25-05-2021||World||UK Conservatives seen as insensitive to Muslims: Report||Prime Minister Boris Johnson helped create an impression that his Conservative Party is “insensitive” to Muslims with a newspaper column comparing veil-wearing women to “letter boxes,” a report into prejudice in Britain’s governing party said Tuesday.The inquiry, set up by the party in 2019 to investigate all forms of discrimination, said “anti-Muslim sentiment remains a problem” within the Conservative Party at local and individual levels. But it didn't conclude that the party was institutionally racist or failed to take complaints seriously.“While the party leadership claims a ‘zero tolerance approach’ to all forms of discrimination, our findings show that discriminatory behaviors occur, especially in relation to people of Islamic faith,” said the committee, led by Srawan Singh, an academic and former member of Britain’s equalities commission.But it said it didn't find evidence of a party which “systematically discriminated against any particular group.”Johnson has a long history of making provocative and offensive comments in a career that has combined politics and journalism. He has called Papua New Guineans cannibals, claimed that “part-Kenyan” Barack Obama had an ancestral dislike of Britain and, in a 2018 newspaper column, compared Muslim women who wear face-covering veils to “letter boxes” and “bank robbers.”The committee cleared Johnson of breaking the party’s code of conduct, but said Conservative leaders “ought to set a good example for appropriate behaviors and language.”Johnson has previously apologized for any offense given by his language, but not for writing the words. He has dismissed such comments as jokes or plain-speaking, or accused journalists of distorting his words.He told the commission that he wouldn't use “some of the offending language from my past writings” now that he is prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-conservatives-seen-as-insensitive-to-muslims-report-101621940457176.html

Meghan Markle claimed that the royal family, which she referred to as “The Firm”, refused to make her son a prince partly due to conversations about how dark his skin might be.While Meghan Markle refused to name the person because it would be “damaging” to them, Harry later clarified that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who died in April, were never part of those conversations. Prince William refuted the claims saying they are “very much not a racist family."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-kate-cook-meals-for-vulnerable-sikh-women-s-group-guide-couple-101621939066552.html
25-05-2021||World||China denounces people's tribunal in Britain on alleged Xinjiang abuses||China on Tuesday denounced plans for a people’s tribunal in Britain on allegations of genocide against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim people in China's Xinjiang region.The spokesman for the northwestern region’s government, Xu Guixiang, said China “condemned and despised” the hearings, which are expected to draw dozens of witnesses when they begin in early June.The tribunal, which does not have government backing, is to be chaired by prominent lawyer Geoffrey Nice, who led the prosecution of ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and worked with the International Criminal Court.“This is a total violation of international law and order, a serious desecration of the victims of real genocide, and a serious provocation to the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang,” Xu told reporters at the latest in a series of briefings in Beijing intended to counter growing criticism of China's policies in Xinjiang.The region has become a major foreign policy headache for China, which is accused of locking up more than a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in re-education camps where they are forced to denounce their traditional culture and swear fealty to China’s ruling Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.Women from the region have also testified that they have been forced to undergo contraceptive measures, children have allegedly been taken from their incarcerated parents and claims of forced labor have prompted multinational companies to cut ties with Xinjiang's key cotton industry.China says it has merely been providing job training and counseling to de-radicalize those influenced by jihadist propaganda following years of violent outbursts against Chinese rule in the region.While the tribunal’s judgment is not binding on any government, organizers hope the process of publicly laying out evidence will compel international action to tackle the alleged abuses in Xinjiang.Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared before he left office that China’s policies against Xinjiang’s Muslims and ethnic minorities constituted crimes against humanity and genocide. His successor, Antony Blinken, reiterated the statement on his first day in office.The Associated Press reported last year that the Chinese government was systematically forcing sterilization and abortion on Uighur and other Muslim women, and sent many to camps simply for having too many children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denounces-people-s-tribunal-in-britain-on-alleged-xinjiang-abuses-101621934677886.html

I scratched the number and it was USD 1 million underneath the ticket,” Abhi was quoted as saying by the local TV station WWLP.“I was a millionaire for a night,” he joked.Abhi said he initially thought of buying a Tesla car, but later decided to return the winning ticket.“I mean I had USD 1 million in my hand and on the other hand I wanted to do something good,” he said.The family said it was not an easy decision to return the ticket.“We didn’t sleep two nights,” said Maunish Shah, owner of Lucky Spot.“He called my mom, grandparents in India, they said, ‘Give it back, we don’t want that money,’” Maunish said.The family then decided to return the ticket. Since the customer visited the store often, they knew where to find her.The younger Shah came to find Fiega at work and told her his parents wanted to see her, according to the lottery winner.“I said ‘I’m working,’ and he said ‘no you have to come over’. So, I went over there and that’s when they told me. I was in total disbelief. I cried, I hugged them,” Fiega said.The other customers of the store are not surprised that the Shahs did the right thing.“They’re just purely good people. You can tell by just talking to them,” one customer was quoted as saying by WBZ TV, a CBS-owned-and-operated television station licensed to Boston, Massachusetts.The family is now fielding congratulatory calls and interview requests from across the country.“If I had kept that million, I wouldn’t have been this famous. So, I’m glad I gave it back,” Abhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-family-in-us-returns-1-million-discarded-lottery-ticket-to-winner-101621933362382.html
25-05-2021||World||Iranian media say 3 heavyweights barred from June presidential polls||Three of the best-known candidates in Iran's June presidential elections, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Ali Larijani and Eshaq Jahangiri, have been barred from running, Iranian media said Tuesday.First reported by ultraconservative Fars news agency, the trio's disqualification by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council came days before campaigning starts for the June 18 poll to succeed President Hassan Rouhani.Iranian media had widely predicted a showdown between conservative former parliament speaker Larijani, an advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi.But unlike Raisi, Larijani did not feature on what Fars said was an "unofficial final list" of seven candidates approved by the Guardian Council, which has veto power over election hopefuls.Reformists had pinned their hopes on Jahangiri, first vice-president to Rouhani.Firebrand ex-president Ahmadinejad had been expected to be disqualified.Approved candidates on the list reported by Fars also include ex-Revolutionary Guards chief Major General Mohsen Rezai, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and central bank governor Abdolnasser Hemmati.The other three on the list were the reformist ex-vice president Mohsen Mehralizadeh, and ultraconservative MPs Alireza Zakani and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi.The Guardian Council's spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee also said that "only seven of the presidential candidates have been qualified by the council", according to the council's website.He had earlier told ISNA news agency that the final list "must be announced by the interior ministry".That is expected to happen on Wednesday or Thursday.Barred candidates have until midnight Tuesday night to appeal. Those approved are allowed to start campaigning from May 28.Under the Islamic republic's constitution, Rouhani is barred from running for a third consecutive term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-media-say-3-heavyweights-barred-from-june-presidential-polls-101621933901798.html
25-05-2021||World||US senator helps unite Indian family separated by Covid-19 travel ban||An Indian family separated due to the recent travel restrictions in view of the Covid-19 cases in India was united over the weekend because of the personal efforts made by a top Democratic Senator Robert Menendez.Software solutions architect Ashu Mahajan, who is on H-1B visa, travelled to India on April 17 to see his ailing father just days before his death on April 21 from Covid-19. But before he could return home to New Jersey, new pandemic restrictions went into effect forcing the closures of American embassies and consulates located in India.As a highly-skilled immigrant worker with an H1-B visa, Mahajan is required to have his passport reviewed and stamped at an American embassy or consulate before travelling to the US, but that the earliest he was told he could get an appointment was in February 2022.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.“Having the family separated for so long would not only be a tremendous hardship—it would jeopardize the very job that makes Mahajan’s H1-B status and his family’s life here in America possible,” Menendez, who is Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters at Scotch Plains in New Jersey.“I’m incredibly proud of my staff in New Jersey and in Washington with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for working together to bring Mr. Mahajan home. They reached out to the State Department. They made clear all that was at stake in this case, and they successfully secured an expedited appointment at our embassy in New Delhi so that he could get that passport stamp and board a plane back to America,” Menendez said.Menendez was joined by Mahajan along with his wife Neha and two daughters, 15-year-old Sanaa and nine-year-old Aishi, at the press conference near their Scotch Plains home to announce his safe return.“When I was leaving for India, I knew my dad was sick. I was still debating whether I should go or not. If I go, I knew I would have visa issues, but still, I took that decision because it was related my dad,” said Mahajan.“While he was in the hospital, I was not even thinking about visa issues. After that, it hit me that I would be separated from my family for more than a year. At that time, I told Senator Menendez I became so pessimistic about everything, whether this is going to happen or not. But thanks to Senator Menendez and his team they have been reassuring us all this while and showing us directions on how to go about this,” he said.“We really want to thank Senator Menendez and his staff. If it were not for his support and his office’s support, I don’t know when I would see Mahajan,” said Neha Mahajan.“When the girls would see him. Every night we spent on two different continents, my girls would ask me, ‘When is daddy coming home?’ And I really did not have an answer for them. Yesterday was probably the first night when I saw him and I was able to sleep in peace because during a pandemic we are all going through a lot. And immigration related matters are the last ones that you need to impact and keep us separated,” Neha told reporters.Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas have been facing similar situations as a result of the travel restrictions imposed on those coming to the US from India.The Mahajan’s have been caught for nearly a decade in the immigration backlog after they legally immigrated to the US through the H1-B visa programme and applied and qualified in 2012 for green cards, Menendez’s office said.Their youngest daughter, Aisha, is an American citizen, which was a factor that the US State Department considered in expediting her father’s case.“Ironically, had the family received their green cards and permanent resident status in a timely manner, Ashu Majahan never would have faced his predicament because he would not have been required to get his passport stamped before travelling home to New Jersey,” said his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-helps-unite-indian-family-separated-by-covid-19-travel-ban-101621933360327.html
25-05-2021||World||Covid in Thailand: Vaccine hesitancy grows ahead mass inoculation rollout||Vaccine hesitancy has risen sharply in Thailand opinion polls show, just weeks away from the start of a mass inoculation programme and as the country fights its deadliest Covid-19 outbreak.Reasons for the rise in vaccine hesitancy were unclear in the polls, but there are widespread complaints at government disorganisation, delays in getting vaccines and reliance on Sinovac and locally made AstraZeneca doses.Thailand has reported 135,439 infections and 832 deaths since the pandemic began last year.In January, 83% of Thais surveyed by polling firm YouGov were willing to be vaccinated, but by May that dropped to 63% in the same poll, lower than Vietnam and the Philippines at 83% and 66% willingness, respectively.Thai-based Suan Dusit Poll on Sunday echoed the YouGov findings of rising vaccine hesitancy, with 64% of respondents willing to be vaccinated, compared with 66% in January.Dissatisfaction with the military-backed government's vaccine strategy has been building for months."People are worried about the vaccines that the government procured. It's not that we don't want to get shots, but there is hesitancy," Facebook user Than Tongkum wrote under a government announcement encouraging vaccinations.Asked by Suan Dusit poll for their views on Thai vaccinations, only 57% of respondents believed they would help develop immunity and reduce the virus impact, while 59% worried about side-effects.With Thailand's main vaccination drive, which is due to start June 7, relying heavily on AstraZeneca, respondents had 66% confidence in the shot, fourth behind US-developed vaccines, with Pfizer top at 75%.Thailand aims to inoculate 70% of its population by year-end, a level its tourist hotspots must also reach locally before reopening to vaccinated foreign visitors.Registration is ongoing for the first 16 million people including those over 60 or with health conditions.So far, 7.8 million people have registered.Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said he believes the vaccines will be embraced once the inoculation programme starts."As Thailand receives more doses, there will be more vaccine sites, which will help create awareness among the public after they see large numbers of vaccinations do not lead to serious side effects," he told Reuters.Actress Araya "Chompoo" Hargate sparked controversy after she posted to her 10.5 million followers on Instagram saying she chose Sinovac."Can't help but think this is government PR," wrote user iloveurdadmaybe.Among the concerns is perception that Sinovac has a low efficacy rate."Just hearing that it's Sinovac that's only 50% safe and 50% effective," wrote Facebook user Dang Juntawan."Injections are on chance. If you're unlucky you'll die."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-thailand-vaccine-hesitancy-grows-ahead-mass-inoculation-rollout-101621932894806.html

25-05-2021||World||Biden hosts George Floyd family on anniversary of shocking murder||President Joe Biden marks the anniversary Tuesday of the police murder of George Floyd by hosting the African American man's family -- but without being able to celebrate hoped-for national police reform.Floyd's daughter Gianna, his mother, sister and brothers will be among those attending private talks with Biden at the White House, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said."The courage and grace of his family, and especially his daughter Gianna, has really stuck with the president," she told reporters. "He's eager to listen to their perspectives."The choking to death of Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 last year and subsequent conviction of the officer, Derek Chauvin, who'd knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, were seen as seminal moments in the long US struggle for racial equality.After the killing during Floyd's arrest outside a store, protests and riots erupted across a country already crackling with tension from the election battle between Biden and then president Donald Trump.In the wake of the verdict this April against Chauvin, who faces sentencing next month, Biden sought to build on political momentum by urging Congress to pass a far-reaching police reform bill in time for the first anniversary.Americans must confront the "systemic racism" revealed by Floyd's killing "head on," he declared.However, the ambitious deadline comes with only the House having passed the bill, known as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, while the Senate continues to wrangle over key details.The bill seeks to reform what critics say have become ever more violent and unaccountable police forces around the country.Opponents argue that police are being unfairly blamed when they are simply trying to operate in a dangerous and often heavily armed society.However, Biden and reform proponents say that a culture of impunity and underlying racism have made incidents like Floyd's death increasingly common.- Personal impact on Biden -Among other measures, the bill would ban potentially fatal restraint techniques used on suspects, like chokeholds.It would also end so-called "no-knock warrants," when police are authorized to burst into a suspect's house unannounced -- a volatile situation that led to the accidental killing of a Black woman, Breonna Taylor, in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020.The most far-reaching of the measures that senators are still debating would be to end current legal protections that block civil lawsuits against police accused of misconduct.Psaki put a brave face on chances of success, saying "the president is still very much hopeful that he will be able to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law."While nothing is easy to get through the heavily divided Congress, Biden hopes that the energy unleashed in the wake of Floyd's death will "help move this legislation across the finish line."Confirming that there's still hope for the bill, House Democrat Karen Bass, Senate Democrat Cory Booker and Republican senator Tim Scott issued a joint statement on Monday citing "progress.""This anniversary serves as a painful reminder of why we must make meaningful change. While we are still working through our differences on key issues, we continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic," they said.For Biden himself, hosting the Floyds for a "real conversation" will be a moving moment, Psaki said.George Floyd's death was "a day that certainly impacted him personally and impacted millions of Americans."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hosts-george-floyd-family-on-anniversary-of-shocking-murder-101621906295787.html
25-05-2021||World||Joe Biden calls Belarus plane diversion an 'outrageous incident'||President Joe Biden on Monday said the forced diversion by Belarus of a commercial passenger jet so it could arrest an opposition journalist was “a direct affront to international norms" and condemned the action as an “outrageous incident."Biden made the statement — and joined calls for an international investigation — as the European Union imposed sanctions against Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the airspace and airports in the 27-nation bloc in reaction to Sunday's forced diversion of the Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight. The flight had originated from Greece, but was forced to land in Minsk.Also Read: EU to impose sanctions on, cut air links with Belarus after plane diversionBiden in his statement also expressed outrage over a video statement from Raman Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize massive protests against Belarus authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko, that aired on Belarusian state television Monday night.In the video clip, Pratasevich, 26, said his treatment in custody was “maximally correct and according to law.” He added that he was giving evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances.“This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press," Biden said in a statement. “The United States joins countries around the world in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by the Lukashenka regime."Separately, the White House said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday spoke with Belarus opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Sullivan told the opposition leader that the U.S. “in coordination with the EU and other allies and partners, will hold the Lukashenka regime to account."Also Read: Outrage as Belarus forces plane to land, arrests journalist on boardTwo U.S. senators urged the Biden administration to prohibit U.S. airlines from entering Belarus airspace because of the incident. “We must protect innocent passengers from despotic regimes and stand in solidarity with dissidents who are being targeted," Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a joint statement.The U.S. and the EU had already imposed sanctions Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten.“I applaud the courage and determination of Belarusians fighting for basic rights, including journalists like Raman Pratasevich and opposition leaders like Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya and her husband, Syarhey Tsikhanouski," Biden said in a statement. “The United States will continue to stand with the people of Belarus in their struggle."Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-calls-belarus-plane-diversion-an-outrageous-incident-101621902694954.html
25-05-2021||World||‘State terrorism, piracy’: Global outrage over Belarus flight diversion||Pressure was building Monday for a tough international response to Belarus’s forced landing of a European airliner so it could arrest an opposition activist.The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was diverted while in Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat.Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet on the orders of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, the plane landed in the capital Minsk where Protasevich, a 26-year-old who had been living in Lithuania, was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend.The move sparked an international outcry, with Western leaders accusing Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane.As EU leaders prepared to meet for a summit later on Monday, Brussels said it had summoned the Belarusian ambassador to condemn the “coercive act”.Belarus’s exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Protasevich’s life was in danger, calling for an international investigation and concrete steps against the regime.Belarus on Monday insisted the country had acted legally and accused the West of playing politics. “There is no doubt that the actions of our competent authorities... fully met established international rules,” foreign ministry spokesman Anatoly Glaz said in a statement, accusing the West of “politicising” the situation.The diversion of the plane was condemned in Europe, with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as “outrageous and illegal”, Poland denouncing it as “an act of state terrorism” and France calling for a “strong and united response”.NATO demanded a probe into the “serious and dangerous incident” and alliance envoys were to discuss it on Tuesday.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it “a shocking act” that “endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/state-terrorism-piracy-global-outrage-over-belarus-flight-diversion-101621902574866.html
25-05-2021||World||National Guard exits US Capitol for the first time after January 6 attack||The US Capitol stood unprotected by National Guard troops for the first time in nearly five months Monday as concerns about right-wing extremist threats have diminished since the January 6 attacks.The last 2,149 of what had been nearly 26,000 troops in an extraordinary deployment in Washington departed over the weekend as their mission to protect Congress formally ended.The troops were mobilized after hundreds of supporters of then-president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, halting the joint session of Congress to confirm Trump's rival Joe Biden as winner of the presidential election.Some broke into lawmakers' offices, and called for the killing of members of Congress and vice president Mike Pence, who was presiding over the session.Also Read: Trump administration officials to testify on January 6 riotsAmid fears of more threats around and following the January 20 inauguration of Biden, thousands of Guard troops were mobilized, patrolling the Capitol area day and night while a large fence encircled the grounds, making it appear a building under siege.The troops remained in Washington for months after the inauguration as what many dubbed an insurrection was investigated."These airmen and soldiers protected not only the grounds, but the lawmakers working on those grounds, ensuring the people's business could continue unabated," Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement.Trump, who was impeached for encouraging the assault, later claimed the attackers were "zero threat" to lawmakers and downplayed the episode.Since January 6 the FBI has arrested and charged some 440 people involved in attacking the legislature, dozens of them associated with armed militia groups.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, thanked the National Guard, calling them "American heroes and defenders of democracy.""Their presence in our temple of Democracy following January 6th, one of the most harrowing and horrific days in our history, has brought security, safety and healing to the Congress and indeed the Country," Pelosi said in a statement."It is imperative that Congress continues to take action to honor the sacrifice of law enforcement and to protect the Capitol and ensure that an attack can never again be perpetrated against it," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-exits-us-capitol-for-the-first-time-after-january-6-attack-101621901280930.html

Since then, the complaint says, the government “has bobbed and weaved in the face of every attempt” by Sondland to be fully reimbursed for the legal expenses.The suit says the unwillingness to cover Sondland's legal fees not only represented a breach of commitment and “normal convention” but was also “especially problematic in this instance because the amount of preparation needed to comply with the subpoenas was staggering."“Ambassador Sondland retained a Washington, D.C. law firm well experienced in Congressional investigations that possessed the capacity to assist him, along with his long-time personal counsel, in preparation for his critically important testimony,” the lawsuit states. “Ambassador Sondland continued to rely on Pompeo’s individual promise, on behalf of himself and the Government, in seeking outside counsel and incurred nearly $1.8 million in attorneys’ fees and costs.”The lawsuit was first reported by The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-impeachment-gordon-sondland-witness-sues-pompeo-over-1-8m-in-legal-fees-101621901323584.html
25-05-2021||World||EU to impose sanctions on, cut air links with Belarus after plane diversion||The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions on Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist.Reacting to what EU leaders called a brazen “hijacking” of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.“We won’t tolerate that one can try to play Russian roulette with the lives of innocent civilians,” said EU Council chief Charles Michel, who presided over the EU meeting.A brief video clip of Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize huge protests against Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed from the Ryanair flight.Also Read: Outrage as Belarus forces plane to land, arrests journalist on boardSitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory health and said his treatment in custody was “maximally correct and according to law.” He added that he was giving evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances.In their unusually swift action in Brussels, the EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into what they viewed as an unprecedented move and what some said amounted to state terrorism or piracy.The leaders called on their council “to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines.” In addition calling for the release of Pratasevich, they also urged authorities in Minsk to free his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off the plane with him.The text was endorsed quickly by the leaders who were determined to respond with a “strong reaction” to the incident because of the “serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian authorities,” said an EU official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly about the private talks.Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing through Belarus airspace Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-century.Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic. Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to Vilnius, Lithuania.“This is an attack on democracy,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the executive European Commission. “This is an attack on freedom of expression. And this is an attack on European sovereignty. And this outrageous behavior needs a strong answer.”Von der Leyen added that a €3 billion EU investment and economic package for Belarus will remain on hold until Belarus “turns democratic.”Also Read | Minutes to touchdown: The moment a Belarusian dissident knew his time was upU.S. President Joe Biden said late Monday that he asked his team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and international organizations.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier that the administration condemned the “shocking act” of diverting a flight to detain a journalist. She said Biden had been briefed on the incident and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue in his call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council.EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was flying between two of the bloc’s member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a member.EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc — to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the influence of Russia — but have failed so far.British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority “to request airlines avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe.” He added he was suspending the permit allowing Belavia to operate in the U.K.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian flights via the neighbor's airspace.The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten.The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as “belligerent” EU statements, insisting Minsk acted “in full conformity with international rules.”It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown.Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a “security warning.” It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched.On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened.Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The plane was searched, and no bomb was found. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary described the move as “a case of state-sponsored hijacking … state-sponsored piracy.”Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk.“He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is diverted to Minsk. He said there’s death penalty awaiting him there,” passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the plane finally arrived in Vilnius.Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests. Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have followed the channel. Belarus authorities have labeled the channel “extremist” and charged Pratasevich in absentia of inciting mass riots and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison.Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the episode needs to be investigated — but that it couldn’t be rushed. Moscow and Minsk have close political, economic and military ties, and Lukashenko has relied on Russian support amid Western sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-impose-sanctions-on-cut-air-links-with-belarus-after-plane-diversion-101621900470901.html
25-05-2021||World||Trump's govt forced deported parents to leave kids behind: Report||A government watchdog says the Trump administration, under its practice of separating families at the border, forced migrant parents to leave the US without their children, contradicting claims by officials that parents were willingly leaving them behind.The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General said in a report released Monday that it found at least 348 cases in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement had no records showing migrants wanted to leave their children in the US. It also found “some” cases in which agency officials deported parents even while knowing they wanted to take their children with them.That contradicted assertions by senior DHS officials that parents were choosing to leave their children in the US to stay with family or for other reasons while they were deported in 2017 and 2018 as the administration sought to enforce a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement.The findings, issued by Trump-appointed Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, provide new insight into a policy that became a significant political crisis for the previous administration and a continuing challenge for the current one, which is working to reunite children who remain separated even now.“Those who conceived of this travesty will have to live with the memory of their cruelty for the rest of their lives," said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is chair of the Judiciary Committee and requested the report.The Trump administration separated thousands of migrant parents from their children since the summer of 2017 as it moved to criminally prosecute people for illegally crossing the southwest border. Minors could not be held in criminal custody with their parents and were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.The mass separation of families sparked public outrage and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which also collected reports of parents being deported without the opportunity to take their children with them.“Throughout the litigation, we learned that some parents were even told their child would join them on the plane only to have the plane take off without the child," ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said.That contradicts what DHS officials were telling the public.Then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to the report, testified to Congress in December 2018 that “every parent” had a choice to take their child back to their country and those who did not “made the choice not to have the child accompany them.”Nielsen told Congress in March 2019 that there has been “no parent who has been deported, to my knowledge, without multiple opportunities to take their children with them."Nielsen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She has said previously that her agency did not set out to intentionally separate families but had no choice because the administration was criminally prosecuting border-crossers.Trump issued an executive order halting the practice of family separations in June 2018, days before a federal judge's ruling that did the same and demanded that separated families be reunited.In response to the report, ICE said it concurred with the findings and is working to address the issues around recordkeeping raised in the report.Shortly after taking office, President Joe Biden set up a task force to reunite hundreds of children who remain separated. It announced the first four reunifications this month.That effort is going on as the Biden administration confronts an increase in the number of migrants under 18 attempting to cross the southwest border by themselves.The administration has transferred about 19,000 to facilities overseen by HHS. Those children are being allowed to remain in the US while the government decides whether they have a legal claim to residency through a citizen parent or for some other reason.Meanwhile, the Biden administration continues to turn back adult migrants, including asylum-seekers, and many families crossing together under a public health order issued at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-govt-forced-deported-parents-to-leave-kids-behind-report-101621881272949.html
