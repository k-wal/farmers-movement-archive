"Do you want them breathing in your face on the strength of their honor?"Pelosi has clashed over masks with the chamber's top Republican Kevin McCarthy, who introduced a resolution that would allow lawmakers to be maskless on the House floor.House Democrats killed the measure.Some lawmakers have grown openly defiant. Republican Brian Mast said Tuesday he was fined $500 for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor.Pelosi announced such punishments for mask violations in January."This is nothing more than political theatre," House Republican Ralph Norman tweeted Thursday. "All over the Capitol complex, staff and members are maskless. It is time for @SpeakerPelosi to drop the charade."A recent Morning Consult poll found that unvaccinated Americans are about twice as likely as vaccinated people to say they are comfortable not wearing masks while doing activities like attending a work conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-us-lawmakers-a-danger-to-congress-says-nancy-pelosi-101621532162066.html
20-05-2021||World||European Union-US trade officials move towards resolving 'key differences'||European Union and U.S. top trade officials on Thursday further cemented recent advances on some key differences that have soured trans-Atlantic relations over the past few years.EU trade ministers used a virtual meeting with U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai to highlight the breakthroughs in the longstanding dispute over airplane production subsidies and a fight over steel tariffs.“We agreed that finding effective solutions together is essential to preserve our critical industries,” EU Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.“It is spring here in Brussels and there is a spirit of optimism," German Trade Minster Peter Altmaier said. It stood in sharp contrast with the four years of divisive relations under President Donald Trump.U.S. President Joe Biden will visit the EU next month seeking to further increase cooperation on anything from battling the COVID-19 pandemic and confronting a surging China as a disruptive rival.“I stressed the importance of sticking together regarding what happens in China,” Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag said.Germany's optimism was boosted further when the Biden administration on Wednesday spared the German company overseeing a natural gas pipeline from Russia into the EU, underscoring how Biden wants to mend relations with a key ally that were unsettled during the Trump administration.Even if Germany is the juggernaut of the EU's economies, France is its strategic partner in dealing with Washington, and French Foreign Trade Minister Franck Riester equally lauded “the very positive signals coming from the United States.”And the European Union has done its part too. Just on Monday, it hit the pause button and temporarily suspended some upcoming measures at the heart of a steel tariff dispute. With it, the bloc wouldn't increase some tariffs targeting U.S products, including Harley-Davidson motocycles and bourbon.And they agree to address together the global steel and aluminum excess capacity, where they see China as a common adversary.It already followed the four-month suspension of tariffs used in the longstanding Airbus-Boeing dispute. Both sides now face a July 10 deadline to find a new breakthrough.“Work is advancing. So I would say that this timeline is realistic,” Dombrovskis said. “Of course, it requires effort on both sides, but it’s possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-team-biden-take-one-more-step-towards-resolving-key-differences-101621529513467.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday described Gaza as "hell on earth" for children, appealing to Israel for rapid and unhindered aid access and telling the 193-member General Assembly he would launch an appeal for humanitarian funding.Diplomatic efforts toward a ceasefire in the Gaza war gathered pace on Thursday amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory, but fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continued.The 193-member U.N. General Assembly met on Thursday to discuss the renewed violence, but no action was expected."If there is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza today," said Guterres, adding that he would launch a full humanitarian appeal for funding as soon as possible."The hostilities have caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including roads and electricity lines, contributing to a humanitarian emergency. Crossings into Gaza have been closed and power shortages are affecting water supplies," Guterres added.Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire and urged Israel's military to exercise maximum restraint and Hamas to stop indiscriminate rocket fire. He also called on Israel to stop demolitions and evictions in the Palestinian Territories."Access for humanitarian goods is paramount. Attacks by militant groups on areas surrounding crossing points are unacceptable," Guterres said. "At the same time, Israel has a duty to allow and facilitate rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian aid ... into Gaza."Hundreds of buildings and homes have been destroyed or damaged, Guterres said, and airstrikes have damaged several hospitals. Some 50,000 people were seeking shelter in U.N. schools, mosques and other places with little access to water, food, hygiene or health services, Guterres added.The U.S. mission to the United Nations on Wednesday expressed opposition to a French push for a Security Council resolution on the conflict. France has circulated a draft text to council members, diplomats said. The United States has traditionally shielded its ally Israel at the United Nations.The French draft text, seen by Reuters, demands an immediate cessation of hostilities and condemns "the indiscriminate firing of rockets against civilian areas," without laying blame. It urges protection of civilians and revival of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians with the aim of creating two states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-hell-on-earth-for-children-un-chief-urges-israel-to-exercise-maximum-restraint-101621526772676.html

20-05-2021||World||China, US again engage in war of words over transit of warship||China on Thursday slammed the latest transit by a US warship through the South China Sea, calling it a “violation”, and adding that its navy “warned away” the American vessel from the contested waters.The US navy denied the claim by China, saying the warship “USS Curtis Wilbur was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory” from near the Paracel islands in the South China Sea.“The PLA’s statement about this mission is false. USS Curtis Wilbur was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory. USS Curtis Wilbur conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in international waters. The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea as a principle. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS Curtis Wilbur did here,” the US Navy’s 7th Fleet said.China, Taiwan and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel islands, known as Xisha islands in China.It is the second time in two days that China and the US have sparred over the passage of the same warship, which sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, which separates the self-ruled Island from China on Wednesday.The Chinese foreign ministry said it warned the US over its “provocations” in the disputed South China Sea. “China urges the US to stop infringements and provocations,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.Zhao’s remarks came after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said it “warned away” the American warship, the USS Curtis Wilbur, after it allegedly “broke into China’s Xisha territorial waters”.The Southern Theatre Command of the PLA warned the US destroyer that “its behaviour severely violated China’s sovereignty and security and undermined South China Sea’s peace and stability”.“China will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard its national sovereignty and security,” Zhao said.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China says is a breakaway region).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-again-engage-in-war-of-words-over-transit-of-warship-101621515944087.html

In April, Bourla told CNBC people will "likely" need a third booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines within 12 months.Scientists, however, are questioning the need for COVID-19 booster shots due to a lack of data to make an informed decision.There has been significant headway in ensuring vaccine equity, Fauci added, highlighting that the shots should be available in geographic locations easily accessible to minorities as a lesson for the next pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-expects-covid-19-vaccines-for-children-by-late-2021-or-early-2022-101621514485442.html
20-05-2021||World||Chinese vaccines effective against Covid variant detected in India: Expert||China’s current Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the coronavirus variant first detected in India, a leading Chinese disease control expert said on Thursday.Based on preliminary studies, the vaccines in use in China can provide protection against coronavirus infection “to a certain extent”, Shao Yiming, an expert with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in Beijing on Thursday.Shao did not share specific details of which vaccines are effective.Chinese experts had said last week that at least 18 cases of the Covid-19 variant first detected in India had been detected in China.China has been paying close attention to the variant of the coronavirus detected in India, and is conducting research and accumulating data on it, Shao said.The virus will continue mutating, therefore more changes will appear, Shao, was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.He said that China is capable of putting new, effective vaccines into use if new variants render current vaccines ineffective.Shao added that if an emerging mutated variant reaches beyond the protection efficacy of the existing vaccines, China has the capability to respond to it quickly “…because the production process is mature enough and does not require much change to produce a new vaccine against the mutation”.India until last week had not approached Chinese companies to import vaccines to tackle the current surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chinese foreign ministry told HT on May 14.China, according to agency reports, has five vaccines in use in its mass immunization campaign: Three inactivated-virus vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm, a one-shot vaccine from CanSino, and the last one from CDC in partnership with Anhui Zhifei Longcom.More than 449.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in China as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said in an update on Thursday.Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation gave the green light to China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally.It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get the UN health agency’s backing though China has already vaccinated millions of people at home, since last year, and in dozens of other countries with it.“On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined,” the WHO said.China had provided vaccine assistance to over 80 countries, three international organisations and exported jabs to over 50 countries, the Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this week.“We are also working with over 10 developing countries including Egypt and the UAE on technological transfer and cooperative production to quickly advance large-scale production of vaccines,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.China has also promised to supply 10 million vaccines to Covax, a global vaccine distribution campaign backed by the WHO.India recorded 276,110 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, Indian health ministry data showed on Thursday.The total tally now stands at 25,772,440. The country also recorded 3,874 deaths, pushing the overall death toll to 287,122.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccines-effective-against-covid-variant-detected-in-india-expert-101621514385159.html
20-05-2021||World||Canada taps female generals amid military misconduct cases||Canada is putting women generals into some of its most senior military posts, including one to run logistics for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, after a series of misconduct allegations were levied against top male officers.Critics have complained the armed forces were not doing enough to address systemic problems with sexual harassment, identified in a landmark 2015 report.Admiral Art McDonald lasted barely six weeks in the job of chief of the defense staff, Canada's top soldier, before stepping down in February for what were later revealed to be sexual misconduct allegations. He has not commented on the case.His predecessor, General Jonathan Vance, is being probed over complaints about inappropriate behavior with two female subordinates. Vance has acknowledged one relationship but denied impropriety.Late on Friday, the defense ministry announced that Major-General Dany Fortin, who was running the vaccine rollout, had stepped aside pending a probe. Fortin's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters but told the Globe and Mail his client denied the allegations, which have not been revealed."This is ... not an ideal situation to be in, particularly in this moment of crisis," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters. The furor could damage Trudeau, an avowed feminist, ahead of an election aides say he is likely to call this year. The opposition Conservative Party accuses Ottawa of acting too slowly and covering up allegations.On Monday, Fortin was replaced by Brigadier-General Krista Brodie, who health officials said had already played a pivotal role in the vaccine rollout.In March, General Mike Rouleau, vice-chief of the defense staff, was replaced by Lieutenant-General Frances Allen, the first woman to hold the job. On Friday, the armed forces announced promotions for three female generals."Part of this is trying to demonstrate that the Canadian armed forces is a place where women can fully serve," said David Perry, defense analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute think tank, "that no matter what your background is, you do have a chance to succeed."The office of Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan did not respond to a request for comment.Defense ministry data show that as of May 7, women made up just 10% of the top military and naval ranks.Last month, Ottawa put newly promoted Lieutenant-General Jennie Carignan in charge of a team addressing systemic misconduct inside the armed forces. It also asked former supreme court justice Louise Arbour to lead a probe into military harassment and sexual misconduct.This came too late for a senior female officer who quit in March, sickened by the allegations."I am not encouraged that we are 'investigating our top officers'. I am disgusted that it has taken us so long to do so," Lieutenant-Colonel Eleanor Taylor wrote in a resignation letter cited by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.Former officer Leah West welcomed the Arbour probe but said the 2015 report had already revealed the size of the problem. West said she was assaulted in 2008 by a senior officer but found no support from her immediate superior and ended up staying silent."Despite years of clear evidence that sexual misconduct is rampant in our military's culture, nothing has changed," she wrote in the Globe and Mail this month.Perry said the system had clearly failed, noting some allegations stretched back decades."What we've seen over these past months is that there is a ... culture of unacceptable actions in the military that have gone on for far too long," Trudeau said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-taps-female-generals-amid-military-misconduct-cases-101621513781722.html

To all those working on the vaccine rollout – thank you for everything you’ve done and continue to do,” said William, the Duke of Cambridge, in his message on Twitter.On Tuesday I received my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. To all those working on the vaccine rollout - thank you for everything you’ve done and continue to do. pic.twitter.com/8QP6ao5fEbIt is not yet known if his 39-year-old wife, Kate Middleton, has received her first vaccine dose as well. His 95-year-old grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his father Prince Charles, 72, have all spoken about receiving their first doses earlier this year.William’s confirmation comes as the National Health Service (NHS) expanded its vaccination programme further from over-36s to now cover all those aged 34 and over. Text messages inviting people to book a vaccination will be sent to those aged 34 and 35 from Thursday. Younger groups in their thirties are expected to be invited over the next few days and weeks, with all adults expected to be eligible from next month.“This is incredible news and means we remain on track to hit our target of offering a vaccine to all adults by the end of July,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The minister had told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening that there is “increasing confidence” that the vaccines are effective against all variants, including the B1.617.2 variant first discovered in India currently under strict monitoring in the UK.“The early evidence suggests that the B.1.617.2 variant, first discovered in India, passes on more easily from person to person than the B.117 variant, first discovered in Kent,” said Hancock.“We’ve always known one of the things that has the potential to knock us off track would be a new variant. That’s why we made the presence of a new variant that could do that one of our four tests when we set out the roadmap, which are the steps we must pass before going down each step of the roadmap,” he said, in reference to plans to completely lift lockdown restrictions from June 21 under the government's current roadmap.As the UK registered 2,967 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant, the minister said the data remains under constant review even as additional measures are being deployed.“Mobility data shows travel patterns in different areas, and we look at this in deciding where the virus is at risk of spreading. Next, we now analyse wastewater in 70 per cent of the country, and we can spot the virus, and the variants in the water, and that can help us identify communities where there is spread,” said Hancock.“What this means in practice is putting in place more testing – more testing sites – and on vaccinations, we are making more vaccinations available to everyone who’s eligible. To everybody across the whole country, I’d urge vigilance as we open up and of course, as soon as you’re able to, to get the jab,” he said.Meanwhile, on the advice of the government and Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the NHS said people aged 50 and over and the clinically vulnerable are having their second doses brought forward to counter the spread of the B.1.617.2 variant.“Getting the vaccine is the single most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our families and our communities against Covid-19, so when you’re called forward, book your appointment and join the tens of millions who have already been jabbed,” said Professor Stephen Powis, National NHS Medical Director.People 39 and under are being offered the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine in line with recently updated JCVI guidance, while all other age groups are being administered either of the two or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines based on supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-gets-covid-19-jab-as-expands-uk-vaccine-programme-further-101621509415381.html
20-05-2021||World||China builds key highway in Tibet||China has completed building a highway including a 2km mountain tunnel in a remote part of southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which ends near the border with Arunachal Pradesh, posing a security challenge to India.The highway cuts through the world’s deepest canyon, the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, and its likely terminus is Baibung county (known as Drepung in Tibetan), close to the Indian border village of Bishing in the Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh.The village of Bishing is located in Arunachal’s Gelling circle, which touches the McMahon Line, the de-facto Sino-India border in the region.The highway is part of China’s ambitious plans to build roads and tunnels along the length of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India, connecting far-flung areas to inland cities and airports.The new highway has cut down the travelling time between the Chinese border county and the nearest city area of Nyingchi prefecture by eight hours.The highway is also expected to play a key role in the surveying of and planning for the mega Yarlung Zangbo hydro-power project China is planning to build at the canyon in the same Medog county, triggering unease among downstream countries like India.Rising in TAR, the Yarlung Zangbo flows into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.The construction of the highway passing through the world’s deepest canyon with a maximum depth of 6,009 metres was completed on May 16, Chinese state media reported.It was completed after the Laohuzui 2,114-metre tunnel was built on the 67.22km road connecting Pad township in the city of Nyingchi and Medog county near the India border.The project, which was executed by China’s Huaneng Group, started in 2014, and cost 2 billion yuan ($310 million).The highway was completed 228 days ahead of its scheduled opening. “It is the second significant passageway to Medog, following the first one connecting the county and Zhamog township in Bomi county. After the new highway opens to traffic, the road length connecting the city of Nyingchi and Medog county will be shortened to 180km from 346km, cutting travel time by eight hours,” Xinhua reported.The highway was built on the “…former hiking route between Nyingchi’s Pad township and Baibung township, Medog county, with an altitude difference of up to 2,892 metres between the highest and lowest spots of the road”.All the places named in the state media report are located near the border with India.“This road has obviously an important strategic significance, first due to the proximity of the border/LAC and also due to the fact that all infrastructure development in the TAR is dual use, military and civilian. It also means more tourists at the border,” India-based Tibet specialist Claude Arpi said. “The new route will probably facilitate the survey for the mega hydro power project announced as part of the 14th Five-year plan.”Interestingly, in December, in a report on the highway, the official Tibet news website had said that the constructing the highway had proven difficult and the project was affected by geological disasters such as heavy rain during the flood season, ice and snow in winter, landslides, mudslides and avalanches.In 2018, a landslide caused by a melting glacier blocked the Yarlung Zangbo at the Sedongpu Basin in Milin county, close to the proposed site of the dam, forming an unstable lake of around 600 cubic metres of water, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported in April.Across the border, India is also building a 150-km-long Yingkiong-Bishing national highway in the Upper Siang district.Arunachal Pradesh health and family welfare minister Alo Libang said in November that the satellite survey for construction of the highway had been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-key-highway-in-tibet-101621504363053.html

The 2020 edition was also canceled due to the pandemic.Singapore's defence ministry said it supported the decision to cancel, calling it regretful but the responsible course."The cancellation of the SLD in no way reflects any reduced commitment to dialogue and engagement to ensure peace and stability in Asia and beyond," the ministry said, adding it will "find alternative and safer avenues for these important goals".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shangrila-dialogue-summit-in-singapore-cancelled-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-101621500868092.html
20-05-2021||World||World’s largest iceberg breaks off in Antarctica as glaciers retreat||An iceberg the size of the Spanish island of Majorca has broken off the coast of Antarctica, with measurements taken from satellites and planes confirming it’s now the world’s largest.  Iceberg A-76 calved from the western side of the Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica and is now floating on the Weddell Sea, the European Space Agency said. It measures around 170 kilometers (105 miles) long and 25 kilometers (15 miles) wide. That's larger than New York’s Long Island and half the size of Puerto Rico. The Antarctica ice sheet is warming faster than the rest of the planet, causing melting of snow and ice covers as well as the retreat of glaciers, especially around the Weddell Sea. As glaciers retreat, chunks of ice break off and float adrift until they break apart or crash into land. Last year, currents took iceberg A-68A, the world’s largest at the time, from Antarctica to the coast of the South Georgia Island. Scientists feared the berg would collide with an island that’s a breeding ground for sea lions and penguins, but it ended up splitting and breaking into pieces instead. Average sea levels have risen about nine inches since 1880, and about a quarter of that increase comes from ice melting in the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, along with  land-based glaciers elsewhere, according to a study published in Nature earlier this month.The study by 84 scientists from 15 countries concluded that the more ambitious national goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change set recently are not enough to stop sea levels from rising. In fact, melting glaciers and ice sheets will raise sea levels twice as fast as they would if countries fulfilled their earlier pledges under the Paris Agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-largest-iceberg-3-times-the-size-of-delhi-breaks-off-in-antarctica-101621497626358.html
20-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada’s privacy commissioners express concern over vaccine passports||Canada’s federal privacy commissioner along with his peers across all provinces of the country have voiced concerns over the possible introduction of so-called “vaccine passports”, arguing that they may encroach upon civil liberties.Vaccine passports are travel passes that are being considered by several countries in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The proposed system involves allowing only those people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to travel and attend public gatherings such as music concerts and sports events. On May 12, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had said that Canada was among the countries considering such immunity certification, particularly for international travel.But despite being open to considering vaccine passports, Trudeau himself had cautioned against the possibility of the proposed passes becoming discriminatory. “The idea of certificates of vaccination for domestic use does bring in questions of equity. There are questions of fairness and justice. There could be discrimination,” the Canadian PM had said.A statement issued jointly by privacy commissioners and ombuds across Canada, however, cautioned, “While this may offer substantial public benefit, it is an encroachment on civil liberties that should be taken only after careful consideration.”They said that while vaccine passports would allow people to travel and attend public gatherings, also supporting economic recovery while protecting public health, the system would require individuals to disclose personal health information about their vaccination status “in exchange, potentially, for access to goods and services, for example, restaurants, sporting events and airline travel”.“Vaccine passports must be developed and implemented in compliance with applicable privacy laws,” the statement said. “They should also incorporate best practices in order to achieve the highest level of privacy protection commensurate with the sensitivity of the personal health information that will be collected, used or disclosed.” The privacy commissioners also said that whether introduced by governments or by private organisations, the proposed certificates, whether digital or in paper, need to have “clear legal authority”.They were also categorical that vaccine passports should “not be used for any purpose other than Covid-19”.

The breakup of one of the world's most wealthy and powerful couples has given rise to scrutiny over what may have caused them to take the step. One of the main reasons for the divorce is believed to be the world-famous software pioneer's questionable behaviour in work-related settings, highlighted by several leading newspapers in their reports.Bill Gates pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on several occasions, the New York Times reported, quoting people familiar with the developments.Also Read: Here's what Melinda Gates may spend her fortune on after her divorceIn 2018, a sexual harassment claim against the billionaire's longtime money manager Michael Larson came to light. While Bill Gates insisted that the matter be settled internally, Melinda Gates wanted an outside investigation. At the end of the investigation, Melinda Gates was reportedly not satisfied with her husband’s handling of the matter, according to NYT. Michael Larson still works for Gates.The following year, Microsoft’s board of directors, of which Bill Gates was a part, initiated investigation into a case after being told that their co-founder had “sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” according to Frank X Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson. The incident was reported by Wall Street Journal. In 2020, Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board. However, Bridgitt Arnold, spokesperson for Bill Gates, said the affair took place 20 years ago and ended 'amicably'. “Gates’s decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter,” she added.Also Read: Bill and Melinda Gates to divorce after 27 years of marriageThe nail in the coffin is said to be the billionaire's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who faced accusations of sex trafficking and pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. When Bill Gates started spending time with him in 2011, three years after Epstein's confession, Melinda Gates expressed her discomfort. When Bill Gates did not put an end to his association with Epstein and their relationship became public in October, 2019, Melinda Gates hired divorce lawyers, according to people who attended or were briefed on gatherings with the two men, NYT reported.Arnold, however, said that characterisation of his conduct was not right. “It is extremely disappointing that there have been so many untruths published about the cause, the circumstances and the timeline of Bill Gates’s divorce,” she said.“Any claim that Gates spoke of his marriage or Melinda in a disparaging manner is false. The claim of mistreatment of employees is also false. The rumours and speculation surrounding Gates’s divorce are becoming increasingly absurd, and it’s unfortunate that people who have little to no knowledge of the situation are being characterised as ‘sources’,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-before-divorce-bill-gates-conduct-upset-melinda-report-101621486969396.html

Kejriwal's Covid comments cause stormThe South-east Asian country on Wednesday called in the Indian envoy to lodge an objection over Kejriwal's statement. The ministry of external affairs said that the chief minister “does not speak for India” and Indian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified the matter with his Singapore counterparts.Singapore’s high commissioner Simon Wong later told a virtual news conference his country was satisfied with the Indian government’s clarification, but reserved the right to invoke a domestic fake news law to prevent the spreading of misinformation.The correction orders to social media platforms were issued under Singapore's fake news law, or the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).Facebook confirmed receipt of the order and said it was legally compelled to issue the correction notice, news agency Reuters reported. A prompt on users' Facebook news feeds will link to a government website that will clarify there is no new 'Singapore' variant of Covid-19, neither there is evidence of any Covid-19 variant that is 'extremely dangerous for kid - the two claims made by Kejriwal.Twitter has so far not responded to Singapore's move.Dismissing the assertions made by Kejriwal, Singapore's health ministry said that the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tells-facebook-twitter-to-carry-correction-notice-on-covid-strain-101621488106379.html

As many as 35 Republicans supported the move, joining Democrats to hand former US president Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, a resounding rebuke by ignoring his appeal to reject such a panel.The measure passed 252-175. It has to now secure the support of the evenly split Senate where at least 10 Republicans will need to join Democrats to see it through.The legislation, which was negotiated by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House committee on homeland security, proposes to create a 10-member commission with five each from the two main parties, who will exercise equal powers of issuing subpoenas to summon witnesses. Modelled on the commission that investigated the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, it will look into the storming of the US Capitol by a huge mob incited by Trump to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.Trump, who was impeached over the insurrection and has continued to falsely claim that he lost because of election fraud, had in a statement issued just hours before the vote called for Republicans to defeat the legislation, calling it “partisan unfairness”.Charlie Crist, a Republican congressman who voted to pass the legislation, told CNN, “I voted for it is because when I saw the events of January 6, I saw a breakdown in communications. I saw a breakdown in coordination, in anticipation; and I want to get to the bottom of how our security forces allowed a breach of the people’s House, the Capitol.”Crist is among 35 Republicans who rebuffed Trump’s appeal to vote against the legislation. There is growing opposition within the Republican Party to Trump and his control over the GOP.It is a major increase from 10 House Republicans who had voted to impeach Trump for the US Capitol insurrection in January, which in itself was a huge leap from zero Republicans who had voted to impeach him in December 2019, when two Democrats had voted against the motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rebuffing-trump-republicans-join-democrats-in-bid-to-set-up-capitol-riot-probe-101621485282512.html

"We've sent seven air shipments, including health supplies, oxygen, oxygen supplies, and 95 masks, rapid diagnostic tests and medicine"."In terms of the 80 million doses (of Covid-19 vaccines), we know there's a great deal of interest in this understandably 60 million of AstraZeneca and 20 million of three other approved vaccines. Right now, it is working through an interagency process," Psaki said in response to a question.The interagency team including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and those from the State Department are discussing to determine how the United States is going to distribute and share these vaccine doses."Certainly, the plight of everything the people of India had been through is obviously on our minds… but there are also a range of countries and regions around the world that have been deeply impacted that are also in need. So, these are all factors. Hopefully we'll have more on this in the coming days," Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-provided-over-500-million-in-covid-19-relief-to-india-says-white-house-101621480076986.html

In another sign of potential escalation, militants in Lebanon fired a rocket barrage into northern Israel.After a visit to military headquarters, Netanyahu said he appreciated “the support of the American president”, but he said Israel would push ahead to return “calm and security” to Israeli citizens. He said he was “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met”.Earlier on Wednesday, Biden told Netanyahu he “expected significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire” in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, setting a deadline amid growing calls for an end to hostilities.The fourth call in a week between the two leaders came after Netanyahu, fondly referred to as “Bibi”, was quoted by the Israeli media as saying he is not setting a time frame for an end to the hostilities.“The [US] president conveyed to the [Israeli] prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,” the White House said in a readout of their call.US may veto French draft resolution on ceasefireA US spokesperson said Washington won’t support a UN Security Council draft resolution proposed by France calling for a ceasefire, saying it may undermine efforts at de-escalation.Israel said earlier that it was not setting a time frame for an end to hostilities with Gaza as its military pounded the Palestinian enclave with airstrikes and Hamas militants unleashed new cross-border rocket attacks.In a 25-minute attack overnight, Israel bombarded targets including what its military said were tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip used by Hamas. Some 50 rockets were fired from the enclave, the Israeli military said, with sirens sounding in the coastal city of Ashdod.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bibi-defies-biden-vows-more-strikes-101621477549394.html

Nearly three fifths of the total have been given in three countries: China (421.9 million), the United States (274.4 million) and India (184.4 million).In terms of population, Israel is leading the pack: nearly six Israelis out of 10 have been completely vaccinated with two shots. The UK follows, with 54% of its population having received at least one dose.EU to allow tourists fully vaccinated against CovidThe EU took a step towards relaxing tourism travel for visitors from outside the bloc, with EU ambassadors agreeing on measures to allow fully vaccinated visitors in. They have also agreed on easing the criteria for nations to be considered a safe country, from which all tourists can travel. Up to now, that list included only seven nations.Malawi destroys 20,000 expired AZ vaccine dosesMalawi has burned 20,000 doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines. The health minister K K Chiponda presided over the incineration on Wednesday at a hospital in Lilongwe.She said the burning of the vaccines will prevent those with a negative perception from hesitating to be vaccinated.

Biden announced on Monday the US will share 20 million doses from its surplus stocks of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by the end of June. This will be in addition to the earlier commitment to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.“We intend that the allocation of the vaccines will include a substantial portion through Covax, but we have not made final decisions,” Smith, a former USAID director, told reporters.The US is confident that Covax, the largest vaccine delivery platform, will undertake fair and science and data-based allocation of Covid-19 vaccines, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-80-million-jabs-to-be-routed-via-covax-us-official-101621477677479.html

20-05-2021||World||US oil pipeline paid $4.4 million to hackers after attack||The operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to a gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems.Colonial Pipeline said Wednesday that after it learned of the May 7 ransomware attack, the company took its pipeline system offline and needed to do everything in its power to restart it quickly and safely, and made the decision then to pay the ransom.“This decision was not made lightly," but it was one that had to be made, a company spokesman said. “Tens of millions of Americans rely on Colonial – hospitals, emergency medical services, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, airports, truck drivers and the traveling public.”Also Read: Why the Colonial Pipeline hack matters. ExplainedColonial Pipeline’s CEO, Joseph Blount, told The Wall Street Journal he authorized the payment because the company didn't know the extent of the damage and wasn't sure how long it would take to bring the pipeline's systems back.The FBI discourages making ransom payments to ransomware attackers, because paying encourages criminal networks around the globe who have hit thousands of businesses and health care systems in the U.S. in the past year alone. But many victims of ransomware attacks, where hackers demand large sums of money to decrypt stolen data or to prevent it from being leaked online, opt to pay.“I know that’s a highly controversial decision,” Blount told the Journal. “But it was the right thing to do for the country."Blount said Colonial paid the ransom in consultation with experts who previously dealt with the group behind the attacks, DarkSide, which rents out its ransomware to partners to carry out the actual attacks.Multiple sources had confirmed to The Associated Press that Colonial Pipeline had paid the criminals who committed the cyberattack a ransom of nearly $5 million in cryptocurrency for the software decryption key required to unscramble their data network.A ransom payment of 75 Bitcoin was paid the day after the criminals locked up Colonial’s corporate network, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of the cryptocurrency-tracking firm Elliptic. Prior to Robinson’s blog post, two people briefed on the case had confirmed the payment amount to AP.Blount told the Journal the attack was discovered around 5:30 a.m. on May 7. It took Colonial about an hour to shut down the pipeline, which has 260 delivery points across 13 states and Washington, D.C., Blount said. That helped prevent the infection from potentially migrating to the pipeline's operational controls. But there are lingering issues. Blount said Colonial is still unable to bill customers following an outage of that system.The pipeline system delivers about 45% of the gasoline consumed on the East Coast, and Colonial, which is based in Alpharetta, Georgia, halted fuel supplies for nearly a week. That led to panic-buying and shortages at gas stations from Washington, D.C. to Florida.Colonial restarted its pipeline a week ago, but it took time to resume a full delivery schedule, and the panic-buying led to gasoline shortages. More than 9,500 gas stations were out of fuel on Wednesday, including half of the gas stations in D.C. and 40% of stations in North Carolina, according to Gasbuddy.com, which tracks fuel prices and station outages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-oil-pipeline-paid-4-4-million-to-hackers-after-attack-101621470226579.html
20-05-2021||World||Twitter finds its AI tends to crop out Black people, men from photos||Twitter Inc's image-cropping algorithm has a problematic bias toward excluding Black people and men, the company said in new research on Wednesday, adding that "how to crop an image is a decision best made by people."The study by three of its machine learning researchers was conducted after user criticism last year about image previews in posts excluding Black people's faces.It found an 8% difference from demographic parity in favor of women, and a 4% favor toward white individuals.The paper cited several possible reasons, including issues with image backgrounds and eye color, but said none were an excuse."Machine learning based cropping is fundamentally flawed because it removes user agency and restricts user's expression of their own identity and values, instead imposing a normative gaze about which part of the image is considered the most interesting," the researchers wrote.To counter the problem, Twitter recently started showing standard aspect ratio photos in full - without any crop - on its mobile apps and is trying to expand that effort.The researchers also assessed whether crops favored women's bodies over heads, reflecting what is known as the "male gaze," but found that does not appear to be the case.The findings are another example of the disparate impact from artificial intelligence systems including demographic biases identified in facial recognition and text analysis, the paper said.Work by researchers at Microsoft Corp and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018 and a later U.S. government study found that facial analysis systems misidentify people of color more often than white people.Amazon Inc in 2018 scrapped an AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-finds-its-ai-tends-to-crop-out-black-people-men-from-photos-101621469163582.html

Facebook executives previously met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz via Zoom, Politico reported last week.A Reuters fact-checking team has debunked images shared on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that falsely claim to be related to the conflict.The New York Times reported on Wednesday that there has also been a surge of new groups formed on WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned encrypted messaging service, by Jewish extremists for the purpose of committing violence against Palestinians."As a private messaging service, we do not have access to the contents of people's personal chats though when information is reported to us, we take action to ban accounts we believe may be involved in causing imminent harm," a WhatsApp spokesman said. "We also quickly respond to valid legal requests from law enforcement for the limited information available to us."Social media platforms have also come under fire over allegations of censorship amid the conflict. Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Facebook-owned Instagram had mistakenly removed content about the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The Thomson Reuters Foundation also reported that Instagram and Twitter Inc had blamed glitches https://reut.rs/3ouaf0t for the deletion of posts mentioning the possible eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem.On Facebook's call with reporters on Wednesday, Bickert said the Facebook operations center was staffed by experts across the company, including native Arabic and Hebrew speakers. Facebook, which is based in California, has been criticized in the past for lacking local language expertise and resources amid violent situations in other countries.Bickert also said Facebook had activated a feature for its third-party fact-checking partners - of which Reuters is one - to use keyword detection for grouping related content around the conflict. She said it had been used in the past, for content about COVID-19, elections and U.S. and Australian wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-running-special-center-to-respond-to-content-on-israeli-gaza-conflict-101621468849673.html

The envoy still has not returned.Half an hour into Wednesday's meeting, the U.S. imposed sanctions on some ships and entities involved in construction of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would take Russian gas from the Arctic to Germany, a deal Biden has opposed. The administration decided, however, to waive sanctions on the company behind the pipeline and its chief executive.After his brief remarks, Lavrov did not respond to shouted questions on the sanctions. Before the announcement, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had said the waiving of those sanctions would help normalise ties between Moscow and Washington.Lavrov, summarizing Russia's posture toward the United States, described it as "very simple.""We are ready to discuss all the issues without exception, but under the perception that the discussion will be honest, with the facts on the table, and of course on the basis of mutual respect."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-seeks-cooperation-with-russia-but-will-respond-to-aggression-blinken-101621460317150.html
20-05-2021||World||Lawmakers clash over commission to probe US Capitol riot||Congress was divided over creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate January's deadly US Capitol storming, with Republican opposition coalescing ahead of a House vote Wednesday on the truth-seeking panel.One day after the top House Republican came out against the commission, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed opposition, raising new hurdles to getting the fact-finding probe off the ground more than four months after the riot.In January McConnell blamed then-president Donald Trump for inciting violence at the Capitol, which was overrun by Trump supporters seeking to block certification of the election won by Joe Biden.This week McConnell said he remained open to supporting a commission if changes were made to its structure, but by Wednesday he hardened his opposition."After careful consideration, I've made a decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal for another commission to study the events of January the 6th," McConnell said.He pointed to ongoing law enforcement investigations that have already resulted in hundreds of arrests, and said a new panel might cause unnecessary overlap.The gridlock came hours before the House of Representatives was to vote on legislation that would create a commission evenly split between five members chosen by Democrats and five chosen by Republicans.The measure is expected to pass the House with overwhelming support from Democrats and at least some Republicans.But McConnell's opposition, coming a day after Trump urged Republicans to oppose it, complicates passage in the Senate.The chamber is divided 50-50, but at least 10 Republicans would have to join Democrats for the measure to become law."It sounds like they are afraid of the truth, and that's most unfortunate," Pelosi told reporters, referring to Republicans.While McCarthy had slammed Pelosi's tactics for the panel, Pelosi herself said she yielded to several Republican demands including a 50-50 commission split, and equal subpoena power from the panel's chair and vice chair.John Katko, the Republican congressman who helped craft the bipartisan deal, told the House that the commission would would "depoliticized entirely."Other Republicans though say they would like broader scope to allow investigation into last year's violence at Black Lives Matter protests, but Pelosi refused.She said the panel would be similar to the high-profile 9/11 commission created in 2002.That body's two chairs, former New Jersey governor Tom Kean and ex-congressman Lee Hamilton, have endorsed a January 6 commission."As we did in the wake of September 11, it's time to set aside partisan politics and come together as Americans in common pursuit of truth and justice," the pair said in a statement Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-clash-over-commission-to-probe-us-capitol-riot-101621459853898.html
