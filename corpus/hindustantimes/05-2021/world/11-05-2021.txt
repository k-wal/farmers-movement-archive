India has maintained that issue related to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution was entirely an internal matter of the country.However, lately there has been some improvement when the two countries agreed in February to restore peace on the Line of Control. It is said that the rival officials have been interacting through the back channel diplomacy to ease tension.Khan also responded to several questions about domestic issues and defended the performance of his government which came to power in August 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-would-not-hold-talks-with-india-until-new-delhi-reverses-its-decision-on-kashmir-imran-khan-101620755205840.html
11-05-2021||World||Inside the secretive Swiss bank for the world’s richest people||In the mythology of private banking, Banque Pictet & Cie SA stands apart. Over the course of more than two centuries, the Swiss institution has discreetly tended to the assets of the very rich, led by a small crop of partners who form the most exclusive men-only club anywhere outside the Vatican.In its entire history, only 43 individuals — all men, all white — have risen to the rank of Pictet managing partner, creating a bond more enduring than your typical marriage. From their Geneva perch, they oversee more than 600 billion francs ($662 billion) in assets under management and a level of profitability far beyond larger, publicly-listed peers, often rewarding each of them with more than 20 million francs a year.  But in recent years, an unsettling new trend crept into Pictet, cracking the façade of corporate cohesion: key employees began leaving. Over the course of 2019, a dozen long-tenured relationship managers at the wealth unit departed. Within days in September of that year, four leading bankers from the team looking after Russian clients handed in their resignations. Bankers for Scandinavia and Israel followed, putting billions in assets under management at stake.At the heart of the exodus lies a culture clash. Longtime employees were bristling at the brash style of the flood of recent hires brought on to manage the money of the ultra rich, particularly the explosive growth of new wealth in Asia that has set off an aggressive race for assets and talent with bigger rivals like UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc.Yet for others, change wasn’t happening fast enough; some newcomers who had signed up to the promise of the rejuvenated Pictet were departing again in frustration.Interviews with a dozen people familiar with Pictet’s private-wealth arm reveal a business at a crossroads, confronted with the reality that, in order to stay ahead, Switzerland’s preeminent private bank must adapt. That means embracing more risk and changing the client relationship — away from the concierge-like approach that endured for generations toward a more transactional model.That can be tough for employees accustomed to the principle of caution and secrecy that guided Pictet through the centuries. But change has also brought opportunity to rethink old habits and expand the bank on the global stage.The people asked not to be identified discussing the bank’s inner workings. Pictet declined to comment for this story.While overall attrition at Pictet Wealth Management stands at an all-time low of 2.8%, the evacuation of longtime talent has reverberated through the corridors of the five-story modernist headquarters. The departures startled the partners, who viewed the outflow as an assault on an institution priding itself in flat fluctuation. So late in 2019, they gathered in a spartan conference room for what the partners call their salon meeting to learn more about what was behind the defections.Sitting in tiered formation at the large conference table, much in the same way they congregate several times a week to discuss the order of business, the men heard of tensions, a dispute over restraint and renewal rippling through the bank’s private wealth subsidiary.  “Pictet is in between two worlds,” says Pedro Araujo, a senior researcher at the University of Fribourg, who has studied Switzerland’s elite families. “They are in the old world of Geneva private bankers, and the new world of globalized finance, where they want to be present internationally, they want to grow, they want to present themselves as modern, but not too much. Two worlds that are on a collision course.”For all its tradition, Pictet has become more attuned to change in recent years. The company transformed its legal status after the end of banking secrecy in 2014, disclosing more performance metrics as a result. One of its partners, Rémy Best, had already made his mark revamping the asset-management unit. Next, he turned his attention to the wealth division, long the beating heart of Pictet. It turned out that the operation required fresh blood. And the bank found it in Boris Collardi, who performed one of the most audacious maneuvers in Swiss banking in 2018 when he abruptly left as CEO of Zurich private-banking nemesis Julius Baer and decamped to the shores of Lake Geneva to join Pictet.On the face of it, Collardi is everything that the typical Pictet stakeholder is not. More bonvivant than ascetic financier, Collardi, 46, stands apart as the first outside partner in decades. He also brought serious star power and a dose of bonhomie to the Pictet franchise that values uniformity over individualism, down to the subdued color palette of the partners’ perfectly tailored suits.Collardi, by contrast, is known to greet close colleagues with a hug or a peck on the cheek; in meetings, he is the first to take off his suit jacket and jokingly complains about having to wear a tie. His ascent to the Pictet partnership not only made him one of the youngest people in recent history to hold that title, it also tipped the scale for the first time to a majority of members in the group who aren’t descendants of the founding families.In Collardi, the partners identified a peer who could pick up from Best, a longtime acquaintance who had introduced the new hire to the other partners. And Collardi was already well versed in Asia, where Pictet was keen to tap into an affluent class of newly minted billionaires preparing to pass on their wealth to the next generation.But Collardi also had to adjust to the new reality of no longer being the undisputed leader. Instead, he is now one voice among seven, where every decision is made in unison. The weekly meetings are presided over by senior partner Renaud de Planta, who declined to comment for this story. Given that the average tenure of an active partner is 20 years, collegial harmony is the glue that holds together the senior team. That hasn’t stopped Collardi from moving swiftly in his new role. Within a year, more than 100 of his loyalists had followed him to Pictet, including close to the complete teams for the Middle East and Latin America.Collardi also accelerated an overhaul of the investment and trading platforms, replacing some of the longest-serving portfolio managers with investment advisers half their age. By the end of 2020, Pictet's wealth bankers had swelled to 1,098 from 740 just five years earlier, an expansion not dissimilar to absorbing a full-blown acquisition. The changes echo the overhaul that Collardi enacted at Julius Baer. Over the course of a decade, he turbo-charged the storied private bank, sending it on a breakneck expansion from Sao Paulo to Singapore, doubling assets under management as a result. But despite his meteoric rise, Collardi remained, by his own account at the time of the move, “only an employee.” Pictet, by contrast, offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become an entrepreneur with extra financial legroom but without the daily grind of running a publicly-listed company. Making Pictet partner brings a stake in a steady business whose owners share in more than 500 million francs in annual profit. Up until a few years ago, the firm was so old-fashioned that managing partners were expected to be addressed as Notre Sieur, a formal French title for sire. The challenge facing the partners is that in order to grow, they need to aggressively target Asia, the epicenter of wealth creation. But that requires the embrace of new — and potentially riskier — investment assets, chief among them structured products, which use derivatives to track the performance of an underlying asset.Collardi spent more than a year trying to win backing from the other partners to push Pictet to sell its own products in that asset class. The others weren’t convinced, priding themselves in their track record of never having endured a defaulted loan. The project was watered down in early 2020 and Pictet settled for the less-risky option of being a broker selling other bank’s structured products.Asia has nevertheless remained an important focus for Collardi’s reorganization, where he wants to break into the ranks of the top 10 private banks. For now, Pictet is willing to wait for clients to come to the bank once they are ready for a risk-averse approach to wealth management. Collardi appointed Fong Seng Tee, a banker he knew from his time at Credit Suisse Group AG, as the head for the wealth arm’s Asia division, pushing the existing leader into a more ceremonial chairmanship position. He also brought an ally over from Baer to run a new Middle East region, stripping the territory from the longtime banker who oversaw the wealth business for Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.While Pictet has steadily grown over the years, it has so far avoided the tense transitions to a modernized corporate structure embraced by other well-known former partnerships, notably Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lazard Ltd.  Pictet may still be much smaller than publicly-listed wealth managers, but the bank packs a punch when it comes to profitability. Pictet long managed to achieve a return on equity above 40%, a number that's unheard of for any modern bank. While the figure has come down to between 16% and 21% in the past half decade, it's still a cut above UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer.The transformation in 2014 into a limited partnership removed the risk of the partners bearing the full brunt of losses. As a result of the change in legal status, Pictet began publicly disclosing performance data. Suddenly, Pictet was forced to reckon with its haphazard organization that often put personal relationships before a systematic structure. Until then, it wasn’t unusual for bankers to act independently with no uniform approach to clients, for example sending out correspondence using their own fonts and letterheads. Among historic quirks, some employees didn’t have a formal work contract — joining the bank was a social compact with a benevolent patriarchy holding a protective hand over its flock. Pictet embarked on a long march into the 21st Century, guided by one of its partners. A former McKinsey executive, Rémy Best was attuned to performance metrics and organizational optimization. Fresh from turning Pictet’s asset management arm into a metric-minded profit generator, Best next set his eyes on wealth management, long a protected sanctuary at Pictet because it used to bring in the bulk of money.The bank took a hard look at which private wealth customers were bringing in the lion’s share of revenue, realizing that some were costing Pictet too much, while others still should be targeted more aggressively to buy more services.Best’s forensic approach caused a stir among employees. Pictet’s private bankers hadn’t previously been required to disclose their clients, or say how much money they were making for the bank. Personal customer relationships gave way to faceless scorecards measuring net new money, return on assets, and whether bankers met growth targets.The details were made available to an army of internal business managers poring over the numbers, often re-assigning clients by funneling them into categories based on wealth, location and level of activity with the bank. Some individual bankers lost coveted clients to new teams with regional focuses, and others bristled at what they saw as an unvarnished style of the newer hires. Still others threw up their hands and decided to leave.The tone of modern corporate efficiency can grate in a firm where former managing partner Nicolas Pictet once told his employees that retaining a client was more important than making a profit. The company has also grown past the point where partners could regularly act as rainmakers on a hard-fought deal or bringing on a big client.But as owners of a private partnership, they still stand apart from the rank-and-file. After all, a confidential calculation determines how much profit is kept for the partners and how much is distributed to the rest of the bank to support the firm’s entire equity structure.  Each time a partner joins the reigning fellowship, he is required to purchase a substantial stake of the company. To finance the transaction, existing partners provide a loan to their newest member, who pays them back over time. A departing partner must start selling his share back to the bank. To support this ebb and flow of stakes, the bank aims for a minimum 20% return on equity.Maintaining that level has become harder amid mounting competition and higher compliance costs. When profitability has dropped below 20%, employees have felt the pain in their personal compensation, which contains a variable component tied to the annual results. That, in turn, has led to a growing divide between average employees and the partners, who have continued to enjoy their steady inflow.During a presentation in February, a cherished Pictet ritual held online for the first time this year, de Planta laid out last year’s key numbers. The bank was buoyed like many others by the market volatility the pandemic provided — from the boom in investing revenue to a rebound in variable compensation for employees and a record number of assets under management as clients sought safety.But while the partners spoke at length about performance, charitable efforts or Pictet’s gleaming new building slowly rising on the outskirts of Geneva, one member from their group remained conspicuously absent: Collardi didn’t speak or show once during the presentation.Instead, the man most associated with Pictet’s turbulent last years had slipped into the background.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-the-secretive-swiss-bank-for-the-world-s-richest-people-101620747721099.html
11-05-2021||World||Beijing's new Covid-19 firewall shores up to keep out infection||China is shoring up its border to fence all provinces and cities to keep out the novel coronavirus after the nation largely banished the pandemic after it first emerged in the city of Wuhan, known as Beijing's new Covid firewall.Frank Chen, writing in Asia Times, said that Beijing's authorities aren't taking any chances of a premature reopening as vaccinations lag and new Covid variants ravage neighbouring nations, particularly India.The measures were hastily put in place before the summer of 2020 and now China's firewall has become nearly impregnable and is being strengthened as the West edges towards loosening its entry requirements as caseloads fall amid vaccination campaigns.Meanwhile, the different approaches of China and the West are plain to see as Chinese ministries responsible for health and border protection have scrambled to send updated directives to border cities, airports and checkpoints that aim to beef up the country's defenses against so-called "backflows", wrote Chen.In the West there is widespread optimism about travel bubbles, vaccine passports and mutual recognition of tests and inoculations for transatlantic travel and exchanges now that the focus of the global contagion has shifted back to Asia.Dr Jennifer Huang Bouey, an epidemiologist and China policy studies specialist at the California-based think tank RAND Corporation, noted in her blog that huge risks could be lurking beneath the surface of China's weeks-long streak of zero local infections as any resurgence could be "explosive" with such a low level of vaccinations. The last time Chinese state media acknowledged local cases was in early April.The expert noted that strict border controls meant few Chinese have naturally acquired immunity against the new viral mutants while at the same time the efficacy of China's vaccines against the new strains remains largely uncertain.Currently, China only grants admission to foreigners with work visas and stay permits who must get clean slates in blood serum and polymerase chain reaction tests 24 hours before their departure. Upon arrival in China, they must undergo up to three weeks of quarantine as well as multiple subsequent tests before they are granted admission, reported Asia Times.Also, China's slow vaccine take-up also means the masses are ill-prepared for any influx of the virus from border re-openings. The NHC's previous vaccination target of 40 per cent of the entire population, or 560 million Chinese, by the end of June now looks unachievable as daily jabs administered nationwide continue to hover around five million, half of the original goal.The NHC said on Monday that more than 324 million doses had been given, though it didn't say how many have received the two shots needed to be fully vaccinated. Experts now warn that the slow pace of vaccination combined with people's hesitancy has left Beijing with no choice but to fortify the border firewall, reported Asia Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijings-new-covid-19-firewall-shores-up-to-keep-out-infection-101620752398444.html
11-05-2021||World||Myanmar marks 100 days of junta rule with protests||Protesters rallied in towns and cities around Myanmar on Tuesday to denounce its military rulers, 100 days after the generals' overthrow of an elected government plunged the country into its biggest crisis in decades.Demonstrators took part in marches, motorcycle convoys and flash protests to evade security forces, some making three-finger gestures of defiance as anti-coup groups renewed calls for the toppling of a junta condemned around the world for killing hundreds of civilians.The junta has struggled to govern Myanmar since seizing power on Feb. 1, with protests, strikes and a civil disobedience campaign crippling businesses and the bureaucracy, in an overwhelming public rejection of the return of military rule.Protesters in the biggest city Yangon carried a banner saying "Yangon strikes for complete removal of the enemy", while demonstrators in Hpakant in northern Kachin State marched chanting "the revolution must prevail".Demonstrators in Hpakant, the Saigang region and elsewhere held signs in support of strikes and a National Unity Government (NUG), a coalition of anti-junta elements that has declared itself Myanmar's legitimate authority.The military arrested elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi hours before a coup that it said was to protect the country's fledgling democracy after a November election whch it said was marred by fraud. Suu Kyi's party, which won in a landslide, has rejected that.Despite the imposition of limited economic sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others, the junta has shown no sign of compromise. It has the tacit support of neighbouring China, a major investor and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.Tuesday's protests took place amid sporadic violence in the country that has included fatal attacks on military-appointed administrators and a weeks of small blasts involving homemade bombs, which the junta says is the work of the ousted government.The NUG has said the military has orchestrated much of the unrest as a pretext to intensify its crackdown.News reporting and information flow inside Myanmar has been severely impacted since the coup, with restrictions on internet access, a ban on foreign broadcasts and some news organisations ordered to close, accused by authorities of inciting rebellion.Security forces have killed 781 people since the coup, including 52 children, and 3,843 people are in detention, according to monitoring group the Association for Political Prisoners, whose figures are being used by the United Nations.The U.N. human rights body on Tuesday said the military was showing no letup in its efforts to consolidate power.In said in a statement that human rights violations went beyond the killings and included raids on homes, forced disappearances, illegal detention and the dismissal or suspension of thousands of civil servants."It is clear that there needs to be greater international involvement to prevent the human rights situation in Myanmar from deteriorating further," said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-marks-100-days-of-junta-rule-with-protests-101620737962064.html

11-05-2021||World||Uber, Lyft to offer free rides to vaccination sites in US: White House||The White House announced new efforts to vaccinate Americans, including an expansion of free rides from Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. to get shots and a partnership with community colleges to administer vaccines.Lyft and Uber will offer free rides through July 4 to anyone going to get vaccinated in the U.S., the White House said on Tuesday. It’s an expansion of programs they were already providing to some low-income users in cooperation with pharmacies and non-profits.The Biden administration and its federal pharmacy partners are also seeking to start on-site vaccination clinics at community colleges in a bid to inoculate students, staff and those in nearby communities. The White House said it had selected community colleges because of the diversity of their student populations.The announcement comes as President Joe Biden is poised to meet virtually on Tuesday with the leaders of Massachusetts, Utah, Ohio, New Mexico, Maine and Minnesota to discuss “innovative ways governors are working to get the people in their states vaccinated,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive officer, and John Zimmer, Lyft’s president, urged Americans to get vaccinated in separate statements confirming the expanded programs.Biden has said the country is in a new phase of its vaccination campaign as domestic demand weakens. The U.S. is administering about 2.1 million shots per day, down from 3.4 million about a month ago, even though there’s enough supply to give more.But coronavirus cases are falling at an even faster pace than vaccinations. The U.S. reported 21,767 new cases on Sunday, the lowest daily total since June 2020. In early April, the country was still averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, according to federal data.The pool of people who will eagerly seek out an appointment to get a vaccine is all but exhausted, forcing the government to shift its attention to those willing to take it but who don’t want to go out of their way.The administration’s moves include winding down mass vaccination clinics while steering more shots to rural and mobile sites. Some states are offering incentives: West Virginia Governor Jim Justice has proposed giving a $100 savings bond to anyone age 16-35 who gets a shot, while leaders in New Jersey, New Orleans and Washington, D.C., have offered beers and shots of liquor.“We always expected we’d be in a different phase,” Psaki said Monday. “And it means we have to work extra hard to get into communities, to have partnerships with local doctors, with primary care physicians, to expand access, expand mobile units that are going into communities to get the supply out to people.”Biden and his team have repeatedly dismissed any suggestion of requiring vaccination or creating a federal registry of people who have gotten their shots, instead focusing on increasing information about vaccine safety and efficacy and access to shots.Biden’s latest target calls for 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one shot by July 4; about 58% have gotten one as of now.Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a top Biden medical adviser, said reaching the president’s target likely will prevent major flare-ups later this year.“The larger proportion of the population that’s vaccinated, the less likelihood that in a season like the coming fall or winter you’re going to see a significant surge,” Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-lyft-to-offer-free-rides-to-vaccination-sites-in-us-white-house-101620751094968.html

The Kremlin has sharply criticised the crackdown on Medvedchuk.Medvedchuk could not immediately be reached for comment. He has previously denied all wrongdoing and described the crackdown against him and his associates as illegal and designed to deflect from the Ukrainian government's policy blunders.Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said in a statement that she had put her signature "on the reports of suspicion of two deputies of the Ukrainian Parliament - M and K."Interfax Ukraine and other media said the initials referred to Medvedchuk and Taras Kozak, the owner of the three television channels that were put under sanctions in February. Kozak could not immediately be reached for comment.Venediktova is due to give a news conference at 1500 GMT alongside the head of the state security service.Medvedchuk is a Ukrainian citizen but has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has said the Russian leader is godfather to his daughter. The Kremlin in February said it was alarmed by the sanctions against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-advances-treason-case-against-kremlin-ally-medvedchuk-reports-101620741244104.html
11-05-2021||World||Veteran AP journalist Sally Buzbee to head The Washington Post, first woman to hold the job||Sally Buzbee, senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press, was named Tuesday as executive editor of The Washington Post, succeeding the recently retired Marty Baron.As AP’s top editor since 2017, Buzbee has directed AP’s journalism through the Covid-19 pandemic, Donald Trump’s presidency, the #MeToo movement, Brexit, protests over racial injustice and the 2020 U.S. election.Her emphasis on live coverage of breaking news events in all formats, augmented by deep enterprise reporting, has helped yield top awards, including Pulitzer prizes in feature photography and international reporting, along with six other Pulitzer finalists.In appointing Buzbee to one of the most high-profile jobs in journalism, Fred Ryan, the newspaper's publisher and CEO, pointed to her achievements and experience in leading a global news organization.“In an extensive search that included many of the best journalists in America, Sally stood out as the right person to lead the Post going forward,” Ryan said. “She is widely admired for her absolute integrity, boundless energy and dedication to the essential role journalism plays in safeguarding our democracy.”Buzbee previously served as the agency’s Washington bureau chief, and before that was Middle East editor, among many other positions in an AP career stretching back to 1988.At the Post, Buzbee succeeds the widely revered Baron, who had led the Post since 2013, guiding the news organization’s resurgence under the ownership of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Baron retired earlier this year at age 66.“I’ve been blessed to have one of the best jobs in journalism, and I’m excited to take on a whole new challenge,” Buzbee said. “The Post has a strong legacy, a committed staff, and is doing some of the most innovative work to engage new audiences.”Buzbee, originally from Olathe, Kansas, joined the AP as a reporter in Topeka. She was correspondent in San Diego, and then in 1995 joined the Washington bureau, where she eventually became assistant chief of bureau.In 2004, Buzbee became AP’s Middle East editor, based in Cairo, where she led coverage of the war in Iraq, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Darfur crisis and the growth of terrorist cells in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and elsewhere.In early 2010, she was promoted to deputy managing editor at the agency’s New York headquarters and led the founding of the Nerve Center, AP’s now-integral hub for global news coordination and customer communication. Later that year, she was named chief of the Washington bureau, where she oversaw coverage of the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, the White House, Congress, the Pentagon and the bureau’s polling and investigative teams.“This is bittersweet news for the AP,” President and CEO Gary Pruitt said. “Sally has been an exceptional leader, guiding AP’s journalists and news report through some of the most pivotal news events of our time. We are sorry to lose Sally but very happy for her as she takes the next step in her career. We look forward to watching Sally succeed at the Post.”Buzbee will begin her new position on June 1. and The AP announced Tuesday that it was immediately launching a search for a new executive editor. The process is expected to take a few months.Until a selection is made, the executive editor duties will be shared by AP Vice President and Managing Editor Brian Carovillano, who will lead AP’s news report, and AP Vice President and Managing Editor David Scott, who will handle news operations.“The journalists of the AP are some of the world’s best people —bold, brave and utterly committed to the facts,” Buzbee said. “Each day they tell the world’s stories with accuracy, precision and flair, and the world depends on AP for that solid information. It has been a huge honor and joy to work with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aps-sally-buzbee-to-head-the-washington-post-first-woman-to-hold-the-job-101620745382961.html
11-05-2021||World||Israel hits Gaza with airstrikes as Netanyahu vows to step up attacks on Hamas||Israel unleashed new airstrikes on Gaza early Tuesday, hitting a pair of high-rise buildings believed to be housing militants, as Hamas and other armed groups bombarded southern Israel with hundreds of rockets. The conflict escalated relentlessly throughout the day, and Israel vowed that its strikes would only increase.The latest exchange of fire was sparked by weeks of tensions in contested Jerusalem.Since sundown Monday, 26 Palestinians — including nine children and a woman— were killed in Gaza, most by airstrikes, Gaza health officials said. The Israeli military said at least 16 of the dead were militants. During the same period, Gaza militants fired hundreds of rockets toward Israel, killing two Israeli civilians and wounding 10 others.But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning in the evening that more was coming. He said after meeting with senior defense officials that Israel would “increase even more the strength of the strikes and also the rate of the strikes” against Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the Gaza Strip.“Hamas will receive blows now that it didn’t expect,” he said in a statement.In a further sign of rising tensions, Israel signaled it is widening its military campaign. The military said it is sending troop reinforcements to the Gaza border and the defense minister ordered the mobilization of 5,000 reserve soldiers.Even as the two sides ramped up tensions, officials said Egypt was working on brokering a cease-fire.Also Read | Explained: What's behind the Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Jerusalem?The barrage of rockets and airstrikes was preceded by hours of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, including dramatic confrontations at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a sacred site to both Jews and Muslims. The current violence, like previous rounds, including the last intifada, or uprising, has been fueled by conflicting claims over Jerusalem, which is at the emotional core of the long conflict.In a sign of widening unrest, hundreds of residents of Arab communities across Israel staged overnight demonstrations — denouncing the recent actions of Israeli security forces against Palestinians. It was one of the largest protests by Palestinian citizens in Israel in recent years.Israel and Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel’s destruction, have fought three wars and numerous skirmishes since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Recent rounds of fighting have usually ended after a few days, often helped by behind-the-scenes mediation by Qatar, Egypt and others.An Egyptian official confirmed that the country was trying to broker a truce. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing sensitive diplomacy, said Israeli actions in Jerusalem had complicated those efforts. A Palestinian security official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the cease-fire efforts.Even before he vowed more strikes, Netanyahu had warned that fighting could “continue for some time.” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that the military was in “the early stages” of its strikes.Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes, including two that targeted high-rise buildings where militants were believed to be hiding.At midday, an airstrike hit an apartment building in central Gaza City. Local media said an unknown number of militants had been killed. But the force of the blast sent terrified residents, including women and children who were barefoot, running into the streets.An earlier airstrike struck a high-rise elsewhere in Gaza City as people were conducting dawn prayers, residents said. Health officials said two men and a woman were killed. The woman’s 19-year-old disabled son was among the dead, residents said.Ashraf al-Kidra, spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, said a total of 26 people, including nine children and the woman, were killed and 122 people were wounded. He said Israel's “relentless assault” was overwhelming the health care system, which has been struggling with a COVID-19 outbreak.The escalation comes at a time of political limbo in Israel.Netanyahu has been acting as a caretaker prime minister since an inconclusive parliamentary election in March. He tried and failed to form a coalition government with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies, and the task was handed to his political rivals last week.One of those rivals is Israel’s defense minister, who is overseeing the Gaza campaign. It was not clear whether the toxic political atmosphere is spilling over into military decision-making, though the rival camps have unanimously expressed support for striking Hamas hard.The support of an Arab-backed party with Islamist roots is key for the anti-Netanyahu bloc’s efforts. But the current tensions might deter the party’s leader, Mansour Abbas, from joining a coalition for now. The sides have three more weeks to reach a deal.The current round of violence in Jerusalem coincided with the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in mid-April.Critics say heavy-handed police measures helped stoke nightly unrest, including a decision to temporarily seal off a popular gathering spot where Palestinian residents would meet after evening prayers. Another flashpoint was the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where dozens of Palestinians are under treat of eviction by Jewish settlers.Over the weekend, confrontations erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is the third holiest site of Islam and the holiest site in Judaism.Over several days, Israel police fired tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets at Palestinians in the compound who hurled stones and chairs. At times, police fired stun grenades into the carpeted mosque.On Monday evening, Hamas began firing rockets from Gaza, setting off air raid sirens as far as Jerusalem. From there on, the escalation was rapid.Conricus, the army spokesman, said Gaza militants fired more than 250 rockets at Israel, with about one-third falling short and landing in Gaza.The army said that a rocket landed a direct hit on a seven-story apartment block in the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israeli paramedic service Magen David Adom said it treated six people injured in the rocket strike. Two were hospitalized in moderate condition.Later, a second building in the city of Ashdod was hit, lightly wounding four people, Israeli police said.Conricus said the military hit 130 targets in Gaza, including two tunnels militants were digging under the border with Israel. He said Israel’s new system of concrete barriers and electronic sensors, intended to thwart tunnel digging, has proven effective.He did not address Gaza Health Ministry reports about the dead children.In Gaza, most of the deaths were attributed to airstrikes. However, seven of the deaths were members of a single family, including three children, who died in an explosion in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun. It was not clear if the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike or errant rocket.Dozens of mourners took part in the funeral of Hussein Hamad, an 11-year-old boy who was among the dead.More than 100 Gazans were wounded in the airstrikes, the Health Ministry said.Israel struck scores of Gaza homes in its 2014 war with Hamas, arguing it was aiming at militants, but also killing many civilians. The practice drew broad international condemnation at the time.Israel’s tactics in Jerusalem have drawn angry reactions from the Muslim world.Regional power house Saudi Arabia on Monday condemned in the strongest terms what it said were attacks by Israeli forces against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa and the safety of its worshippers. The Saudi Foreign Ministry called Tuesday on the international community to hold Israeli forces responsible for any escalation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-hits-gaza-with-airstrikes-as-netanyahu-vows-to-step-up-attacks-on-hamas-101620741944926.html

Some 29 patients died."The presence of neutralising antibodies, while reducing over time, was very persistent -- eight months after diagnosis, there were only three patients who no longer showed positivity to the test," said the statement, issued jointly with the ISS.The study, published in the Nature Communications scientific journal, also emphasised the importance of the development of antibodies in recovering from coronavirus."Those who failed to produce them within the first 15 days of infection are at greater risk of developing severe forms of Covid-19," it said.Two thirds of the patients surveyed were men, and the average age was 63. Some 57 percent of them had a pre-existing pathology, notably hypertension and diabetes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-antibodies-last-8-months-after-infection-says-study-101620741297024.html
11-05-2021||World||India shouldn’t copy China’s birth-control policies, say experts||India should not copy China’s birth-control policies and instead try to learn from its neighbour’s experience of countering the challenges of an ageing population, experts have said.Experts told HT that it is already too late for China to reverse the falling fertility rate, and the one-child policy, which is said to have kept China’s population down by hundreds of millions, should have been reversed at least three decades ago.China’s latest census on Tuesday revealed that its population increased by only about 72 million in the last decade to reach 1.41 billion compared to India’s 1.37 billion.The world’s most populated country is now staring at a shrinking labour force, an ageing population dependent on social welfare, and falling demand in the years ahead.“India should stop making population an excuse (for all its problems) and plan for a large population through investment in health, nutrition and skill development,” said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the New Delhi-based Population Foundation of India.“Population is a boon, not a bane,” said Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert at the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation, indicating that India should not put in place any strict birth-control measures.For China, Huang said the situation is going to get “worse and worse” as “demand shrinks, labour force shrinks, and the burden of pension goes up”.Huang added, “India is in a much better situation. Now and in the future. If you look at the number of births, India has twice as many as China’s children per year. I am very jealous of India frankly.”“Population is positive, future population is strength. Not weakness,” said Huang, who has studied and researched on demographics at Johns Hopkins and Harvard universities in the US.Yi Fuxian, a scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison, has long argued that India’s population has already overtaken China’s because officials here had overestimated the number of births between 1990 and 2016 by almost 90 million.In an email interaction with HT, Yi shared a paper he had written on China’s latest census.“On May 22, 2017, I was invited to speak at a seminar on demographic situation and economic development organised by Peking University. I said at the symposium that China’s population was overestimated by 90 million (100 million if taking account of Chinese migration to other countries), and India’s population had already overtaken China’s,” he wrote in the paper.India has maintained a fertility rate of around 2.3, which indicates that its population may surpass China’s by 2023 or 2024, He Yafu, an independent demographer told Chinese state media on Tuesday, which is sooner than a UN prediction in 2019 that this would happen by 2027.Some Chinese demographers also predicted that India’s population may overtake that of China as early as in 2022. Huang said that in the future, India will experience a sharp decline in fertility rate. “When India gets richer, I think you also need to handle this problem. But now I think the people in India have the mindset of China 30 years ago, which is that we have too many people. That’s not the case,” he said.“India’s population is certainly young compared to China and bodes well for the future. Demographers call this advantage ‘demographic dividend’, which means the share of the working age population has risen, implying a fall in dependency ratio. We must learn from China’s experiences and the proven inefficacy of coercive population policies,” Muttreja said.Muttreja said that every year, 12 million to 14 million people enter the workforce in India, and India needs to take advantage of that “dividend”.For that, India should invest in quality education, particularly for girls, different skill-building initiatives, and identifying employment pathways. Women’s empowerment and a greater gender equitable environment will assist girls and young women to complete their education, delay marriage and pregnancy and enter the labour force, she argued.“Stepping up investments in health, nutrition, and social conditions will naturally result in fertility decline and help India achieve its development goals,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-shouldn-t-copy-china-s-birth-control-policies-say-experts-101620741987158.html

Nearly 60% of the population have had two doses, the WHO said.The ministry said 80% of those needing hospital treatment had not been vaccinated and tended to be people with co-morbidities. The ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment.The WHO has said a large Phase III trial of Sinopharm has shown that two doses, administered at an interval of 21 days, have an efficacy of 79% against symptomatic infection, 14 or more days after the second dose. AstraZeneca said its March its Covid-19 vaccine was 76% effective.The WHO approved the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency on Friday. The decision also clears the way for the vaccine to be included in COVAX, a global programme to provide vaccines mainly for poor countries.The total number of confirmed cases in Seychelles since the pandemic began is less than 8,200. Cases dropped slightly from May 7 to May 8, the ministry statement said, but "the rate of transmission remains high and is of concern".The WHO said vaccination alone would not stop transmission entirely, and preventive health measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing and hand washing must continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reviewing-seychelles-covid-19-data-after-fully-vaccinated-people-test-positive-101620740707448.html

He’s also asking a panel of European data regulators to take action and issue a bloc-wide regulation. The new WhatsApp terms formally authorizing the data scoop are invalid because they are intransparent, inconsistent and overly broad, he said.“The order aims to secure the rights and freedoms of millions of users which are agreeing to the terms Germany-wide,” Caspar said in a statement on Tuesday. “We need to prevent damage and disadvantages linked to such a black-box-procedure.”A German spokeswoman for Facebook didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.Also Read | Users not accepting privacy terms to face limited functionality: WhatsAppThe company has faced global criticism over the new terms WhatsApp users are required to accept by May 15. Caspar said Facebook may already be wrongfully handling data and said it’s important to prevent misuse of the information to influence the German national election in September.The order strikes at the heart of Facebook’s business model and advertising strategy. It echoes a similar and contested step by Germany’s antitrust office attacking the network’s habit of collecting data about what users do online and merging the information with their Facebook profiles. That trove of information allows ads to be tailored to individual users -- creating a cash cow for Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-ordered-to-stop-collecting-german-whatsapp-users-data-101620737831435.html
11-05-2021||World||Taiwan denounces China's 'shameless lies' about WHO access||Taiwan's foreign minister criticised what he called China's "shameless lies" on Tuesday in an escalating dispute about Beijing blocking the island from the World Health Organization (WHO), saying China clearly did not care about Taiwan's people.The United States and the rich-nation Group of Seven (G7) have called for Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled Taiwan to attend the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, which meets from May 24.Taiwan is excluded from most global organisations such as the WHO because of the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces not a country.China's foreign ministry said on Monday that "appropriate arrangements" have been made for Taiwan's participation in global health matters and that nobody cared more for Taiwan's people than the Chinese government."Shameless lies! Just goes to show the CCP can't tell the truth," Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter, referring to China's ruling Communist Party."After what Beijing has done to Xinjiang, Tibet & Hong Kong, no sane person would believe it could take care of Taiwan's health needs or otherwise," Wu added. "Thank God we aren't under China's control! Please help us keep it at a distance."Wu said China's Communist Party could not claim to speak for Taiwan as it has never ruled it and only the island's democratically elected government can represent its people.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the blame lay with Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for refusing to accept the island was part of China."The DPP authorities know this well. Taiwan compatriots are our flesh and blood. The Chinese central government takes all necessary measures to ensure the health and well-being of the Taiwan compatriots," she added.While the WHO cooperates with Taiwan's technical experts on COVID-19, it is up to member states whether to invite Taiwan to observe the WHO meeting, the WHO's principal legal officer Steve Solomon said on Monday.China can easily corral enough countries to support blocking Taiwan from the World Health Assembly, according to diplomats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-denounces-china-s-shameless-lies-about-who-access-101620724351439.html

11-05-2021||World||US schools fight to keep students amid fear of dropout surge||US educators are doing everything they can to track down high school students who stopped showing up to classes and to help them get the credits needed to graduate, amid an anticipated surge in the country's dropout rate during the coronavirus pandemic.There isn't data available yet on how the pandemic has affected the nation's overall dropout rate — 2019 is the last year for which it is available — and many school officials say it's too early to know how many students who stopped logging on for distance learning don't plan to return. But soaring numbers of students who are failing classes or are chronically absent have experts fearing the worst, and schools have been busy tracking down wayward seniors through social media, knocking on their doors, assigning staff to help them make up for lost time and, in some cases, even relaxing graduation requirements.“When students drop out, they typically look for an out, an opportunity to leave. And this has provided that, unfortunately,” Sandy Addis, chairman of the National Dropout Prevention Center, said recently, referring to the pandemic. His group believes the dropout rate has spiked this year and will remain high for years.At one high school in Kansas City, Kansas, staff members have made thousands of calls to the families of at-risk students, said Troy Pitsch, who supervises high school principals in the city.“If we lose a student, it is going to be after kicking and screaming and fighting tooth and nail for them,” Pitsch said.Many districts were forgiving last spring when schools shut down abruptly, freezing grades unless students wanted to improve them. That made this year the first for which schools would feel the full effects of the pandemic on student performance and engagement.The early signs aren't encouraging. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization warned that the pandemic had put 24 million children worldwide at risk of dropping out of school. And the pandemic's effects could erase gains the U.S. made in reducing its dropout rate, which fell from 9.3% in 2007 to 5.1% in 2019, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Not finishing high school significantly hurts a person's earning potential, with dropouts bringing home an average of $150 less per week than graduates, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.To keep students on track, some local governments and school systems have waived certain testing requirements for graduation or changed grading policies so that missed assignments aren't as damaging. But such leniency carries the risk of watering down academic standards, said Russell Rumberger, a professor emeritus of education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has written about dropouts.“If they let you pass with a D and you don’t have to do very much to do it, maybe technically you are getting a diploma, but you are not getting the same type of diploma you may have gotten prior to the pandemic, when the standards were higher," he said.A National Dropout Prevention Center report predicted a doubling or tripling of the number of students who were at risk of falling behind academically and not graduating.Among them for much of this school year was Jose Solano-Hernandez, a 17-year-old senior at Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, Kansas. In January, when he was at his lowest point following the deaths of one grandparent from COVID-19 and another from cancer in the same week, he estimated that he had missed eight assignments in each of his classes.“I wouldn’t make my parents proud,” he recalled thinking as he struggled to learn virtually at night while working by day at a mechanic's shop.Solano-Hernandez has been slowly chipping away at his backlog of work since his school brought back him and other struggling seniors for extra in-person help more than a month before the rest of the student body returned at the end of March. He said the change brought “relief" and he's now hopeful he'll graduate.Mary Stewart, the school's principal, said there was “radio silence” from hundreds of students in the fall. But the number who weren't accounted for shrank to about 40 by the spring after staff hunted down siblings and scrolled through Facebook searching for clues to their whereabouts.“I went to a house of a young man the day before Thanksgiving and found that he had self-isolated in his room because of a mental health issue,” she said. “That is very common. Whatever happens in the community and in the world, we are a micro-system of that.”The pandemic also has taken a toll on students at North Grand High School in Chicago.Principal Emily Feltes said some of her students took on jobs to support their families and others fell ill. Her students returned for part-time in-person instruction in April, but she's worried that dropout numbers will rise.“We have done everything that we think that we can to try to re-engage kids — to try to help them. And I know that my colleagues are all working really hard too," she said. “But the reality is that this has been a worldwide and a national trauma."Persuading reluctant students to return isn't easy. At Orange County Public Schools in the Orlando, Florida, area, substitute teacher Patrice Pullen was assigned in December to oversee a group of 13 seniors who fell behind during virtual learning. She said it became clear on her first day that her most important job would be “rebranding” the students, who had come to see themselves as failures.“You have kids — and I’m not exaggerating — they had zeros. They had not turned in anything since August, since school started,” she said. Now, eleven are on track to graduate and the other two are close to being on track.At Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the 185,000-student district saw the percentage of middle school and high school students earning F’s in at least two classes jump by 83% in the fall.The spring numbers returned to more normal levels as the district made several changes, including dropping the minimum number of assignments per quarter from nine to six and allowing teachers to accept late work on major assignments with minimal penalties, said district spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell. Still, she said, it is hard to say how many students disappeared or what will happen with dropouts.“The pandemic was extraordinarily difficult on families — emotionally, economically, and physically," Caldwell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-schools-fight-to-keep-students-amid-fear-of-dropout-surge-101620737078913.html

According to news agency ANI, Dr Roderico H Ofrin’s statement on vaccine efficacy against the variant of concern was based on what the WHO knows so far as per the discussions with experts globally."There has been an increasing rate of detection of this variant along with an increase and a surge of Covid-19 cases in parts of India. However, the relative contribution of this variant in the rapid increase of cases in the country remains unclear," said the WHO official.The B.1.617 variant is the fourth variant that has been classified as a variant of global concern. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at WHO, earlier told a briefing that there is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility. Dr Kerkhove stressed that the scientists need much more information about the B.1.617 variant and all of the sub-lineages."Our Epi teams and our lab teams internally, there is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility of B1617, as such we are classifying this as a variant of concern at the global level," she said.Read | Covid-19: What we know about the Indian variant as coronavirus sweeps South AsiaWhile the Union health ministry on Tuesday said that an early trend of decline in daily new Covid-19 cases and related deaths has been noted in India, the country continues to record over 3 lakh daily infections, overwhelming the healthcare infrastructure. In an interview with ANI, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan called on governments to boost exercises on reporting actual numbers, terming the rate of infections and fatalities “worrying”."I would say that at this point of time, the situation is very worrying, the daily number of cases and deaths that we are seeing today in India and other countries in the Southeast area region is a big concern for us and we also realise that these are underestimates.

11-05-2021||World||Most in US who haven't got Covid-19 jab need convincing, poll says||Fewer Americans are reluctant to get a Covid-19 vaccine than just a few months ago, but questions about side effects and how the shots were tested still hold some back, according to a new poll that highlights the challenges at a pivotal moment in the U.S. vaccination campaign.Just 11% of people who remain unvaccinated say they definitely will get the shot, while 34% say they definitely won't, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.That leaves a large swath of Americans in the middle who might still roll up their sleeves — including 27% who say they probably will and 27% who say they probably won't — if someone credible addressed their concerns. That's where National Institutes of Health immunologist Kizzmekia Corbett comes in.Corbett helped lead development of the Moderna shot, and she spends hours giving plain-spoken answers to questions from Americans — especially Black Americans like her — to counter misinformation about the three vaccines used in the U.S.Read more: 20-metre-long escape tunnel found at Australian detention centre: ReportNo, COVID-19 vaccines won’t cause infertility: “Whoever started that rumor, shame on you.”No, the shots’ speedy development doesn’t mean corners were cut: “We worked our butts off for the last six years” hunting vaccines for earlier cousins of COVID-19 — a head start that made the difference, Corbett recently told the AP.Getting as many people vaccinated as fast as possible is critical to returning the country to normal. More than 150 million people — about 58% of all adults — have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.As that number grows, reluctance is inching down. Overall, the AP-NORC poll found about 1 in 5 American adults say they probably or definitely won’t get vaccinated, compared to about a third in January, when the shots were just rolling out.Black Americans likewise are becoming more open to the shots, with 26% now saying they definitely or probably won’t get vaccinated compared with 41% in January. That’s similar to the 22% of Hispanic Americans and white Americans the poll found unlikely to get vaccinated. Among Asian Americans, just 9% say they definitely or probably won’t get the shots.Read more: US congresswoman urges Biden to send more direct Covid support to IndiaHoldouts are from all over American society — fueling experts' advice that there is no one-size-fits-all vaccine message and that people need to hear from trusted sources, whether that's scientists like Corbett or their own doctors. Adults under 45, rural Americans and Republicans are especially likely to say they will avoid vaccination, the poll found. But again, attitudes are changing: 32% of Republicans now say they probably or definitely won’t get vaccinated, down from 44% in January.About three-fourths of those who say they are unlikely to get vaccinated have little to no confidence that the vaccines were properly tested, and 55% are very concerned about side effects, the poll found. Even among those who say they will probably get vaccinated but have not done so yet, concerns about proper testing are elevated compared with people who have received their shots already.In forums hosted by colleges, Black pastors, doctors and even basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Corbett says the best way to overcome distrust is to put the science in understandable terms for strangers just like she does for family. Later this spring, she's moving from the NIH to Harvard's School of Public Health to continue both her vaccine research and that outreach to communities, the school plans to announce on Tuesday.The vaccines’ speedy development “is historic and it is brag-worthy,” said Corbett, whose NIH team was able to customize a shot that matched the new virus after spending six years developing vaccines against other dangerous coronaviruses such as MERS.But “really, we should have started the conversations very early about what went into it,” she said, so the public understood that no steps were skipped.A combination of huge studies and real-world data show the main side effects of the U.S. vaccines are temporary fevers or aches as the immune system revs up. The shots are undergoing unprecedented safety monitoring, which last month led to a temporary pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccinations to determine how to handle an incredibly rare risk of blood clots.Even after that pause, overall confidence in the vaccines is up slightly compared with a few months ago, with 45% of all adults now very or extremely confident that the shots were properly tested for safety and effectiveness, compared with 39% in an AP-NORC poll in February.But side effect myths persist. Corbett calls the fertility concern “completely absurd,” and in forum after forum explains why it’s biologically impossible for the vaccines to alter anyone’s DNA.The repetition is OK: “People need to hear things multiple times,” she said.Plus, many Americans have some of the same questions scientists are still trying to answer, such as whether or when people might need a booster dose.“Those are things that even I can’t even answer. But what I can say is that we’re doing everything we can to make sure we can answer it as soon as possible,” Corbett said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-in-us-who-haven-t-got-covid-19-jab-need-convincing-poll-says-101620734920739.html

We have been given an historic opportunity to change things for the better.""RHETORIC INTO REALITY"After completing Britain's exit from the European Union at the end of 2020, Johnson has wanted to showcase what he sees as the benefits of Brexit. But he has so far been unable to match a pledge made in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign of handing the health service 350 million pounds ($494 million) a week.His government will instead try to reduce what it saw as excessive EU bureaucracy by streamlining state aid and procurement rules so it can target funds to ailing businesses more quickly and directly.That was part of the government's strategy to "build back better", which also included education reforms to help adults access life-long learning - seen by ministers as key to reshaping the British workforce.On climate change, the government repeated its commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a pledge it hopes will spur other nations to cut their emission targets before a United Nations climate summit in November in Scotland.Much of Tuesday's 'Queen's Speech' comprised policies and proposals already flagged, prompting the opposition Labour Party to challenge the government to turn its "rhetoric into reality"."The Conservatives have so far tried to hide their lack of a long-term plan by making people and places scrap over funding pots," Labour leader Keir Starmer said in a statement."This piecemeal approach won't deliver the fundamental change our country needs. Instead, we must today see meat on the bones of a proper, ambitious plan to deliver the change people across the country deserve."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-change-queen-sets-out-uk-johnson-s-post-pandemic-agenda-101620730478237.html
11-05-2021||World||US congresswoman urges Biden to send more direct Covid support to India||A US congresswoman has urged President Joe Biden to send more direct support to India which is battling an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Congresswoman Haley Stevens, in a letter to Biden on Monday, said that India is now the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This past week India registered over 400,000 daily cases. On May 4, there were 3,786 deaths, bringing the total to 226,188 fatalities. The sharp increase in cases has severely strained the healthcare system, overwhelming hospitals, and depleting oxygen supplies. India is in great need of oxygen, therapeutics, and vaccines,” Stevens wrote.Asking the White House to increase shipments of oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and ventilators to Indian hospitals, she thanked Biden for his support of more than USD 100 million to India.“I urge you to provide the following items: Oxygen Cylinders, 10 liters and 45 liters Liquid Medical Oxygen Capacity; Oxygen Concentrator; Oxygen Generator Plants; Remdesivir; Tocilizumab, Ventilators/BiPAP,” she said.“As you continue to assess the situation in India, I urge you to consider fulfilling the additional needs outlined above. As long as Covid persists in India, there is the potential for additional variants that could pose a serious threat to a vaccinated America. We must do our part to quell the virus everywhere it persists,” Stevens added.Also Read | Outpouring of support from US for India, Covid-19 help touches USD half a billionIndia has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds.After recording over four lakh fresh cases for four consecutive days, India witnessed a single-day rise of 3,66,161 Covid-19 cases on Monday, which pushed its tally to 2,26,62,575, according to the health ministry.The death toll due to the viral disease climbed to 2,46,116 with 3,754 more people succumbing to it, the ministry's data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congresswoman-urges-biden-to-send-more-direct-covid-support-to-india-101620729652011.html
11-05-2021||World||Pope Francis creates lay ministry to boost supply of faith teachers||Pope Francis on Tuesday formally created a new lay ministry to encourage greater participation of secular women and men in the teaching of the Catholic faith, especially in places where priests are in short supply.The new law creating the lay ministry of catechists officially recognizes for the universal Catholic Church a practice that has been used for centuries in local dioceses.In many parts of the world, lay men and women introduce people to the Catholic faith, educate them on receiving the initial sacraments of baptism and Communion and accompany them in their faith journey.Soon, the Vatican’s liturgy office will publish a specific rite of installation to be used around the world when lay catechists formally begin their ministry, the pope said in the new law.It’s the latest reform by Francis to address longstanding complaints that lay people — and specifically women — have been shut out of all levels of church decision-making, governance and participation in favor of the all-male clerical class of priests, bishops and cardinals.Earlier this year Francis issued another law decreeing that women can be installed in the lay ministries of lectors, to read Scripture, and acolytes to serve on the altar as eucharistic ministers. Such roles had been officially reserved to men even though exceptions were made.Francis has firmly upheld Catholic doctrine that women cannot be ordained priests. He remains under pressure, however, to allow women to be deacons — ministers who perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding at weddings, baptisms and funerals. Currently, the ministry is reserved for men even though historians say the ministry was performed by women in the early church.In the new law published Tuesday, Francis recalled that throughout the history of the church, lay catechists have been fundamental in spreading the faith, particularly in mission territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-creates-lay-ministry-to-boost-supply-of-faith-teachers-101620729618590.html

Wei Fenghe emphasied to Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid that Beijing and Dhaka should make joint efforts against powers from outside the region establishing a "military alliance" in South Asia and practising "hegemonism"."Obviously it will not be a good idea for Bangladesh to participate in this small club of four (Quad) because it will substantially damage our bilateral relationship,” Ambassador Li said at a virtual meeting organised by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh on Monday.Reacting to the Chinese envoy's controversial remarks, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said Dhaka maintains a non-aligned and balanced foreign policy and it will decide what to do according to those principles."We're an independent and sovereign state. We decide our foreign policy. But yes, any country can uphold its position," he told reporters on Tuesday."Naturally, he (Chinese ambassador) represents a country. They can say what they want. Maybe they don't want it (Bangladesh joining the Quad)," Momen said, adding that no one from the Quad has approached Bangladesh yet.The comment has been preemptive, the United News of Bangladesh (UNB) news agency reported, quoting said the foreign minister as saying.Initiated in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Quad for short, is an informal grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan.Quad is a “small group of elites” working against China, Ambassador Li said.“Quad says it is only for economic purposes and security and so on. But that’s not true. We know that Quad is aimed at China,” the envoy was quoted as saying by BDNews24.com news portal and other newspapers.“Japan, together with the US, has stated it very clearly – they are participating in [Quad] because of China,” Li said.Li described the Quad as a "narrow-purposed" geopolitical clique, and Bangladesh should not join it as the country will not derive any benefit from the initiative."History has proved again and again such partnership surely damages our neighbours' own social, economic development and people's well-being," Li was quoted as saying by the UNB news agency.Chinese Defence Minster Gen Wei, who visited Dhaka on April 27 had said that to jointly maintain regional peace and stability, China and Bangladesh "should make joint efforts against powers outside the region setting up military alliance in South Asia and practicing hegemonism."China has vehemently opposed the formation of the Quad with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman emphasising in March that exchanges and cooperation between countries should help expand mutual understanding and trust, instead of targeting or harming the interests of third parties.The four Quad member countries have resolved to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the strategically vital region.The first summit of the Quad leaders was hosted by US President Joe Biden on March 12 and the virtual meeting was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four Quad leaders have vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending an clear message to China against its aggressive actions in the region.During Monday's virtual event, the Chinese ambassaor also raised the possibility of China aiding Bangladesh’s efforts on the Teesta River management project, stating that their involvement in the project would be ‘seriously considered’ once Dhaka submitted a feasibility report.The Bangladesh government had yet to formally propose that China take part in the project, he said.The Teesta River management project would dredge and embank large portions of the river in order to form a single, manageable channel.Li dismissed concerns that water sharing disputes between Bangladesh and India could affect the project.“I think it is the legitimate right of Bangladeshi people to build this kind of project within the lower reach of a shared river,” he said. “If this was made in the upper reaches, you would have to consult the opinions of countries from the lower reaches. But as you are building it in the lower reaches, I don’t think there are any sensitive issues,” Li was quoted as saying.The Teesta deal was set to be signed during then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Bangladesh in September, 2011 but was postponed at the last minute due to objections raised by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Banarjee had expressed strong reservations against giving Bangladesh a greater share of water from the Teesta river.The issue also figured during Prime Minister Modi's visit to Bangladesh in March during which he reiterated India's "sincere and continued efforts" to conclude the Teesta water-sharing agreement in consultation with relevant stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-decide-our-foreign-policy-bangladesh-s-curt-response-to-china-over-warning-to-join-quad-101620729070540.html
11-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Australia aims to vaccinate all adults by end of 2021||Australia set a new target of vaccinating all willing adults by the end of 2021 on Tuesday, hoping to speed a glacial vaccine roll-out that threatens the country's pandemic success story.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg -- unveiling a free-spending, crisis-tinged budget -- said the continuation of the country's "roaring" economic recovery depended on "effective suppression of the virus".To that end, he said, the conservative government expected Australia's borders to remain closed well into 2022 and for all adults "who seek to have that vaccine" to have received two doses by the end of the year.Australia has ridden out the coronavirus pandemic by effectively sealing itself off from the rest of the world, and with a series of snap local lockdowns.It remains one of the few places where there is no widespread community transmission and daily life is relatively normal.But very few Australians are immunised and there have been repeated outbreaks linked to quarantine facilities, raising fears success could be fleeting."We don't know what is around the corner with respect to the virus," Frydenberg said. "The assumption is that there will be new cases."So far Australia has delivered just 2.5 million vaccine shots, versus the roughly 50 million jabs needed to vaccinate the entire population -- lagging other rich countries, and the government's own targets.After a series of problems with vaccine delivery and the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those under 50, the government is now in talks to manufacture promising mRNA vaccines domestically.Spend, spend, spendFrydenberg also unveiled a new round of tax cuts and stimulus spending that could set the stage for an election as soon as this year.Prime Minister Scott Morrison is seeking reelection and a fourth consecutive victory for his conservative Liberal-led coalition.Jettisoning the party's traditional talk of belt-tightening and fiscal prudence, Frydenberg said "unavoidable" spending would see the deficit swell to Aus$161 (US$125) billion this year, almost eight percent of GDP.The government has committed Aus$291 billion to virus-related stimulus, including a swathe of tax cuts and income support that is equivalent to almost 15 percent of gross domestic product.The deficit explosion was limited only by increased tax revenue -- as people go back to work more quickly than expected -- and surging iron ore prices."We're giving a very big thanks to Western Australia and the iron ore industry," Frydenberg said.Amid fierce criticism of the government's handling of a series of rape allegations by officials, the budget for the next year also sets aside Aus$2 billion for women's safety, the bulk of which will go to childcare subsidies.Defence spending is expected to rise about 10 percent in the next three years, as relations with China sour and American security guarantees look less ironclad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-aims-to-vaccinate-all-adults-by-end-of-2021-101620728441593.html

This is very important with a view to the summer," he added.The pass would allow those vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 or with negative test results to move more easily in the 27-nation bloc, where restrictions on movement have weighed heavily on the travel and tourist industry for over a year.As the vaccination campaign in the EU is gaining speed with 200 million jabs delivered and Covid-19 infections rates falling, Europe is starting to reopen cities and beaches, raising hopes for the summer holiday season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-certificate-will-be-a-signal-for-travel-in-eu-germany-says-101620726462424.html
11-05-2021||World||20-metre-long escape tunnel found at Australian detention centre: Report||A 20-metre-long underground escape tunnel has been discovered at an immigration detention centre in Australia, according to refugee advocates. The unfinished tunnel dug around three metres deep in the Falcon compound of Yongah Hill detention centre in Western Australia was reportedly found on Monday morning.The campaign group Refugee Action Coalition said that the tunnel ran from beneath the floor of room 6F in one of the accommodation blocks, underneath two inner fences to within five metres of the outer perimeter fence. The Guardian, quoting the refugee advocates, reported that the tunnel was built “over several months”, but it has not yet been established who dug the tunnel or with what.In 2001, 23 asylum seekers escaped by tunnelling out of the Villawood detention centre in Sydney. The refugee advocates said that the fresh escape attempt has highlighted the prolonged detention of those held in the onshore detention centres. According to Australian Border Force statistics, around 320 people were held at Yongah Hill as of February 28, 2021, and many of the asylum seekers are very long-term detainees who have been held for over five years.Ian Rintoul, a spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition, said in a statement that the “systematic abuse of long-term detention” is hidden behind the fences of the country’s detention regime. Rintoul accused the detention regime of depriving asylum seekers of their liberty and mental health, claiming that almost none of the oversight that applies to prisoners of the judicial system are applied to detainees.“The government, for example, is vindictively holding Iranian asylum seekers for years, even though it knows that they cannot be returned to Iran. Indefinite detention is pointless and destructive. Visa cancellation powers allow asylum seekers and refugees to be punished twice, first by the judicial system and then by immigration detention,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20metrelong-escape-tunnel-found-at-australian-detention-centre-report-101620727105457.html
11-05-2021||World||China loses workers as its 1.4B people age||The number of working-age people in China fell over the past decade as its aging population barely grew, a census showed Tuesday, complicating Chinese leaders' efforts to create a more prosperous and influential nation.The total population rose to 1.411 billion people last year, up 72 million from 2010, according to the once-a-decade census. Slow growth fell closer to zero as fewer couples had children.That adds to challenges for Chinese leaders who want to create a richer society and increase its global influence by developing technology industries and self-sustaining economic growth based on consumer spending.The ruling Communist Party has enforced birth limits since 1980 to restrain population growth but worries the workforce is shrinking. It has eased birth limits, but couples are put off by high costs, cramped housing and job discrimination against mothers.The population of potential workers aged 15 to 59 fell to 894 million last year, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That would be down 5% from a 2011 peak of 925 million. The percentage of children in the population edged up compared with 2010, but the group aged 60 and older grew faster.Changes in birth limits and other policies “promoted a rebound in the birth population,” the bureau director, Ning Jizhe, said at a news conference.However, Ning said 12 million babies were born last year, which would be down 18% from 2019’s 14.6 million.China, along with Thailand and some other developing Asian countries that are aging fast, faces what economists call the challenge of whether it can grow rich before it grows old. Some warn China faces a “demographic time bomb.”The potential shortage of workers needed to generate economic activity and tax revenue comes as President Xi Jinping's government boosts spending on its military and efforts to create global competitors in electric cars and other technologies.Reflecting the issue’s sensitivity, the statistics agency took the unusual step last month of announcing the population grew in 2020 but gave no total. That looked like an effort to calm companies and investors after The Financial Times reported the census might have found a surprise decline.“We are more concerned about the fast decline in the proportion of the working age population compared to the total population,” said Lu Jiehua, a professor of population studies at Peking University.The working-age population will fall from three-quarters of the total in 2011 to just above half by 2050, according to Lu.“If the population gets too old, it will be impossible to solve the problem through immigration,” said Lu. “It needs to be dealt with at an early stage.”Couples who want a child face daunting challenges.Many share crowded apartments with their parents. Child care is expensive and maternity leave short. Most single mothers are excluded from medical insurance and social welfare payments.Some women worry giving birth could hurt their careers."When you have a kid, you take pregnancy leave, but will you still have this position after you take the leave?” said He Yiwei, who is returning from the United States after obtaining a master’s degree. “Relative to men, when it comes to work, women have to sacrifice more.”Japan, Germany and some other rich countries face the same challenge of supporting aging populations with fewer workers. But they can draw on investments in factories, technology and foreign assets. By contrast, China is a middle-income country with labor-intensive farming and manufacturing.The decline in the working-age population “will place a cap on China’s potential economic growth,” said Yue Su of the Economist Intelligence Unit in a report. That is a “powerful incentive to introduce productivity-enhancing reforms.”The International Monetary Fund is forecasting Chinese economic growth of 8.4% this year following a rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. The Communist Party wants to double output per person from 2020 levels by 2035, which would require annual growth of about 4.7%.The numbers reported Thursday reflect a gain of 11.8 million people, or 0.8%, over the official estimate for 2019, when the government says the population edged above 1.4 billion for the first time.The working-age population fell to 63.3% of the total from 70.1% a decade ago. The group up to age 14 expanded by 1.3 percentage points to 17.9%. Those 60 and older — a group of 264 million people who on their own would be the world's fourth-biggest country — rose 5.4 percentage points to 18.7% of the population.“Labor resources are still abundant,” said Ning of the statistics agency.The party took its biggest step in 2015 when rules that limited many couples to having only one child were eased to allow two.However, China’s birth rate, paralleling trends in South Korea, Thailand and other Asian economies, already was falling before the one-child rule. The average number of children per mother tumbled from above six in the 1960s to below three by 1980, according to the World Bank.Demographers say official birth limits concealed what would have been a further fall in the number of children per family.The one-child limit, enforced with threats of fines or loss of jobs, led to abuses including forced abortions. A preference for sons led parents to kill baby girls, prompting warnings millions of men might be unable to find a wife, fueling social tension.Thursday’s data showed China has 105.7 million men and boys for every 100 women and girls, or about 33 million more males.The ruling party says the policy averted shortages of food and water by preventing as many as 400 million potential births. But demographers say if China followed Asian trends, the number of additional babies without controls might have been as low as a few million.After limits were eased in 2015, many couples with one child had a second but total births fell because fewer had any at all.Some researchers say China’s population already is shrinking.Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says the population started to fall in 2018. His book “Big Country With An Empty Nest” argued against the one-child limit.“China’s economic, social, educational, tech, defense and foreign policies are built on the foundation of wrong numbers,” said Yi.Chinese regulators talk about raising the official retirement age of 55 to increase the pool of workers.Female professionals welcome a chance to stay in satisfying careers. But others resent being forced to work more years. And keeping workers on the job, unable to help look after children, might discourage their daughters from having more.The latest data put China closer to be overtaken by India as the most populous country, which is expected to happen by 2025.India’s population last year was estimated by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs at 1.38 billion, or 1.5% behind China. The agency says India should grow by 0.9% annually through 2025.___Wu reported from Taipei.

11-05-2021||World||Taiwan tightens restrictions after new domestic Covid-19 cases||Taiwan's government on Tuesday tightened rules on public gatherings after reporting six new domestic Covid-19 cases with no clear source of infection, a rare rise on the island which has kept the pandemic well under control.Taiwan largely closed its borders early on in the pandemic and has a robust contact tracing and quarantine system, meaning its low case numbers - 1,210 infections to date including 12 deaths - have allowed life to carry on more or less as normal.Already dealing with an outbreak amongst pilots of Taiwan's largest carrier China Airlines and at a hotel where some of them stayed, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters they had confirmed six new cases with no clear source of infection.Five of these are in the northeastern county of Yilan and one in New Taipei, which surrounds the capital Taipei. None have a recent history of overseas travel, Chen added."We hope that this does not spread," he said, calling on people to wear masks, wash their hands and ensure social distancing while the government tracks down those who had been in contact with the infected to quarantine and test them.Effective immediately until June 8, all outdoor activities of more than 500 people and inside activities of 100 or more should be cancelled, Chen said. Food and drink will also be banned on trains.Similar restrictions have been put in place before, though Taiwan has never gone into a total lockdown. More than 90% of Covid-19 cases have been imported from abroad.The rise in domestic infections, reported in local media before being officially announced, helped drag down the stock market, which ended off 3.8% on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-tightens-restrictions-after-new-domestic-covid-19-cases-101620722501415.html
11-05-2021||World||Thousands suspended at Myanmar universities as junta targets education||More than 11,000 academics and other university staff opposed to Myanmar's ruling junta have been suspended after going on strike in protest against military rule, a teachers' group told Reuters.The suspensions come as the resumption of universities after a year closed due to the coronavirus epidemic prompts a new confrontation between the army and the staff and students who are calling for boycotts over the Feb. 1 coup."I feel upset to give up a job that I adored so much, but I feel proud to stand against injustice," said one 37-year-old university lecturer, who gave her name only as Thandar for fear of reprisals."My department summoned me today. I'm not going. We shouldn't follow the orders of the military council."A professor on a fellowship in the United States said she was told she would have to declare opposition to the strikes or lose her job. Her university authorities had told her every scholar would be tracked down and forced to choose, she told Reuters.As of Monday, more than 11,100 academic and other staff had been suspended from colleges and universities offering degrees, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation told Reuters, declining to be identified for fear of reprisals.Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain exactly what proportion of total staff that figure represents. Myanmar had more than 26,000 teachers in universities and other tertiary education institutions in 2018, according to the most recent World Bank data.Students and teachers were at the forefront of opposition during nearly half a century of military rule and have been prominent in the protests since the army detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and halted a decade of tentative democratic reforms.Many teachers, like medics and other government workers, have stopped work as part of a civil disobedience movement that has paralysed Myanmar. As protests flared after the coup, security forces occupied campuses in the biggest city, Yangon, and elsewhere.A spokesman for the junta did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on the suspensions.The junta-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said teachers and students should cooperate to get the education system started again."Political opportunists do not wish to see such development by committing sabotage acts," it said.BOYCOTTSIt was not clear to what extent the 11,000 staff suspensions would hamper efforts to reopen colleges but many students are also boycotting classes.At the public West Yangon Technological University, the student's union published a list of 180 staff who had been suspended to hail them as heroes."I don't feel sad to miss school," said 22-year-old Hnin, a student of the Yangon University of Education. "There's nothing to lose from missing the junta's education."Zaw Wai Soe, education minister in a rival National Unity Government set up underground by opponents of the junta, said he was touched that students had told him they would only return "when the revolution prevails".Doubts have also been raised over the return to school of younger students, with institutions now taking registrations for the start of a new year. There are nearly 10 million school students in the country of 53 million.Protesters daubed "We don't want to be educated in military slavery" at the entrance of a school in the southern town of Mawlamyine last week, a phrase that has been echoed at demonstrations across Myanmar by students."We'll go to school only when Grandmother Suu is released," read a banner of students in the northern town of Hpakant at the weekend, referring to detained leader Suu Kyi. "Free all students at once," said another sign.Many students are among at least 780 people killed by security forces and the 3,800 in detention, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.At least 47 teachers are also among the detainees while arrest warrants have been issued for some 150 teachers on charges of incitement.Myanmar's education system was already one of the poorest in the region - and ranked 92 of 93 countries in a global survey last year.Even under the leadership of Suu Kyi, who had championed education, spending was below 2% of gross domestic product. That was one of the lowest rates in the world, according to World Bank figures.Students could have little expectation of progress in Myanmar this year, said Saw Kapi, a founding director of the Salween Institute for Public Policy think tank."When it comes to education, I would suggest that instead of thinking about getting a bachelor's degree, you must go to the University of Life with a major in revolution," he wrote on social media. "You can go for a Masters or PhD later."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-suspended-at-myanmar-universities-as-junta-targets-education-101620725596419.html

"We know that having the right skills and training is the route to better, well-paid jobs.""RHETORIC INTO REALITY"Britain's main opposition Labour Party said it was time for the government to turn its "rhetoric into reality"."The Conservatives have so far tried to hide their lack of a long-term plan by making people and places scrap over funding pots," Labour leader Keir Starmer said in a statement."This piecemeal approach won't deliver the fundamental change our country needs. Instead, we must today see meat on the bones of a proper, ambitious plan to deliver the change people across the country deserve."In a break with tradition, the usually grand 'State Opening of Parliament', a heavily choreographed and costumed ceremony led by the 95-year-old monarch, will this year involve face masks, social distancing, and fewer guests.The Queen's Speech usually lasts around 10 minutes and is fleshed out by a raft of documents containing details of legislative proposals, consultation plans and other policy papers.It is expected to detail plans for new asylum rules, reforms of the social care system and to make good a manifesto promise to scrap legislation which limits government's powers to call new elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-to-set-out-uk-government-s-post-pandemic-agenda-101620722463346.html

Another worker arriving from the Philippines had also tested positive for a variant.Those findings prompted the city to order domestic workers to be tested for the virus at the end of April.The plan for mandatory vaccinations was dropped after officials assessed public health needs and the potential legal issues, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at a regular news briefing Tuesday.The Philippines’ Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. previously slammed the Hong Kong government for its mandatory vaccination plan for foreign domestic workers, saying that it “smacks of discrimination.”On Tuesday, Lam also announced a second round of mandatory tests for domestic workers as a precaution, which will begin on Saturday and last until the end of the May.She urged employers to allow the workers to take the test on a workday instead of on their day off.Hong Kong has so far reported 11,812 infections of the coronavirus, with 210 deaths.Indonesia has reported more than 1.7 million people infected and 47,000 deaths, while the Philippines has confirmed 1.1 million infections and 18,500 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-won-t-mandate-vaccination-against-covid-for-foreign-domestic-workers-101620722756611.html

"It's a major tragedy for our republic."He said earlier that four boys and three girls were among those killed."Sixteen more people are in hospital," Minnikhanov said, including 12 children and four adults.He described the detained assailant as a "terrorist" and said the 19-year-old shooter had a licence to carry a firearm.Images broadcast on state television showed dozens of people outside the school with fire services and police vehicles lining nearby streets."I was in class, I first heard an explosion, then gunshots," news agency TASS quoted a student as saying.Elena, a Kazan resident who said she was outside the school, told the Echo of Moscow radio station that law enforcement was removing people from outside the premises."Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine. People are hysterical," she told the radio station.Putin expressed his "deep condolences" to the victims and ordered a review of gun control legislation, the Kremlin said."The president gave an order to urgently work out a new provision concerning the types of weapons that can be in civilian hands, taking into account the weapon" used in the attack, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.- Tight school security -Russia has relatively few school shootings due to normally tight security in education facilities and the difficulty of buying firearms legally, although it is possible to register hunting rifles.In November 2019, a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire in his college, killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting himself dead.In October 2018, a teenage gunman killed 20 people at the Kerch technical college in Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.The 18-year-old attacker, who also set off explosives in one of the school's buildings, shot himself dead at the site.He was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the US, which left 13 people dead.Putin at the time blamed the attack on "globalisation" and online communities dedicated to American school shootings which promoted "fake heroes".The Crimea shooter, Vladislav Roslyakov, was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist.The shooting led to calls for tighter gun control in Russia.The country's FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.In February last year the FSB said it had detained two teenagers on suspicion of plotting an attack on a school in the city of Saratov with weapons and homemade explosives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-gunman-in-russian-school-shooting-killed-report-101620722324808.html

Footage posted on social media showed a young man being pinned to the ground outside the school building by a police officer.Footage also showed emergency service vehicles parked outside the school, with people running towards the building.It was not clear whether any other shooters remained at large. Nor was it immediately clear what the motive for the attack was.School shootings are rare in Russia. One of the last major shootings of its kind took place in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018 when a student at a college killed 19 before turning his gun on himself.Kazan is the capital of the Muslim-majority region of Tatarstan and located around 450 miles (725 km) east of Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-11-killed-in-school-shooting-in-russia-several-injured-101620721601085.html

The strain has reportedly been spotted in at least 21 countries.It was quite possible that the woman had contracted the virus from Thailand or somewhere else as the virus was not reported in Pakistan, Umar said.Thailand has banned travellers from India, other than Thai citizens, starting on May 1 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.It extended the entry ban to foreigners visiting from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal on Monday in an effort to keep the Indian variant from spreading, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanee Sangrat said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's coronavirus death toll reached 19,106 on Tuesday with 113 succumbing to the viral infection in the last 24 hours, health officials said.The nationwide confirmed cases now stand at 864,557 with 3,684 new cases, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-indian-variant-of-covid-19-not-present-in-country-101620719934070.html
11-05-2021||World||Moscow rejects US ransomware attack claims||Russia on Tuesday rejected US accusations that a Russia-based group was behind a ransomware attack that forced the shutdown of the largest oil pipeline in the eastern United States."We categorically reject the baseless fabrications of individual journalists and reiterate that Russia does not conduct 'malicious' activity in the virtual space," the Russian embassy in the United States said in a statement.On Monday, US President Joe Biden said there was no evidence of Russian government involvement in the cyber attack on the US fuel pipeline but said there were indications the ransomware was "in Russia.""They have some responsibility to deal with this," he said.The FBI identified the group behind the hack of Colonial Pipeline as DarkSide, a shadowy operation that surfaced last year and attempts to lock up corporate computer systems and force companies to pay to unfreeze them.The Russian diplomatic mission said Moscow had repeatedly advocated dialogue with Washington on international information security issues.It said that last year the embassy suggested that the United States directly contact the Russian National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents to address such issues."At the moment, the embassy has no information about requests for assistance from the American side," it said in the statement posted on its Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-rejects-us-ransomware-attack-claims-101620720035626.html
11-05-2021||World||Gaza militants, children among 24 dead as Israel hits Hamas||Israel unleashed new airstrikes on Gaza early Tuesday, hitting the high-rise home of a Hamas field commander and two border tunnels dug by militants, as Hamas and other armed groups fired dozens of rockets toward Israel. It was an escalation sparked by weeks of tensions in contested Jerusalem.Since sundown Monday when the cross-border fighting erupted, 24 Palestinians - including nine children - were killed in Gaza, most by airstrikes, Gaza health officials said. The Israeli military said 15 of the dead were militants. During the same period, Gaza militants fired more than 200 rockets toward Israel, injuring six Israeli civilians.This was preceded by hours of clashes Monday between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, mainly in Jerusalem but also across the West Bank. More than 700 Palestinians were hurt, including nearly 500 who were treated at hospitals.The current violence, like previous rounds, was fueled by conflicting claims over Jerusalem, home to major holy sites of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. The rival national and religious narratives of Israelis and Palestinians are rooted in the city, making it the emotional core of their long conflict.In the past, cross-border fighting between Israel and Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, would typically end after a few days, often helped by behind-the-scenes mediation by Qatar, Egypt and others. It was not clear if that trajectory would be repeated this time.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Monday that fighting could “continue for some time.” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that the military was in “the early stages” of strikes against Gaza targets it had planned well in advance.The escalation comes at a time of political limbo in Israel.Netanyahu has been acting as a caretaker prime minister since an inconclusive parliament election in March. He tried and failed to form a coalition government with his hardline and ultra-Orthodox allies, and the task was handed to his sworn political rivals last week. One of those rivals is Israel's defense minister who is overseeing the Gaza campaign. It is not clear if and to what extent the toxic political atmosphere is spilling over into military decision-making, though the rival camps have unanimously expressed support for striking Hamas hard.The tensions in Jerusalem coincided with the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in mid-April. Critics say heavy-handed police measures helped stoke nightly unrest, including a decision to temporarily seal off a popular night-time gathering spot where Palestinian residents would meet after evening prayers. Another flashpoint was the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah where dozens of Palestinians are under treat of eviction by Jewish settlers.Over the weekend, confrontations erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in east Jerusalem, which was captured and annexed by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The compound, located in Jerusalem's Old City, is the third holiest site of Islam and the holiest site of Judaism.For four successive days, Israel police fired tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets at Palestinians in the compound who hurled stones and chairs. Hundreds of Palestinians were hurt, requiring treatment at hospitals. Two dozen officers were also injured. At times, police fired stun grenades into the carpeted mosque.On Monday evening, Hamas began firing rockets from Gaza, setting off air raid sirens as far as Jerusalem, after giving Israel a deadline to withdraw Israeli security forces from the compound. From there on, the escalation was rapid.Conricus, the army spokesman, said Gaza militants fired more than 200 rockets at Israel, with about one-third falling short and landing in Gaza.The army said that a rocket landed a direct hit on a seven-story apartment block in the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon. Photos and videos from the scene showed a large blast hole on the side of the building. Israeli paramedic service Magen David Adom said it treated six people injured in the rocket strike. Two were hospitalized in moderate condition.Conricus said the military hit 130 targets in Gaza, including the high-rise home of a Hamas field commander and two tunnels militants were digging under the border with Israel. In all, Israel killed 15 militants, Conricus said, including some tunnel diggers. He said Israel's new system of concrete barriers and electronic sensors, intended to thwart tunnel digging, has been operational for the past six months and has proven itself.He did not address Gaza Health Ministry reports that nine children were among 24 Palestinians killed overnight.In Gaza, most of the deaths were attributed to airstrikes. However, seven of the deaths were members of a single family, including three children, who died in a mysterious explosion in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun. It was not clear if the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike or errant rocket.More than 100 Gazans were wounded in the airstrikes, the Health Ministry said.In one sign of escalation, an Israeli missile hit the upper floors of an apartment building in the Shati refugee camp on the edge of Gaza City early Tuesday, killing two men and a woman inside, according to health officials.Israel had struck scores of Gaza homes in its 2014 war with Hamas, arguing it was aiming at militants, but also killing many civilians. The practice drew broad international condemnation at the time..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-militants-children-among-24-dead-as-israel-hits-hamas-101620715483169.html
11-05-2021||World||FBI names pipeline cyberattackers as company promises return||Hit by a cyberattack, the operator of a major US fuel pipeline said Monday it hopes to have services mostly restored by the end of the week as the FBI and administration officials identified the culprits as a gang of criminal hackers.US officials sought to soothe concerns about price spikes or damage to the economy by stressing that the fuel supply had so far not experienced widespread disruptions, and the company said it was working toward “substantially restoring operational service” by the weekend.The White House said in a statement late Monday that it was monitoring supply shortages in parts of the Southeast and that President Joe Biden had directed federal agencies to bring their resources to bear.Colonial Pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, halted operations last week after revealing a ransomware attack that it said had affected some of its systems.Nonetheless, the attack underscored the vulnerabilities of the nation's energy sector and other critical industries whose infrastructure is largely privately owned. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out by criminal hackers who scramble data, paralyzing victim networks, and demand large payments to decrypt it.The Colonial attack was a potent reminder of the real-world implications of the burgeoning threat. Even as the Biden administration works to confront organized hacking campaigns sponsored by foreign governments, it must still contend with difficult-to-prevent attacks from cybercriminals.“We need to invest to safeguard our critical infrastructure,” Biden said Monday. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the attack “tells you how utterly vulnerable we are” to cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure.The attack came as the administration, still grappling with its response to massive breaches by Russia of federal agencies and private corporations, works on an executive order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity defenses. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has formed a ransomware task force designed for situations just like Colonial Pipeline, and the Energy Department on April 20 announced a 100-day initiative focused on protecting energy infrastructure from cyber threats. Similar actions are planned for other critical industries, such as water and natural gas.Despite that, the challenge facing the government and the private sector remains immense.In this case, the FBI publicly assigned blame Monday by saying the criminal syndicate whose ransomware was used in the attack is named DarkSide. The group's members are Russian speakers, and the syndicate’s malware is coded not to attack networks using Russian-language keyboards.Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said at a briefing that the group has been on the FBI's radar for months. She said its business model is to demand ransom payments from victims and then split the proceeds with the ransomware developers, relying on what she said was a “new and very troubling variant.”She declined to say if Colonial Pipeline had paid any ransom, and the company has not given any indication of that one way or the other. Though the FBI has historically discouraged victims from making payments for fear of promoting additional attacks, she acknowledged “the very difficult” situation that victims face and said the administration needs to look “thoughtfully at this area" of how best to deter ransomware."Given the rise in ransomware, that is one area we’re definitely looking at now to say, ‘What should be the government’s approach to ransomware actors and to ransoms overall?’”Speaking later in the day at a conference on national security, Neuberger said the administration was committed to leveraging the government's massive buying power to ensure that software makers make their products less vulnerable to hackers.“Security can't be an afterthought,” Neuberger said. “We don't buy a car and only then decide if we want to pay for seatbelts and airbags.”The U.S. sanctioned the Kremlin last month for a hack of federal government agencies, known as the SolarWinds breach, that officials have linked to a Russian intelligence unit and characterized as an intelligence-gathering operation.In this case, though, the hackers are not known to be working at the behest of any foreign government. The group posted a statement on its dark web site describing itself as apolitical. “Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society,” DarkSide said.Asked Monday whether Russia was involved, Biden said, ”“I’m going to be meeting with President (Vladimir) Putin, and so far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that Russia is involved, although there is evidence that the actors, ransomware, is in Russia.“They have some responsibility to deal with this,” he added.U.S. officials have sought to head off anxieties about the prospect of a lingering economic impact and disruption to the fuel supply, especially given Colonial Pipeline's key role in transporting gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other petroleum products between Texas and the East Coast.Colonial is in the process of restarting portions of its network. It said Monday that it was evaluating the product inventory in storage tanks at its facilities. Administration officials stressed that Colonial proactively took some of its systems offline to prevent the ransomware from migrating from business computer systems to those that control and operate the pipeline.In response to the attack, the administration loosened regulations for the transport of petroleum products on highways as part of an “all-hands-on-deck” effort to avoid disruptions in the fuel supply.“The time of the outage is now approaching critical levels and if it continues to remain down we do expect an increase in East Coast gasoline and diesel prices,” said Debnil Chowdhury, IHS Markit Executive Director. The last time there was an outage of this magnitude was in 2016, he said, when gas prices rose 15 to 20 cents per gallon. The Northeast had significantly more local refining capacity at that time.The pipeline utilizes both common and custom technology systems, which could complicate efforts to bring the entire network back online, according to analysts at Third Bridge.Granholm, the Energy Secretary, said “Cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure — especially energy infrastructure — is not going away."“This is a serious example of what we’re seeing across the board in many places and it tells you that we need to invest in our systems, our transmission grid for electricity. We need to invest in cyber defense in these energy systems," she told Bloomberg TV.The attack has not affected the supply of gasoline, she said, “but if it goes on too long, of course that will change.″Gasoline futures ticked higher Monday. Futures for crude and fuel, prices that traders pay for contracts for delivery in the future, typically begin to rise anyway each year as the driving season approaches. The price you pay at the pump tends to follow.The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline has jumped 6 cents over the past two weeks, to $3.02 per gallon, which is $1.05 higher than a year ago. The year-ago numbers are skewed somewhat because the nation was going into lockdown due to the pandemic.The attack on the Colonial Pipeline could exacerbate the upward pressure on prices if it is unresolved for a period of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-names-pipeline-cyberattackers-as-company-promises-return-101620711715682.html
11-05-2021||World||Why all the fuss over falling debris from China's most powerful rocket?||China launched into orbit last month the first piece of a permanent space station using its most powerful rocket, but international focus has fallen instead on the re-entry of debris which critics say has been shrouded in secrecy.WHAT HAPPENED?The Long March 5B rocket successfully delivered its payload into orbit on April 29, in the first of 11 missions needed to complete China's first permanent space station by 2022.Media reports warned of an "uncontrolled" re-entry of the rocket's core stage, rekindling memories of debris from the flight of the first Long March 5B in May 2020, which damaged buildings when it landed in Ivory Coast.Remnants from the rocket finally fell harmlessly in the Indian Ocean on Sunday after a 10-day descent, but China has drawn criticism for not being transparent about the timing of the debris re-entry and predictions of its trajectory.WHAT DID CHINA SAY?The China National Space Administration (CNSA) said nothing about the rocket's re-entry until shortly before its arrival on Sunday morning Beijing time, in contrast to normal international practice when initial public announcements can be made days in advance."That left foreign observers scrambling to map the discarded heavy stage of the Long March 5B and guesstimate its final destination on Earth," said Richard de Grijs, professor of astrophysics at Macquarie University."This caused anxiety to a large number of nations in the potential impact area."The debris landed in the Indian Ocean near the Maldives and India.CNSA declined to comment.Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, told reporters on Monday that China had shared the results of re-entry predictions through "international cooperation mechanisms," when asked whether the Maldives and India had been informed.She did not say when the results were shared.Space-faring nations must minimise the risks to people and property and maximise transparency, and China failed to meet "responsible standards" in both aspects, said NASA.LITTLE KNOWNScientists know little about the rocket itself - including its design for demise.The core stage was not discarded until its payload - the space station module Tianhe - reached orbit. In contrast, rocket stages typically drop off more quickly, making their landing sites more predictable.But falling off too quickly could have run the risk of not inserting a huge payload into orbit. The Long March 5B has only one core stage, unlike other rockets with two or even three stages."It seems that China's rocket design has prioritised power above all else, that is, enough power to lift heavy payloads to orbit," said de Grijs.The chances of space junk damaging property and taking human lives are tiny, scientists say, with most burning up in the Earth's atmosphere, but sturdier components can survive."(The rocket) was not forced to re-enter and was left to natural processes to remove it from orbit," said Moriba Jah, associate professor in aerospace engineering at the University of Texas.He said "natural rocket decay should be avoided at all costs" because of the risk that chunks of the rocket could survive the re-entry.'DEVIATION FROM THE NORM'The rocket's main stage is about 33 metres long, and has a diameter of 5 metres.The government gave no official data on its mass, but observers say it weighs about 21 tonnes - heavier than China's two earlier prototype space stations combined - Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2.There have been no reports of damage so far from the recently launched rocket."In the past year, two of China's Long March 5B rocket stages have not fully burned up on re-entry, so that is a noticeable deviation from the norm," said de Grijs.Within China, media reports of debris from rocket launches are common.The Long March 5B is next expected to deliver two other space station modules in May and August next year. Other missions will involve the smaller Long March 7 and 2F rockets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-all-the-fuss-over-falling-debris-from-china-s-most-powerful-rocket-101620710187886.html
11-05-2021||World||Myanmar military's pretense of control after 100 days of takeover||After Myanmar’s military seized power by ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, they couldn’t even make the trains run on time: State railway workers were among the earliest organized opponents of the February takeover, and they went on strike.Health workers who founded the civil disobedience movement against military rule stopped staffing government medical facilities. Many civil servants were no-shows at work, along with employees of government and private banks. Universities became hotbeds of resistance, and in recent weeks, education at the primary and secondary levels has begun to collapse as teachers, students and parents boycott state schools.One hundred days after their takeover, Myanmar’s ruling generals maintain just the pretense of control. The illusion is sustained mainly by its partially successful efforts to shut down independent media and to keep the streets clear of large demonstrations by employing lethal force. More than 750 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces, according to detailed independent tallies.“The junta might like people to think that things are going back to normal because they are not killing as many people as they were before and there weren’t as many people on the streets as before, but... the feeling we are getting from talking to people on the ground is that definitely the resistance has not yet subsided,” said Thin Lei Win, a journalist now based in Rome who helped found the Myanmar Now online news service in 2015.She says the main change is that dissent is no longer as visible as in the early days of the protests — before security forces began using live ammunition — when marches and rallies in major cities and towns could easily draw tens of thousands of people.At the same time, said David Mathieson, an independent analyst who has been working on Myanmar issues for over 20 years, “Because of the very violent pacification of those protests, a lot of people are willing to become more violent."“We are already starting to see signs of that. And with the right training, the right leadership and the right resources, what Myanmar could experience is an incredibly nasty destructive, internal armed conflict in multiple locations in urban areas.”Meanwhile, the junta also faces a growing military challenge in the always restive border regions where ethnic minority groups exercise political power and maintain guerrilla armies. Two of the more battle-hardened groups, the Kachin in the north and the Karen in the east, have declared their support for the protest movement and stepped up their fighting, despite the government military, known as the Tatmadaw, hitting back with greater firepower, including airstrikes.Even a month ago, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet was describing the situation as grim, saying Myanmar’s “economy, education and health infrastructure have been brought to the brink of collapse, leaving millions of Myanmar people without livelihood, basic services and, increasingly, food security.”It was not surprising that The Economist magazine, in an April cover story, labeled Myanmar “Asia’s next failed state” and opined it was heading in the direction of Afghanistan.The U.N.’s Bachelet made a different comparison.“There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,” she said. “There too, we saw peaceful protests met with unnecessary and clearly disproportionate force. The State’s brutal, persistent repression of its own people led to some individuals taking up arms, followed by a downward and rapidly expanding spiral of violence all across the country.”Junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has shunned all efforts at mediation, from the United Nations as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member.Myanmar’s resistance movement, meanwhile, has organized widely and swiftly underground.Within days of the junta takeover, elected parliamentarians who were denied their seats convened their own self-styled Parliament. Its members have formed a shadow National Unity Government with guidelines for an interim constitution, and last week, a People’s Defense Force as a precursor to a Federal Union Army. Many cities, towns and even neighborhoods had already formed local defense groups which in theory will now become part of the People’s Defense Force.Aside from being morale boosters, these actions serve a strategic purpose by endorsing a federal style of government, which has been sought for decades by the country’s ethnic minorities to give them autonomous powers in the border areas where they predominate.Promoting federalism, in which the center shares power with the regions, aligns the interests of the anti-military pro-democracy movement with the goals of the ethnic minorities. In theory, this could add a real military component to a movement whose armaments are generally no deadlier than Molotov cocktails and air rifles — though homemade bombs have been added to its arsenals in recent weeks.In practice, at least for the time being, the guerrilla armies of the Kachin in the north and the Karen in the east will fight as they always have, to protect their own territory. They can give military training to the thousands of activists that are claimed to have fled the cities to their zones, but are still overmatched by the government’s forces. But on their home ground they hold an advantage against what their populations consider an occupying army. That may be enough.“The only thing that the military is really threatened by is when all of these disparate voices and communities around the country actually start working against it, not as a unified monolith, but all working against the military’s interests,” said the analyst, Mathieson. ”And I think that’s the best that we can hope for moving forward, that the people recognize that all efforts have to go against the military.

11-05-2021||World||Colombia protesters, government at odds after initial meeting||A meeting between Colombian protest leaders and President Ivan Duque broke up on Monday with little sign of progress on curbing nearly two weeks of sometimes deadly anti-government protests.Protest leaders said the government had not shown empathy for their demands, while the government emphasized the meeting was exploratory and said it wanted to reach agreements with demonstrators.Protests, fueled by outrage at a now-canceled tax plan, began on April 28. Amid more than 20 deaths, mostly of marchers, demands have expanded to include action to tackle police violence and the withdrawal of a long-debated health reform.The National Strike Committee, made up of major unions and student groups, attended the meeting with Duque, other government officials and representatives from the United Nations and the Catholic Church."There was not empathy from the government with the reasons, with the demands that have taken us to this national strike," said Francisco Maltes, president of the Central Union of Workers (CUT).The meeting was an echo of similar discussions held after protests in 2019, to little result, student leader Jennifer Pedraza said."The discourse of President Ivan Duque was permissive toward the excesses of the security forces," she said, calling on Colombians to participate in further protests on Wednesday."There was an environment of listening and of respect," said High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos, speaking on behalf of the government. "I repeat before the country: the clear, express willingness of the president of the republic is to create a space to reach deals."Attendees agreed on the need to reject violence, said Ceballos, who repeated a government call for road blockades around the country to be lifted. The government has proposed a further meeting with the strike committee, he said.Protests continued in several cities on Monday, with an estimated 13,000 participants according to a police estimate.Duque made a lightning-fast visit to the city of Cali - a protest epicenter - earlier on Monday, after it was the scene of weekend violence which left over a dozen injured.Nine indigenous demonstrators, who were marching as part of a "minga" or protest, were wounded by gunshots, the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca said in a statement on Sunday.Four people were wounded by minga protesters, Cali's police said.The human right ombudsman has reported 26 people killed since protests began, but says seven were unrelated to the marches themselves.Human Rights Watch said it has reports of 38 deaths, while local rights groups Temblores and Indepaz have reported 47 killings, the majority by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombia-protesters-government-at-odds-after-initial-meeting-101620707682091.html
11-05-2021||World||Canadian senators call on govt to scale up pandemic-related donations for India||Canadian senators have called upon the government to match donations made by citizens to assist India as it struggles to tackle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have also called upon the Trudeau government to support a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights (IPR) protections on coronavirus vaccines and pharmaceuticals necessary to counter the crisis.Indo-Canadian Senator Ratna Omidvar has tabled a motion in the Senate, “asking the government of Canada to match the generous donations made by Canadians to India for Covid-19 related relief”.That motion has garnered support from about six other senators, including Leo Housakos, who tweeted, “I would like to wholeheartedly lend my support as well to this initiative. The situation in India is one of truly a humanitarian crisis and our government must step up Canada’s efforts.”Senators supporting the motion have written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterating the point, noting that research by Library of Parliament has found that in the last 10 years, the government has matched the donations of Canadians 10 times. “This is certainly another disaster that needs the same support,” they jointly wrote.The release from Omidvar also said that earlier this year, “India came to Canada’s aid by shipping vaccines to support the nation’s vaccination drive. It is now time for Canada to be generous in return and send much needed support before it is too late.” Separately, a group of 14 senators has written to the government asking it to support a motion submitted by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization, seeking temporary suspension of IPR protections on Covid-19 vaccines and medicines under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement.“Should the government support the TRIPS waiver initiative, it will send a strong signal of solidarity with global public health efforts and support the health and well-being of the most vulnerable,” they argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-senators-call-on-govt-to-scale-up-pandemic-related-donations-for-india-101620708024759.html
11-05-2021||World||Scientists improve method to stop viruses causing respiratory infections in children||Researchers have improved a method in rodent models intended to help keep children healthy by engineering a short chunk of protein, or peptide, that can prevent the attachment of human parainfluenza viruses to cells.Human parainfluenza viruses, or HPIVs, are the leading cause of childhood respiratory infections, responsible for 30% to 40% of illnesses like croup and pneumonia. The viruses also affect the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. The researchers published their findings in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.To sicken people, HPIVs must latch onto cells and inject their genetic material to start making new viruses. HPIV3 is the most prevalent among these viruses. There are currently no approved vaccines or antivirals for HPIV3 infection in people.In a study led by the Sam Gellman lab in the chemistry department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the lab of Anne Moscona and Matteo Porotto at Columbia University, researchers built upon years of work on peptide treatments to generate one capable of blocking the HPIV3 attachment process.To enter host cells, HPIVs use specialized fusion proteins that resemble three corkscrews laid side-by-side. Earlier work by the Moscona-Porotto lab showed that scientists could a partial chunk of this corkscrew protein from HPIV3, introduce this peptide to the virus, and prevent the corkscrew from driving the infection process. The peptide, itself a corkscrew, essentially zippers up with the virus's corkscrews, creating a tight bundle of six corkscrew shapes.The new peptide persists longer in the body, making it about three times more effective at blocking infection in rodent models of disease than the original form.The research team started by trying to engineer the original peptide to be more resistant to protein-digesting enzymes in the body, which can easily shred proteins and make them useless. So, the Gellman lab turned to unusual building blocks to create a hardier peptide.Cells build proteins out of alpha-amino acids. But chemists can create beta-amino acids, which are similar but have an extra carbon atom. When peptides use these beta-amino acid building blocks, they often take a different shape because of the extra atom. This can help a peptide hide from protein-digesting enzymes and survive longer.However, the researchers also knew that if the peptide's shape changed too much as a result of these unusual building blocks, they might not lock together with HPIV's corkscrew fusion protein.That's where the Gellman lab's decades of experience testing and modifying beta-amino acid-containing peptides became critical."We know which side of the peptide is binding to its protein target. So, we (knew that we) can modify only residues that are not directly involved in binding the viral protein," says Victor Outlaw, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab and one of the co-first authors of the report. In lab tests, they saw that the carefully modified peptide still bound strongly to the virus's protein.In another improvement pioneered by the Moscona-Porotto lab, the scientists hooked the peptide up to a molecule of cholesterol. This fatty addition helps the peptide slide into the greasy cell membrane, where it can best block the virus."Our hypothesis was that the combination of beta-amino acids and cholesterol would increase anti-viral efficacy," says Outlaw, who explained that the cholesterol helped get the peptide to where it needed to go, while the shape change from the beta-amino acids allowed the peptide to persist longer in the body.As the research team hoped, when they gave the new peptide to cotton rats it lasted much longer in the lungs than the previous version did thanks to its resistance to digestion by enzymes. The peptide was delivered into the rats' noses.To test how well the peptide worked to prevent infection, cotton rats received the new peptide before they were exposed to HPIV3. Compared to animals given no antiviral peptides, those given the improved peptide had 10 times fewer viruses in their lungs.And compared to the peptide that was more susceptible to enzymes, the hardier peptide reduced viral load by about three times, suggesting that the new peptide's ability to avoid digestion in the body helps it better block infection.While the approach hasn't yet been tested in humans and researchers must further refine and test the system, it does provide a new strategy for potentially preventing or treating these common infections.The research collaboration is now looking to make second-generation peptides that last even longer in the body. They also want to test how well the modified peptide might block infection by related viruses. That additional research could move the peptide treatment closer to clinical trials."This was a very fortunate coming together of groups that had complementary needs and capabilities," says Gellman. "It's really been a great joint effort."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-improve-method-to-stop-viruses-causing-respiratory-infections-in-children-101620706468236.html
11-05-2021||World||Thai police arrest journalists fleeing coup-hit Myanmar||Three Myanmar journalists have been arrested in Thailand after fleeing across the border to escape a crackdown by the military junta, their employer has said.The trio were set to appear in court on Tuesday, their editor added, urging Thai authorities not to repatriate them to the coup-hit country.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, triggering a mass uprising as large swathes of the population take to the streets to demand democracy.The junta has responded with force -- shooting protesters, arresting suspected dissidents in night raids, and targeting journalists and news outlets by shutting them down."They were arrested during a random search by the police and charged for illegal entry in Thailand," said a Monday statement by Aye Chan Naing, chief editor of Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), which had its broadcast licence revoked in March, sending its journalists into hiding."DVB strongly urges the Thai authorities to not deport them back to Burma, as their life will be in serious danger if they were to return," said the Oslo-based editor, referring to Myanmar by its old name.He told AFP the group was set to appear in court Tuesday.Thai authorities on Tuesday confirmed the arrests, but did not say if they were journalists.DVB confirmed in a statement late Monday night that three of its journalists -- along with two Myanmar activists -- had escaped to neighbouring Thailand and were arrested by authorities Sunday in the northern city of Chiang Mai.A well-known news organisation within Myanmar, DVB started as an exile media outlet during the previous junta, broadcasting uncensored reports on TV and radio.It moved into Myanmar in 2012, a year after the military dictatorship loosened its grip.Despite losing its broadcast licence in March, it has continued to report, posting regular updates on its Facebook page about the daily protests and crackdowns across the country.It also broadcasts via satellite television -- a move that the junta attempted to halt when it banned homes from having satellite dishes.The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand said in a statement Tuesday that if the arrested Myanmar nationals were deported, they would face "certain arrest and persecution, if not worse"."The world is watching what the Thai authorities do in this important case for press freedom in Myanmar and the region," it said.More than 70 journalists have been detained since the February 1 coup, according to a local monitoring group -- which has tracked a total of nearly 5,000 arrests nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-police-arrest-journalists-fleeing-coup-hit-myanmar-101620706872528.html
11-05-2021||World||China now has 1.41 billion people; growth in 10 years only 72 million||China’s population is growing at its most sluggish pace in decades, latest census data released on Tuesday said with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade. The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the last 10 years, down from 0.57% between 2000 and 2010, taking the population to 1.41 billion. The total population on the mainland stood at 1.41178 billion on November 1.The population growth rate is the slowest since 1953 when the first census was carried out. The slump in the growth rate – despite Beijing withdrawing the one-child policy in 2016 after being in force since the late 1970s -- will add pressure on Beijing to incentivise childbearing as the most populous country deals with a rapidly ageing population and the added economic burden.The fresh census results showed that China’s “…population is not just declining but also its demographic structure is deteriorating with a growing aging population, will serve as an important reference for China’s population and economic policy adjustment as well as plans to put off retirement, which may come in the next year or two”, a state media report said.Ning Jizhe, head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016 and 14.65 million in 2019. Ning, however, added that it was “still a considerable number”. Ning said a lower fertility rate is a natural result of China’s social and economic development.The average age of the Chinese population stood at 38.8 in 2020 compared to 38 in the US.Also Read | China marks separator from Nepal on EverestChina’s demographic situation is similar to Japan, South Korea and other developed countries, which are facing the problem of an ageing and dependent population. But it will have to deal with the reality that, unlike the developed countries, China has not been able to yet generate similar levels of household wealth.The census found there has been a rapid shrinking of China’s labour force in the past decade while the ageing population continued to increase. The proportion of people aged between 15 and 59 was 894 million, down by 6.79 percentage points from that in the 2010 census.“The number of people aged 60 and above grew to 264 million, up from 177.6 million in the 2010 census, and the number of people aged 65 and above grew to 190 million, up from 118.8 million in the 2010 census,” the state-run tabloid, Global Times reported, quoting the new data.Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert at the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said: “That (the census data) means the official number of the births every year for the past 10 years were mostly accurate. It also means the downward trend is more significant than what we expected in the recent years.”The two-child policy, which was implemented in 2016, has failed to make an impact on the low birth rates. “From the trend of population development in recent years, the population growth will continue to slow in the future,” NBS head Ning said. “China’s population will reach a peak in the future, but the specific time is still uncertain. It is estimated that China’s total population will remain at more than 1.4 billion in the near future.”The severity of China’s ageing crisis is beyond anyone’s imagination, said Yi Fuxian, senior demography researcher from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.“China’s adoption of one-child policy for four decades played a significant role by changing people’s views of childbearing; and, the economy, social environment, education and almost everything else relates back to the one-child policy. The willingness to give birth in Mainland China is lower than that in Taiwan and South Korea, and the contraceptive rate and female labour participation rate are higher than those in Taiwan and South Korea,” Yi said.He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the Global Times that there is no doubt that China will “fully lift birth restrictions in the near future…likely to remove its family planning policy as early as this autumn during the sixth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).” Fully lifting birth restrictions may not be enough to avert a fall in total population, or prevent China from becoming another Japan, demographers said, noting that Beijing should come up with more measures to encourage childbirth, such as subsidising couples who choose to have more than one baby.A total of 679,000 census-related institutions were created in the country’s provinces, cities, counties, townships, and villages. Over 7 million census takers were organised to document demographic information door to door across the country.The census does not include Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan residents and foreigners, who live in the Mainland’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, the NBS said.China conducted national censuses in 2010, 2000, 1990, 1982, 1964, and 1953.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-now-has-1-41-billion-people-growth-in-10-years-only-72-million-101620705264489.html

In a trial involving 2,260 participants, none of those given the vaccine contracted Covid-19 while 16 among those given a saline placebo tested positive.Calling the emergency use authorisation “significant step” in the fight against the epidemic, Janet Woodcock, acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said, “Today’s action allows for a younger population to be protected from Covid-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.”She added: “Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations.”Also Read | Covid-19 Pandemic plateauing with deaths and cases declining: WHOThe health regulator said that Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has “met the statutory criteria to amend the EUA, and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in this population.More that 152 million Americans — 57% of the eligible population of those 16 and older and 46% of the total population — have received at one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Only 12% of Indians have been vaccinated thus far in comparison, an estimated 170 million doses have been administered.“This is a promising development in our fight against the virus,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “If you are a parent who wants to protect your child, or a teenager who is interested in getting vaccinated, today’s decision is a step closer to that goal.”The Biden administration plans to expand the programme with a new focus on children. The US president said last week that 20,000 pharmacies will be involved in the roll-out of vaccines for children. Vaccinating children is key part of his strategy to get the United States back on track.Moderna, the other major maker of Covid-19 vaccines, is also working towards an authorisation of its vaccine for children.

Sensitive data plays a major role in government policy planning.The 2020 survey was completed in December with the help of over seven million volunteers who surveyed residents door-to-door.Beijing changed family planning rules in 2016 to allow families to have two children as fears grew about China's fast-aging population and shrinking workforce.But there has been growing concern that the policy change is yet to produce the expected baby boom to help offset the country's aging population.This is partly due to falling marriage rates in recent years, couples struggling with the high cost of raising children in major cities, as well as women naturally delaying or avoiding childbirth due to their growing empowerment.China recorded its slowest birthrate since 1949 for the year 2019, at 10.48 per 1,000 people.And preliminary data published in February suggested the birth rate was also down significantly in 2020, although the number of actual births has not yet been announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-population-grew-only-5-over-past-decade-to-pass-1-4-billion-shows-census-data-101620701350386.html

Republicans have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits for the numbers, saying the benefits discourage people from returning to work."My expectation is that, as our economy comes back, these companies will provide fair wages and safe work environments," Biden told reporters at the White House. By doing so, he said, the companies will "find plenty of workers, and we're all going to come out of this together better than before."Biden also defended himself against critics who have said expanded unemployment benefits offered in the Covid-19 relief bill passed in March are keeping Americans from taking new jobs.He said the administration will remind U.S. states this week that any unemployed American offered a comparable job must take it or risk losing unemployment benefits.Biden, a Democrat, said he will direct the U.S. Labor Department to work with states to reinstate requirements that those receiving unemployment benefits must demonstrate they are actively looking for work.He said school closures, child care constraints and fears of contracting the coronavirus had hindered job creation last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-urges-employers-to-boost-wages-get-people-vaccinated-101620699542160.html

Those who attack us will pay a heavy price," said Netanyahu, who held meetings with the heads of the army and the Shin Bet security agency.Israel's army said 150 rockets had been launched from Gaza, dozens of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System, with no casualties reported."We have started, and I repeat started, to attack military targets in Gaza," army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said."We have made preparations for various scenarios, including high intensity ones... Hamas will get the message."The military said it had targeted "two rocket launchers, two military posts", a tunnel and eight Hamas operatives in Gaza.Hamas sources confirmed to AFP that one of their commanders, Mohammed Fayyad, had been killed.Tensions in Jerusalem have flared since Israeli riot police clashed with Palestinian worshippers on the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in the city's worst disturbances since 2017.Also Read: US expresses 'serious concerns' about Jerusalem clashes, Palestinians' evictionsNightly unrest since then at the Al-Aqsa compound has left hundreds of Palestinians wounded, drawing international calls for de-escalation and sharp rebukes from across the Muslim world.Diplomatic sources told AFP that Egypt and Qatar, who have mediated past Israeli-Hamas conflicts, were attempting to calm tensions.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas, saying they "need to stop immediately"."All sides need to de-escalate, reduce tensions, take practical steps to calm things down," he said.- Sirens, evacuation -Adding to the sense of chaos, a huge fire engulfed trees in the compound that houses the mosque, Islam's third holiest site, as hundreds of Jewish Israelis watched from the Western Wall esplanade below.Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, earlier Monday warned Israel to withdraw all its forces from the mosque compound and the east Jerusalem district of Sheikh Jarrah, where looming evictions of Palestinian families have fuelled angry protests.Sirens wailed across Jerusalem just after the 1500 GMT deadline set by Hamas as people in Jerusalem, including lawmakers in the Knesset legislature, fled to bunkers for the first time since a 2014 Gaza conflict.A spokesman for Hamas' armed wing the Qassam Brigades said the rocket attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Sheikh Jarrah and around the Al-Aqsa mosque."This is a message that the enemy must understand well: if you respond we will respond, and if you escalate we will escalate."A house in Beit Nekofa, about 10 kilometres (six miles) west of central Jerusalem, was also damaged by rocket fire, AFP TV reported.The Israeli army said on Twitter that, separate to the rockets, "as a result of an anti-tank missile fired from Gaza, an Israeli civilian in a nearby vehicle was lightly injured" in the Gaza border area.- 'Escalating aggression' -Fears of further chaos in the Old City had temporarily eased when Israeli organisers of a march to celebrate the Jewish state's 1967 capture of east Jerusalem cancelled the event.But then came the Hamas warning, followed by the rockets, which also forced the evacuation of the Western Wall and other sites.Militants in Gaza have recently also deployed incendiary balloons that have sparked dozens of fires in Israeli territory.On Monday evening, as during the previous nights since Friday, Palestinians hurled rocks at Israeli officers in riot gear who fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas.That came after morning clashes which left the ground littered with rocks, stun grenade fragments and other debris as loud booms and angry screams echoed from the ancient stone walls.There were dozens of newly wounded demonstrators. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 395 Palestinians were wounded, including more than 200 who were hospitalised, five of them in critical condition.Siraj, 24, was wheeled into surgery at the large Makassed Hospital after suffering a spleen injury from being hit by a rubber bullet."They shot everyone, young and old people," he said.Makassed director general Adnan Farhoud said most of Monday's injuries were to the head, chest, and upper and lower limbs.When "you mean to harm someone you shoot to the head", he told AFP.The Israeli police reported 32 injuries in their ranks.The violence since Friday has been fuelled by a long-running bid by Jewish settlers to evict several Palestinian families from their nearby Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.A Supreme Court hearing on a Palestinian appeal in the case originally set for Monday was pushed back by the justice ministry due to the tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-killed-in-palestine-in-israel-s-strikes-after-hamas-rocket-barrage-101620696606423.html

Cases are also surging in the Maldives, another Indian Ocean island nation that’s a popular tourism destination.In Seychelles, Sinopharm shots were issued to 57% of those who were fully inoculated and the rest with Covishield, a vaccine made in India under a license from AstraZeneca Plc. As of May 8 no one who had contracted Covid while being vaccinated had died, Seychelles News Agency reported, citing the minister for foreign affairs and tourism.The Seychelles, a group of palm-fringed tropical islands, last week re-imposed curbs including closing schools, canceling sports events and banning mingling of households.The country had raced to vaccinate its population of just under 100,000 -- first with a donation of doses from China’s Sinopharm and then with a gift of Covishield, so it could reopen to the tourists who are the lifeblood of its economy.Daniel Lucey, clinical professor of medicine at Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said in a blog last week that data on genetic sequencing are not yet available for infections in Seychelles in April.Still, the B.1.351 variant, first identified in South Africa late last year, was found in the Seychelles in February, he said. AstraZeneca’s vaccine appeared to be less effective against that variant in a study, and South Africa halted plans to use those injections.A comparison between Sinopharm, Covishield and unvaccinated people who caught the coronavirus could be done using genetic sequencing and data on the severity of their infections, Lucey said.Cases in the Maldives, which has seen a surge in visits from affluent Indians, have also shot up. The country has the most new cases per 100,000 people in the past five, seven and 14 days. Active cases jumped from 4,978 to 9,423 on May 9.As of May 8, over 300,000 people in the Maldives had received at least one dose of a vaccine and 35% of the population had received two, according to the Health Protection Agency. The country has been using Sinopharm and Covishield.Positive test results in Greater Male, the area in and around the capital of the Maldives, are about 60% of the total. As of May 7 the government closed gyms and cinemas and imposed a curfew from 9 p.m. until 4 a.m, the agency said.The government is also now requiring that arrivals to the islands, including those who have been vaccinated, have a negative Covid-19 test administered four days before their departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-double-in-the-world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-101620695918476.html
11-05-2021||World||Why the Colonial Pipeline hack matters. Explained||A cyberattack on a critical U.S. pipeline is sending ripple effects across the economy, highlighting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the nation's aging energy infrastructure. The Colonial Pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel used along the Eastern seaboard, shut down Friday after a ransomware attack by gang of criminal hackers that calls itself DarkSide. Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, the incident could impact millions of consumers.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COLONIAL PIPELINE?Colonial Pipeline, the owner, halted all pipeline operations over the weekend, forcing what the company called a precautionary shutdown. U.S. officials said Monday that the “ransomware” malware used in the attack didn’t spread to the critical systems that control the pipeline’s operation. But the mere fact that it could have done so alarmed outside security experts.Also Read | 'No evidence Russia involved in Colonial Pipeline ransomware hack': Joe BidenWILL THERE BE GASOLINE SHORTAGES?It depends on how long the shutdown lasts. Colonial said it's likely to restore service on the majority of its pipeline by Friday.There’s no imminent shortfall, and thus no need to panic buy gasoline, said Richard Joswick, head of global oil analytics at S&P Global Platts. If the pipeline is restored by Friday, there won’t be much of an issue. “If it does drag on for two weeks, it’s a problem,” Joswick added. “You’d wind up with price spikes and probably some service stations getting low on supply. And panic buying just makes it worse.”SO WHAT’S HAPPENING WITH GASOLINE PRICES?The average gasoline price jumped six cents to $2.96 over the past week, and it’s expected to continue climbing because of the pipeline closure, according to AAA. Mississippi, Tennessee and the East coast from Georgia to Delaware are the most likely to experience limited fuel availability and higher prices, and if the national average rises by three more cents, these would be the highest prices since November 2014, according to AAA.WHAT’S RANSOMWARE AGAIN?Ransomware scrambles data that can only be decoded with a software key after the victim pays off the criminal perpetrators. An epidemic of ransomware attacks has gotten so bad that Biden administration officials recently deemed them a national security threat. Hospitals, schools, police departments and state and local governments are regularly hit. Ransomware attacks are difficult to stop in part because they’re usually launched by criminal syndicates that enjoy safe harbor abroad, mostly in former Soviet states.Also Read: US pipeline hackers say their aim is money, not mayhemWHO IS BEHIND THE ATTACK AND WHAT MOTIVATES THEM?The hackers are Russian speakers from DarkSide, one of dozens of ransomware gangs that specialize in double extortion, in which the criminals steal an organization’s data before encrypting it. They then threaten to dump that data online if the victim doesn’t pay up, creating a second disincentive to trying to recover without paying.Ransomware gangs say they are motivated only by profit. Colonial has not said how much ransom s.WHY WASN’T COLONIAL ABLE TO PREVENT OR CONTAIN THE ATTACK?Neither Colonial nor federal officials have explained how the attackers breached the company’s network and went undetected. Cybersecurity experts believe that Colonial may not have employed state-of-the-art defenses, in which software agents actively monitor networks for anomalies and are programmed to detect known threats such as DarkSide’s infiltration tools.WHAT DOES COLONIAL NEED TO RESTORE ITS NETWORK AND HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?That depends on how extensively Colonial was infected, whether it paid the ransom and, if it did, when it got the software decryption key. The decryption process could take several days at least, experts say. Colonial has not responded to questions on these issues, although it said only its IT network was affected.DO PIPELINES FACE A GREATER RISK OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS?They're not necessarily at greater risk, but they do pose unique challenges. The Colonial Pipeline structure is a vast piece of critical infrastructure that provides fuel supply to states along the East Coast. Such a large network is bound to have different control systems along its path where it connects with distributors or customers.“Every single time you connect something, you run the risk that you’re going to infect something,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. That variability can also make it harder for hackers to know where to find vulnerabilities, he said.Over time, as pipelines expand, companies can end up with a mix of technology — some parts built within the company and others brought in from outside, said Peter McNally, global sector lead at Third Bridge. Many large energy companies have been under pressure from investors to limit reinvestment in such assets, which can be decades old, he added. That can be a problem when dealing with modern criminals.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has established and enforced mandatory cybersecurity standards for the bulk electric system, but there are no comparable standards for the nearly 3 million miles of natural gas, oil and hazardous liquid pipelines that traverse the United States. “Simply encouraging pipelines to voluntarily adopt best practices is an inadequate response to the ever-increasing number and sophistication of malevolent cyber actors,” said Richard Glick, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Democratic Commissioner Allison Clements, in a joint statement. They called for the U.S. to establish mandatory pipeline security standards.WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HALT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS?Previous attempts to put ransomware operators out of business by attacking their online infrastructure have amounted to internet whack-a-mole. The U.S. Cyber Command, Microsoft and cross-Atlantic police efforts with European partners have only been able to put a temporary dent in the problem.Last month, a public-private task force including Microsoft, Amazon the FBI and the Secret Service gave the White House an 81-page urgent action plan that said considerable progress could be possible in a year if a concerted effort is mounted with U.S. allies, who are also under withering attack.Some experts advocate banning ransom payments. The FBI discourages payment, but the task force said a ban would be a mistake as long as many potential targets remain “woefully unprepared,” apt to go bankrupt if they can’t pay. Neuberger said Monday that sometimes companies have no real choice but to pay a ransom.The task force said ransomware actors need to be named and shamed and the governments that harbor them punished. It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and the creation of a federal “response fund” to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that, in many cases, it will prevent them from paying ransoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-the-colonial-pipeline-hack-matters-explained-101620691797385.html

The Nobel laureate has not been seen in public since she was detained in a February 1 military coup, when the junta ousted her from power and took charge of the country.She was later hit with a series of charges, and her lawyers faced an uphill battle to get a private audience with their client.Multiple court hearings in the capital Naypyidaw have seen Suu Kyi - who attended via video conferencing from under house arrest - express frustration at the pace of the proceedings.During the latest hearing on Monday, a judge ordered her cases to be heard with her present in a special courtroom near her residence.“She will appear in person in court on May 24,” lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told AFP. The decision came as the country neared 100 days of the coup.Myanmar poet Khet Thi, whose works declare resistance to the ruling junta, died in detention overnight and his body was returned with the organs removed, his family said. A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls to request comment on the death of Khet Thi.“He died at an hospital after being tortured in an interrogation centre,” the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said in a bulletin that put the toll of civilians killed since the military coup at 780.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suu-kyi-ordered-to-show-up-in-court-on-may-24-101620691216429.html

An announcement is expected Wednesday.Most Covid-19 vaccines worldwide have been authorized for adults. Pfizer’s vaccine is being used in multiple countries for teens as young as 16, and Canada recently became the first to expand use to 12 and up. Parents, school administrators and public health officials elsewhere have eagerly awaited approval for the shot to be made available to more kids.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“This is a watershed moment in our ability to fight back the Covid-19 pandemic,” Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president who’s also a pediatrician, told The Associated Press.The Food and Drug Administration declared that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and offers strong protection for younger teens based on testing of more than 2,000 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15. The agency noted there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 16 among kids given dummy shots. More intriguing, researchers found the kids developed higher levels of virus-fighting antibodies than earlier studies measured in young adults.The younger teens received the same vaccine dosage as adults and had the same side effects, mostly sore arms and flu-like fever, chills or aches that signal a revved-up immune system, especially after the second dose.Pfizer’s testing in adolescents “met our rigorous standards,” FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said. “Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech recently requested similar authorization in the European Union, with other countries to follow.The latest news is welcome for U.S. families struggling to decide what activities are safe to resume when the youngest family members remain unvaccinated.Also Read: Canada approves Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for kids aged 12 and above“I can’t feel totally comfortable because my boys aren’t vaccinated,” said Carrie Vittitoe, a substitute teacher and freelance writer in Louisville, Kentucky, who is fully vaccinated, as are her husband and 17-year-old daughter.The FDA decision means her 13-year-old son soon could be eligible, leaving only her 11-year-old son unvaccinated. The family has not yet resumed going to church, and summer vacation will be a road trip so they do not have to get on a plane.“We can’t really go back to normal because two-fifths of our family don’t have protection,” Vittitoe said.Pfizer is not the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Moderna recently said preliminary results from its study in 12- to 17-year-olds show strong protection and no serious side effects. Another U.S. company, Novavax, has a Covid-19 vaccine in late-stage development and just began a study in 12- to 17-year-olds.Next up is testing whether the vaccine works for even younger children. Both Pfizer and Moderna have begun U.S. studies in children ages 6 months to 11 years. Those studies explore whether babies, preschoolers and elementary-age kids will need different doses than teens and adults. Gruber said Pfizer expects its first results in the fall.Outside of the U.S., AstraZeneca is studying its vaccine among 6- to 17-year-olds in Britain. And in China, Sinovac recently announced that it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3.Children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill from Covid-19, yet they represent nearly 14% of the nation’s coronavirus cases. At least 296 have died from Covid-19 in the U.S. alone, and more than 15,000 have been hospitalized, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics.That’s not counting the toll of family members becoming ill or dying -- or the disruption to school, sports and other activities so crucial to children’s overall well-being.The AAP welcomed the FDA’s decision.“Our youngest generations have shouldered heavy burdens over the past year, and the vaccine is a hopeful sign that they will be able to begin to experience all the activities that are so important for their health and development,” said AAP President Dr. Lee Savio Beers in a statement.Experts say children must get the shots if the country is to vaccinate the 70% to 85% of the population necessary to reach what’s called herd immunity.In the meantime, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says unvaccinated people — including children — should continue taking precautions such as wearing masks indoors and keeping their distance from other unvaccinated people outside of their households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-shots-authorised-for-us-children-as-young-as-12-101620690673129.html

Federal justice Thomas Thawley ruled the government had not overstepped its biosecurity powers in banning Australians from returning home temporarily.The move stranded an estimated 9,000 Australian citizens and threatened them with large fines and jail time if they tried to dodge the ban and return on non-direct flights.Thawley ruled that Morrison acted within the law, dashing the hopes of an Australian man who brought the case as he tries to return from Bengaluru.EU to launch Covid-19 health pass in JuneThe EU is “fully on track” to ensure all its citizens and residents are able to have a free Covid health pass next month to ease travel, a spokesman said on Monday. The EU is keen for anybody living in its 27 countries to be able to get a digital health pass - referred to as a “green certificate” - to display their vaccination status, results of Covid-19 tests and whether they recovered from a coronavirus infection.Bring back oxygen tanks: Nepal to Everest climbersNepal is so short of oxygen canisters for critical Covid-19 patients that it has asked climbers on Mount Everest to bring back their empty cylinders instead of abandoning them on mountain slopes.US biotech firm Novavax said it had positive results from preclinical studies of a shot combining its influenza and Covid vaccine candidates.England, Scotland and NI report no daily deathsNo coronavirus deaths were announced for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, the BBC reported. Wales was the exception in the UK, reporting four Covid-19 deaths on Monday.The development came as the UK’s coronavirus alert level was lowered from four to three on the advice of experts.

11-05-2021||World||WHO chief scientist says India's Covid-19 figures worrying||As India is in the grasp of a devastating second wave of Covid-19, World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan on Monday (local time) termed the rate of infections and deaths in the country as "worrying" and called on governments to boost exercises on reporting actual numbers.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Swaminathan said that the projections of one million deaths by August projected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) are based on models and available data, which are not predictions of the future and can be changed.Watch | ‘People not just dying of Covid…’: WHO Chief scientist on India’s Covid situation"I would say that at this point of time, the situation is very worrying, the daily number of cases and deaths that we are seeing today in India and other countries in the Southeast area region is a big concern for us and we also realise that these are underestimates. Every country in the world, in fact, the number of cases and deaths has been underestimated to its true number," she told ANI, adding that governments should boost exercises to report actual numbers.The WHO on Monday said that the coronavirus variant first identified in India last year was being classified as a variant of global concern, with some preliminary studies showing that it spreads more easily."We are classifying this as a variant of concern at a global level," Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on Covid-19, told a briefing.The B.1.617 variant is the fourth variant to be designated as being of "global concern" and requiring heightened tracking and analysis and data collection must be done in a transparent way, the Chief Scientist added."It should be done and we should be aware because the better the data, the better the policies can be directed towards what is happening. Let's remember, people are not just dying of Covid, people are also dying of other illnesses for which they are not able to access healthcare," Dr Swaminathan asserted.Indian coronavirus infections and deaths held close to record daily highs on Monday, increasing calls for the Indian government to lock down the world's second-most populous country.Soumya Swaminathan said studies were underway in India to examine the variant's transmissibility, the severity of the disease it causes and the response of antibodies in people who have been vaccinated. The WHO scientist called for more genome sequencing in India to get a full picture of what is going on in different parts of the country, while saying that it should be hand-in-hand with clinical epidemiological studies."Sequencing does not give you the full picture. You do not know whether it is more transmissible, whether it causes more severe disease or what impact it has on your diagnostics," she said.While replying to a query on travel amid the pandemic, Swaminathan said that the Review Committee on International Health Regulations (IHR) has said that vaccine passports should not be a pre-condition for travel."The scientific reason is that just because you are vaccinated does not mean you cannot get infected. You can see infection or you could be asymptomatic but when you travel you may infect others. The ethical argument is that not everyone has access to vaccinations now," she said, while advocating safe travel with precautions.She also said that the double mutant - B.1.617 - is highly transmissible and a WHO committee has classified it as a 'variant of concern'."For now, the message is that it will be more transmissible, but it behaves the same way as other viral strains replicate the same proportions. Vaccines are still very effective against every variant in the world in protecting against severe disease and hospitalisations," she informed.Swaminathan also called on countries to continuously update policies regarding the pandemic, which should be based on science and data. "We have to continue to adapt our policies. We cannot become stagnant. What is needed first is to call strong leadership which is based on science and data at public health principles. That needs to be updated from time to time even if you take treatment," Swaminathan added. The WHO scientist also urged data transparency in different countries and that people should be explained why certain decisions are being made and the rationale behind them.Earlier today, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the WHO Foundation was launching a "Together for India" appeal to raise funds to purchase oxygen, medicines and protective equipment for health workers.India is currently battling a deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is believed to being led by the 'double mutant'. The current wave has strained the country's health infrastructure and overburdened frontline medical workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-scientist-says-india-s-covid-19-figures-worrying-101620689401120.html

The country’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism revenue.While the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, it has largely been brought under control in the country through a series of strict lockdowns and border closures.Mount Everest straddles the China-Nepal border, with the north slope belonging to China.Also read | Covid-19 scales Mt Everest: At least 30 evacuated in recent weeksA team of Tibetan mountaineering guides will set up the separation line at the peak before climbers attempt to reach the summit from the Chinese side, Xinhua reported.The report did not make clear how the separation line will be drawn and defined or what it will be made of.Tibetan authorities said at a press conference they would take the “most stringent epidemic prevention measures” to avoid contact between climbers on the north and south slopes or at the top, Xinhua reported on Sunday.Twenty-one Chinese climbers have been approved to climb to the summit of Everest this year after having quarantined in Tibet since early April.Both countries suspended the climbing season on the world’s highest mountain last year due to the pandemic. Nepal has issued permits allowing 408 foreigners to attempt climbs this year as it tries to boost tourism revenue.An Everest permit alone from Nepal costs $11,000 and climbers pay upward of $40,000 for an expedition.More than a thousand people are typically camped at the bustling tent city at the foot of Everest on the Nepalese side at any one time, including foreign climbers and the teams of Nepali guides that escort them to the peak. In the last three weeks, Nepal’s daily case trajectory has shot up with two out of five people tested now returning positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-marks-separator-from-nepal-on-everest-101620677347539.html
11-05-2021||World||‘Migration pact will help return illegal settlers, offenders’: UK home secretary Priti Patel||The new India-UK migration and mobility partnership and a proposed British law on migration will facilitate the movement of Indian professionals and simultaneously streamline the process of returning illegal migrants and offenders, British home secretary Priti Patel said on Monday.The UK government understands the importance and significance of speedily resolving the cases of economic offenders such as Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya and is working with the courts to address “legal challenges” in order to ensure “just outcomes”, Patel said in an interview.The migration and mobility partnership, signed by Patel and external affairs minister S Jaishankar to coincide with the virtual India-UK Summit on May 4, will facilitate up to 3,000 young Indian professionals availing employment in the UK every year, and also enhance bilateral cooperation in combating illegal migration.The two sides have set April 2022 as the deadline for implementing the partnership and Patel described the arrangement as an “unprecedented” and a “bespoke” route to benefit young professionals from the UK and India. “At some stage, when we publish the figures on the new points-based immigration system [introduced by the UK last year], you will see that India is benefiting enormously from this because it’s a professional route,” she said.Patel also spoke of her plans for introducing a new legislation on illegal migration during the state opening of the UK Parliament on Tuesday, which she described as a “big reform” that will “facilitate the path for [illegal Indian migrants] to be returned back to India”.Also read | Indian variant got to be monitored, says Boris Johnson as UK lockdown eases“So we have many legal obstacles in the UK, I’m not going to sugar-coat that. These legal obstacles end up in the courts, people will use appeal, it is a complete legal merry-go-round,” she said. These reforms will streamline the process of identifying illegal migrants and also address “some of the extradition challenges that we have faced over years”, she added.Asked specifically about the extradition of Nirav Modi and Mallya, Patel said many of the complexities and legalities surrounding illegal migrants also apply to both these cases. She contended she had changed the relationship between the UK and Indian governments in respect of extradition, and the British side was working to resolve these cases as speedily as possible.“So we are absolutely clear of the importance and the significance of these cases and quite rightly, we want them to progress as swiftly as possible. It serves no purpose to keep having these cases tied up within the legal wrangling,” she said.“I ordered on April 15 the extradition of Nirav Modi and... that’s in the public domain. He has indicated that... he’s appealing on extradition. So instantly, we’re in a legal process. So I can’t comment further on any of that whatsoever,” she said.Asked specifically if Mallya had applied for asylum in the UK Patel said: “I can’t sit and share with you the ins and outs of all of that because that would prejudice the case. That’s not right and I don’t want to do that.”Patel only said that there are “legal challenges” and “clearly we have to work with the courts and that is what we’re doing because we need just outcomes”. She added: “There are legal processes and the fairness and the firmness that comes with those legal processes need to be respected.”Fugitive businessman Nirav Modi’s extradition was cleared after a British court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam. He was the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Mallya whose extradition was cleared by a trial court in the UK.Patel evaded a direct response to a question on whether the case of UK national Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, had been taken up with the Indian side after a UN panel ruled his detention was arbitrary.“If you don’t mind, it’s not for me to disclose what is discussed in private meetings...there’s plenty of engagements around cases of that nature with FCDO [UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and those engagements will continue,” she replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migration-pact-will-help-return-illegal-settlers-offenders-uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-101620676827888.html
11-05-2021||World||UK home secy speaks to HT on illegal migration; Nirav Modi, Mallya extradition and more||The new India-UK migration and mobility partnership and a proposed British law on migration will facilitate the movement of Indian professionals and simultaneously streamline the process of returning illegal migrants and offenders, British home secretary Priti Patel said in an interview with HT on Monday.On the issue of Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya’s extradition, Patel said that “we’re in a legal process”. Here are the excerpts from the interview. Q. What do the UK and India hope to achieve through the Migration and Mobility Partnership signed during the India-UK Summit? A: I used to come to India a lot in my ministerial capacity... and I used to receive a lot of umbrage about the lack of progress on mobility and migration issues. It was my determination, after becoming home secretary, and the prime minister’s conviction to really shift the relationship of India and the UK around mobility. I have to say it’s very much thanks to Boris Johnson, thanks to his vision and his leadership, and also to Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi’s conviction and leadership as well, to bring the two countries together to really move the needle. You’ve got two home ministries as well, with Amit Shah and myself in position, absolutely determined to make this work. We have created something that is unprecedented, we haven’t just taken something off the shelf, we have created a new bespoke and new reciprocal route for young professionals from the UK and India. Both our countries will benefit and that’s just so important, to benefit and take part in this new professional migration and mobility partnership, which will build upon our ‘living bridge’... the diaspora community and the flow of what we’ve had before. But this is fundamentally different. Of course, this is a key pillar of the 2030 Roadmap but this will work through mutual recognition and working together. From my side, I am now working with colleagues in the MEA’s office and the Indian high commission to make this practical and not just sort of say, here we have a partnership and isn’t that fantastic. It is fantastic but we will make sure that this builds upon the benefits that have come together from, for example, something else that I did last year for India’s benefit, which will be the points-based immigration system. At some stage, when we publish the figures on the new points-based immigration system, you will see that India is benefiting enormously from this because it’s a professional route. I’ve always spoken about the professional people of India, the close ties, the living bridge, clearly I understand this perhaps more than others but really channelling and bringing together these strands have made this mobility partnership unique and so beneficial to India and the UK, economically and professionally in terms of skills and actually cementing the bond between our two countries which is really important. As I said, this is unprecedented and the ways of working around this are unprecedented. The fact that I’m as plugged into the high commission here, working the teams there who are working with my teams here...same with the MEA’s office, [external affairs minister S] Jaishankar and the work of his team plugged into my policy team here. So it’s seamless on that basis. This isn’t just some kind of agreement that we’ve signed and then we’ve sort of ticked the box and move on. This is a living, live agreement and it speaks to the roadmap and our values that we have as two countries working together. Q. Do you expect to deliver on the April 2022 timeframe for implementing the Migration and Mobility Partnership? A: Yeah, totally, absolutely, no question about that. There is no delay. We started work the minute after we signed the agreement last Tuesday. So, follow up with our colleagues at the high commission already. I have to emphasise that we have the level of pro-activity and positivity on both sides, it’s really the key driver to all of this. This is not static, this is living, we are absolutely determined not just to make this work but this new route will be the roadmap for us in terms of enhanced mobility and an enhanced relationship for decades to come. The fact that in the 18 months that I’ve been home secretary, we’ve been able to energise the mobility discussions and the relationship by putting propositions forward that my predecessors did not put forward. I have led that, obviously with the leadership of my prime minister and colleagues in India, especially the leadership of the prime minister of India as well. Q. Have you addressed the issues that were holding up the return of illegal Indian migrants, and is there a ballpark figure for the number of people who would be coming back to India? A: I’m not going to disclose figures because that takes time to work through them. But there are many technical barriers, let me just be clear about this, and legal barriers that prevent us from returning people. Part of that is our system, it is very much our system...[on Tuesday] we have the state opening of Parliament in the UK. We will pass new legislation around illegal migration. It’s a big reform that I will be bringing in as home secretary which will facilitate the path for Indian nationals to be returned back to India. So we have many legal obstacles in the UK, I’m not going to sugar-coat that. These legal obstacles end up in the courts, people will use appeal, it is a complete legal merry-go-round. We are going to streamline much of that and bring new efficiencies and new transparencies and new accountability around that. So that will absolutely help with the ways of working between both our governments and with the high commission over travel authorisation documents, identifying individuals – all these things which are just wrapped up in endless bureaucracy and process. We are going to streamline that and make it much clearer on both sides because if we don’t, then we harbour people that obviously the Indian government want to have sent back and it works both ways. Which brings me on to not just illegal migration but some of the extradition challenges that we have faced over years, and even in my tenure of 18 months as home secretary, we have already energised and changed that relationship between the UK and India in respect of extradition – that has improved, it has absolutely improved in a way that benefits both our countries. It’s no point us having people sitting on both sides in both countries that we can’t send back to get on and deal with some of these really naughty, very serious and criminal issues. Q. Have the two sides agreed on documentation and processes to identify illegal migrants? A: We absolutely know what is needed in terms of process, identification, documentation, how we can remove people, how we can return people. This is case by case and it takes a long time but we have ways in which we can literally streamline a lot of this. But it is intense, we will work with the high commission here, we will work with the MEA’s office. The way of working that we are proposing is unprecedented because it speaks for the commitment that both sides have to bring about the changes that both governments want to see. Q. Could we have clarity on the issue of the extradition of Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya? In the case of Mallya, the UK has said the extradition is being held up by a confidential legal issue but there is speculation here that he has applied for asylum. A: Speculation will always exist. What I will say – you’ve already heard me speak about some of the complexities [and] legalities around illegal migration. That equally applies here in both these cases. I ordered on April 15 the extradition of Nirav Modi and...that’s in the public domain. He has indicated that... he’s appealing on extradition. So, instantly, we’re in a legal process. So, I can’t comment further on any of that whatsoever. In a similar vein, with Vijay Mallya’s case, there’s an ongoing legal case. I can’t sit and share with you the ins and outs of all of that because that would prejudice the case. That’s not right and I don’t want to do that. So I can’t comment on that but what I would say to you and your readers – two things, first of all, I have changed that relationship between the UK government and the Indian government in respect of extradition. I understand the seriousness of these cases, I understand the desire as to why India, you know, it’s the same for us – there are individuals in India that we want to be returned and extradited to the UK. So that is changing fundamentally but alongside that, where we have legal challenges, clearly we have to work with the courts and that is what we’re doing because we need to have just outcomes. There are legal processes and the fairness and the firmness that comes with those legal processes need to be respected. So we are absolutely clear of the importance and the significance of these cases and quite rightly, we want them to progress as swiftly as possible. It serves no purpose to keep having these cases tied up within the legal wrangling. We are absolutely working with the persistence that we have and we understand the significance of all these cases. Q. Has the UK discussed with the Indian side the case of Christian Michel, especially after he wrote to the British government following the report of a UN panel of experts that his detention in India is arbitrary? A: If you don’t mind, it’s not for me to disclose what is discussed in private meetings...there’s plenty of engagements around cases of that nature with FCDO [UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and those engagements will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-home-secy-speaks-to-ht-on-illegal-migration-nirav-modi-mallya-extradition-and-more-101620673880543.html
