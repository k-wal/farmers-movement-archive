Output grew faster in August when many manufacturers had not long reopened after Britain's first lockdown.Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year - the biggest fall in output in more than 300 years - and even with rapid growth this year it may take until 2022 for it to regain its pre-crisis size, a slower rebound than the United States.Manufacturers are still dealing with the knock-on impact of COVID-19 disruptions which have increased shipping costs and led to shortages of key components such as microchips used for car electronics.British firms also face greater friction trading with their European Union counterparts due to trade barriers which came into force on Jan. 1 due to Brexit, though IHS Markit said this was proving less troublesome than feared.Overall confidence rose to its highest in seven years."Optimism reflected expectations for less disruption related to COVID-19 and Brexit, economic recovery, improved client confidence and planned new product launches," IHS Markit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-factory-activity-expands-at-fastest-rate-since-1994-101620117895693.html

But it has warned that Afghanistan would suffer isolation and sanctions if it backslides on human rights.A February 2020, U.S.-Taliban accord struck by the Trump administration specified a May 1 deadline for completion of a U.S. troop withdrawal from America's longest war.Biden, however, decided to complete the withdrawal before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States that triggered the U.S.-led invasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-would-roll-back-afghan-women-s-rights-us-intelligence-report-101620148927883.html
04-05-2021||World||Sri Lankan Parliament postpones debate on China-backed Colombo port city bill||The Sri Lankan Parliament on Tuesday postponed a debate on the controversial Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill which was scheduled for discussion on Wednesday.All party leaders in the House agreed that the debate should be rescheduled as the Supreme Court's determination on the constitutionality of the bill had not yet reached Parliament, officials said.The USD 1.4-billion Colombo Port City project, expected to play a key role in China's ambitious 'Maritime Silk Road' project in India's backyard, is said to be the single largest private sector development in the island.China has built the port city on reclaimed sea, adjoining the Port of Colombo.The Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill aims to provide for a special economic zone to establish a commission to grant registrations, licenses, authorisations and other approvals to operate business in such economic zones.As per the schedule on Wednesday, the Supreme Court's determination of the bill was to be read in Parliament by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena before the House was opened to debate on it. However, the determination has not yet reached Parliament.The apex court had concluded the examination of the bill on April 23. The Supreme Court has heard 18 petitions filed against the bill by the Opposition parties and civil groups.Some of the pleas called for the Supreme Court to order a national referendum and a vote of two-thirds majority in Parliament to pass the bill.The bill was gazetted on March 24 and placed in the order paper of Parliament on April 9. While the Opposition parties demanded the bill be debated upon for at least three days, the government had scheduled the debate for just one day.The Opposition has questioned the government on why was it rushing ahead with the bill.Petitioners have branded the Port Commission Bill as a threat to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka, objecting to a clause which allows foreign persons to form the board of the commission.Some groups have claimed that the port city could end up becoming a Chinese colony, if the bill is approved in its present form.Sri Lanka, in recent years, has carried out various development projects with an estimated USD 8-billion in loans.The huge Chinese loans sparked concerns globally, after Sri Lanka handed over the Hambantota Port to China in 2017 as debt swap, amounting to USD 1.2 billion for a 99-years lease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lankan-parliament-postpones-debate-on-china-backed-colombo-port-city-bill-101620133743082.html
04-05-2021||World||Covid in US: Biden admin to reallocate vaccines to states with greater interest||The Biden administration will begin shifting how it allocates Covid-19 shots to states, moving doses from states with lower demand to those with stronger interest in vaccines, an administration official said Tuesday.The change away from a strict by-population allocation comes as demand for the coronavirus vaccines has dropped nationwide, but especially precipitously in some areas, with some states turning down part or all of their weekly dose allotments. The federal government will now shift some of those doses to areas with higher demand, in an effort to speed shots in those areas.The administration says those states would have the shots available whenever demand for vaccines in their states increases — a key priority of the Biden administration.Governors were informed of the change by the White House Tuesday morning. The Washington Post first reported on the new allocation.This week, Iowa turned down nearly three quarters of the vaccine doses available to the state for next week from the federal government because demand for the shots remains weak.Individual states have made similar shifts internally to account for changing demand. Last week, Washington state changed the way it allocates coronavirus vaccine to its counties. Previously the state doled out supplies to counties proportionate to their populations. But Gov. Jay Inslee said Thursday that the amounts now will be based on requests from health care providers.The official who confirmed the reallocation decision spoke on the condition of anonymity before the news was shared publicly,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-us-biden-admin-to-reallocate-vaccines-to-states-with-greater-interest-101620146612016.html
04-05-2021||World||Canada taken to court over Covid policy that pushes asylum-seekers to US||Canada's pandemic-era policy of turning back asylum-seekers trying to enter between official border crossings is unlawful and violates their rights, a legal action filed on Tuesday alleges.The Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers filed the legal action in federal court claiming the policy is unlawful because it fails to consider the situation of asylum-seekers and whether they have reasonable alternatives available.The policy also denies asylum-seekers their right to a hearing, according to a copy of the legal action seen by Reuters.It is the first legal action against this policy since it was instituted in response to Covid-19 in March 2020.Between March 21, 2020, and April 20, 2021, Canada turned back 387 asylum-seekers trying to cross between ports of entry, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.Even though Canada said they could return at a later date to make refugee claims, the legal action argues Canada is not ensuring that the turning away of refugees is temporary.Canada has previously said the turn-back policy, which it has been renewing monthly, is a necessary public health measure. Canada also says it has assurances from the United States that "most" asylum-seekers will be returned to Canada to pursue refugee claims.But the United States deported at least one asylum-seeker turned back under this policy, according to the man's lawyer and correspondence seen by Reuters. Others were held in a detention centre.Canada's Public Safety Minister could not immediately be reached for comment.Burundian Apollinaire Nduwimana tried to cross into Canada in October at Roxham Road, which has become a common destination for asylum-seekers skirting the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).Under the STCA, asylum-seekers crossing at a formal port of entry along the Canada-U.S. border are turned around and are often held in U.S. immigration detention. Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the contested agreement after a lower court ruled the pact violated asylum-seekers' fundamental rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Nduwimana aimed to avoid being turned back under the STCA, only to be turned back under the new policy. Canadian border officers handed him to U.S. authorities, who, he says, brought him to the immigration detention centre at Batavia, New York.According to his lawyers, U.S. authorities tried multiple times to deport him to Burundi, to which Canada has deferred deportations for reasons of humanitarian crisis.Nduwimana is not directly affected by this legal action. But his case demonstrates the potential repercussions of this policy, lawyers say.He was allowed to enter Canada under an exemption to the turn-back policy after being detained for five months. He has now filed a refugee claim.He was one of nine turned-back asylum-seekers granted a national interest exemption letter by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Marco Mendicino. According to the government, seven have come to Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-taken-to-court-over-covid-policy-that-pushes-asylum-seekers-to-us-101620145688555.html

Whoever violates the television and video law, especially people using satellite dishes, shall be punished with one year imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 kyat ($320)," MRTV state television said."Illegal media outlets are broadcasting news that undermines national security, the rule of law and public order, and encouraging those who commit treason."In the face of widespread opposition, the junta has struggled to impose order since overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and ending an unsteady transition to democracy.Violence has spiralled since the coup and security forces have killed more than 760 civilians, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group says. The junta disputes the figure and says 24 police and soldiers have died in the protests.Myanmar media reported that five people were killed by at least one parcel bomb on Tuesday, including an ousted lawmaker and three police officers who had joined a civil disobedience movement opposing military rule.Meanwhile, the Chinland Defence Force, a newly formed militia in Chin state bordering India, said on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its forces had killed at least four Myanmar army soldiers and wounded 10 in a clash overnight.The Myanmar army did not comment on the claim.Villagers had found the beheaded body of a junta appointed local administrator in the northwestern Sagaing region, independent broadcaster DVB reported, a day after another local official was stabbed to death in the biggest city, Yangon.Reuters was unable to reach local police for comment.Pro-democracy supporters held protests on Tuesday in the second-biggest city of Mandalay, including one by education staff calling for a boycott of schools and universities when they reopen in June, Myanmar Now reported.The junta said it had to seize power because its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party were not addressed by an election commission that deemed the vote fair.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup along with many other members of her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-announces-ban-on-satellite-tv-as-security-threat-101620140231363.html

On Tuesday, it confirmed five new locally acquired cases.The stricter measures, which will be effective from May 8, include extending checks on where incoming travellers have been to three weeks earlier, instead of two weeks currently.All visitors with a recent travel history in higher risk countries and who arrive from Saturday onwards will also need to be ini quarantine for 21 days, instead of 14.Social gathering will also be limited to five people, while indoor gyms and fitness studios will be shut.The new measures amount to the tightest local restrictions since Singapore started easing curbs in the middle of last year after a partial lockdown.Among infections detected in the latest Covid-19 cluster in a hospital, nine out of 40 cases had already been fully vaccinated."Because of vaccination, these cases are either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and none has required oxygen so far," said health minister Gan Kim Yong."Therefore vaccination remains an important tool to help lower the risk of infection and severe disease," he said.The minister also said authorities could not rule out a return to a partial lockdown again, if the situation worsened.Though Singapore's daily cases are only a fraction of the number being reported among Singapore's Southeast Asian neighbours, a jump in infections would be a setback for the Asian business hub, which has successfully contained its earlier outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tightens-covid-19-curbs-as-overseas-virus-variants-emerge-101620132786197.html

It saw its contribution to global output collapse by 49% to 4.7 trillion dollars in 2020, causing the loss of 62 million jobs, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. International visitor spending plunged by an unprecedented 69%.“We emphasize that the resumption of travel and tourism is crucial for global economic recovery because of the direct and indirect economic impact this sector has on others,” the document said. The pandemic is an opportunity to “shape a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive tourism sector,” it also said.Thomas Bareiss, a deputy German economy minister who took part in the virtual meeting, said a new start for tourism after the pandemic should be guided by the principle of “build back better.”“We agreed that we want a more resilient, more sustainable and more inclusive tourism sector in order to be better equipped for the future,” Bareiss said in an emailed statement.The ministers are set to back efforts for safe mobility, coordinating with initiatives including the European Union’s Digital Green Certificate. That document will show the bearer has been fully vaccinated, has immunity via recovery, or recently tested negative.EU member states would reopen borders to travelers from countries with relatively low infection rates, as well as those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, under a proposal unveiled on Monday.

The meeting was told that Pakistan's agreement with the EU did not include any condition with regard to religion.Pakistan had made a total of eight agreements with the EU on various human rights issues including human freedom, enforced disappearances, women rights and minority rights.The meeting was told that the country would suffer an annual loss of $3billion if the EU revokes its GSP status.In January 2014, the EU granted Pakistan status under its flagship trading scheme, the General Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP ).The GSP provides enhanced and preferential free trade between the EU and a small list of countries that are meant to be among those developing countries with the best human rights records.According to the October 2019 report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, at least 80 people have been convicted of blasphemy in Pakistan and many of them face the death penalty.In December 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution calling the worldwide repeal of blasphemy, heresy and apostasy laws, some of which have resulted in the imprisonment and/or deaths of Christians accused of speaking against Islam.Pakistan's blasphemy laws, both in content and application, are contrary to Pakistan's human rights obligations to respect and protect the right to life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, freedom of opinion and expression, equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination and the right to life.

04-05-2021||World||Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu faces midnight deadline to form government||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced a midnight deadline Tuesday to form a government, a daunting task that would likely require convincing the Jewish far right to cooperate with an Islamic party.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, was given a 28-day window to forge a majority coalition following a March 23 general election, Israel's fourth inconclusive vote in less than two years.The prime minister's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in the vote, but as results came in on election day, it became clear that he would again struggle to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament.Over the past month, Israeli media have been rife with speculation about possible deals that could see Netanyahu extend his record 12 consecutive years in power.But hours before his negotiating window was due to expire at 2100 GMT, the core obstacles facing the 71-year-old premier remained largely unchanged since the morning after the vote.A coalition will require coming to terms with his estranged former protege Naftali Bennett, leader of the hawkish Yamina party.It will also require persuading the far-right Religious Zionism alliance to tacitly cooperate with the Islamic conservative Raam party.'End of Zionism'Religious Zionism has vowed not to sit in such a coalition.Orit Strok, a lawmaker from the party who lives in a settlement in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, told army radio that sitting with Raam would "bring a Trojan horse into the government of Israel" and mean "the end of Zionism."Netanyahu said Thursday that he had offered Bennett to serve as premier ahead of him if that would help maintain the right's hold on power.Bennett immediately replied that he never asked Netanyahu for the opportunity to be prime minister."I asked him to form a government, which, unfortunately, he cannot do," Bennett said.Political scientist Gayil Talshir of Hebrew University said a Netanyahu-Bennett arrangement was doomed because it would require support from Likud defector Gideon Saar, whose New Hope party won six seats.Saar has maintained that he is committed to ousting Netanyahu."Bennett did not say no to (Netanyahu's) offer, he just said it's not realistic," Talshir told AFP.As his coalition talks faced roadblocks, Netanyahu has also floated the idea of passing legislation that would enable direct election of a prime minister.He would need 61 Knesset votes to do it, unlikely given the election results, but Talshir said: "This is what Netanyahu tries to do now, to get the legislation passed."Eyes on Lapid?Netanyahu has a reputation as a political survivor and may yet have more moves to make."This is a day for people with strong nerves," political commentator Sima Kadmon wrote in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper."As always, nobody knows what trick Netanyahu intends to pull out of his hat at the last minute."Barring a breakthrough before midnight, President Reuven Rivlin can reclaim the mandate.He could give opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose centrist Yesh Atid party finished second in the March vote, 28 days to try to form a government, or he could ask parliament to recommend its own candidate for the premiership."It's time for a new government," Lapid said Tuesday."In one more day, if nothing happens, we will be faced with two options: an Israeli national unity government, solid, decent and hard working, or a fifth election."The coalition deadline comes just days after 45 mainly ultra-Orthodox Jewish pilgrims were killed in a stampede in Mount Meron in northern Israel.A government investigation has been opened into the tragedy, called one of Israel's worst peacetime disasters.Lapid said it was "preventable," assigning blame in part to the fact that Israel "does not have a functioning government."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-faces-midnight-deadline-to-form-government-101620127860545.html

I've got no family left if you don't help me. Everybody will die. Help me, help me," she pleaded.Cameroon's two western Anglophone regions have been gripped by fighting since 2017 as English-speaking rebels try to break away from the predominantly Francophone government.More than 3,500 people have died and 700,000 have been displaced in the violence with both sides accused of committing atrocities.The woman later told Australia's Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) she had made the public display to ask Morrison to help desperate people seeking asylum from Cameroon."There are people seeking asylum and Australia must try to help them escape," the woman told the broadcaster, identifying herself only as Lillian.Under Canberra's immigration policy, asylum-seekers who reach Australia are sent to Australian-run detention camps offshore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-hears-emotional-plea-for-cameroonian-asylumseekers-101620123776716.html
04-05-2021||World||EU drug regulator starts review of China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union’s drug regulator announced Tuesday that it has started a rolling review of China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine to assess its effectiveness and safety, a first step toward possible approval for use in the 27-nation bloc.The European Medicines Agency said Tuesday that its decision to start the review is based on preliminary results from laboratory studies and clinical studies.“These studies suggest that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies” that fight the coronavirus “and may help protect against the disease,” the agency said in a statement.The EMA, which so far has approved four coronavirus vaccines, added that no application seeking marketing authorization for the Sinovac vaccine has been submitted yet. The agency also is conducting rolling reviews of three other vaccines: the one developed by German biotech company CureVac, the American-developed Novavax and Russia's Sputnik V.The agency said its experts will “evaluate data as they become available to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks” of the vaccine. The rolling review will continue until “enough evidence is available for a formal marketing authorization application,” the EMA said, adding that it could not predict timelines.The announcement from the Amsterdam-based agency came a day after a top World Health Organization official said the WHO is set to decide this week whether to approve two Chinese COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use.Such approval would mark the first time that a Chinese vaccine had been granted a so-called emergency use listing from the U.N. health agency, and would trigger a broader rollout of Chinese vaccines that are already being used in some countries beyond China.Mariangela Simao, assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, says some “final arrangements” remain to be made before the crucial word from a WHO technical advisory group comes on the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.China and a number of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, already are using the Sinovac vaccine, which is made using killed or inactivated coronavirus.No Phase 3 study data on the vaccine has yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. The vaccine has been studied in several countries. The most closely watched research involved about 12,000 health workers in Brazil, where researchers reported 50.7% effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 and much stronger protection against severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-starts-review-of-china-s-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-101620127385029.html

Biden signed a proclamation restricting travel from India, with some exceptions, after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated India’s Covid-19 assessment from Level 3 to Level 4, the highest level on its scale. The CDC has warned that even vaccinated travellers “may be at risk for getting and spreading” coronavirus variants.The United Kingdom has already put India on its ‘red list’, which means foreigners who have been in or through India in the previous 10 days will be refused entry to the UK. Those with British or Irish nationality, or with residence rights in the UK, will be able to enter Britain on the condition of mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. The Australian government recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back. Any requirement of flight operation will need special permission from the embassy.Here’s the list of other countries that have restricted flights from India:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-travel-ban-these-countries-have-restricted-flights-to-and-from-india-101620125693859.html

"We don't have enough raw materials, we don't have enough manufacturing in the right places, so it is allowing the nations that have manufacturing in place to hoard their vaccines, so we got to fix that piece."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melinda-gates-sees-us-government-donating-covid-19-vaccine-doses-soon-101620126656812.html

04-05-2021||World||Covid-19 lockdown rules to end on June 21, says Boris Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said coronavirus lockdown rules are set to be scrapped in seven weeks’ time, as he hailed the U.K.’s successful vaccine rollout ahead of key elections this week.On the campaign trail, Johnson said the pandemic data was likely to allow people in England to stay overnight with friends or relations, with indoor hospitality able to reopen from May 17.Remaining social distancing rules are also likely to be canceled from June 21, he added, although he warned that international travel will need to be carefully monitored after May 17 to avoid reimporting the virus again.The prime minister is making his case to millions of voters in England, Wales and Scotland who are taking part in elections on May 6. At stake is who gets to govern London and Scotland, as well as more than 140 local English districts. In Scotland, the prospect of a new referendum on independence from the rest of the U.K. hangs in the balance, depending on the result.The U.K.’s Future May Be in the Hands of Scotland’s Rebel YouthAfter a year on the back foot defending a pandemic strategy that delivered the worst death toll in Europe, Johnson has spent much of 2021 championing his government’s success at rolling out vaccines faster than most other wealthy nations.“With the vaccine rollout going the way that it is - we have done 50 million jabs as I speak to you today, quarter of the adult population, one in four, have had two jabs,” the premier said on a visit to Hartlepool in northeastern England Monday. “You are seeing the results of that really starting to show up.”Johnson’s Popularity Faces a Key Test in a Brexit HeartlandHe said the next stage in the government’s plan to gradually ease lockdown on May 17 was on track. “But it also looks to me as though we’ll be able to say social distancing as we currently have to do it, the one-meter plus, I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-meter plus from June 21.”Currently under “one-meter plus” guidelines, people are advised to maintain a distance of at least a meter from each other indoors, while wearing a face covering or taking other protective measures. Removing the rule could allow businesses and citizens to return to something closer to pre-pandemic normality.Foreign TravelBut speaking on Tuesday, Trade Secretary Liz Truss urged people to hold off booking overseas holidays until the so-called travel task force issues its findings. The government has previously said non-essential travel will be allowed from May 17 at the earliest.“The really important thing is that we don’t move too fast and jeopardize the progress we’ve made, so people will have to wait a bit longer, I’m afraid, to be able to hear the news on exactly what’s happening on the travel front,” Truss told Sky News. “We need to be cautious and we need to make sure that we’re not simply importing the virus after we’ve successfully dealt with it in Britain.”Thursday’s elections take place against a difficult backdrop for Johnson. He’s beset by questions over whether he broke rules in the way he funded the refurbishment of his official apartment, following weeks of negative headlines about his conduct and the actions of some of his senior ministers. On Sunday, a senior Tory said the premier would have to resign if he’d broken the rules.“I know that people want to focus on trivia, but I’m focusing on the issues that matter,” Johnson said Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-lockdown-rules-to-end-on-june-21-says-boris-johnson-101620120100849.html

Starting on Monday, any user with at least 600 followers can be a host, the company added.Twitter introduced Spaces last year to compete with viral app Clubhouse, which jump-started the audio chat trend and attracted celebrities and entrepreneurs, but remains limited as an invite-only app.Over the coming months, Twitter said a limited group of users will be able to sell tickets to access their Spaces conversations, and will determine their own pricing and how many tickets to make available. Hosts will keep the majority of the revenue, while Twitter will earn a "small amount," the company added.The move is part of Twitter's effort to be a bigger player in the "creator economy," as influencers and independent writers are increasingly earning money from their content on platforms like YouTube or Substack.Facebook last month announced its own plans for audio chat features, and also said it would allow listeners to tip hosts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-introduce-ticketing-for-audio-spaces-feature-101620118259680.html
04-05-2021||World||Fauci advises India to marshal all resources, including Army, to fight Covid-19||Terming the situation in India “very desperate”, America's top public health expert Dr Anthony Fauci has suggested the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.In an exclusive interview to PTI, Fauci, who is the Chief Medical Adviser to US President Joe Biden, also called for a nationwide lockdown, not necessarily for six months but “for a few weeks” to break the “continuity and transmission of infection.”Dr. Fauci’s suggestions and dire assessment of India came as the number of new Covid infections in India officially passed 2 crore, almost double the number three months ago. Of these more than 2,20,000 people have died, according to official figures.In contrast, the United States has recorded 3.2 crore cases and 5,77,000 deaths in a population that’s one-fourth of India’s 120 crore since the pandemic began. Still, because of India’s inadequate healthcare infrastructure, weaker economy and lower standard of living, the suffering has been magnified, especially in the second wave that has led to a huge shortage of oxygen and hospital ICU beds.The government says the infection rates have consistently dropped since April 30, when it recorded more than 400,000 cases. It reported over 355,000 cases on Tuesday.“Given the fact that India is under such terrible stress right now with the extent of the outbreak, the rest of the world should pitch in to help, similar to what the United States is doing,” he said.“The world can help by supplying India with materials, and perhaps even personnel, but certainly materials that they need to adequately address it (the pandemic),” he said.The 80-year-old physician and immunologist, who serves as the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Monday also recommend mass vaccination to arrest the current spread of the deadly disease across India.“Right now, they should start getting as many people vaccinated as they possibly can, with both the vaccines that they developed themselves in India as well as supplies of vaccines that they may be able to procure from other suppliers, be that the United States, be that Russia… whatever country is willing whenever companies are willing to supply vaccine,” Fauci said.However, getting someone "vaccinated now" does not solve today's problem, he noted, adding that it helps prevent a problem several weeks from now.The more immediate problem is how to care for and treat the thousands who are thronging overflowing hospitals across the country every day, in desperate need of oxygen and basic treatment.“It is quite obvious to everyone that the situation in India is extremely serious," said Fauci, who is considered one of the world’s top infectious disease specialists.“When you have so many people getting infected…the lack of the capability to take adequate care of everyone; when you have shortages of hospital beds and oxygen and shortages of supplies, that really becomes a very desperate situation. Which is the reason why we feel it's important for the rest of the world to help out, to the extent they can,” he said.Fauci, who has been keeping a close tab on the worst health crisis in India, said there are certain things that India can do immediately, mid-term and long-term basis. He recommended taking the help of the country's armed forces to immediately build makeshift field hospitals. "You will recall, last year when China had a very serious problem, they marshalled their resources to very, very rapidly build new hospitals, to be able to handle all the people who required hospitalisation," he said.Referring to media reports, he said there is a drastic shortage of hospital beds in India and people are being taken care of in makeshift arrangements."So, it would be possible, perhaps, with the help of your own military, to put up field hospitals as you would do as if in a wartime setting, so that people who are sick and require a hospital bed, will have a hospital bed," he said. He also underlined the need for a countrywide lockdown for a few weeks to arrest the spread of the virus.“A few days ago, I recommended and I believe at least parts of India are doing it, that you shut down the country in lockdown,” he said."Because other countries, including for example what China did last year, what Australia did when they had an outbreak, what New Zealand did, what other countries did is to completely lock down for a relatively limited period of time. You don't have to lock down for six months. You can lock down for a few weeks,” Fauci suggested.He explained that when a lockdown in imposed, it definitely interferes with the dynamics of the viral outbreak and you could interfere with the continuity and the transmission of infection, the top immunologist noted, citing the experience gained by other countries.Responding to a question whether the current surge in infections in India posed a threat to other countries, Fauci said, “Well, I mean, obviously, when you have a massive amount of infection in one country there's always a risk of infections.“You want to be careful that that doesn't spread widely elsewhere,” Fauci added."We are very sorry that India is going through this very, very difficult time. And that's the reason why we know we are in great solidarity with them and trying to do whatever we can to help them," Fauci said, referring to the Biden administration rushing medical equipment and life-saving drugs to India to help it fight the pandemic..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-advises-india-to-marshal-all-resources-including-army-to-fight-covid19-101620111230887.html

04-05-2021||World||Lubbock city in Texas bans abortion, allows family to sue providers, helpers||Declaring Lubbock a "sanctuary city" for the unborn, voters have approved a local ban on almost all abortions, and the Texas legislature is considering a law to bar the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.Lubbock, home to some 260,000 people, is the 25th such "sanctuary city" - all but two in Texas - to have banned abortions in the last two years.Drucilla Tigner, a policy and advocacy strategist for ACLU-Texas, said most other towns that have passed similar sanctuary city measures have populations of a few hundred or thousand, and often have no medical providers whatsoever, let alone one that provides abortions, as Lubbock does.The Lubbock ordinance bans abortion in all cases except when a woman's life is in danger. It also allows any private citizen of Texas and also the family member of any woman who has an abortion to sue the provider or anyone who assisted.Nearly 63% of votes cast in the May 1 election supported Lubbock's abortion measure, the county elections office said Monday. Turnout was 22.6%. The measure is expected to take effect once the official tally is complete, which could take up to a month.The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday said it is weighing legal measures, calling the Lubbock vote unconstitutional and detrimental to women's health. The ACLU last year sued other such "sanctuary cities" in Texas. That lawsuit was dropped after the ordinances were changed to remove wording that labeled two reproductive rights groups as criminal organizations.Lubbock is a medical hub for 1 million people in West Texas. The ordinance "has a huge impact on not just the people of Lubbock, but that entire region," Tigner said.Planned Parenthood, which last year reopened a clinic in Lubbock, said in a written statement that it "will follow legal restrictions as required."A woman's right to have an abortion through the first trimester of pregnancy was protected nationally in 1973, following the Supreme Court's landmark 7-2 ruling in Roe v. Wade.Abortion fights at the local level have heated up since the Supreme Court attained a 6-3 conservative majority under former President Donald Trump. If Roe v Wade is overturned, abortion would be governed by state and local law.Jim Baxa, whose West Texas for Life was among the organizations that got the ordinance before voters, said his bigger goal was to see Texas ban abortions at the state level.Baxa said West Texas for Life got the "sanctuary city" idea after seeing similar measures pass in east Texas two years ago. After the Lubbock city council unanimously rejected the measure as violating state and federal law, West Texas for Life collected enough petition signatures to force a vote.The Texas Senate in March approved five bills restricting abortion - including one that would ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks in some pregnancies. The Texas House is expected to take up the measures later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lubbock-city-in-texas-bans-abortion-allows-family-to-sue-providers-helpers-101620109518905.html

Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 after spending about eight years at Google.Apple declined to comment on Bengio's role. Bengio did not respond to a request for comment.Bengio who left Google last week after about 14 years said last month he was pursuing "other exciting opportunities".His decision followed Google's firings in recent months of fellow scientists Margaret Mitchell after alleging she transferred electronic files out of the company and Timnit Gebru after she threatened to quit rather than retract a paper.Mitchell and Gebru had co-led a team researching ethics issues in AI, and had voiced concern about Google's workplace diversity and approach to reviewing research. Bengio had expressed support for the pair.As one of the early leaders of the Google Brain research team, Bengio advanced the "deep learning" algorithms that underpin today's AI systems for analyzing images, speech and other data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-hires-ex-google-ai-scientist-who-resigned-after-colleagues-firings-101620109399451.html

On this day, people express their gratitude for the firefighters by wearing a symbolic red and blue-ribbon badge to raise awareness about the dangers that firefighters face.Know about the history and significance of International Firefighters' Day:The International Firefighters' Day came into existence after a tragic incident in Australia's Linton. The incident occurred on December 2, 1998, during which five firemen were killed while trying to douse a wildfire.All the five firefighters -- Garry Vredeveldt, Chris Evans, Stuart Davidson, Jason Thomas and Matthew Armstrong -- were part of a strike team and were rushed in to attend an SOS call. All of them died battling the fire.After the incident, a proposal was sent out to all countries on January 4, 1999, to honour the firefighters and others who lose their lives while performing their duty.One of the main aspects to celebrate this day is fire prevention and the need to improve intensive and thorough training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-firefighters-day-know-history-and-significance-101620106695978.html

04-05-2021||World||US should push North Korea diplomacy, not pressure: China||China's US ambassador expressed hope Monday that President Joe Biden's policy toward North Korea will give more importance to diplomacy and dialogue instead of “extreme pressure” to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Zhang Jun said China also hopes the review of US policy will give equal emphasis to both the nuclear issue and the peace and security issue.“Without tackling the security and the peace issue properly, definitely we do not have the right environment for our efforts for the denuclearization,” he said.The White House said last Friday that Biden plans to veer from the approaches of his two most recent predecessors as he tries to stop North Korea's nuclear program, rejecting both Donald Trump's deeply personal effort to win over leader Kim Jong Un and Barack Obama's more hands-off approach.Press secretary Jen Psaki announced administration officials had completed the review of US policy toward North Korea but did not detail its findings.The Biden administration appeared to signal it is trying to set the stage for incremental progress, in which denuclearization steps by the North would be met with corresponding actions, including sanctions relief, from the United States.There was no mention of US security guarantees for North Korea or a formal end to the Korean War, both of which had been demanded by the North and considered by the Trump team as part of a larger package.China assumed the presidency of the UN Security Council this month and ambassador Zhang told a news conference that Beijing will look “very carefully” at the US policy review in hopes it will give more emphasis to dialogue.China and Russia circulated a draft resolution a year ago on lifting some sanctions against North Korea, and Zhang said it's still on the table.He stressed that while China is implementing sanctions against the North, it also believes the Security Council should consider adjusting and lifting sanctions “which are really hindering the humanitarian access ... and making people suffer.”“At a certain stage, timely adjustment (of sanctions) will really produce good results with the creation of more favorable environment for the tackling of this issue,” the ambassador said.North Korea said Sunday that Biden was mistaken in calling the country a security threat in a speech to Congress last week and warned of an unspecified response.As for the current situation, China's Zhang said: “We do hear harsh words and we do see some tensions at certain level, but in general it remains stable.”Referring to North Korea and the United States, he said both sides “should really think seriously about what they should do next ... and in particular avoiding taking any actions which may make the situation even worse.”“All efforts should go along the direction of resuming dialogue, making more efforts, walking towards each other instead of walking against each other,” Zhang said.“Otherwise, I do not see any possibility of finding a lasting, sustaining solution simply by exercising pressure,” whether “it's extreme pressure or light pressure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-push-north-korea-diplomacy-not-pressure-china-101620103711995.html
04-05-2021||World||US ban on travellers from India comes into effect||The travel ban imposed by US President Joe Biden for people coming from India, which is experiencing one of the worst waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, came into effect on Tuesday.Biden issued a proclamation on Friday restricting travel from India starting from May 4.Certain categories of students, academics, journalists and individuals have been exempted from the ban, according to the US State Department.US nationals, those having green cards, their non-citizen spouses and children below 21 years of age, are among the various categories exempted from the restrictions.The new travel restrictions have been imposed for an indefinite period and will require another presidential proclamation to end it."I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as non-immigrants, of non-citizens of the United States who were physically present within the Republic of India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States," says the proclamation signed by Biden on Friday.The decision was taken at the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, which determined India is experiencing widespread, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“The World Health Organization has reported that the Republic of India has had more than 18,375,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The magnitude and scope of the Covid-19 pandemic in India surging,” Biden said, adding that India accounts for over one-third of new global cases.The number of new cases in India is accelerating at a rapid rate, he said.Secretary of State Tony Blinken later gave an exemption to certain categories of visa holders, in particular students and non-citizen spouses and dependents of American nationals and those of legal permanent residency.According to the State Department, the travel ban exemption to certain categories is in line with a similar exemption that the US has granted to some categories of travellers from Brazil, China, Iran and or South Africa.Students seeking to commence studies in the fall, academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic Covid-19 restriction may qualify for the exception, it said.This includes qualified applicants who have been present in India, Brazil, China, Iran, or South Africa, it added.The pandemic continues to limit the number of visas our embassies and consulates abroad are able to process, it said.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.According to Indian health ministry data, single day rise of 3,68,147 Covid-19 infections and 3,417 fatalities pushed the country's tally of cases to 1,99,25,604 and death toll to 2,18,959 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ban-on-travellers-from-india-comes-into-effect-101620102824549.html
04-05-2021||World||Key lawmakers urge Biden to ship AstraZeneca vaccine to India, other countries||A group of powerful US Democratic lawmakers have expressed frustration over the delay in the implementation of the Biden administration’s decision to release the country’s supply of unusable AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines to India and other countries that need them and demanded their speedy delivery.“Time is of the essence. Without assistance from the United States, new vaccine-resistant mutations could arise across the globe, threatening international public health and the United States’ national security and economic prosperity,” four Democrats, who head powerful congressional committees, said in a joint letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.The signatories are Carolyn Maloney, chairperson of one of the most powerful of House committees, the oversight committee; James Clyburn, chair of the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis; Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American chair of the House subcommittee on economic and consumer policy; and Stephen Lynch, chair of the House subcommittee on national security.Clyburn, it should be noted, had rescued Biden’s faltering presidential run in the primaries by rallying African American Democrats to vote for Biden in South Carolina. Biden’s massive win in the state forced his rivals to pull out in his favour and cleared the decks for his nomination. Clyburn is Number 3 in the House Democratic caucus as the whip.Lawmakers have also pressed the Biden administration to reverse President Donald Trump’s opposition to India and South Africa’s proposal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to help developing counties get the same access to vaccines, therapeutics and technologies as the high-income countries.Also Read | India may see 1.02mn Covid deaths by August 1: US-based bodyIn a letter sent last Friday, which probably got overshadowed by everything else happening at the same time, the four legislators had seemed worried about inordinate delays in the shipping of these supplies by the administration’s plans to obtain the approval of the country’s foods and drug regulator.They had cited White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s as the chief reason for their worry. “Before any AstraZeneca doses are shipped from the United States, the FDA will confirm any such doses meet its expectations for product quality,” Psaki hd said on April 26. “This is being done in the context of the FDA’s ongoing review of all doses made at the plant where these AstraZeneca doses were produced.”AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, which is made and retitled in India as Covishield, is not approved for use in the United States and the company has not even applied for it. It has also faced questions about the use of old data in support of its efficacy claims. Even if AstraZeneca were to apply and get the approval for is vaccines, the United States won’t need them. It has enough — either physically in possession or secured through pre-orders — of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s two-shot vaccines and Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccines to inoculate all Americans.More than 52% of eligible Americans — 147.5 million, which is 44% of the population — have received at least one dose of a vaccine. India has inoculated 154.6, millions of is people which is an extremely small percentage of its population, and the availability of vaccines has been strained in recent days as people rush to get themselves inoculated, panicked by the ongoing surge of Covid-19 cases.The United States has contracted for $ 60 millions of AstraZeneca vaccines, but did not have any in its stockpile April end. It is expected to receive 10 million doses of them shortly.It doesn’t need any of them, India does.The four lawmakers called for a briefing from the Biden administration on the reasons for the delay stressing their “our oversight of this matter”.They said they want to know about the process by which the administration will select countries that will get these AstraZeneca vaccines, the time taken to ship consignments, legal and contractual barriers, and whether the United States will have enough vaccines left from other sources to meet its domestic needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-ship-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-india-other-countries-101620101835637.html
04-05-2021||World||Seven US businesses drop H-1B lawsuit against federal agency||A group of seven American businesses Monday announced to have dropped an H-1B lawsuit against the US Citizenship and Immigration Services after the federal agency agreed to accept and adjudicate previous decisions on foreign work visas.In March, the American Immigration Council, on behalf of the seven businesses, had filed a suit, challenging USCIS’ arbitrary rejection of H-1B petitions filed after October 1 solely because the H-1B workers’ intended employment start date fell after October 1.The lawsuit alleged that based on this timeline, USCIS created an absurd choice: foreign workers needed to start on October 1 (and not a day later) or the US employer had to misrepresent the intended employment start-date by “back-dating” the petition.“Arbitrary rejections restrict business immigration in the US. The resolution of this case showcases the importance of litigating to challenge unlawful agency actions and advance a fair process for employment-based immigration,” said Leslie Dellon, senior attorney (business immigration) at the American Immigration Council.Filed in the federal district court for the district of Massachusetts, the lawsuit had called for stopping USCIS’ arbitrary and capricious refusal to accept timely and properly filed H-1B petitions, which are subject to the annual statutory cap on H-1B visa numbers allocated each year, a media release said.“We dismissed the lawsuit because USCIS promptly corrected its error. All of our clients' applications have now been accepted by the USCIS. It is unfortunate that legal action was required. But we thank the USCIS for doing the right thing,” said Mintz members and co-counsel for the plaintiffs Douglas Hauer and Laurence A Schoen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-businesses-drop-h-1b-lawsuit-against-us-federal-agency-101620095272323.html
04-05-2021||World||It’s not just India. New virus waves hit developing nations||It’s not just India. Fierce new Covid-19 waves are enveloping other developing countries across the world, placing severe strain on their health-care systems and prompting appeals for help.Nations ranging from Laos to Thailand in Southeast Asia, and those bordering India such as Bhutan and Nepal, have been reporting significant surges in infections in the past few weeks. The increase is mainly because of more contagious virus variants, though complacency and lack of resources to contain the spread have also been cited as reasons.In Laos last week, the health minister sought medical equipment, supplies and treatment, as cases jumped more than 200-fold in a month. Nepal is seeing hospitals quickly filling up and running out of oxygen supplies. Health facilities are under pressure in Thailand, where 98% of new cases are from a more infectious strain of the pathogen, while some island nations in the Pacific Ocean are facing their first Covid waves.Although nowhere close to India’s population or flare-up in scope, the reported spikes in these handful of nations have been far steeper, signaling the potential dangers of an uncontrolled spread. The resurgence -- and first-time outbreaks in some places that largely avoided the scourge last year -- heightens the urgency of delivering vaccine supplies to poorer, less influential countries and averting a protracted pandemic.“It’s very important to realize that the situation in India can happen anywhere,” said Hans Kluge, the regional director at the World Health Organization for Europe, during a briefing last week. “This is still a huge challenge.”Ranked by the change in newly recorded infections in the past month over the previous month, Laos came first with a 22,000% increase, followed by Nepal and Thailand, both of which saw fresh caseload skyrocketing more than 1,000% on a month-over-month basis.Also on top of the list are Bhutan, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Cambodia and Fiji, as they witnessed the epidemic erupt at a high triple-digit pace.“All countries are at risk,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “The disease appears to be becoming endemic and will therefore likely remain a risk to all countries for the foreseeable future.”On May 1, India reported a record 401,993 new cases in the prior 24 hours, while deaths touched a new high of 3,689 the following day. The nation’s hospitals and crematoriums are working overtime to cope with the sick and the surging number of deaths. Compounding the crisis, health-care facilities are also facing a shortage of medical oxygen, unable to treat distressed patients with coronavirus-infected lungs gasping for air at their doorsteps.The abrupt outbreak in Laos -- a place that only recorded 60 cases since the start of the pandemic through April 20 and no death to date -- shows the challenges facing some of the landlocked nations. Porous borders make it harder to clamp down on illegal crossings though entry is technically banned.Communist-ruled Laos has ordered lockdowns in its capital Vientiane and banned travel between the capital and provinces. The health minister reached out to neighbors like Vietnam for assistance on life-saving resources. Nepal and Bhutan have seen cases erupt, in part due to returning nationals. Nepal, which has identified cases of the new Indian variant, has limited resources to combat the virus.‘Very Serious’The situation is “very serious,” according to Ali Mokdad, Chief Strategy Officer for Population Health at the University of Washington. “New variants will require a new vaccine and a booster for those already vaccinated -- they will delay the control of the pandemic.”Mokdad said the economic hardship of poorer countries make the battle even tougher.Thailand, which had been seeking to revive its ailing tourism industry, just reintroduced a two-week mandatory quarantine for all visitors. A government forecast for 2021 tourism revenue was cut to 170 billion baht ($5.4 billion), from January’s expectations for 260 billion baht. With the country’s public health system under pressure, authorities are trying to set up field hospitals to accommodate a flood of patients.About 98% of cases in Thailand are of the variant first identified in the U.K. based on a sample of 500 people, according to Yong Poovorawan, chief of the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology at Chulalongkorn University.Red ZoneIn Cambodia, since the beginning of the current outbreak, more than 10,000 locally acquired cases have been detected in more than 20 provinces. The Cambodian capital Phnom Penh is now a “red zone,” or a high-risk outbreak area. In Sri Lanka, the island-nation at the southern tip of India, authorities have isolated areas, banned weddings and meetings and closed cinemas and pubs to cap a record spike following last month’s local New Year festivities. The government says the situation is under control.Across the oceans in the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago announced a partial lockdown after the country’s daily cases hit a record high, closing restaurants, malls and cinemas until late May. The case count in the latest month is about 700% more than the previous month.That high level of increase is also seen in Suriname, on the northeastern coast of South America. Cases in April rose over 600% from that in March.After staying relatively Covid-free thanks to strict border controls, some of the Pacific island-nations are now seeing their first wave. Cities in the tourist hot spot of Fiji have gone into lockdown after the wider community contracted the virus from the military.“The recent rise in recorded cases throughout the Pacific reveals how critical it is to not just rely on strong borders but to actually get vaccines into these countries,” said Jonathan Pryke, who heads research on the Pacific region for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank. “India is a shocking warning to this part of the world about how quickly this pandemic can spiral out of control.”There’s a duty for developed countries, recovering from the pandemic thanks to rapid inoculations, to contribute to a more equitable global distribution of vaccines, diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents including oxygen, according to Heymann, the professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.The world hasn’t seen a concerted global response yet, and that is a concern, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.Getting back to pre-2020 normalcy “really depends on helping countries gain control of this virus as much as possible,” she said. “I really hope countries can look within themselves and figure out what they can do to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-not-just-india-new-virus-waves-hit-developing-nations-101620092537375.html

He was extradited to the United States, where he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He was executed in 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-man-shot-by-officers-outside-cia-headquarters-fbi-101620089784218.html
04-05-2021||World||US' FDA expected to give nod to Pfizer vaccine for teens within week||The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorise Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for young adults age 12 and older by next week, according to a federal official and a person familiar with the process, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year.The announcement is set to come barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorised for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group.The federal official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview the FDA's action, said the agency was expected to expand its emergency use authorisation for Pfizer's two-dose vaccine by early next week, and perhaps even sooner.The person familiar with the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, confirmed the timeline and added that it is expected that the FDA will approve Pfizer's use by even younger children sometime this fall.The FDA action will be followed by a meeting of a federal vaccine advisory committee to discuss whether to recommend the shot for 12 to 15-year-olds.Shots could begin after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopts the committee's recommendation. Those steps could be completed in a matter of days.The New York Times first reported on the expected timing for the authorisation.Pfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15, showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.Pfizer isn't the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a US study of Moderna's vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds.But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to begin U.S. studies in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6 months old.More than 131 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine have already been administered in the US, where demand for vaccines among adults has dramatically slowed in recent weeks.While younger people are at dramatically lower risk of serious side effects from Covid-19, they have made up a larger share of new virus cases as a majority of US adults have been at least partially vaccinated and as higher-risk activities like indoor dining and contact sports have resumed in most of the country.Officials hope that extending vaccinations to teens will further accelerate the nation's reduced virus caseload and allow schools to reopen with minimal disruptions this fall.The US has ordered at least 300 million doses of the Pfizer shot by the end of July, enough to protect 150 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-expected-to-give-nod-to-pfizer-vaccine-for-teens-within-week-101620085679952.html

She won Gates’ heart after meeting at a work dinner, sharing a mutual love of puzzles and beating him at a math game.The couple's sprawling Seattle-based foundation is easily the most influential private foundation in the world, with an endowment worth nearly $50 billion. It has focused on global health and development and US education issues since incorporating in 2000.The couple were married in 1994 in Hawaii. They met after she began working at Microsoft as a product manager in 1987.Last year, Bill Gates, formerly the world's richest person, said he was stepping down from Microsoft's board to focus on philanthropy.Gates was Microsoft’s CEO until 2000 and since then has gradually scaled back his involvement in the company he started with Paul Allen in 1975. He transitioned out of a day-to-day role in Microsoft in 2008 and served as chairman of the board until 2014.The Gateses will be the second high-profile Seattle-area billionaire couple to end their marriage in recent years.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos finalized their divorce in 2019. MacKenzie Scott has since remarried and now focuses on her own philanthropy. She received a 4% stake in Amazon, worth more than $36 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-and-melinda-gates-to-divorce-after-27-years-of-marriage-101620080468993.html
