A large number of people will benefit with the launch of such a scheme, he said. The hospitals should be also given exemption at par with MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) units for the installation of oxygen plants. The state government should fix the prices of life-saving medical instruments to prevent traders from jacking up the rates of equipment like multi para monitor, ventilators and other gadgets, he said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had visited Moradabad and Bareilly districts on Saturday to review the facilities provided to the Covid patients. He had also held meetings with the peoples’ representatives and officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bareilly-health-officials-don-t-take-people-s-calls-union-minister-writes-to-yogi-adityanath-101620573913739.html
