The gurdwara management added that their charity had received massive support from both Hindu and Muslim communities, making it a truly humanitarian effort transcending the boundaries of religion. The Alambagh Gurdwara said it received several oxygen cylinders as ‘zakat’ from Muslims during Eid, while Hindus too have donated oxygen cylinders apart from ration kits and hearse vans. Zakat is a form of obligatory charity, which Muslims believe cleanses and blesses their wealth.“The pandemic has brought all the communities closer. Muslims have donated oxygen cylinders to us during Eid. While the Loha Vyapar Mandal has donated several cylinders, the Lucknow Jewellers’ Association has donated ration kits. Sandeep Singh Anant has donated a hearse bus to the gurdwara,” said Nirmal Singh, president of Alambagh Gurdwara. He said the gurdwara in turn had donated more than 800 oxygen cylinders and 4,000 ration kits so far. “With help pouring in from all communities, the ‘oxygen langar’ will start in Unnao Gurudwara on Tuesday and [it] will also begin soon in Ayodhya and Sitapur this week,” Nirmal Singh added. Langar, a word associated with community kitchens serving free food in gurudwaras, is also being used to indicate free distribution of life-saving oxygen cylinders to Covid patients. To avail the benefits, residents will have to give an application to the gurdwara with the doctor’s prescription, Covid and pathology reports, Aadhaar cards of both the patient and the attendant on WhatsApp numbers 9554822225 and 9670888333. Along with medical oxygen, the Alambagh Gurudwara management has also arranged for home delivery of food for Covid-19 infected patients. “We have prepared kits of 10 kg wheat flour, 4 kg rice, 2 kg pulses, 2 kg ghee, 1 kg oil, spices of 4 kinds and a salt packet weighing 1 kg. We deliver kits to the needy, but they have to provide details like aadhaar card, ration card, so that we can keep a record of the beneficiaries.” “We will continue to provide oxygen to Covid patients till things normalize,” he added.Uttar Pradesh on Monday reported 285 coronavirus deaths as 9,391 fresh cases surfaced, taking the state’s infection tally to 16,28,990, a government bulletin said. So far, 17,817 people have died from the infection in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-gurdwara-s-oxygen-langar-gets-generous-donations-from-hindus-muslims-101621325893193.html
18-05-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow mosque steps in to help amid Covid-19 crisis||When Covid-19 cases surged and overwhelmed hospitals in April, the management committee of Lucknow’s Jama Masjid, Lalbagh, stepped in and offered its services. The committee began its work with just five oxygen cylinders and seven concentrators. But with generous community support, it has significantly expanded its services since, said the panel’s president, Zunoon Nomani.Akeel Siqqiui, who prays at the mosque, said they created a Facebook page and a helpline, and the assistance followed immediately. “Many people, including our Hindu brethren, approached us and offered money which we refused. Instead, we asked them to help us with the things that are needed the most—sanitisers, gloves, masks, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, and so on,” he said.

We requested a person from the Hindu community in the Gomti Nagar area, who expressed his willingness to help and took the cylinder to his house 10km away,” said Siddiqui.The committee has formed a four-member team, which stays at the mosque round the clock to help people with their 55 oxygen cylinders and 24 concentrators. Those in need of help just need to bring their Aadhaar card and avail themselves the services free of cost, said Siddiqui.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-mosque-steps-in-to-help-amid-covid-19-crisis-101621311792759.html
18-05-2021||Lucknow||Medical system in smaller cities, villages of UP is 'Ram bharose': Allahabad HC||The Allahabad high court on Monday observed that the medical system of the state pertaining to smaller cities and villages was like the Hindi saying “Ram bharose” (at God’s mercy).The court made the observation while taking serious note of a patient having gone missing from the Meerut district hospital and later his body having been handled as an unidentified one.“If this is the state of affairs of treatment at medical college in the city like Meerut then the entire medical system of the State pertaining to the smaller cities and villages can only be taken to be like a famous Hindi saying ‘Ram Bharose,” the court said.The court also said it was a case of “high degree carelessness”.“A patient is admitted to the hospital in an absolute care of doctors and paramedical staff and if the doctors and paramedical staff adopt such casual approach and show carelessness in the performance of their duty, then it is a case of serious misconduct because it is something like playing with the lives of innocent people,” the court observed.The bench comprising justice Siddhartha Varma and justice Ajit Kumar was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on “conditions of quarantine centres and for providing better treatment to corona positives” in Uttar Pradesh.The court directed the additional chief secretary (medical and health), Uttar Pradesh, to file an affidavit fixing responsibility in the matter.At the previous hearing, the court had directed the state government counsel to apprise it how it was managing Covid hospitals, requirement of oxygen, beds and life-saving drugs and equipment in districts of Bahraich, Barabanki, Bijnor, Jaunpur and Shravasti.The bench took the example of Bijnor district as a test case to assess the overall health care system in smaller cities and rural areas of the state. After going through Covid testing data related to Bijnor, the bench expressed its dissatisfaction over the number of tests conducted in Bijnor between March 31, 2021 and May 12 , 2021.The bench said that in a population of 32 lakh, if testing is done of only 1200 persons per day, then the situation is not happy.The manner in which the pandemic had hit the rural areas of the state, the district administration was required to have a robust way of conducting tests, the court said.The bench directed the state government to immediately improve and increase the testing methods of the rural population and the population of small cities and towns and also provide sufficient health care infrastructure in such cities of the state.The bench then said that we are under “serious threat of its third wave, hence, we need to vaccinate each and every individual in the country and we need to have an excellent medical infrastructure”.After going through the details of the health infrastructure of five districts, the bench observed, “We have no hesitation in observing that health infrastructure is absolutely insufficient in city areas to meet the requirement of city population and in the rural areas the community health centres are virtually lacking in respect of life saving gadgets. In most of the districts, the Level-3 hospital facilities are not there.”“…there has been no further increase in supply of life saving gadgets to district Bijnor since last one year and thus the situation has not improved at all in terms of health care in district Bijnor. These facts therefore, are quite opposed to the Government’s claim,” the bench added.The bench then observed, “If we have to test 30% of the population i.e. almost 10 lacs in the rural areas of district Bijnor within three month’s time, then we will have to conduct 10,000 tests per day, but from the statement made by the district magistrate we do not see any such robust testing in near future in district Bijnor and condition in other four districts are also same. If this is the state of affairs of five districts, one can guess where we are leading people of this State to i.e. third wave of the pandemic.”The bench then suggested that government may allow people who might like to buy the vaccines for the have-nots. Likewise, business houses which donate to various religious organizations may be asked to divert their funds to vaccines.The bench also suggested government may take steps like waiver of intellectual property protection so that other manufacturers may produce vaccine.“One cannot understand as to why the Government of ours, which is a welfare state is not trying to manufacture the vaccine itself on a large scale,” the bench observed.HC for PGI-like facilities at 5 medical colleges in four monthsThe Allahabad high court on Monday said medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur should have enhanced facilities like the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) and emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them.The court directed the state government to come up with a definite report by the next date of hearing as to how this upgradation of medical colleges shall be done in four months’ time. The court suggested that facilities at all hospitals and nursing homes in the state must be improved.The court has fixed May 22 as the next date of hearing.The bench comprising justice Siddhartha Varma and justice Ajit Kumar was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on “conditions of quarantine centres and for providing better treatment to corona positives” in Uttar Pradesh.“In these few months we have realized that in the manner it (medical infrastructure) stands today, it is very delicate, fragile and debilitated. When it cannot meet the medical requirements of our people in normal times then it definitely had to collapse in the face of the present pandemic,” the bench observed.“In the State of Uttar Pradesh, we find that apart from various institutes like Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute and the Universities like the King George’s Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, we have five more medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. These colleges should have enhanced facilities as are there with the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute within a period of four months. Emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them. Funds should be provided to them forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an institute of the standard of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute. For this there should also be given a certain extent of autonomy,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/medical-system-in-smaller-cities-villages-of-state-is-ram-bharose-says-allahabad-high-court-101621277831450.html
