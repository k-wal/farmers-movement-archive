The first meeting should be held today itself,” Yogi Adityanath said at a Covid-19 review meeting on Thursday.Yogi Adityanath’s directive is a response to demands from teachers’ associations who have claimed that 1,621 government school staffers died due to Covid-19 between the first week of April and May 16 (two weeks after the counting of votes).The state government’s basic education department appeared to have rejected this demand on Tuesday when it insisted that according to official records, only three government teachers succumbed to Covid-19 when they could be treated on election duty under the existing rules.On Wednesday, the department announced that the government would give ₹30 lakh each to the next of kin of the three schoolteachers and a government job to an eligible candidate in each family. The four-phase panchayat elections were held on April 15, 19, 26 and 29. The counting of votes was taken up on May 2.The decision was sharply criticised by teachers and opposition parties who sought a liberal interpretation of the rules since there was a gap between the time when a person contracted the infection, fell ill and died. Studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.At Thursday’s review meeting, Yogi Adityanath said the state government had been acting as per the SEC guidelines so far for compensating any staff who dies on election duty, be it teachers, shiksha mitras, anudeshaks, rozgar sewaks, police personnel, or any government employee on election duty.“But because the guidelines are old — when Covid did not exist — so there is a need to have a relook with sympathy,” he said.A senior state government official said that any policy change would be with retrospective effect, factoring in the panchayat polls held in April.Hindustan Times has been reporting extensively on the issue, including the need to relook and change the guidelines. In the HT reports, several experts, including former chief election commissioner of India SY Quraishi, said the state government and the state election commission (SEC) should go for a “liberal interpretation” in case of casualty of government staff deployed on election duty, especially when the country is facing the pandemic.Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of the Pradeshiya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh (a teachers’ association), welcomed Yogi Adityanath’s decision. “The step by the chief minister is worth welcoming and we stress that the compensation should be ₹1 crore and any policy change must be with retrospective effect,” he said. He added that the Allahabad high court had made an observation for the government to consider giving compensation of ₹1 crore.Giving a break-up of the association’s claim on the number of deaths, Sharma said: “Out of 1,621 government school staff, 1332 were teachers, 209 shiksha mitras (para teachers), 25 anudeshaks (instructors), five block education officers, 15 clerks and 35 other employees.”A former official with the state election commission, who asked not to be named, said, “One should consider the death of government staff on a case-by-case basis and there cannot be a generalised rule that can be applied to all cases.”Yogi Adityanath told the Covid review meeting that the state government is committed to providing all necessary benefits, especially, in times of election duties or any other such duties. So, get into a dialogue with the SEC and make necessary recommendations.”For his part, Sharma said: “The government should also talk to us for suggestions before formulating new guidelines. We suggest that the criteria should include getting Covid infection within 10-12 days of the duty, death within at least a month of infection. It should also include post-Covid death by factors such as ‘black fungus’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-reaches-out-to-up-teachers-seeks-change-in-compensation-rule-101621529504887.html
20-05-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh MSMEs finding it difficult to operate amid Corona curfew||A body representing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) says restrictions on transport and shortage of manpower has made continuation of operations difficult during the Covid-19 lockdown in Uttar Pradesh. They said they may be forced to consider shutting down shops till the situation normalises.Indian Industries Association (IIA) has pointed out that though the state government has exempted industrial activity from the ongoing corona curfew, production and maintenance work has been affected in almost all units“As transport services are off the roads, industries are finding it difficult to procure raw material and send finished products to stockists,” says Manmohan Agarwal, senior vice president, IIA.Agarwal adds that the state has not accepted some of their demands making resolution of the problem difficult.“We have requested the state government to exempt transport companies from the purview of corona curfew. Unless offices of transport companies are allowed to open, there will be no movement of trucks on roads. In such a scenario, industries cannot be run,” Agarwal said.He adds that if the situation continues like this, MSMES will have to shut down for the time being.Another association member pointed out that MSME units in Noida and Meerut were working at minimum capacity due the disrupted supply chain and low work force.“...Workers have left for their homes, fearing the pandemic,” said Rajiv Bansal, national secretary, IIA.According to the association, Uttar Pradesh has around 30 lakh MSMEs comprising 90% micro units and 8% small units. The body says that while 180 out of the 240 units at Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) are currently operational, the manpower has shrunk significantly due migrants returning to their hometowns.Bansal says only around 5,000 workers are currently available in Noida against 50,000 capacity and since all shops are closed except for those related with essential items, it is also hard to get maintenance work done at industrial units.“We have also requested the government to allow all essential shops related with industries to open at least for two days in a week so that maintenance work may be carried out, if required,” said Bansal.Uttar Pradesh government has imposed curfew like restrictions till 7 am on May 24 to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-msmes-finding-it-difficult-to-operate-amid-corona-curfew-101621488427664.html
20-05-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow to use machines to clean sewer hotspots to protect staff amid Covid-19||The Lucknow municipal corporation (LMC) and the Jal Sansthan will use jetting machines to clean at least 50 sewer overflow hotspots in the city identified through geographic information system (GIS) mapping as it moves from manual scavenging to mechanical cleaning to protect sanitation workers from health hazards amid Covid-19 pandemic, said officials.Areas near Civil Hospital in Hazratganj, Lalkuan, road near Raj Bhawan, Hewett road, Chitta Khera, Billauchpura, Alambagh bus station, Chander Nagar, Balaganj and Thakurganj, are among areas identified for cleaning through machines. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said Sewage India has been entrusted with the work.“Lucknow is also moving from non-mechanical systems to more mechanical and automated systems. The latest equipment has been introduced for cleaning of drains and sewage to save sanitation workers from health hazards. During the pandemic, it is the duty of the civic body to take care of its workforce. Currently, over 525 workers are into cleaning of sewers. They will be trained to operate advanced cleaning machines,” Bhatia said.She added this use of machines has become important due to the need to complete a high volume of work in a short period. “More than 800 nullahs and 1,500 small drains have to be cleaned before May 31. Similarly, all the sewer lines have to be cleaned before this date.”Amit Kumar, additional municipal commissioner said the use of machines will likely cut down the risks associated with manual scavenging.Lucknow recorded 493 fresh Covid-19 cases and 29 deaths on Wednesday, even as the state-wide Covid tally rose by 7,336 fresh cases to reach 1,644,851.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-to-use-machines-to-clean-sewer-hotspots-to-protect-staff-amid-covid19-101621487861936.html
