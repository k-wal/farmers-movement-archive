However, they were visited by a jail warder on Sheru’ request a few days ago. The warder arranged his parents’ video consultation with the doctors in Naini jail and also handed them over a free medicine packet. Later, Sheru was made to talk to his parents over the phone from the jail.Similarly, Chandan, who is lodged in Sonbhadra district jail for the past 20 months, was worried for his old mother, who stays alone in her village. His mother suffers from lung problems and can’t visit the doctor due to her old age. The authorities of Sonbhadra district jail send a warder to her house, who gave her a packet of medicine free of cost after arranging a telephonic medical consultation with a doctor for her.UP prisons headquarters spokesman Santosh Kumar Verma said four prisons in the state are now providing medical assistance at doorsteps to prisoners’ parents and family members, who are seriously ill or suffering from Covid-19 infection. “We have provided medicines for Covid-19 positive people on the same lines,” he added.He said this service was first started at Prayagraj’s Naini Central Jail apart from the district jails at Sonbhadra, Firozabad and Mathura. The facility for prisoners to call their family members over phone started last year at all jails after in person meetings were stopped to curb Covid-19 infections among prisoners.Verma said over 40 such in-house calls have been made so far since last week of April. He said the jail authorities are planning to extend the medical assistance service for prisoners’ families at all 71 jails across the state by setting up a dedicated and trained team of jail personnel for the purpose.Meanwhile, the jail authorities are also focused on maintaining hygiene and cleanliness to curb any infection in the state jails where over 1.10 lakh prisoners remain lodged at a time. At present, 45 temporary jails are operational to quarantine new prisoners for two weeks before they are shifted to permanent jails.Verma said at least 16,611 inmates have been infected with Covid-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic in April 2020. 14,882 of these have recovered leaving 1,722 active cases in UP jails, including 353 in 71 permanent jails and 1,230 in 45 temporary jails . As many as 111,882 prisoners are lodged in UP jails, including 108,892 prisoners in 71 permanent jails and 2,990 inmates in 45 temporary jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/free-medicines-consultation-to-up-prisoners-kin-at-their-doorstep-101620027900736.html

03-05-2021||Lucknow||Covid-19: UP real estate sector seeks relief from state, Centre||The real estate sector in Uttar Pradesh is demanding a relief package on the lines of the one given to the micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector by the Central and state governments. They are demanding moratorium on loans, extension of key approvals by a year and on site vaccination drive for workers to cope up with the fresh slump driven by the second wave of Covid-19.The real estate sector has been hit hard with sales and construction activity coming to a halt since the pandemic-induced lockdown in March last year.Just when it started showing some signs of recovery from November last, the second Covid wave has derailed it again, claim industry representatives.Citing various relief measures announced for MSMEs such as moratorium on loans and subsidies, the UP unit of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), an apex body of private real estate developers, has requested for a couple of major reliefs for the real estate sector from the state government.“We have requested the state government to extend the deadline of all statutory approvals by a year. This extension must be enforced after the pandemic subsides,” said Shobhit Mohan Das, president, CREDAI, UP.The developers’ body cites Covid-related challenges hampering progress of projects to seek extension of approvals given by development authorities, housing board and UP-RERA by a year. While UP-RERA has made registration of all projects compulsory, it has also specified a timeframe for completion of the project so that homebuyers get possession of flats within due time.The sector’s other demand to allow vaccination of labourers working at project sites using the fund collected as labour cess from developers.The building and other construction workers’ welfare board of the state government collects labour cess. This fund is utilised for various welfare schemes launched for labourers by the state government.“Vaccination at project sites will to some extent ensure holding back of labourers and continuity in the projects,” said Ramandeep Singh, president-elect, CREDAI, Uttar Pradesh. The CREDAI is also planning to meet union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman with its demand for moratorium on loans taken by developers for their projects. The labourers employed in the sector are primarily migrant workforce, which has begun to leave for their hometowns amid the resurgence of Covid infections. Their departure during the lockdown last year had stalled several projects, which picked up pace only towards the end of the year.“Soon, we will meet the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking moratorium on loans availed by developers and also homebuyers on the lines of MSMEs. This will, to some extent, ease financial constraints of both developers and home buyers,” said Ramandeep Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-up-real-estate-sector-seeks-relief-from-state-centre-101620009839938.html
