For this, it is necessary to amend this rule so that the family of a person who died of Covid-19 can be extended an assistance of ₹4 lakh to mitigate their problems," Nath said.This will help a large number of families whose head or earning members have died due to Covid-19, he added.On Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh reported 12,319 new Covid-19 cases and 71 fatalities, raising the infection count to 6,24,985 and the death toll to 6,074, as per official figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/former-mp-cm-nath-seeks-rs-4-lakh-assistance-for-covid-19-victims-kin-101620299506889.html
