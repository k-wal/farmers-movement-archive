We will start vaccination (for the 18-44 age group) from May 5. The vaccines will be administered free of cost to all the citizens," he added.The vaccination drive for the 18-44 category, which was scheduled to take off on May 1, was deferred due to the unavailability of vaccines in Madhya Pradesh.Vaccination of eligible beneficiaries from other categories is already going on in the state.Madhya Pradesh's Covid-19 tally stood at 6,00,430 on Monday while the death toll reached 5,905, as per the state health department.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath doubted the feasibility of the vaccination programme announced by Chouhan."The vaccination programme, which should ideally be held round-the-clock at a very fast pace, will now be held in sessions on different dates in the state and that too in limited numbers. It will take months to vaccinate the citizens of the state," Nath said.He alleged Covid-19 patients and their families are still struggling to get a bed in a hospital, medical oxygen and life-saving drugs."....Who is responsible for this situation?" he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/covid-in-mp-vaccination-for-18-44-age-group-to-begin-on-may-5-says-cm-chouhan-101620058579965.html

It was due to massive internal sabotage. We lost heavily from the urban areas. People who said the BJP was like their mother have committed dishonesty."Queried about who he was referring to, Lodhi said, "It is senior BJP leader and former MP minister Jayant Malaiya (74) and his family. They are solely responsible for my defeat. We lost in their ward. We lost heavily in city areas where Malaiya's son Siddharth was supposed to drum up support for us."He said the "Malaiya family gameplan" had succeeded while the BJP had lost, and demanded that they be expelled from the party.During the day, Union Minister and senior MP BJP leader Prahlad Patel too had blamed "conspiracies" on the part of insiders for the party's defeat in the Damoh bypoll.The Damoh bypoll result gives clear indications of future challenges, conspiracies and improvements in the system and workers will find solutions through diligence and without being malicious, Patel, the local Lok Sabha MP, had said in a tweet.While former state minister Jayant Malaiya, who was BJP MLA for several terms from the area earlier, stayed away from the bypoll campaign, sources said there were several local leaders in the party who were upset with Lodhi joining it.Lodhi, incidentally, had defeated Malaiya in the 2018 Assembly polls, though the former at the time was in the Congress.MP Home minister Narottam Mishra on Monday said "we lost Damoh due to out own Jaichands".It is a common reference for an insider who betrays, the term coming from the role played by Jaichand who back- stabbed Prithviraj Chauhan in the latter's fight against invader Muhammad Ghori in the 12th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/damoh-bypolls-madhya-pradesh-bjp-candidate-blames-internal-sabotage-for-defeat-101620045537035.html
