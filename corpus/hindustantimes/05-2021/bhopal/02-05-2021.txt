He told me my video has hurt religious feelings and I have no right to mock religion. I felt he was right so I apologised and withdrew the video," Kaushal said."I had no intention of hurting anybody's religious feelings. The video had a message against infanticide in the end," the comedian added.A Hind Rakshak spokesperson said Kaushal withdrew the video about Navratri after the organisation issued him a "first and last warning".It was on Eklavya Singh's complaint that Faruqui and some others were arrested in January for a stand-up act at a cafe in Indore.Faruqui was released a month later after the Supreme Court gave him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-comedian-withdraws-video-after-objection-from-outfit-of-bjp-mla-s-son-101619942470901.html
