But so far, only Moderna has replied to the request, Garg said. The company’s vaccine has so far inoculated over 90 million people. Moderna could not be reached for comments.Earlier, the Punjab government approached Covax, the global vaccine sharing programme, but was told that it would not directly deal with the state, Garg said.The Punjab government has said that it has so far received 4.4 million vaccine doses from the Centre, and the first dose has been administered to 3.66 million people while 730,000 have received the second shot. But due to the non-availability of jabs, the state has had to stop phases 1 (above 60 years) and 2 (above 45 years) of its vaccination programme in the last three days.“We are seeking more vaccines from the Centre. They will also advise how to deal with such manufacturers who directly deal with the Centre,” said Garg.Punjab had a tepid response to the programme as not many people turned up for vaccination in the early days. But the brutality of the second wave triggered panic, leading to rush at vaccination centres, especially in rural areas. Punjab registered nearly 5,300 fresh Covid cases and 201 deaths on Saturday, taking the death toll in the state to over 13,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moderna-refuses-to-sell-vaccines-directly-to-punjab-101621801199674.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s cotton crop area claim last season holds no water||As cotton sowing is in full swing in Punjab, questions have been raised on the state agriculture department’s previous claim that in 2020 more than one-lakh hectare area was diversified into cotton from water-guzzling paddy.Sources admit that the official claim that last year’s area under cotton was enhanced from 3.9 lakh hectares in 2019 to 5.01 lakh hectares across the semi-arid region of southern Punjab does not hold water.Officials said it is surprising that no clarification has been issued by the agriculture department, the portfolio held by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on an overstretched claim of record cultivation of cotton last year.“It appeared to be a case of an exaggeration to claim drastic success in crop diversification. Cotton production data belies any such claim,” says an official privy to the cotton production. Agriculture director Dr Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said last season, only 2.51 lakh hectare was covered under cotton.“I cannot comment about the statements made before my joining the office in February this year. But as per official record, for this year, we have set the target to bring 3.25 lakh hectares under crop, an increase of 20% area than 2020. As per the weekly report till May 17, sowing was completed on a 1.80-lakh hectare area. It will be over in another one week,” he said.In the 2020-21 season, an estimated 45-50 lakh quintal cotton was purchased by Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and private players.Agriculture experts say one hectare produces an average of 20 quintals of raw cotton and Punjab should have produced close to one-crore quintals if the cash crop was actually sown on 5 lakh hectares.“Last season was good, and the cotton-growing area did not witness any major pest attack. An average farmer produced between 8-12 quintals from one acre is on par with the past trend of a good yield. No protest by farmer unions, who are most active in Malwa districts, is an indicator that overall yield was good,” say sources in agriculture and cotton industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-cotton-crop-area-claim-last-season-holds-no-water-101621801024850.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||‘Ardas’ row: BJP leaders’ support to ‘pathi’ enrages Sikh bodies||Various Sikh bodies are enraged over some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders’ support to the ‘pathi’ arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments by doing ardas at Bathinda’s Bir Talab village gurdwara for controversial Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim, saying that “this is deep-rooted conspiracy to vitiate atmosphere in the state”. The ‘pathi’ was booked under section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.Members of some Sikh bodies discussed the issue at a gurdwara in Sangrur on Saturday. Prominent BJP leaders who opposed the action against the ‘pathi’ were Vijay Sampla and Rajesh Bagha. Being chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Sampla also sought a report from the Bathinda police. During his visit to Amritsar on Friday, Sampla had said he found no ground for charging the ‘pathi’ with Section 295-A, adding that police acted against him because he was Dalit and prayed for ‘Dalit chief minister in Punjab’.Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “This ardas was against Sikh maryada as it was performed for a person who is guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and against whom hukamnama was issued by Takht Sahib for committing blasphemy. Anyone supporting this kind of ardas is wrong”.“Days after Punjab Police arrested six Dera followers in the sacrilege case, this so-called ardas was organised in which release of the dera chief was also desired. Entire Sikh Panth is enraged over this act, but BJP leaders support it. Why? A Dalit was chosen for this act so that Sikhs are divided over caste lines ahead of the 2022 elections,” Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member Sukhdev Singh Bhaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ardas-row-bjp-leaders-support-to-pathi-enrages-sikh-bodies-101621800604927.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Agricultural laws: Farmers’ convoy leaves Karnal to join Tikri border protest||Defying the coronavirus lockdown, thousands of farmers gathered at the Karnal and Panipat toll plazas on Sunday morning and left for Tikri on the state’s border with New Delhi, the site where farmers have been protesting against the Centre’s three agricultural laws since last November. On the call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers’ unions, farmers will hold protests in New Delhi on May 26, to mark six months of the agitation. Those supporting the agitation have been asked to hoist black flags on their houses and vehicles the day to register their protest.Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Charuni led the convey comprising SUVs, cars and bikes from Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza. “Around 2,000 vehicles will leave for the protest site from different districts every week in order to maintain the gathering there,” he said. Farmers from Karnal will lead the agitation from May 23 to May 30.“This movement of farmers will not only strengthen the agitation but will also send a message to those who predicted that the agitation is likely to fizzle out because of decline in the number of farmers on the Delhi borders,” said a farmer leader, pleading anonymity.With harvesting of wheat over and transplantation of paddy to start from June 15, farmers’ unions from Haryana have reached out to farmers and villagers asking them to ensure a sizeable gathering at the Delhi borders. Charuni also slammed the lathicharge on farmers. “ Farmers were beaten up and FIRs were registered against them but why were the cops not booked for assault and damaging our vehicles,” he said. . He also refuted reports of two farmers dying due to Covid at Singhu border.Despite restrictions on gatherings amid the pandemic, farmers, many of whom were not wearing masks, gathered at the toll plaza in the presence of police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/agricultural-laws-farmers-convoy-leaves-karnal-to-join-tikri-border-protest-101621800066105.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Despite Capt’s appeal, farmers to go ahead with 3-day protest||Despite chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s appeal, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugarahan) have decided to go ahead with their call of three-day protest from May 28.The farmers will protest against state government for its alleged failure in tackling the Covid crisis and imposing curbs across the state.Farmers claimed that the ill-preparedness of state and central governments has led to spread of Covid. “Both the governments have failed to check Covid spread. People are dying due to lack of ventilators, oxygen and other medical facilities,” said BKU’s general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan.He added that the traders are already feeling the brunt of undue restrictions imposed in the state. “To hide its failures, the government has come up with curfew-like decisions, which has battered the trader class,” he said.The farmers have prepared detailed demand charter in which they demanded government to fill vacant vacancies in the health department, to make adequate arrangements for oxygen and ventilators, to bring private hospitals under its control and to stop forcible vaccination and testing.Rejecting the allegations of the state government’s failure to tackle the Covid pandemic, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged the BKU not to go ahead with their proposed dharna, which he said could turn into a super-spreader of the contagion.The CM said his government had fought hard to prevent Punjab going the way some other states, such as Delhi, Maharashtra and even Uttar Pradesh, where bodies floating in the Ganga.“Any event, such as the proposed three-day dharna of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) in Patiala, had the potential to negate the gains made by his government in tackling Covid in the state,” he said.Amarinder urged the farmers’ group not to act irresponsibly and jeopardise the lives of their own people with such reckless behaviour amid the pandemic, especially when there is a complete ban in the state on all gatherings and any violation of the ban would be highly detrimental to the interests of Punjab and its people.“The group’s action was also completely unwarranted considering the total support the state government had extended all these months to the agitating farmers on the issue of the centre’s black farm laws. It is time for the farmers now to reciprocate by supporting the state government in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.He added that taking note of the gravity of the situation, there was no scope for any laxity in Covid appropriate behaviour, and rallies or dharnas of any kind were totally unacceptable when the lives of the people were at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-capt-s-appeal-farmers-to-go-ahead-with-3-day-protest-101621800004560.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Two Khalistan Tiger Force activists nabbed for dera follower’s murder||Punjab Police have arrested two activists of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), allegedly involved in the murder of a Dera Sacha Sauda follower and other heinous crimes, from near a railway crossing in Mehna village of Moga on Saturday night. The two were acting on the directions of KTF’s Canada-based chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whose name figured in the list of Khalistani operatives handed over by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the latter’s visit to India in 2018. Those arrested have been identified as Lovepreet Singh, alias Ravi, and Ram Singh, alias Sonu. Police said with the arrests, they have foiled KTF activists’ plan to kill another dera follower, who they were targeting to take revenge for the sacrilege cases.Three 0.32 bore pistols with 38 live cartridges, one 0.315 bore pistol with 10 live cartridges and two magazines, were seized from the suspects, said the police. Director general of Police Dinkar Gupta said that Nijjar, three other conspirators, identified as Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh, of Dalla village in Moga, Ramandeep, alias Raman Judge, of Ferozepur and Charanjit, alias Rinku Bihla, of Barnala are hiding in Surrey, Canada, while one Kamaljeet Sharma, alias Kamal, is still absconding. He said while Arshdeep and Ramandeep went to Canada legally in 2019 and 2017, Rinku Bihla migrated to Canada illegally between 2013 and 14. According to initial investigations, which were led by Moga senior superintendent of police Harmanbir Singh Gill, the DGP said Lovepreet and Kamaljeet were known to Arshdeep, as they all belonged to the same village. Ram Singh, a student at ITI Moga, was known to Kamal since college days. All were given money by Arshdeep, who sent it through Western Union money transfers. On November 20 last year, Sonu and Kamal killed Manohar Lal, a dera follower, at Bhagta Bhaika in Bathinda, said the DGP. Sonu and Kamal were also involved in firing at a priest, Kamaldeep Sharma, in Bhar Singh Pura village in Phillaur on January 31 this year. The priest, who was shot at thrice, was seriously injured along with a girl in the attack, allegedly carried out by the suspects on the directions of Nijjar, said the DGP.In September 2020, Nijjar was designated a terrorist by the Union ministry of home affairs and the NIA had also attached his properties in Bhar Singh Pura village. Kamal and Ravi, along with Arshdeep (who had come to India at that time), were involved in the murder of their associate, Sukha Lamme, on June 27, 2020. On July 14, 2020, Ravi and Kamal killed Tejinder, owner of cloth store, to terrorise the people of Moga city. In the latest incident on February 9, the duo attempted to kill owner a sweets shop in Moga. The DGP said investigations were in progress to trace their involvement in other crimes. A hunt has been launched to arrest Kamal. He said a Red Corner Notice was issued against Nijjer, who has also been put on the “No Fly List” by the Canadian authorities. He added that the state government would also seek their deportation to India to face trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-khalistan-tiger-force-activists-nabbed-for-drea-follower-s-murder-101621799886373.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana extends lockdown till May 31, shops to open on odd-even basis||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Sunday extended the lockdown till May 31 with some relaxations to allow resumption of routine business activities in local markets.While stand-alone shops have been allowed to open when the night curfew is not in operation, other shops will be allowed to operate from 7am to noon as per the odd and even formula.As per orders of chief secretary Vijai Vardhan, shops with odd numbers will open on odd dates and shops with even numbers on even dates. The government has not allowed malls to open and authorised deputy commissioners to work out the modalities of implementing the relaxations.This is the third extension of the week-long lockdown which was first imposed in Haryana from May 3 in the face of rising infections in the state. It was then extended on May 10, with stricter restrictions such as not allowing more than 11 people in weddings and funerals.In a single page order, Vardhan said the decision to yet again extend the lockdown had been taken “after duly considering the fact that although the Covid positivity rate has come down,” the lockdown, termed mahamari alert-surakshit Haryana, needs to continue with the objective of further bringing down the positivity and the fatality rate.That the lockdown has helped contain the Covid spread becomes apparent as in past 13 days the number of new cases (from 13,548 on May 9) has been declining every day and stood at 5,021 on May 22.Till Saturday, Haryana had vaccinated 52.56 lakh people. The state government said as on Sunday, 1,554 oxygen beds in ICUs, including ventilators, were available in government and private hospitals across the state, while 8,185 oxygen beds were available in both government and private hospitals.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-extends-lockdown-till-may-31-shops-to-open-on-odd-even-basis-101621799644608.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Three more detected with black fungus in Himachal||Even as Covid infections are on a decline for past one month, the rise in black fungus cases has left the health authorities in Himachal Pradesh worried.Three more patients have been diagnosed with mucormycosis in the state.A 41-year-old woman from Solan’s Arki, who lives in Shimla, has been admitted to the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) after complaining of loss of eyesight, said senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj.Initial test reports have confirmed presence of black fungus and culture and biopsy reports are awaited. The patient had recently recovered from Covid. He said ENT specialists removed decayed skin from the patient’s nose through surgical treatment and her condition is stable. Himachal had recorded its first case of mucormycosis on Friday when a 52-year-old woman from Hamirpur was found infected with deadly fungus. She is currently undergoing treatment at IGMC. Her surgical treatment was to be held on Saturday, but couldn’t be done due to her unstable blood pressure and high blood sugar level.Meanwhile, two cases of black fungus have been reported at Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Tanda.Kangra chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Gurdarshan Gupta said a 40-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman were diagnosed with mucormycosis as well.They had Covid and their samples tested after symptoms of black fungus infection emerged turned out positive.Dr Gupta said the patients are being treated as per the protocol.Mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus, is caused by a mould found in soil and in decaying organic matter like rotting leaves. People get mucormycosis, of which there are several types, by breathing in the fungal spores.Intense headache, pain in the sinus area and the right eye, blurred vision and swollen cheeks are some of the symptoms. The disease progresses rapidly and attacks blood vessels and live tissues turning them black — hence the name ‘black fungus. The infection needs to be caught early or it may turn deadly. Once spread to brain, the mortality rate is 50%. Himachal logs 1,309 infections, 59 deathsHimachal Pradesh recorded 1,309 fresh Covid-19 infections on Sunday taking the state’s tally to 1,79,034, while the death toll mounted to 2,752 after 59 more patients succumbed to the contagion. Of the new cases, 245 were reported in Solan, 216 in Kangra, 204 in Shimla, 144 in Mandi, 133 in Sirmaur, 122 in Hamirpur, 80 in Chamba, 75 in Una, 51 in Bilaspur, 26 in Kullu, seven in Lahaul-Spiti and six in Kinnaur.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Booking a vaccination slot a Herculean task for 18+ in Himachal||If you are in the age group of 18-44 years and waiting to get vaccinated in Himachal, get ready for a long haul. Booking a vaccination slot in the state is no less than hitting a jackpot.Even those with high-speed internet and fastest fingers are at their wits’ end as there is no guarantee that they will get a spot. Slots open for a fraction of second, one blink and they are gone. “I was on two devices with high-speed internet, but still didn’t get a slot,” said Varun Chaudhary, who lives in Shimla.“The CoWIN portal always displayed slot booked on the vaccination centre in and around Shimla from 2pm to 3.30pm. The official time of slot opening was 2.30pm but it showed no vacancy,” he complained. “It seems like a big scam. The slots are already booked before they are uploaded on the portal,” he alleged.Due to shortage of vaccine, the state government has fixed two days, Monday and Thursday, in a week for vaccination of people in the 18-44 age group. Vaccination began on May 17 and till date, 40,353 people have been given the jab while the estimated population in this range is more than 31 lakh. To start with, the state government had received more than 1.7 lakh doses for the vaccination of the people in this age group.The slots are updated on the website two days before the vaccination schedule.Abhay Karki, a youth from Dharamshala, said he and his brother were trying to book a slot on two separate computers.“It opened for a while and till we submitted the details, all the slots were taken. This has happened not once but twice. If there was shortage of vaccines, the government should have started the drive later instead of creating a chaos,” he said. This is not the only problem with the process. In rural belts, people have limited access to the internet and those living in urban areas have been hogging the vaccination slots.Vinod Kumar, a resident of a rural area in Kangra district, said many people from the other states got jabbed at the vaccination centre near his village.He said village people were not tech-savvy and till they filled the form, all slots were booked.There were also reports of some tourists getting jabbed at vaccination centres in Lahaul and Spiti while a Haryana man was seen getting the shot at Dharamshala vaccination centre. Another member of his family had booked a vaccination slot near Nurpur. Prajwal Busta, a Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader, said if anyone from other state worked here or lived here for long, he/she should definitely get the vaccine.“But, if tourists are hogging the slots, then it’s wrong. If they can travel this far for getting jabbed, then they can also pay for the vaccine. Bona fide address proof should be made mandatory for booking slots,” she added. She said the state government had done a good job in vaccinating its people, but some of them were taking advantage of “flaws in the system”.Matter taken up with CentreMeanwhile, Dr Nipun Jindal, director of National Health Mission (NHM), said problems being faced by people were in notice of authorities.“We have taken up the matter with the Union health ministry and also written to them seeking a solution,” he said. “We have asked the Centre to allow us book certain percentage of slots offline like it is being done in Lahaul and Spiti where 80% slots are not being booked on web,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/booking-a-vaccination-slot-a-herculean-task-for-18-in-himachal-101621799524414.html

In his complaint, Vishal told the police that he and his friend Laxman Yadav worked at the Ludhiana Railway Station, where they loaded and unloaded material from trains. On Friday afternoon, he received a call from Jagmohan to meet him near the Clock Tower. When he reached there, Vishal said Jagmohan picked him up in his car and on reaching near Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, also picked up four other men. He drove him to his office near Vishkarma Chowk, where he forced him to call Laxman to Dholewal Chowk.Soon after, Jagmohan went to bring Laxman from there, and then drove him and Laxman to Vishwakarma Chowk, where he and his accomplices thrashed him. After brutally beating them up, the accused tore their clothes and filmed it on their phones, Vishal alleged.“The victims were released later in the night with threats of being killed if they reported the incident to the police, and were also warned against any future tip-offs about their consignment to the excise department,” said sub-inspector (SI) Harjit Singh, who is investigating the case.The accused have been booked under Sections 365 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful consignment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act at the Division Number 1 police station.

He was charged ₹80,000 and provided a visitor’s visa with a promise that it will automatically convert into a work visa a month later.Kumar said he landed in Dubai on February 26, and soon realised he was duped, as all contacts to the travel agent for a work visa bore no fruit. His family also visited the agent’s office several times, but in vain, leaving him stranded abroad.Being able to secure the deputy commissioner’s mobile phone number through a contact gave him hope, and he sent the official a distress message on May 13.Swinging into action immediately, Sharma contacted Sarbat Da Bhala head SPS Oberoi, whose team in Dubai rescued Kumar and helped him fly back to India.The deputy commissioner thanked the trust for its untiring efforts in Kumar’s safe repatriation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-youth-stranded-in-dubai-reunited-with-family-101621796824324.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Horticulture waste being dumped in Chandigarh’s southern sectors||The residents of Chandigarh’s southern sectors have had it with the waste problem in the area which they claim has become a dump yard despite prompt complaints to the civic body authorities.As per the chief coordinator of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), Rajinder Garg, an empty patch of land in Sector 46-A has become a dumping ground for horticultural waste.“The land exists between 1-kanal kothis where garbage collectors and residents frequently chuck their waste. The municipal corporation too has failed to resolve the issue, instead the officials ask us for money to hire vehicles to pick up the garbage. Don’t we pay enough taxes already,” asked Garg.When asked, area councillor Gurpreet Singh Dhillon said he has been routinely getting the spot cleaned in the past. “The land belongs to the UT administration, but we still get it cleaned routinely. I was hospitalised for Covid treatment, so I was unavailable for the past few days. I will get this issue resolved on priority now,” he assured.Similarly, president of Sector 38 resident welfare association (RWA) Joginder Singh said, “In the park beside Vivek High School, disposal of horticultural waste has become a routine affair. We demand that the authorities concerned act on our complaints and maintain cleanliness in the area.” He added that the MC should also issue challans if any private individual is found dumping waste here.In Sector 33, this problem continues despite repeated complaints from residents. Sector 33-A RWA president Jagdish Singh Sarpal said, “The park near the Sehaj Safai Kendra is lying in a state of neglect while horticultural waste is also dumped regularly in an empty plot next to Tender Heart School.”MC officials tasked with lifting the waste here said they would look into the matter. The civic body is also in the process of buying more vehicles to lift horticultural waste from the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/horticulture-waste-being-dumped-in-chandigarh-s-southern-sectors-101621794905301.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||New 8pm deadline for home delivery brings Ludhiana restaurants back in business||Now allowed to deliver food till 8pm instead of the earlier 12pm deadline, the city’s restaurant sector has finally heaved a sigh of relief.Already facing mounting losses due to low footfall amid the Covid pandemic, restaurant businesses have been struggling to stay afloat since the 17-hour curfew was imposed in the district on May 10, limiting their hours of operation to 5am to 12pm.From Monday onwards, the district administration pushed their home delivery deadline to 8pm and also extended the curfew relaxation hours to 5am to 1pm, allowing take-away service for eight hours. The relaxation also came as a boon for delivery boys, whose daily earnings had depleted with customers unable to place home delivery orders after noon. Restaurateurs are now also seeking permission to open dine-in services at 50% capacity to help them cover their fixed expenses. “Restaurants were unable to even meet the fixed costs to keep their businesses running with the 17-hour curfew in place. Now that the administration has allowed home delivery till 8pm, around 50% business may return in the coming days. Yet, as dinner hours are usually till 10pm, further relaxation is needed,” said Bhupinder Basant, owner of Basant Restaurants, and senior vice-chairman, Punjab State Traders Board.Meanwhile, representatives of the city’s restaurant and hotel industries also said that the administration’s decision will only benefit certain outlets that offered home delivery, while those depending on dine-in customers were still out of business.“Those offering only dine-in will continue to suffer. We will take up the matter with the government to allow restaurants to host customers at 50% capacity, else the restaurant and hotel sector will collapse,” said Amarvir Singh, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana.Proprietor of Club 69ML, Bhanu Ahuja said,”We cannot open our premises, as our business mostly depends on customers wishing to dine in during dinner hours. With negligible footfall before noon, it has become almost impossible to cover our expenses and salaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-8pm-deadline-for-home-delivery-brings-ludhiana-restaurants-back-in-business-101621880587576.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana prison dept’s proposal to educate inmates remains a pipe dream||The Haryana prison department’s 20-month-old proposal to educate the inmates, especially women prisoners and their kids, is yet to take off despite eight letters being sent to the elementary education department to depute one teacher in every jail on temporary basis, according to official documents.There are about 21,600 prisoners lodged in 19 jails of Haryana against the authorised capacity of 20,041. While 5,168 prisoners are convicts and over 16,400 are undertrials. Lodged in these jails are about 684 women prisoners, including 171 convicted women inmates, who have been serving their sentence along with their children. A section of the prisoners are uneducated.Stressing on the urgency of educating the prisoners in order to help their seamless rehabilitation into the society after they serve their sentences, the director general (DG) prisons had first mooted this proposal in September 2019, asking the director elementary education to post one JBT guest teacher in every jail.As per the first letter of the DG prisons, “among the inmates are mothers and their children, illiterate convicted prisoners and youth.” In every letter/reminder the DG prisons said “educating these inmates is important to help them become good citizens.”According to DG (prisons) Shatrujeet Kapur, whose predecessor had mooted the proposal and kept pursuing it, “About 75% of the inmates in Haryana prisons are undertrials and reforming them is crucial.”He said the jail department is seeking just one teacher for each prison on temporary basis. “We have only 19 prisons in Haryana,” he added.After the first letter to the director elementary education on September 10, 2019, the DG (prisons) sent five reminders in 2020 (January 15, March 6, October 9, November 3, December 14) followed by another reminder on February 11, 2021.He sent the final reminder so far on March 16 this year to know the fate of the proposal.In the latest reminder to the director elementary education, the DG (prisons) said the jail department, through many letters, has been requesting to direct the district elementary education officers to appoint a teacher on temporary basis in all district prisons except central jail Hisar and district jails of Palwal and Rewari.“However, we have not received any intimation from your office in this regard. Thus, we again request you to issue the necessary directions,” the letter reads.When contacted, neither the director elementary education nor the joint directors dealing with the matter, were available for comments.Sources said on May 21, office of director elementary education sent a letter (HT has a copy of which) to all district elementary education officers informing them about the proposal of the jail department and asking them to reply so that JBT teachers can be posted on temporary basis in district jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-prison-dept-s-proposal-to-educate-inmates-remains-a-pipe-dream-101621876507855.html
24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Minimal Covid cases in rural areas belie claims of massive spread||Even as the decline in Covid-19 cases continued in Haryana for the second successive week, the minimal number of cases detected from villages have belied the claims of massive spread of the virus in rural areas.The state-wide dip in number of cases is significant. Health department data showed that the state registered 34,929 lesser cases last week (May 17-23) than the week before (May 10-16). A total of 43,601 cases were reported last week as compared to 78,530 the week before.RURAL SCREENING SHOWS UNEXPECTED RESULTSAmid the continuous drop in cases, a drive launched by the state government to screen rural population for the virus has thrown up unexpected results.The screening drive has not only shown a lower rate of infection in villages, but the outcome also puts a question mark on the claims over role of agitating farmers in acting as super spreaders.The Haryana Villagers General Health Check-up Scheme (HVGHCS) was started by the state government to screen villagers for influenza-like illness (ILI) in view of reports of pandemic making inroads in rural areas.As per statistics, only 2,823 infections have been detected from 5,156 villages in the past nine days of screening by 3,370 field teams.As per the health department data, 97.72 lakh persons from 20.89 lakh rural households have been screened for ILI since May 15 when the check-up drive was commenced. This meant that about 59% of the village population has been screened so far.Data showed that 75,501 persons suspected of ILI were tested using rapid antigen testing (RAT) kits and 13,190 were tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The cumulative positivity rate was 3.74%.‘RURAL SCREENING DATA IS MISLEADING’While politicians across spectrum are expressing concerns over the “outbreak in villages”, statistics of by the screening drive are quite contrary.“The number of cases is more than what the screening is showing. The data is misleading as a large section of the population is still reluctant to get tested. There is stigma attached to Covid and it is more prevalent in villages,” said a top BJP leader, not wishing to be named.State BJP chief OP Dhankar said villagers should go for testing without hesitation, get vaccinated, and refrain from smoking community hookahs and playing cards to protect themselves and their families from the contagion.Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the data is inaccurate. “The number of positive cases in villages is way more then what the data shows. There have also been more fatalities than what the government data shows,” he said.Hooda said villagers are in denial and not ready to go for testing due to stigma. “Even when someone is sick in a village, there is reluctance to go for testing as people fear that they will not make it back home,” he added.A BJP MLA said cases in rural areas have started to dip in the last 10-15 days and so screening of rural populace is showing a lower number of cases.FATALITIES IN RURAL AREAS RISINGData showed that the percentage of fatalities in villages have gradually increased over the past few months.As per the latest data, 2,737 people from rural areas have succumbed to Covid since March 2020 which is about 36% of the total fatalities reported.The gradual increase is evident as the percentage of deaths reported from rural areas in late February, when the second surge had just started, was about 29.36% of the total deaths, 29.63% on March 21, 31.83% by April 25, and 33.52% of the total deaths by May 9.OUTBREAK IN VILLAGESTotal villages: 6,841Total rural population: 1.64 crore (approx)Villages screened: 5,156Villagers screened: 97.72 lakhHouseholds covered: 20.89 lakhVillagers found infected: 2,823Villagers in isolation centres: 251Villagers referred to higher centre: 146||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/minimal-covid-cases-in-rural-areas-belie-claims-of-massive-spread-101621876208074.html

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Antibiotic pollution in Sirsa river flowing through Baddi pharma hub||Due to industrial waste being dumped into the Sirsa river that flows through Himachal Pradesh’s pharma hub of Baddi and Barotiwala, its water has a high content of ciprofloxacin class of drugs called quinolone antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections. Also read: Now, on-site registration for 18 and above at govt vaccination centresThe India Veterans Forum for Transparency in Public Life, an NGO that is a constituent of the Consortium for Common Cause (CCC), has conducted a first-of-its-kind study to find out the level of pollutants in the form of discharge of antibiotics in the river in Baddi. To begin with, the discharge of ciprofloxacin was studied. The study, pioneered by wing commander BNP Singh (retd), showed that the level of ciprofloxacin downstream was extremely high and, in some instances, bordering on 1,500 times the basic safe limits meant for such discharge. NGT directed state to study pollution in riverArmed with the findings, the forum filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on June 24, 2020. Hearing the matter, the NGT last year directed the authorities to constitute a task force and study the matter. As a result, the Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board (HPPCB) conducted followup tests and submitted its test reports to the NGT recently. “The tests confirmed ciprofloxacin pollution in the river,” major Kunwar Suresh Rana, the forum organising secretary, said. The board submitted its report to the state government besides the NGT. Studies found contents of ciprofloxacin and directions have been sought from the Central Pollution Control Board on the permissible limits. Impact of toxic discharge on human life The HPPCB test reports also conclude that though there are no standards available for this kind of pollution, there are draft recommendations and by going through them, it can be easily inferred that pollution found in the river is 1,500 times the acceptable norms. In the absence of any standards for evaluating the impact of the highly toxic discharge on human life, it is difficult to ascertain the health problems being faced by the population using the river water downstream and the natural seepage of the toxins into the groundwater table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/antibiotic-pollution-in-sirsa-river-flowing-through-baddi-pharma-hub-101621851789448.html

Many want the inoculation drive to be done before the children take the exams.“We want the board to conduct the Class 12 exams only once the situation improves and children are vaccinated. Why did the board not conduct exams with a curtailed format in March when the situation was better?” said Krishan Kumar, a parent from Bhiwani.To this, Prasad said that most of the students are aged below 18 years and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not included this age group for vaccination yet.“We need to check with the government if vaccines can be given to students below 18 years.

24-05-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers to protest in Hisar today, admin steps up security||Farmers in Haryana’s Hisar will on Monday protest registration of First Information Report (FIR) against more than 300 farmers for clashing with the police earlier this month. The protest comes at a time when the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) -- an umbrella body of more than 40 farm organisations leading protests against the three contentious central agricultural laws -- has given a call to intensify the movement from May 26, when it completes six months.In view of Monday's protest, the district administration has stepped up security in Hisar, especially fortifying the police commissionerate which, the farmers, declared, they would “gherao” to protest against the police’s decision to book 350 unidentified farmers for the May 16 clash, as well as to demand action against the police personnel who allegedly lathi-charged them.Also Read | 350 farmers booked for Hisar incidentViolence broke out on May 16 after a section of farmers, protesting against the farm laws, tried to march towards a venue where Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was to inaugurate a Covid-19 hospital. The police, which was accused of “high-handedness” as it lobbed tear gas shells and used force to disperse the agitators, in turn accused the protesters of pelting stones at police personnel.While Khattar was able to inaugurate the hospital, the farmers, angered by police action, blocked several key highways in Haryana, and also gheraoed the residence of Hisar’s Inspector General of Police (IGP) against the arrest of some protesting farmers. They dispersed after those arrested were released.Also Read | Protest over Khattar’s visit: Farmers block major highways after clashing with cops in HisarHaryana, and its neighbouring state of Punjab, have emerged as the epicentre of the ongoing protests against the three farm laws. Farmers, most of them belonging to the two northern states, have been camping at three borders in Delhi, demanding a complete repeal of the laws. The legislations were passed in September last year, triggering a face-off between the farmers and the central government. 11 rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock; the two sides last sat across the table on January 22.Also Read | Khattar meets Amit Shah to update him on Hisar clashRecently, the SKM wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a resumption of the dialogue.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-to-protest-in-hisar-today-admin-steps-up-security-101621820616057.html
