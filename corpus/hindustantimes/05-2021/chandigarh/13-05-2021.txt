However, only night shelter building was constructed.Confirming the development, DSP Kewal Karishan of vigilance bureau, Moga, said, “We are investigating this matter and it will take some time. I will be able to share details after completion of the probe.”Darshi confirmed that only the night shelter building was constructed. “The tenders for construction of the other two buildings were cancelled for some reasons. The tender for architectural services of the three buildings were allotted to the architect before that. The payments were released as per rules,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vb-begins-probe-into-9-lakh-paid-to-architect-by-moga-mc-101620929751699.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cong faces crisis as councillors move HC against Jaitu MC chief’s election in Punjab||Five Congress councilors are among the 11 newly elected members who have challenged the May 7 election of Surjit Singh Baba as the Jaitu municipal council president in the Punjab and Haryana high court, demanding that the election be set aside since he doesn’t enjoy trust of the majority members. The high court has treated the civil writ petition as urgent and fixed the hearing for May 19. The Congress had won nine of the 17 seats in the civic body elections held in February. The petition was filed by five Congress councillors, three independents, two of Shiromani Akali Dal and one belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party, alleging that Baba’s appointment was made in an unjust and unfair manner. “The name of Baba was announced by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu from an envelope claiming it is an order of the Congress high command,” the petitioners alleged. The petitioners said they immediately raised an objection inside the House after Baba’s name was announced. “Ten elected members of three different parties along with Jaitu MLA Baldev Singh submitted a written complaint to the chief secretary, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court and chief election officer,” they added. On May 7, the election for the office-bearers of Jaitu municipal council was held amid high drama, with a faction of Congress councillors backed by Faridkot member parliament Mohammad Sadiq opposed the appointment of Baba. One of the petitioners, Suman Devi of the Congress, is backed by Sadiq, while Baba has the support of Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon. Suman was nominated as senior vice-president but she staked claim on the president’s post. MP Sadiq said that out of 17 councillors, Suman had the support of 10 but Baba was still named the president. “This is totally unconstitutional, MLA of another area should not interfere in the affairs of my constituency,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-faces-crisis-as-councillors-move-hc-against-jaitu-mc-chief-s-election-in-punjab-101620929451653.html

The four ministers, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar, on Wednesday demanded the suspension of the Amritsar East MLA for his unwarranted belligerence against the chief minister. “Sidhu’s provocative and targeted attacks on the chief minister over the past several days are an invitation for disaster for the Congress,” they said in a hard-hitting statement, suggesting collusion between Sidhu and opposition parties in the state, such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Punjab’s conscience is above party lines, stop firing from party colleagues’ shoulders. You are directly responsible & answerable. Who will protect you in court of the Great Guru?” Sidhu tweeted on Thursday, without naming the chief minister. Sidhu, whose relations with Amarinder have been strained for more than two-and-a-half years, has been taking swipes at the chief minister almost daily ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed the chargesheets filed by the special investigation team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case of 2015 that left two villagers dead. Reacting to the criticism, the chief minister has termed Sidhu’s outbursts “total indiscipline” and said that he may be leaving for the AAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-takes-aim-at-capt-again-asks-who-will-protect-you-in-guru-s-court-101620893989998.html

Of the new cases, 2,750 were from Kashmir while 1,759 were from Jammu, besides 87 travellers. Dr Rakesh Bahl, senior consultant, department of community medicine, GMC Jammu, said the sudden surge in cases after a year was due to people letting their guard down.“We, as a society, let our guards down and stopped observing Covid preventive measures strictly. If your mask isn’t covering your nose, it is as good as wearing no mask at all,” he said.Officials said with 863 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 621 in Jammu district, 377 in Baramulla, 327 in Pulwama and 233 in Anantnag.The number of active cases has reached 51,542, officials said. Dr Bahl pitched for adopting Covid appropriate behaviour and getting vaccinated as the only foreseeable way out of the pandemic.“A combination of two properly fitted masks — one home-made fabric mask over one surgical mask — is needed for maximum protection. The N95 masks are primarily meant for people at much higher risk of infection like doctors and other healthcare workers,” he added. Nearly 3,603 patients have recovered from the disease, including 2,287 from Kashmir and 1,316 from Jammu. As many as 1,74,953 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 76.26% against around 98% in the first fortnight of February.

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 35% of those dead in April had no comorbidities||Nearly 35% of those who died of Covid-19 in the month of April had no comorbid conditions and were reasonably healthy, data released by the Ludhiana health department has revealed. The monthly death count also shot up to 231 in April as compared to January and February when the figure remained in two digits at 36 and 29 respectively. In March, the monthly fatality count stood at 115. As per the data, out of the total 231 Covid deaths in April, 152 victims were suffering from comorbidities while 79 had no prior health issues. The data also found that the 60-plus age group was more susceptible as 55% of the total deaths in April fell in this age category. The 50 to 60 age group accounted for 25% of the deaths while 20% were under the age of 50. The deaths among women also rose from 50 in March to 99 in April in the district. The combined female death count of January and February stood at 13. The data also shows that out of the 231 fatalities, 167 deaths (72%) were reported in urban areas, 14 (6%) in the urban block (towns) and 50 (22%) in rural areas of the city. Dr Bishav Mohan, member of the Covid task force of the state, said, “There are three reasons for the rise in casualties. The first is that the virulence (severity) of the virus has increased which makes considerably healthy persons extremely sick. Secondly, there has been a rise in the number of infections in rural areas. The third reason is that people are seeking medical help only when their condition starts deteriorating. By the time they reach the hospital, they are in a critical state, which increases their chances of succumbing to the virus. Early testing, treatment and awareness are imperative to save the patients in such situations.” District family planning officer Dr SP Singh, who is also the nodal officer for Covid, said, “This time around, the virus is undoubtedly more aggressive and virulent. We are increasingly witnessing cases where patients have absolutely no comorbidities. Patients below the age of 40 are being hospitalised with serious complications as well despite not having any history of diabetes and hypertension.” Observing that people’s negligence was responsible for the surge in cases, Singh said, “The method of arresting the virus’ spread is still the same. Despite making all efforts to raise awareness, the younger population is still taking the virus lightly, which was not the case during the first wave, when people feared Covid.” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargav said more younger people were testing positive during the second wave as they had suddenly started stepping out. “There are some variants prevalent in the nation which may also be affecting younger people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-35-of-those-dead-in-april-had-no-comorbidities-101620850547493.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Convene all-party meeting on Covid situation in Punjab: SAD to Capt||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to call an all-party meeting to discuss the precarious situation in the wake of rising number of Covid-19 deaths in Punjab and find ways to provide financial relief to different sections of society. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal said this while presiding over a meeting at the party head office in Chandigarh. The Akali leaders said the Congress government in the state should try to take everyone along in the fight against the pandemic and an all-party meeting was necessary to ensure that everyone worked in synergy and assist the government to provide necessary aid to people. The SAD chief also reviewed the relief being provided by the party and its youth wing. He said aid had been extended to 50 assembly constituencies and efforts will be made to reach out to all segments in the coming days. The party leaders also took note of the sufferings of people due to the ongoing lockdown in the state and stressed the need to give relief to all sections of society. The worst-affected were taxi operators, rickshaw pullers, small shopkeepers and labourers, they said, adding that the government should provide financial relief to them. They also asked the government to provide relief to the middle class by deferring bank loan installments or waive installments for six months. The government should also address the grievances of the traders at the earliest, they said. On black marketing of Covid cure medicines, Sukhbir said it was unfortunate that private hospitals were charging lakhs of rupees from infected people and the government was not intervening in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/convene-all-party-meeting-on-covid-situation-in-punjab-sad-to-capt-101620850068175.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Inadequate canal water, bad weather delay cotton sowing in Punjab’s Malwa belt||Lack of canal water supply for irrigation and inclement weather conditions in the last two weeks have slowed sowing of cotton in the semi-arid Malwa region of southern Punjab.The crop was sowed on nearly 70,000 hectares till Monday, 22% of this year’s target area of 3.25 lakh hectares, state agriculture officials said. The exercise is expected to be over by May 23 with a delay of eight days in the government’s sowing schedule.Sowing on more than 12,000 hectares area in Mansa district was delayed due to the non-availability of canal water, it is learnt. Sharanjit Singh of Mansa’s Mann Khera village, who owns 24-acre land, said he was able to sow cotton on about 5 acres using tubewell. “Groundwater is not of good quality in the Sardulgarh area and we depend on water supplied from the Bhakra canal. But the supply was suspended for over 14 days due to a breach in the canal and we are now left in the lurch. Delay in sowing will impact the cotton quality and the crop may be vulnerable to pest attack,” he said.Pargat Singh, a cotton grower from Sangha village whose joint family has 22-acre land, said the delay in sowing has worried them. “Agriculture experts say May 15 is the ideal time for sowing and we have already lost the golden time. The farmers were encouraged by last year’s good yield of 8-10 quintals per acre produce and the crop sale was also hassle-free with handsome rates offered. But this time inadequate electricity supply and lack of canal water worry us,” he added.Mansa chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said the Bhakra mainline had major damage near Fatehpur village and water in the channel is expected to be released tonight. “All villages are expected to get water in the next 24 hours,” he added.Punjab agriculture deputy director for cotton Rajesh Kumar Raheja said the state’s target is to cover 3.25 lakh hectares under cotton this year, an increase of 74,000 hectares from the last season’s 2.25 lakh hectares.Raheja said except Mansa no other district of Malwa belt had any irrigation issue for cotton sowing. “In the last two weeks, cotton-growing districts witnessed cloudy weather. Farmers apprehend rainfall and re-sowing means more expenses. Climatic conditions slowed sowing which will be over in the next 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inadequate-canal-water-bad-weather-delay-cotton-sowing-in-punjab-s-malwa-belt-101620850067145.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Purchase of Fateh kits in Punjab under lens||The purchase of ‘Fateh kits’, which are being provided by the Punjab Government to Covid-19 patients, has come under scrutiny with the National Health Mission (NHM) awarding the purchase of kits worth ₹20 crore without following the due tendering process. Also, Grand Way Incorporation, a Ludhiana-based firm which was given the purchase order, doesn’t have the drug licence — a mandatory condition to participate in the tendering process. A Fateh kit contains a digital thermometer, a steamer, a fingertip pulse oxymeter, vitamin C limcee and zinc tablets, vitamin D3 capsules, Ayush kwath, dolo and other medicines. NHM director (finance) Neeraj Singla said the purchase was made in emergency as cases of infection were rising exponentially in Punjab and the department did not have the kits to distribute it to the patients. The purchase order was given on May 7. The NHM had invited the tenders for the purchase of kits on April 29, it is learnt. The tender was reportedly cancelled because four companies quoted the same price at the rate of ₹1,780 per kit. The NHM officials claim that the tender was cancelled because all four bidders deliberately quoted the same price. “Since new tendering would have taken more time and we wanted kits immediately, one of the companies, which earlier provided 50,000 kits ₹1,095 apiece agreed to supply us kits at ₹1,195 apiece. The pandemic has taken such a turn that we needed to buy the kits urgently,” said Neeraj Singla.The company was asked to provide 1.5 lakh kits at a total cost of ₹20.07 crore. The firm was given the earlier purchase order on April 19 of supplying 50,000 kits through tendering. It did not have the mandatory drug licence while participating in the bidding process at that time also. “A bidder cannot even apply for tenders for supplying drugs without the licence as per Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The bidder was allowed to involve a third party for supplying drugs. All other applicants in both the tenders had the drug licence,” said a health department official. NHM director Kumar Rahul said the condition of having drug licence is not necessary and the company can make purchases from third party as the kit contains several items in non-medicine category. “Since the tender was cancelled, the other bidders will also be given the purchase order as our kit is in demand because of the rising Covid cases. All procedures have been duly followed,” he said. Attempts to contact Grand Way Incorporation did not yield any result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/purchase-of-fateh-kits-in-punjab-under-lens-101620850007415.html

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Nearly 40% of PM Cares ventilators faulty or pending installation in Punjab||Nearly 40% of ventilators received under the PM Cares Fund in Punjab are either faulty or pending installation due to non-compatibility with equipment in state hospitals. Managing director, Punjab Health Systems Corporation, Tanu Kashyap said all 809 ventilators received through the Central scheme have been distributed. “Of these, 174 are non-functional, while 136 are yet to be installed,” she said. The state government had earlier this month flagged the issue of defective ventilators received under the scheme and urged the Centre to direct the company to repair the faulty lifesaving machines. On Wednesday, it was found that of the 80 ventilators received under the scheme at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, 71 were defective. According to official information, 47 of the 59 ventilators at Government Medical College, Amritsar, and 50 at the Government Medical College, Patiala, were also non-functional. Earlier this month, Punjab health secretary Hussan Lal had written to joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare Dr Mandeep Kumar Bhandari saying that there are complaints of malfunctioning in ventilators.The health secretary said they raised the issue of defective ventilators with central authorities during video conference and through a letter in first week of May. “During the meeting, some other states also raised similar issues with the ventilators delivered under PM Cares Fund. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has been entrusted the work of installation and maintenance of ventilators. The company further appointed another firm, TBS, for the purpose. The private company do not have enough manpower due to which there is delay installation and repair. A team engineers visited the Faridkot medical college on Wednesday to repair ventilators. But these machines are not compatible with other equipment installed at the hospitals across the state, so we are facing difficulty to make them functional,” he saidIn April, the Union health ministry had asked Punjab to install all 809 ventilators supplied under PM Cares Fund. The Union health secretary had said that of the total ventilators, only 558 have been installed while 251 are still pending installation. “Non-commissioning of ventilators defeats the very purpose of this exercise by the government of India. There is a need for taking urgent steps to complete the installation of the ventilators for management of Covid pandemic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nearly-40-of-pm-cares-ventilators-faulty-or-pending-installation-in-punjab-101620849106504.html

While the police is coming down hard on all shops dealing with non-essential wares, including groceries, after noon, the liquor vends,which can be seen operating till late night, are somehow escaping their scanner.The vends draw their shutters in suit with other businesses at the start of curfew but the employees stay inside. Customers slip the money through the hole carved in the shutter and the salesperson pushes out bottles through the same cavity.Not sure what to purchase? No problem. Some liquor vends also allow customers to enter the shop through the back door and peruse the shelves. For the booze lovers unwilling to risk arrest, some liquor vendors are also offering home delivery.In order to evade the men in khaki, some ingenious liquor vendors have deployed lookouts to alert them should policemen on patrol be in the vicinity.Such illicit sale was observed on Ferozepur Road, near Barewal Road, outside the Railway station, Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) Chowk, Shingar Cinema Road, Samrala Chowk, Janakpuri Chowk, Sufiyan Bagh Chowk, Old Jail Road, Amarpura and Transport Nagar.The light pouring out of the hole in the shutter indicates the outlet is open for business. At CMCH Chowk, it was observed that a liquor vend was conducting business with impunity after curfew, even as a police team deputed on the site turned a blind eye to the establishment.A policeman deputed near Sufiyan Chowk could be seen peeping through the hole and asking the salesman to switched off the lights.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said that sale of liquor had been banned during curfew hours, but some business owners were violating the directions. “FIRs are being lodged daily. We will ask the excise department to cancel license of those violating the curfew,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grocery-shops-may-close-at-noon-but-you-ll-get-booze-24x7-in-ludhiana-101620848986563.html

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s ESIC Hospital is now Covid facility for children||The Chandigarh administration is opening a separate facility for children suffering from Covid-19 at ESIC Hospital in Ram Darbar. The move comes after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the health department to earmark exclusive wards for such “young patients”, who are increasingly testing positive for the new strain of the virus during the second wave.Initially, the paediatric facility will have six beds, both ICU and oxygen, which can be extended to up to 16 if needed, said officials.Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services, Chandigarh, said the need for an exclusive paediatric ward was felt as the two new facilities at Panjab University and the Sector 45 civil hospital are admitting mostly adult patients. “ESIC Hospital has trained paediatricians and anaesthetists. Initially, it has been earmarked for children, but if the need arises, adult patients can also be admitted,” she said.Chandigarh has only one paediatric Covid facility at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. It has 32 beds, which include nine ICU beds, and has reached 80% occupancy.“The overall infection numbers are very high in the second wave, and consequently the number of affected children has also gone up. The treatment outcome is good among them and mortality due to Covid is uncommon,” said Jayashree Muralidharan, professor of paediatrics at the PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-esic-hospital-is-now-covid-facility-for-children-101620845746429.html

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to roll out vax for 18+ on May 14||The Chandigarh administration will begin the vaccination drive for 18-44 years age group on May 14. There is no facility for walk-in registration, and the beneficiaries will have to book the slot and obtain the time and place of vaccine through the Co-WIN portal, stated an official release on Wednesday. On the first day, 1,000 slots will be opened, said officials.The decision came after the Government of India allotted 33,000 vaccines for the younger age group in Chandigarh. The doses reached the city on Wednesday.The Centre had extended the drive to all adults on May 1. However, amid shortage of vaccines, various states and UTs had to delay the launch. While Panchkula became the first in the tricity to roll it out on May 2, Mohali launched it only for construction workers on May 9.UT adviser Manoj Parida said that in addition to the existing vaccination centres in the government sector, additional sites will be opened in a few schools, exclusively for this age group of beneficiaries. The details of the venues will be intimated individually to the beneficiaries while booking the slot. “Vaccines will be administered in a phased manner to avoid crowding. All necessary arrangements will be made to ensure Covid protocol is strictly followed and doses are administered under proper medical supervision,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh.The administration has earlier announced that the vaccine will be provided for free at government centres.Private hospitals are to get the vaccines directly from manufacturers. For example, the Serum Institute of India has allocated 12,000 doses of Covishield to Chaitanya Hospital in Sector 44 for May. “They may also start the vaccination drive on payment basis immediately after the actual receipt of vaccines. They are already registered on the Co-WIN portal and will be able to offer the slots after they receive the doses,” said a UT spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-roll-out-vax-for-18-on-may-14-101620845267721.html

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||High drama as hundreds waiting for hours told to leave at Panchkula vax centre||Tempers flared at the Civil Hospital in Sector 6 as hundreds of people waiting for hours for Covid vaccine were told to return empty handed on Wednesday evening.Even those reaching at 4pm, ran into a queue of 300 people, who had arrived after reading or hearing news about a special event at the hospital, which normally does not host vaccinations, being a Covid care centre.“There was a news report that vaccination drive will go on till late evening at the Sector 6 hospital and people can reach by 5pm. But even after joining the queue at 4pm, I didn’t move three to four steps for the next two hours,” said Inayat Kakar, a Panchkula resident.She complained that while the vaccination moved at a snail’s pace with hundreds still in queue, a few VIPs went in for shots easily. As the staff announced the stock was over and the window was closed, heated arguments erupted.“Why invite people when they cannot manage the drive? Worse, people are being exposed to infection by holding the vaccination drive at a Covid care centre,” said Kakar, who returned without a jab at 6.30pm.When contacted, immunisation officer Meenu Sasan said the large-scale drive was held without her permission. “I never allow vaccination at a hospital that is treating Covid patients. There will be no more vaccination there.”She said the principal medical officer did approach her for a small vaccination event for around 100 people in view of Nurses’ Day, while saying that they will manage it, so she had only allowed that.Later, in the evening, she got a call during a meeting that lots of people had reached the hospital for vaccination. But, it was not managed as promised, she said.Vaccination pace slowing downEven though Panchkula took the lead in tricity in starting the third phase of vaccination for the 18-44 drive on May 2, its vaccination numbers have declined since April.Only 24,110 people have been vaccinated in the first 11 days of May, compared to 27,920 in the same period in April.This, despite the sharp surge in new infections and deaths. While the district had logged 8,013 cases through April, the figure has already reached 5,319 in just 12 days of May. Worse, at 60, the deaths this month have already surpassed April’s 53.Yet, the younger population is still finding it a challenge to book a slot, which gets full within a few minutes. “I have been trying to book a slot for several days now, but in vain. The slots are always full,” said Uday, a Panchkula resident.Another youth, Aakash, said he had been facing the same issue, with the slots turning red within a few seconds for the past three days.While those in the 18-44 category struggle for slots, those above 45 years are facing a tough time due to non-availability of the right vaccine for their second dose. For instance, there is no Covaxin stock at the government dispensaries in Sectors 7 and 12.To this, Dr Sasan said, “The vaccination drive depends on the supply of vaccines. In the beginning of May, there was a shortage of supply, hence the drive slowed down. But, we are trying our best to manage within the limited resources.”“The number of sites has been decreased for now, as our focus will be on covering those living in slums,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-drama-as-hundreds-waiting-for-hours-told-to-leave-at-panchkula-vax-centre-101620844366004.html
