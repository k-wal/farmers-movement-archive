But the former was recently transferred after being promoted as senior medical officer (SMO) and the latter is on a three-year sabbatical to pursue fellowship in Kolkata.Two other ENT doctors – Dr Ramesh Bhagat, is operating as the district epidemiologist, and Dr Pardeep Kumar, is deputed as Jagraon SMO.Nodal officer of the Covid unit at the civil hospital, Dr Hitinder Kaur confirmed they had no ENT doctor at present. “We have informed the higher authorities in the health department about the staff requirement in the wake of rising black fungus cases,” said Dr Kaur.So far, the district has logged six deaths due to mucormycosis, of which five are from other districts. A total of 64 patients are undergoing treatment in different city hospitals. These include 26 from Ludhiana and 38 from other districts.Sources said in the absence of the specialist, patients were being referred to other hospitals.Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Field Gunj, complained that he brought his father, who had symptoms of black fungus, to the civil hospital as he had limited means. But, in the absence of an ENT doctor, he fears his father’s treatment will be lacking.Besides the fear of consequences of the fungal infection, the cost of treatment at private hospitals is another cause of worry for many.Tilak Raj, 68, a resident of Old City, said he had already spent extensively on his Covid treatment, and wished to get treated at the civil hospital after developing symptoms of black fungus. “But, there is no nasal specialist. So, my son took me to DMCH, which is resulting in more financial burden,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-solitary-civil-hospital-has-no-ent-specialist-for-black-fungus-cases-101622226265157.html
28-05-2021||Chandigarh||New mom reunited with infant son after 14-day battle with contagion||Surrounded by grim scenes for over a year now, especially amid the rising deaths during the pandemic’s second wave, doctors at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) got a reason to smile on Friday when a mother was reunited with her newborn after her two-week battle with Covid-19.A doctor herself, Monika, 41, was 32 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital with serious Covid symptoms on May 13, warranting the need for ventilator support. With her oxygen saturation level down to 80%, doctors were faced with a major challenge to save both the mother and the child, said Dr Rajesh Mahajan, professor of medicine at DMCH.“Complications meant a weeklong ICU stay. But, treating a pregnant woman with serious Covid symptoms is rife with challenges, as strong medicines cannot be administered at such a critical stage,” said Dr Kamakshi, anaesthetist at DMCH, who led the team of young doctors, comprising Dr Ujjwal, Dr Mehak, Dr Shubham, Dr Aman and Dr Karanjot, that treated the patient.A day after her hospital admission, doctors successfully performed a C-Section to save the child, said Dr Ashima Taneja, a gynaecologist. The team of doctors then strived hard to save the mother in the following days and heaved a sigh of relief on the 13th day when she mother finally recovered and was handed her newborn son. “I couldn’t have wanted anything else in life,” Monika gleamed. Equally elated were her family members who spent two weeks in grave tension. “On the one hand was this extreme joy of a new arrival in our family, on the other hand we were constantly praying for his mother’s recovery,” said a family member.Experts have observed an increase in pregnant women contracting the virus as the second wave raged on in the state. In the recent weeks, hundreds of women in their late 20s and 30s across Punjab have tested positive, and over a dozen have succumbed to the virus.Dr Bishav Mohan, a member of the panel of doctors of the Dr KK Talwar committee to manage Covid-19 in Punjab, said pregnant women should not ignore symptoms like cough, fever and body aches, as early diagnosis can save almost every life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-mom-reunited-with-infant-son-after-14-day-battle-with-contagion-101622225964629.html

The worker were seen entering the sewer without a body suit, exposing them to infections, health and safety hazards.Vijay Danav, chairman of the Municipal Karamchari Dal, said, “Sadly, manual scavenging is being carried out on the same road where DC Varinder Sharma lives. We condemn the practice and It should be stopped immediately.”Ashwani Sahota, president of Karamchari Dal, demanded that the workers should not be allowed to enter the sewer without wearing a bodysuit. “The sub-divisional officer (SDO) concerned should ensure that safai workers are wearing protective gear before entering the sewage,” he said.SDO of Zone D, Anshul Garcha, said he had asked the workers to clear the silt in the sewage ahead of the monsoons. He added that no employee was told to enter the manhole and he will look into the matter.One of the sanitation workers, pleading anonymity, said, “We are working on contract and on very low wages. If we raise our voice, we will be sacked and there is no one to address our grievances. We want to live our lives with dignity. We do not want to beg and that is the reason why we enter the sewer and risk our lives.”Another safai sewak said that the work is giving them problems in spending time with their families and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manual-scavenging-underway-a-stone-s-throw-from-ludhiana-dc-s-house-101622225605748.html

Since the pandemic broke out in March last year, at least 504 police personnel, including commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma, have already beaten coronavirus.But, three cops lost the battle to the contagion – assistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Anil Kumar Kohli, 52, ASI Jaspal Singh, 49, and ASI Sanjiv Kumar, 57. A homeguard jawan, Gurnam Singh, 55, who was deputed at the Meharban police station, also lost his life due to the pandemic.While the healthcare staff have been fighting to heal the sick, police personnel have been struggling to safeguard citizens against the deadly infection.From implementing the lockdown restrictions by appealing to residents to stay indoors to penalising the violators to deter the spread of infection, police personnel have been giving it their all, while even staying away from family members for their safety.Going the extra mile, they are also providing food to the needy patients in home isolation and even celebrated birthdays of people locked indoors due to the lockdown last year.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said police were working round the clock to ensure Covid norms were being followed, besides maintaining law and order, which had increased their workload and also exposed them to infection time and again.Vaccine hesitancy continuesCovered under the frontline workers category, police personnel have been eligible for vaccination since the drive was rolled out nationwide on January 16.But, the department has yet to achieve 100% vaccination. While 93.5% cops (4,303) of the 4,600-strong police force have received the first dose, only 52% (2,392) have come forward for the second jab.Agrawal said the department was holding special vaccination camps for the force and will achieve 100% coverage soon. Besides, considering the strains of the job, they were also taking care of their diet, and physical and mental health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana544-khaki-warriors-infected-in-line-of-duty-three-dead-so-far-101622225305738.html

Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu alleged that the MC’s joint commissioner planning Ghulam Hassan Mir, who is also the head of the task force against illegal constructions and deals with building permissions, was involved in corruption. “The indefinite hunger strike by 61 elected representatives of Srinagar should serve as an eye-opener. An inefficient and corrupt joint commissioner planning is patronising illegal constructions and is defaming the MC,” Mattu said.Mattu, who is also an Apni Party leader, had written to the government on Saturday seeking removal of Mir and his repatriation to his parent department housing and urban development department (HUDD).“Ordinary citizens are being harassed as they are not getting permissions. This has been going on for over a year,” Mattu said.“Many illegal constructions are mushrooming in Srinagar because people are not getting permissions. leaving people with no other option,” he said.

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||72% black fungus patients in Punjab got infection in sinus||The patients of mucormycosis, popularly known as black fungus, are being diagnosed at early stages in Punjab with the fungal infection in 72% of the patients found only in sinus (nose area), the state health department said. The infection spread to the eyes in at least 6 patients, resulting in vision-related disabilities, officials said. But no case of infection in a patient’s brain, lungs, jaws or teeth has been reported in the state so far.Mucormycosis, a rare but serious fungal infection, can disfigure a person even when it is not fatal. Health experts say that Covid patients who are not following the post- recovery medical instructions, especially pertaining to blood sugar levels and intake of medicines, are more prone to the infection. “Of the 222 black fungus cases detected in Punjab till now, 160 patients were diagnosed at early stage when only sinus gets infected. But if not treated, the infection can spread to eyes, lungs, jaws, teeth and sometimes brain. Experts doctors are monitoring these patients to contain the infection in their bodies,” said state nodal officer for black fungus Dr Gagandeep Singh, adding that the infection was severe in at least 6 patients as they had to undergo surgery after the fungus reached their eyes. “We do not know the clinical status of the patients who had undergone surgeries for orbit and no specific data was maintained for their partial or complete vision loss. The fungal infection may have spread in the bodies and may have damaged the organs of 25 patients who have died of the disease,” Dr Gagandeep said. On Thursday, a patient infected with Covid-19 and black fungus underwent surgery at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, as the infection had spread to the eye orbit, putting his vision at risk.“A team of doctors performed an advanced endoscopic procedure to preserve the eyes of the patient.

A high court bench monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the two states and the UT said the nodal committees will keep these reports in a sealed cover, which the court may examine at the appropriate stage. The high court bench also said that the rates for RAT and RT-PCR tests in both the states and UT should be uniform and asked Haryana and Chandigarh to consider bringing it down to Punjab level, which has fixed charges of ₹350 for RAT and ₹450 for the RT-PCR. The bench also exhorted Punjab and Haryana government to bring down HRCT (chest) rates to ₹1,800, as fixed by the UT. The court also observed that ICU control rooms be set up by hospitals for sharing information regarding the medical condition of a patient with the kith and kin.

On May 18, the state had told the court that in the first half of May, the case positivity rate was 16% and 9.98%, respectively. Nanda further told the court that an expert committee has examined the issue of black fungus and issued advisories. Besides, injectable drug amphotericin-B has been procured but is still short of the demand and the intervention of the Centre is required, Nanda told the court, adding that the Centre has also been requested for providing more ventilators, particularly for paediatric use. Reacting to various demands raised, additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain assured the court that needful will be done without any delay. He further assured that any demand from Chandigarh and of Haryana will also be considered forthwith and necessary steps will be taken.

According to the data, out of the 4,841 cases reported in both urban and rural regions in the 15-day period, 2,322 pertained to the said age group.However, the category accounted for merely 16% (76) of the total 468 deaths recorded till Thursday. Patients above the age of 46 made up for 83% (389) of the fatalities, three patients in the 15-25 group succumbed to the virus. All children below 14 years beat the virus.Venturing out, late jabs shot up caseloadWhen quizzed about the possible reasons for the high caseload among the 26-45 group, district epidemiologist Dr Sunil Hari observed that other than late vaccination, the said population remained mostly exposed to the virus due to employment reasons.“People of this age group could not remain confined to their homes due to employment and other work. Though the mortality rate in the said group is low as compared to the elderly group, the department’s analysis has shown that half of those who died due in the second Covid wave after March 1 were working in the private sector,” the doctor said.According to the civil surgeon, the active caseload dropped to 948 as 106 fresh infections and 165 recoveries were reported on Thursday. The death rate rose to 1.58% with five more fatalities on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/44-of-all-covid-patients-at-ambala-in-26-45-age-group-101622146203395.html

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||For the first time, petrol crosses ₹90 per litre mark in Chandigarh||For the first time ever, the price of petrol in Chandigarh crossed the ₹90 per litre mark, settling at ₹90.11 on Thursday. At 84.27 per litre, diesel also reached the highest-ever price as prices were hiked for the 14th time since the beginning of May after remaining constant in March and April. Before 2021, the highest that the petrol price had gone was ₹81 per litre. When May began, petrol was priced ₹87 per litre. Fuel rates also spiked in neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula. Prices are highest in Mohali, at ₹95.86 for petrol and ₹87.52 for diesel. In Panchkula, these are higher than Chandigarh, at ₹91.33 per litre for petrol and ₹85 per litre for diesel.The price hike is hitting the petrol pump dealers hard. Proprietor of Kapoor Service Station in Sector 21, Colonel HS Kapoor (retd) said the commission earned by petrol pump dealers was still the same, while the rising price was going to the government as tax. “Worse, due to the lockdown, our sales this month are unlikely to reach even 50% of what we made in February,” he complained.Even as fuel continues to become more expensive, the price of fruits and vegetables in the city continues to remain on the lower side. Explaining this, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, BL Sharma said, “As the lockdown was enforced, we barely got any work. Drivers are happy completing deliveries at previous fuel rates even if we don’t end up earning as much as we should. A sharp increase in prices can be expected once the lockdown is lifted and the industry resumes at normal pace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/for-the-first-time-petrol-crosses-90-per-litre-mark-in-chandigarh-101622145664079.html

On the other hand, the deaths’ graph has been fluctuating without any major downturn.The decreasing cases are coupled with the positivity rate also winding downwards, even though the number of tests has come down from over 3,600 at the beginning of the week to around 2,600 now.Positivity rate – the proportion of samples that test positive – is a true indicator of the spread of an infection, be it growth or decline.“Though the demand for testing is decreasing, the receding positivity rate is encouraging. It reached 7.5% on Thursday after a long interval, as it was hovering around 28% in early May. But, maintaining the testing level is our priority,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta.The city’s cumulative cases have reached 59,416. With more people getting cured, the active cases went down to 3,129 and recoveries rose to 55,558.Covid wards at GMCH to be cut downWith decreasing pandemic numbers, the pressure on hospitals is also easing out as reflected in Government Medical College and Hospital’s decision to close some Covid wards in a gradual manner.“No new Covid patient will be sent to the hospital in Sector 48 unless all beds in the Covid wards and ICUs at the GMCH-32 campus are full. The Sector-32 campus will also keep 10 beds on standby for emergencies,” said Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for Covid-19 management at GMCH-32. He added that this way, initially one wing in the next few days and then the whole hospital at Sector 48 may be closed down in the next two weeks.“The facility will remain ready if needed on a short notice. The period of lesser occupancy will be utilised to prepare for the possible third wave of Covid,” he added.Slight rise in cases in Mohali, PanchkulaWhile Chandigarh recorded a dip in cases, Mohali and Panchkula’s numbers saw slight uptick on Thursday.Against 268 a day ago, Mohali’s cases rose to 278 on Thursday, while Panchkula saw the cases increasing from 103 to 114.However, these were still much lower than their respective peaks of 1,382 and 654 on May 10 and May 5.In some respite, Mohali’s daily deaths dropped from seven the day before to four, the lowest since April 19, when an equal number of fatalities was recorded. The district’s total casualties have reached 910, while the case tally stands at 65,761.

Now, the owners will be able to use the entire building of SCF/SCO as a commercial unit on payment of regularisation charges, which have been fixed at ₹5,500 per sq yard. Certain conditions, such as ensuring availability of parking space, have also been laid out for those seeking regularisation.The policy, dated May 26, has been floated for the entire state and applications can be submitted till September 30.A large number of SCFs have been illegally converted into SCOs and commercial units in different parts of the city, including Sarabha Nagar main market, Bhadaur house, BRS Nagar and Kitchlu Nagar among other areas. In the past, several complaints have been received by authorities against such violations, with many cases even reaching the court. The fresh policy is expected to bring relief to such violators.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said a state-level meeting was held in April under the chairmanship of local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra wherein the government decided to provide relief to SCF owners. In Punjab four local bodies -- Ludhiana, Amritsar, SAS Nagar and Jalandhar—are being seen as high potential zones while the rest have been categorised a low-potential zones. The regularisation fee in high potential zones has been fixed at ₹5,500 per sq yard, while it is ₹4,000 in low potential zones.The owners, however, cannot make any changes to the architectural design of the building. If any additional floor has been constructed illegally in such buildings, it will be demolished. Besides, the owners will also have to submit a structure-safety certificate.

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mattewara Industrial Park: Punjab chief secy told to take steps to protect Sutlej floodplains||A five-judge bench of the National Green Tribunal has ordered the Punjab chief secretary to take remedial actions for protection of the floodplains of Sutlej river in Ludhiana, in coordination with the River Rejuvenation Committee. Four social activists from the city- Kapil Arora, Kuldeep Khaira, Mohit Jain and Gagnish Singh Khurana, had moved NGT against the proposed amendment to the master plan of Ludhiana for developing a modern industrial park in the forest area and floodplains of Sutlej river in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.The state government had proposed to establish an industrial park over around 960 acres of government and panchayat land at villages including Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan. The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) has already acquired the land.The activists rued that the proposed industrial park site is surrounded by protected forests from two sides and deemed forests as well as Satluj river towards the third i.e. rear side. Apart from damaging the forest and disturbing the wildlife, an industrial park will also damage the river.“Since most of the land which is to be developed as an industrial park comes under floodplains of Sutluj, we have submitted references of the district survey report prepared by the Ludhiana district mining officer with the NGT. The tribunal further stated that River Rejuvenation Committees has already been formed in the states and Sutlej is among the 351 polluted rivers for which an action plans have been made,” said Arora.What is a flood plain?A floodplain is an area of land adjacent to a river which stretches from the banks of its channel to the base of the enclosing valley walls and experiences flooding during periods of high discharge.Khaira stated that the Punjab government had marked active flood plains as no manufacturing zones within an area of one kilometre from Dhusi Bandh along the entire stretch of Satluj passing through Ludhiana. He added that in the last two decades, there have been frequent incidents of major breaches in embankments (Dhusi Bandh) at Mattewara village, Garhi Fazal and its surrounding areas.Khaira added that the gazette notification for amendment has not come till date, but the land has already been transferred in the name of GLADA. Accordingly, GLADA has fixed the rates of land per acre and invited expression of interests from industrialists.Kapil stated that the NGT had observed that protection of forests is covered by the statutory mandate of the Forest (conservation) Act, 1980 and no non-forest activity is allowed in forest areas without statutory clearances. There is no reason to presume that the said mandate will be ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mattewara-industrial-park-punjab-chief-secy-told-to-take-steps-to-protect-sutlej-floodplains-101622144462753.html

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||Gangster, accomplice shot dead in Patti||Two car-borne assailants shot dead a gangster and his accomplice in the border town of Patti in Tarn Taran district on Thursday morning, police said, adding that the third person accompanying them was injured in the firing.The deceased were identified as Amandeep Singh, alias Aman Fauji (28), who was also an Akali worker, and Prabhjit Singh, alias Pooran (27), while their accomplice Shamsher Singh, alias Shera (30) of Patti, was injured. All three were returning after paying obeisance at a peer dargah (saint’s tomb) when the assailants opened fire at them at Nadohar roundabout in Patti town at 6.45am, the police said. Fauji and Pooran died on the spot while Shera was rushed to a private hospital in Amritsar where his condition is stated to be stable, police said.Hours after the incident, a Facebook post from the account on one Ravi Dhaliwal, tagging 12 other users, including gangster Goli Kazikot, claimed that the killings were the handiwork of the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang. Bhagwanpuria is lodged in a jail. The victims were the supporters of the Bhagwan Kazikot gang, rival of the Goli Kazikot gang. Later, another FB post from Goli Kazikot’s account read that they don’t have anything to do with the killings. Another post from Preet Sekhon Amritsaria account read that Fauji was executed by their men, threatening that those against them will meet the same fate. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said they were analysing the Facebook posts claiming responsibilities for the killings. “Preet Sekhon is not linked to any gang but he is accused of killing a bouncer in Amritsar. Our teams are working to trace him,” the SSP said. He said Fauji was a gangster and had been facing five criminal cases, including two of attempt to murder. “As per our information, Fauji was also involved in drug smuggling. Similarly, Shera was facing a case under the NDPS Act, while Prabjit had no criminal background,” he said.The SSP said that a case was registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides Sections 25-54-59 of the Arms Act against unidentified persons at the Patti city police station.BoxFauji was party worker: SAD Later in the day, Shiromani Akali Dal leaders and workers along with the victims’ family members staged a protest in Patti city by keeping the bodies on the road. Former minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon’s political adviser Gurmukh Singh Ghulla said: “Fauji was our staunch worker. He was never convicted in any case. All the cases against him were politically motivated.” He alleged that Congress leader Harman Sekhon had been holding a grudge against Fauji. “He should be arrested and investigated. We doubt that the crime was executed at Harman’s behest,” alleged Gurmukh.Sekhon, who is the district president of the Youth Congress, was booked by Amritsar (rural) police for allegedly running liquor smuggling nexus in the Majha region of Punjab.The SSP said: “We will also probe Harman Sekhon’s role in the case. But, so far, we don’t have any evidence against him. Even the family members of the victims had not given their statements to the police despite our repeated requests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-accomplice-shot-dead-in-patti-101622144222623.html
