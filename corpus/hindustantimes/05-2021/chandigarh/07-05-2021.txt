In addition, many patients with other diseases continue to require oxygen.With the introduction of the facility of refilling oxygen cylinders at home, such patients will be benefited. This will curb black marketing of cylinders. He said application request can be made through the portal - http://oxygenhry.in/As soon as a patient registers on this portal, the application will be reflected in the NGO and the Red Cross Society. If any of them accepts the request, the information will be conveyed via a text message on mobile number of the applicant.The applicant will have to upload photo of the oxygen level in oximeter and aadhaar number while applying. In addition, it will be mandatory to write the age and address of the patient. An application can be made only once a day from a mobile number. This facility will start from May 9.Dr Agrawal directed officials to discuss with deputy commissioners for refilling cylinders and set a location. For this, he directed them to fix minimum price (if needed) at their level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oxygen-plants-should-be-handled-by-armed-forces-vij-101620411121692.html

The accused are Parkash Singh alias Pasi and Avinash Singh alias Kalsi.

The chief minister, who held a virtual meeting with the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs of the Congress from Punjab on the Covid situation, exhorted them to push the central government to increase the state’s oxygen quota and dispatch additional tankers on priority to enable lifting of the full allocated quota of 195MT on daily basis. “Punjab is being meted out a step-motherly treatment by the Centre in the matter of supplies needed urgently to battle Covid,” he claimed, adding, “BJP-ruled neigbouring Haryana has got a bigger oxygen quota and more tankers than Punjab”. The meeting was attended by all party MPs from the state except Ambika Soni who is unwell. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar was also present. Bajwa, others suggest complete lockdownAt the meeting, some MPs stressed the need for more stringent measures, including a total lockdown, to fight the second wave of the pandemic. “The suggestion was to consider it as several leading health experts have suggested a full lockdown to stop Covid spread. We understand the lockdown will mean lots of hardships on smaller shopkeepers, daily wagers, etc, but we cannot allow the virus to get out of control. If it can be controlled without lockdown, then there is nothing like it. We have to save lives first,” Bajwa, who along some other MPs advised the CM to consider this option, said after the meeting. On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also stated that the only way to stop the spread of Covid-19 infection now was a full lockdown. The state has imposed a “soft lockdown” unlike during the first wave when it was among the first states to impose a statewide curfew in March 2020. The MPs also urged the chief minister to approach the high court for enhancement of its oxygen quota, besides calling a meeting of the cabinet to make oxygen plant mandatory for private hospitals with 25 beds and government hospitals with 50 beds. They also urged the state government to again try and get permission from the central government for import of oxygen from Pakistan and take measures to ensure vaccination of Punjab farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders. The MPs promised to utilise their MPLAD funds to set up oxygen generation plants in government hospitals. Amarinder said the state was facing issues even on the ventilator front, since there was no BEL engineer to install 108 of the 809 ventilators received from the central government. On the vaccination front also, the MPs expressed concern over the low supplies and repeated delays from the Centre. The chief minister said the Centre’s apathy towards Punjab was also reflected in the fact that many other states had been given more vials of Tocilizumab. The state had sought 650 vials but was given only 200 in the initial stages, which were distributed to government and private hospitals, he added. Even Remdesivir continued to be in short supply, as delivery of the 50,000 vials allocated to the state was extremely slow, he said. The MPs expressed concern over the chief minister’s disclosure that genome sequence results had not been received for the past one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pressure-centre-for-timely-supplies-to-combat-covid-capt-to-party-mps-101620330234273.html

All these services would be free of cost, and the patients would be taken care by the doctors and staff of Sri Guru Ramdas University of Health Sciences,” she said. “The state government was aware about the second wave. The government could have made adequate arrangements, but nothing was done. Besides the paucity of oxygen in many hospitals, ventilators are not functioning,” said Kaur.She said the SGPC had ordered oxygen concentrators from Russia, but the consignment was stuck for customs clearance in Delhi for five days. “Such life-saving consignments should be cleared on priority,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/countrys-reputation-took-a-hit-due-to-covid-mismanagement-jagir-kaur-101620329574882.html

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Long wait for beds as Jammu’s Covid triage facility overwhelmed||Amid a surge in coronavirus cases, the government Chest Diseases Hospital, the first contact point and triage facility for Covid patients in Jammu, has started bursting at the seams. The hospital witnessed a heavy rush of the patients on Thursday. Patients with oxygen cylinders were seen sitting on hospital stairs, lying in the park, ambulances and stretchers. Ambulances with sirens and lights flashing could be seen converging on the hospital premises. However, patients and attendants had to wait for hours for their turn. “We have been waiting for over two hours now. I have brought my elder brother from Lalyana in Bishnah. The hospital staff told us that they have no beds and asked me to take him home. However, they did provide us with an oxygen cylinder,” said a youngster tending his ailing brother. A technicians of a 108 ambulance, swathed in personal protective equipment said, “The ambulances have brought patients to the hospital but they are not being admitted.” A woman technician of another 108 ambulance said, “The hospital should admit the patients quickly as we are getting an increasing number of calls.” Though doctors and paramedics are working round-the-clock, manpower shortage has also hit the functioning of the hospital, said an official, on condition of anonymity. The hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Rajeshwar Sharma said, “A large number of people had rushed to the hospital and many had to wait for their turn but within six hours, from 10am to 4 pm, we received 125 Covid positive patients, all of whom were examined. Forty CT scans were conducted. Some patients were sent to Covid care centres and 22 were hospitalised.” “Every patient was given an oxygen cylinder the moment they reached the hospital. Examining and treating 125 patients in six hours takes time. We have to examine each one of them and check their oxygen saturation level,” said Dr Sharma. “We have a triage area with sheds and chairs but the patients prefer to sit in parks instead,” Sharma said. Every CT scan takes 10 minutes and then we have to wait for the report. We conducted 40 CT scans today in four to five hours,” he said. CD hospital as 110 beds, of which 14 are ICU beds and they are all occupied.From May 1 to 6 at least 12 health employees of the CD Hospital have tested positive. The hospital has also commissioned its own oxygen plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/long-wait-for-beds-as-jammu-s-covid-triage-facility-overwhelmed-101620329454933.html

Other blocks of the under-construction compound of AIIMS can also be utilised to treat coronavirus patients,” said Singh.AIIMS has recently started a 40-bed facility, with 10 beds reserved for critical patients who need ventilators.The institute director said an internal audit conducted on Wednesday stated that construction activities undertaken by a hired agency have almost stopped due to shortage of workers.“The construction agency was conveyed that workers should be encouraged to drop travel plans to their native villages in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal as Covid is spreading at an alarming rate and the institute can take care of their health, but they have left work,” Singh added.Expressing concern over reluctance by a sizeable section of Punjab’s rural population towards vaccination and testing, Singh said religious leaders should motivate people.On Thursday, Bathinda reported 858 new Covid cases and nine deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-aiims-to-set-up-temporary-300-bed-covid-care-facility-101620329334920.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid second wave hit 60-74 age group worst in Himachal||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has been most fatal for senior citizens, who account for nearly 40% of the total deaths, in Himachal Pradesh. The health department data shows that as on May 4, a total of 1,647 people died of Covid-19 in the state since the pandemic broke out. Of them, 650 are in the age group of 60 to 74 years. This is 39% of the fatalities. The mean age of the Covid dead is 63 years. “There is high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Himachal Pradesh, which is one of the primary reasons why senior citizens succumb to the disease,” says Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital medicine department head Jitendera Mokta. Patients aged between 45 and 59 years were the second most vulnerable group with a total of 416 deaths reported till date. This age group constitutes about 25% of the state’s fatalities. The next affected section is those above 75 years. A total of 368 deaths have been reported in this age group. This is 22.34% of the Covid casualties. Similarly, 139 (8.4%) fatalities occurred among people aged between 30 and 44 years, while 20 (1.2%) victims were aged between 15 and 29 years and six (0.3%) were children. “The state government has urged the Union government to provide oxygen cylinders to the state. The health department is working on ways to reduce the delay in getting reports of Covid tests. We are trying to rope in the private laboratories in Himachal. The government has sanctioned ₹7 crore for setting up laboratories in Una and Kullu,” said health department spokesperson Dr Gopal Berry. Case fatality higher than national average The case fatality ratio has gone up to 1.5% in the state, which is higher than the national average of 1.1% and also one of the highest among states in the region. Berry said, “So far we have not been able to gauge the exact reason the increase in fatality rate,” adding that the CM has directed officers to bridge the gap between home isolation and hospitals as it has been felt that the fatality rate in the state was increasing due to delay in shifting of serious patients in home isolation to hospitals, which is matter of concern. The CM has also directed the health department to ensure a smooth supply chain of oxygen, PPE kits, medicines and other logistics during the curfew. Among the Covid-19 casualties, a total of 1,057 (64.1%) were male and 590 (35.9%) female. Co-morbidities were present in 1,062 (64.5%), while 585 (35.5%) were non co-morbid. A majority of co-morbidities include diabetes 532 (50%), hypertension 476 (44.8%), chronic kidney disease 113 (10.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 87 (8%). Recovery rate lower than national average The state’s recovery rate has been low as compared to the national and global average. Himachal Pradesh has a recovery rate of 78.1% as compared to 81.9% at the national level and 85.4% at the global level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-second-wave-hit-60-74-age-group-worst-in-himachal-101620329035154.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) observatory at Sector 39 recorded 14.2mm rain between 6pm and 8:30pm, which was accompanied by winds blowing at speeds up to 50 kilometre/hour.After a sunny start to the day, which saw maximum temperature reach 36.1°C, mercury fell to 22°C by 8:30pm. The IMD, Chandigarh, has predicted light rain on Friday as well, which is likely to be followed by cloudy weather on Saturday and another spell of light rain on Sunday. In the next three days, maximum temperature is expected to remain between 33 and 35 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 23 and 24 degrees.“A system of western disturbances had led to the showers and winds on Thursday. Light run up to 20mm is likely on Friday, while another spell is expected on Sunday. Gusty winds blowing at speeds up to 50km/hour along with thunder can also be expected,” said an IMD official, adding that another system of western disturbances is likely to affect the city around Tuesday as well.Meanwhile, the winds led to power outages in many parts of the city. While Sectors 35, 36 and 43 remained without electricity for up to three hours, power was restored at Sectors 27, 33 and 48 after a short outage, though many residents complained that the UT electricity officials were not picking up their calls. Many villages, including Dhanas, Raipur Khurd and Maloya, also remained without electricity for hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-gusty-winds-lash-chandigarh-more-to-follow-101620328075407.html

The announcement comes days after the afternoon Shatabdi Express between Chandigarh and New Delhi was suspended from May 1.The fresh move covers 13 pairs of trains that have been cancelled by the Northern Railways till further orders. The Una-New Delhi Jan Shatabdi Express, which passes through Chandigarh, and Hemkunt Express, which goes from Rishikesh to Katra via Chandigarh, have also be suspended. Even two Kalka-Shimla trains have been cancelled.“The decision has been taken due to low occupancy amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the region,” said Chandigarh railway station superintendent JP Singh. At present, occupancy in non-AC trains to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is still considerable, though it has dropped drastically in all other trains, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhdelhi-shatabdi-trains-suspended-from-may-9-101620327954098.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||PGI staff with high-risk exposure due to own laxity to go on casual leave||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has ordered that the quarantine period of healthcare workers, who are at high risk for exposure due to their own laxity in following Covid-19 norms, will be treated as casual leave. In the month of April, around 500 employees of the institute had tested positive, which makes it around 30% of the total employees found positive since the outbreak last year. Justifying the directive, the institute said that it is being observed that despite a huge surge in Covid-19 cases, some health workers do not observe Covid-appropriate behaviour and thus there should be some sort of deterrent so that precautions are observed while performing the duties. The PGIMER administration has brought it to the notice of employees that if someone falls under high-risk exposure due to “sharing of food” and “chatting during duty hours without a mask” or “not wearing proper personal protective equipment due to an unjustifiable reason”, his quarantine period will be treated as casual leave or leave of the kind due. The administration has also given powers to the supervisory officer and in-charge of the area to take necessary action while the department heads have been asked to bring the directive to the notice of every employee working under them. The directive has not gone well with different groups of workers who have been at the forefront of managing critical patients. “The order should be taken back immediately. If the administration is concerned about infection spread among health workers, they should revise the policy on breaks after Covid-19 duties. Earlier, we were being given seven-day breaks after being on Covid duty now we are getting just two. This new policy, which was implemented on April 1, has led to infection spread among employees,” said Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary of the Nurses Welfare Association. Meanwhile, the Resident Doctors Association has said that the order is unjustified and they hope that the order is not followed in letter and spirit. “Doctors are also humans. Sometimes, it may not be possible for them to take the required precautions, which makes this order unjustified. But at the same time, health workers should also follow the precautions wherever they can,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of PGIMER’s RDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgi-staff-with-high-risk-exposure-due-to-own-laxity-to-go-on-casual-leave-101620327714069.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid crisis exposes gaping holes in Chandigarh’s health policy||“The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war,” goes a proven military dictum. As Chandigarh struggles in its war against the Covid-19 pandemic, it is evident that the UT administration didn’t sweat out enough when it could.The pandemic has exposed gaping holes in the administration’s health policy and preparedness — from failure to ramp up health infrastructure to recruitment of enough manpower. Senior officials concede that the capacity of the UT’s health infrastructure didn’t expand in correlation with the increasing patient burden, and now during the pandemic it has been found to be severely wanting.“The central issue is unavailability of medical professionals. Recruitment of more than 150 doctors, against new and old posts, has been pending for several years, as Chandigarh awaits the Centre’s approval,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity. In fact, the new infrastructure created in the form of the Civil Hospital in Sector 48 had to be handed over to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, as the approval for creating 80 posts of doctor never came from the central government.Recently, after several hiccups and hanging fire for years, construction of the new emergency-cum-trauma centre started at GMCH. “But, in the absence of additional health care professionals, it is doubtful whether we will able to use these facilities adequately,” said the official.In fact, there are more than 200 sanctioned posts across all categories lying vacant at various government hospitals in Chandigarh.“This tells you that nobody wants to invest in health care,” said Dr RS Bedi, former president of Chandigarh Chapter of Indian Medical Association. “They have not recruited doctors in ages. Also, they are inclined only to employ them on contract basis. There is uncertainty of job; so people don’t want to join. They struggle even during the routine days because of pressure of patients.” Another instance where slow decision-making process is now impacting the city’s capacity to contain this unprecedented crisis is the upgrading of Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. The proposal to convert it to a medical college is pending for more than a year and a half. “Currently, there is very limited scope for expansion of medical infrastructure in the hospital. The proposed new branch in Sarangpur could have helped us during the pandemic,” said the official.Also, the proposal for allowing nursing homes in residential areas has been shuttling between sub-committees of the Administrator’s Advisory Council for years. Not only this, the pandemic has also exposed the lack of interstate coordination among the UT, Punjab and Haryana to devise common policies for the tricity. R Srinivas, town and country planner, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, said: “An interstate coordination committee was set up for the three administrations by the Centre in 1975. Its last meeting was held in 2016, but since then, it is dormant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-exposes-gaping-holes-in-chandigarh-s-health-policy-101620326513994.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh urges Centre to increase oxygen quota||With demand and supply of medical oxygen running “neck and neck” in Chandigarh, the administration has requested the central government to increase its daily quota by 15 metric ton. The Centre has allotted 20MT oxygen to Chandigarh, which is supplied from a plant in Solan and distributed among all government and private hospitals. The administration is also able to generate around 5MT oxygen at its newly developed plants.With a sudden jump in the number of active cases and the infection numbers not seeing any decline, officials fear the requirement might increase manifold in the coming days.“With the high court ordering provision of oxygen to patients in home isolation, we have to make arrangements for them too. In view of this, we have asked the Centre to enhance our daily quota from 20MT to 35MT,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida, while urging NGOs setting up mini Covid care centres to provide oxygen concentrators with each bed to reduce the demand. Officials claimed the UT is not even receive the allotted quota, and a gap of 4-5 MT is seen daily, which is being fulfilled through internal sources of hospitals.“We are almost running neck and neck in terms of demand and supply. If there is any lag in the supply, it can result in a crisis-like situation. Also, the requirement is expected to increase as more ICUs are coming up in hospitals,” said Yashpaul Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supply in Chandigarh. Status in neighbouring districtsIn Mohali, the daily oxygen demand is 27 MT, which is being met through multiple sources. Liquid medical oxygen tankers are arriving from Bokaro, Roorkee, Panipat, Uttarakhand and Solan, while two local companies are supplying oxygen cylinders to Mohali hospitals.Meanwhile, an oxygen plant is being set up at the civil hospital in Phase 6, which is expected to become operational in 15 to 20 days.In Panchkula, there is a demand for 11MT oxygen. While it is receiving 8MT liquid medical oxygen, the remaining 3MT is met through cylinders.On Thursday, an oxygen plant was made operational at the civil hospital in Sector 6, which will provide 24x7 supply to 30 beds. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said another plant with threefold capacity is also being set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-urges-centre-to-increase-oxygen-quota-101620326394064.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||All beds occupied at Mohali’s lone government Covid facility||A week after the Punjab health department declared the civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, not a single bed was available there on Thursday evening. While there is no ICU facility at this government hospital, the number of oxygen beds were upgraded from 60 to 120 recently. Filled to capacity, it was attending to 124 patients on Thursday.Meanwhile, all 336 ICU beds with ventilators were occupied at private hospitals in the district, and only 15 of the 565 oxygen beds were available.The second wave is witnessing more complications among patients, with a large proportion needing critical care or oxygen support. As many as 62 people have succumbed to the virus in just six days this month, while 159 died in April. The number of active cases stands at 8,910. There are around 30 big private hospitals in the district, which has emerged as a medical tourism hub, but all are finding it difficult to meet the surge as patients are pouring in from other parts of the region as well.While there are nine government facilities in the district, only the civil hospital in Phase 6 is attending to Covid-19 patients, and that too only those needing oxygen support. Critical cases are being referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, which too is saturated.  Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said: “All the beds are occupied in the civil hospital, but we are making arrangements in some other government hospitals. Meantime, the army is also coming up with a 100-bed hospital at the civil hospital campus.”Gurtej Singh, chairman of Ivy Healthcare Group, said: “Whatever beds we created for Covid patients have been occupied. However, we are striving hard to create additional capacity and are investing in requisite infrastructure depending upon the availability of oxygen.”Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said: “Though beds are occupied in most of the hospitals in the district, we are making arrangements for more beds for patients requiring oxygen and ventilator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-beds-occupied-at-mohali-s-lone-government-covid-facility-101620326153931.html
