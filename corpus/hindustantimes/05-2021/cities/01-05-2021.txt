They said they won’t be able to carry out the sale of medicine for long without assurance of medical care.Office bearers of the Lucknow Chemist Association (LCA), a body of wholesale and retail chemists in the city, demanded that the district administration ensure beds were available for medicine traders if they got infected with Covid-19 and needed hospitalisation.The association said traders were getting infected and deaths were being reported from among them and their family members.Harish Shah, president of LCA, wrote a letter to the district magistrate on the issue. A spokesperson Mayank Rastogi said medicine traders were at risk but they were not considered corona warriors.“Almost every day, news about death from among the traders or their family members is coming. That is the reason why we shall not be able to work for long without the support of the administration,” said Suresh Kumar of the association.New oxygen plantAn oxygen generating plant with the capacity 125 cylinders per day started at the Vivekananda Polyclinic that runs a 93-bed Covid facility. The hospital already had an oxygen plant with a capacity of 175 cylinders per day.

People above 45 years of age are being given free vaccine by the central government,” he added.On April 20, the Uttar Pradesh cabinet had decided on free Covid-19 vaccination for those above 18 years of age among the poor even in private hospitals in the state. The vaccination in government hospitals is already free. On Saturday, the chief minister also said the vaccine would be given to those above 18 years at 85 centres in seven districts for the next five days. Thereafter, the drive for those above 18 years will be launched in all the districts.The seven districts — Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, and Varanasi — have been chosen as they have a high active caseload.In Lucknow, 2,704 beneficiaries took the Covid vaccine on Saturday and about 500 people did not turn up despite registering for it.A total of 3,200 doses were arranged to start the drive in Lucknow where several enthusiastic youths reached vaccination centres as early as 9am.Among those who took the vaccine in the state capital, 1,641 were male and 1,063 female. Only those who had done the pre-registration were given the doses.“We vaccinated 255 beneficiaries between the age of 18 and 45,” said Dr SC Sundariyal, director of Civil Hospital.The other vaccination centres in Lucknow for the 18-plus age group included King George’s Medical University, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Sanjay Gandhi PGI, Lok Bandhu Raj Narain hospital, Rani Laxmibai Hospital, Jhalkaribai hospital, Avantibai hospital, Balrampur hospital and BRD hospital. Each vaccination centre was given 300 doses of Covaxin.Also, the vaccination drive for people above 45 years is being organised at 2,500 centers across the state.The chief minister said the state government was committed to zero wastage of the vaccines.“The scientists of our country have provided us with ‘swadeshi’ vaccine. The state government is procuring Covid vaccines directly from the manufacturers to give jabs to people above 18 years,” he added.The state government has decided to float global tenders to procure five crore vaccine doses and has already placed orders for one crore doses.“The vaccination drive will be expedited across the state to protect the people from infection. The health workers are doing exemplary work in giving jabs. People should respect the health workers and corona warriors. Teamwork will help UP in fighting the pandemic,” he said.Yogi called upon people to follow the Covid protocol — wear facemask and maintain social distancing after taking the jab.“It has been observed that recovery from infection is fast among people who have taken the vaccine dose. At the vaccination centre, protocol has been implemented at the waiting areas and observation areas set up for the beneficiaries,” he said.Earlier on Friday, the chief minister monitored the supply of doses to vaccination centres in seven districts.State plane brings vials from HyderabadOn his direction, the state plane was sent to Hyderabad to transport vials from Hyderabad- based Bharat Biotech International Limited that manufactures Covaxin. The vaccine doses were supplied to the vaccination centres in the seven districts, said a state government officer.“The seven districts where the vaccination drive was launched for beneficiaries above 18 years included Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, and Varanasi. Here, the active cases are high. Hence, we begin from these districts and more districts will get the benefit later,” said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad.In Varanasi, the vaccination of beneficiaries above 18 years against Covid-19, began at 17 centres.In Prayagraj, 2,410 individuals aged between 18 and 44 years were vaccinated against Covid-19 at 10 vaccinations centres in Prayagraj, on Saturday.District nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination RS Thakur said that 3,000 doses of Covaxin had been received by Prayagraj for the vaccination of individuals aged between 18 and 44.In Meerut, 2450 beneficiaries turned up at 10 vaccination booths to receive the jabs. The overall vaccination percentage was 81.4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-begins-giving-jabs-to-18-in-seven-districts-101619893615077.html
01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Rediscovering Chandigarh through social media||From pinning that inspiring image on Pinterest to sharing photographs on Instagram, ours is an age of visual content. Virtual platforms have made sharing such content with family, friends and designers significantly easier.Interwoven with the theme of design, social media has been presenting itself as an interesting phenomenon in Chandigarh. Hashtags and location tagging have proven instrumental in providing the youth a window to discover the architectural gems of the city.Earlier, architectural marvels such as the Le Corbusier Museum, Sector 19, were largely visited by the architectural community. However, the advent of social media has been a game changer, drawing people from all walks of life.Repository of ideasThis trend has created public awareness about design and its value in the individual’s experience of a space. Professionals such as architects and interior designers engage with this cyberspace phenomenon on a daily basis as well. Inspiration has come for many a designer through social media. A photographer’s still life work, for instance, may be the source of inspiration for designing an entire space. Also, social media widens our cognisance of interesting new building material and spatial accents that are being created across India and the world, helping us offer multiple options to our clients. The multitudinous nature of these options extends to Chandigarh’s cultural milieu. Instagrammable places such as the new underpass connecting the Rose Garden and Sector 17 have become spaces of brimming activity. The quest for posting novel pictures on social media has led people to the city’s many hideouts. The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is one such place. Cycling groups, brought together by Facebook, have also been touring the nooks and corners of the city.Boost to tourismMarketing in the age of social media has been greatly exploited by some designers. In an era where perception rules the roost, virtual presence is a means to create that perception. This potential can be exploited by the Chandigarh administration, which should use the space to proactively market the city’s uniqueness and boost tourism.Another feather to social media’s proverbial hat is bringing people together.Chandigarh’s architect Le Corbusier had based the city’s design on the neighbourhood unit concept leading to the birth of sectors. Nevertheless, the community living that Chandigarh was designed for saw a delayed inception. The 2020 lockdown largely confined people to their sectors. Subsequently, WhatsApp groups of sector residents were formed to assist each other. Thus, knitting the city’s residents together in this hour of crisis.Data overload: The flip side Data overload is the other side of the coin. The deluge of fake news on social media can be confusing and sifting through narratives and counter narratives is a constant struggle, as is choosing a concept for one’s architectural space. Being spoilt for choice has confused many an architect and interior designer’s clients. Attractive shots are presented online after intense spatial styling and picture editing. Just like the unreal beauty standards seen in air-brushed photographs, which are the source of a variety of body image issues, the heavily edited architecture and interior design images create utopian visions in the minds of clients. When the actual space is created, it appears to be different from the mirage created by these online images, leaving clients disgruntled.A bespoke space is what clients want. That is what makes them embark on this virtual image search journey in the first place. And that is what should be responsibly delivered by designers and other project associates. However, a side note of truth should be served as well. Bagging projects on the basis of false promises of delivering a precise rendition of these images is unethical.Social media dilemmaThe potential of social media can be used to vivify life in Chandigarh. The city’s repute as one of the best experiments in urban planning and modern architecture can be built upon.Not only would this serve in increasing the intracity people-to-people connection but also help in promoting tourism. The architectural community has been an asset here and social media the catalyst. In the field of design, social media is both a boon and a bane. You may like how it facilitates vision creation or dislike how it distorts visions. Whatever your stance, social media is here to stay. The trick to resolving this ‘social media dilemma’ lies in using it as a tool to create, curate and connect.( The writer is a Chandigarh-based architect)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-rediscovering-chandigarh-through-social-media-101619892895138.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Emergency parole can’t be counted as part of sentence of convict: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by a murder convict seeking direction to the state government to count his Covid emergency parole leave as part of his sentence while considering his case for premature release.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale dismissed the petition filed by Inden aka Mohiddin Sayyed Ali Shaikh, holding that in view of Rule 20 of the Prison (Bombay Parole and Furlough) Rules, 2020 parole leave cannot be counted as sentence undergone by a convict.Shaikh had moved the HC in December 2020 to include his parole leave in the sentence undergone by him. He was arrested on murder charges on November 8, 2002 and was subsequently convicted for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. HC has since dismissed his appeal against conviction in 2011 and confined his life term.On February 22, 2018, the home department decided Shaikh’s plea for premature release, declaring that the Ambernath resident will have to undergo total imprisonment of 26 years, including remission.It was submitted before HC on his behalf that Shaikh would have completed the 26-year term in November 2020, but he was released on emergency Covid parole leave in May 10, 2020 and what remains now was a meagre term of five months. He therefore urged the HC to direct the authorities to include his emergency parole leave in the sentence undergone by him.Jail authorities opposed his plea contending that Rule 20 of the Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 2020 states that parole is not an incentive, and thus shall not be counted towards remission of the sentence.Besides, jail authorities also pointed out that after being released from jail in May 2020, Shaikh has joined a political party, creating tense atmosphere in Ambernath in view of ensuing civic elections. Besides, they claimed, Shaikh had failed to abide by a parole leave condition to report to local police station once a month.HC accepted the contention based on Rule 20 and dismissed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/emergency-parole-can-t-be-counted-as-part-of-sentence-of-convict-bombay-hc-101619892834527.html

The private bus operators were allowed to flout the time table, and also permitted to park for extra time at bus counters so that they could get more passengers. Senior superintendent of police (vigilance-Amritsar range) Parampal Singh said, “We had a tip-off that some officials were defrauding the state government by facilitating unauthorised movement of private buses across the state.”He added, “After monitoring activities of suspicious employees, the department arrested general manager Arvind Sharma, inspector Iqbal Singh, sub-inspector, Rana Gurwinder Singh Uppal and conductor Sukhchain Singh. They have been booked under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.”The SSP added that they had also booked deputy director state transport Parneet Singh; station supervisor Satnam Singh; inspectors Tarsem Singh, Jasbir Singh and inspector (retd) Punjab Roadways Raj Kumar Raju, but all of them were absconding.“Our investigation shows that Uppal, who was a member of central flying squad that checked violations by private buses, was taking money from bus stand in-charges, drivers and conductors of Punjab Roadways. This staff gave favours to private bus operators. Uppal acted as the middle-man between lower-rung employees and senior staffers. We have found that such malpractice is prevalent across the state.”He claimed that the vigilance had issued strict warning to officials of the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-roadways-batala-gm-among-four-staffers-held-for-graft-101619892781207.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: More takers for 5-year law course, despite delayed admissions||Admissions to law colleges in the state ended in the last week of April and surprisingly, five-year law courses have witnessed a dip in seat vacancies this year. Information shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell showed how 6,864 of the total 10,440 available seats in state law colleges for the five-year LLB were taken this year (only 34.25% seats vacant), much better than the past few years when the seat vacancy stood between 48% to 60%.“Every year after admissions end, we [law colleges] witness a lot of shuffling among students who end up withdrawing admission from one institute and applying to another. This year since the entire process was delayed and extended over a period of two and a half months, students are not withdrawing admissions and this could’ve resulted in more admissions,” said the principal of a suburban law college.Nearly 16,200 students had appeared for the state entrance exam for the five-year law course in October 2020. Admissions to most professional courses, however, were delayed this year and law was the worst affected. Admissions that started only in January 2020 were marred by several errors, eventually extending the admissions process till April this year. While there is excitement among stakeholders to witness increase in admissions at law colleges, many feel the number is still very low compared to the registrations received this year.“If 16,000 students cleared the law entrance exam, how can only 6,800 confirm seats? Obviously, the delay in admissions pushed more students to opt for seats in neighbouring states where admissions were conducted without much delay,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the Student Law Council. He added that the state’s decision to keep extending law admissions dates has cost several aspirants their future.Last month, state minister for higher and technical education, Uday Samant, called for additional admission rounds for the three-year law course where over 767 seats remained vacant after online and offline admission rounds. These additional rounds were conducted by the state CET cell between April 23 and 29, but the final data on vacant seats in the three-year law course has not yet been made available by the admissions body.Despite verbal assurances by Samant, giving first-year law students and colleges extra time to complete their curriculum for the current academic year, students are worried if colleges will manage to complete the curriculum, even with extra time. “Instead of nine-10 months that colleges usually get to complete the entire year’s portion, our batch will get four or five months, if we are lucky. We are fearing the exams because in most cases, colleges have only now started online lectures for the first-year batch,” said Ashutosh Sairam, a first-year LLB (five years) student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-more-takers-for-5-year-law-course-despite-delayed-admissions-101619892775170.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||PhD applicants double at University of Mumbai; experts raise doubts over capacity||Nikesh Patil, 31, completed his masters in political science in 2018 and was all set to appear for the preliminary eligibility test (PET) in May 2020, but had to delay his plans by a year as the world was grappling with Covid-19. This year, he is one of the 11,000-odd candidates who appeared for the PET exam conducted by University of Mumbai (MU) for Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and has managed to successfully clear the exam as well.“Now that I’ve cleared the exam, I’m unsure if I’ll manage to pursue my PhD this year itself because most guides at the university are already managing a few students and cannot possibly take up more candidates,” said Patil, who now plans to continue working as a visiting faculty at various city colleges for another year before applying for PhD next year. The university considers PET results valid for three years, making it possible for people like Patil to pursue their dreams next or the year after that as well.Before 2021, MU had managed to hold its last PET exam in December 2018, and the number of applications made headlines with an almost 85% rise in PhD applicants. From 3,350 and 3,333 in 2016 and 2017 respectively, the varsity received 6,168 applications in 2018, which included maximum applications for the science and technology stream, followed by humanities and then the commerce and management stream.After not being able to hold the exam due to various reasons in 2019 and due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, MU was expecting an even bigger turnout for the entrance exam this year. “In 2018 itself we witnessed a rise in applications because the exam was held after a break of almost 16 months. This year, PET was held after over two years, so we were not surprised to receive 11,351 applications for PhD alone,” said a senior official from the MPhil and PhD department of the university.The varsity had originally planned to conduct PET in May 2020, for which registrations took place between February 27 and March 31 last year, but due to the national lockdown, MU could not conduct the exam. This year, registration began in January and was extended till March in order to accommodate students who cleared their postgraduate programmes in December 2020. The entrance exam was held between March 25 and 27.“The number of applications is almost double because applicants from last year and this year have applied together. We were also very happy to see that almost 55% of the applications were from female candidates,” said the MU official.Experts, however, feel that the rise in PhD applications will not materialise into rise in number of research scholars, due to the lack of appropriate number of guides across various departments of the varsity. At present, officials have confirmed that MU boasts of around 1,500 professors, associate professors as well as assistant professors who can work as guides with PhD as well as MPhil students. However, these guides are already working with enough number of students at present, making it impossible for them to mentor anymore.“This year, maximum applications have come for the chemistry department, where our teachers are already clearing a backlog of previous years’ research candidates. A professor is not allowed to mentor more than eight candidates at a time, and in our department, most professors are already working to the maximum capacity,” said an associate professor from the department of chemistry. She added that many students who could’ve cleared their PhD by now were delayed last year due to the lockdown that left them unable to continue field work or research to complete their thesis.To make matters worse, the university has, this year, decided to extend the validity of the December 2018 PET exam candidates by another year to December 2022. “This means that apart from the 4,304 candidates who cleared the exam this year, we will also see more students from the 2018 batch who could not pursue their research projects last year due to the lockdown. The varsity is not equipped with enough staff to mentor so many students,” added the associate professor.In 2020-21, the total number of PhD and MPhil degrees awarded at the annual convocation ceremony dropped by over 63% compared to 2019-20. Many blamed the lockdown for the small number of doctorates awarded by the varsity this year. Not only was the university and its various departments under complete shutdown for the first few months of the lockdown, candidates highlighted several other issues including lack of proper e-learning resources, unavailability of remote access to science labs and/or libraries, poor internet facility, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phd-applicants-double-at-university-of-mumbai-experts-raise-doubts-over-capacity-101619892714525.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 68 cops died of Covid in April, second highest in a month||April 2021 has turned out to be the second deadliest month of Covid-19 pandemic for the Maharashtra Police, as the force lost 68 personnel to the infection. The police force saw the highest of 89 Covid deaths in September 2020, followed by 55 deaths in August. This year January, February and March together saw a total of 36 fatalities. The second wave of Covid-19 has led to more fatalities in the police department, despite nearly 85% of its personnel having received the first dose of vaccine and 50% having received both the doses. Last month, the police force recorded more than 6,000 new cases of Covid-19. In the past 24 hours, 165 new cases, including 25 officers and 140 constables, were reported.Cities where the police force saw maximum fatalities are Mumbai with 109 deaths, Thane (35), Pune (17), Nagpur (21), Navi Mumbai (12) and Nashik (11).So far, a total of 40,948 police personnel contracted the virus, of whom 422 (35 officers and 387 constables) have died since April 2020. Currently, there are 3,811 active cases. Around 36,715 police personnel have recovered, while around 11,129 are quarantined.Additional director general of police (administration) Sanjeev Singhal said it was unfortunate that 68 policemen lost their lives, but the fatality rate of police is less compared to the general public. The peak could be attributed to overall second wave, he said.“To bring effective check on this, we are aggressively pursuing vaccination of police personnel and have instructed all unit commanders to ensure strict adoption of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Singhal said.According to Mumbai Police spokesperson deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Chaitanya Siriprolu, a total of 8,605 police personnel tested positive for Covid-19 in the city. Of them, 109 succumbed to the infectious disease. Currently, there are 453 patients in the force who are undergoing treatment at various facilities. The city police force also expedited the vaccination drive for its personnel. The Mumbai Police has a strength of around 45,000 personnel, of whom 33,691 have received the first vaccine dose, while 21,915 have got both the doses. “Compared to the November-February period, daily cases of infection among police personnel in March and April have gone up. But due to vaccination, the number of serious patients is low,” said a senior officer from Mumbai Police.In the view of surge in Covid-19 cases, Mumbai Police also opened its dedicated Covid care centre at Kalina with a capacity of 720 beds. The other three Covid centres may also be reopened if need arises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-68-cops-died-of-covid-in-april-second-highest-in-a-month-101619892654014.html

Such analysis would help in pandemic management. “In view of the Covid peak, experts all over the country have been coming up with analysis. Coordinate with IIT-K for district-wise rigorous analysis of UP,” he said while reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state. Explaining the chief minister’s directive, a senior state government official said that various experts had been doing analysis using technology and mathematics to indicate how and when the Covid infection or recovery graph would rise and fall. The IIT-K already has been doing such analysis and has made them public. It would do more as and when the state government asked it to do so. Professor Abhay Karandikar, director of IIT-K, said: “This is a part of a national super model where along with leading experts, doctors, and IIT-K Prof Manindra Agrawal have been working on predicting the peak. The prediction of peak done district wise has shown remarkable fit with observed data and hence reliable estimates can be done. This will help plan the medical emergencies. However, this is just a model and we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.” The chief minister also asked officials to ensure adherence to Covid-19 norms during the counting of panchayat election votes on Sunday. “Make all arrangements for smooth and Covid-safe counting process. Ensure that all the counting centres have rapid antigen test (for quick testing of Covid) right outside the centres. The health department must make all related arrangements for this,” he said. “The counting process must happen following all Covid safety protocols. Appoint a separate senior police officer for each of the districts with regard to the counting of votes for the panchayat polls,” he said. Yogi said the state was now also getting oxygen from Jamnagar (Gujarat), Durgapur and Barjora (West Bengal) and Rourkela (Odisha) to augment supply. Create a manpower bank Retired doctors, retired army personnel, experienced paramedics, and final year students of medical and paramedical courses should be engaged as there would be the need for trained human resource in hospitals in view of the fast-changing scenario, he said. “It would be better if we have a manpower bank in the state so that we can deploy people as and when they are needed,” he said. He asked the medical education minister to work on the idea. In the last 24 hours, the number of recoveries (38,826) was higher than the number of fresh Covid-19 cases (30,317), the chief minister said. He also said that the state 2,66,326 conducted tests of which nearly half were RT-PCR tests in the past 24 hours. Medical help for pregnant women The chief minister also asked for creating a system for ensuring medical attention to pregnant women in the state. They should get ambulance and medical help immediately when required, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/get-iit-k-to-analyse-covid-curve-in-all-up-districts-yogi-101619892593913.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal place of sensitive origins: Maharashtra govt||In a bid to curb transmission of Covid-19 and to stop the “influx of other variants of coronavirus” from other states, Maharashtra on Saturday declared Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal as the places of “sensitive origin”.It means the travellers coming from these two states will have to carry negative RT-PCR tests within 48 hours of their train travel. They will also have to go through a mandatory 15 day home quarantine even if they are carrying a negative report. The order was issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Saturday.Last month, the state had declared Kerala, Goa, Gujarat, Delhi and NCR region, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand as places of “sensitive origin”.The decision has been taken to curb the transmission of coronavirus in the state and also to stop the influx of other Covid-19 virus variants into the state from other locations, stated the order.“These places will be considered the places of ‘Sensitive Origin’ from the date of this order till the time it is retracted or till Covid-19 stays notified as a disaster,” it added.The passengers who are not carrying the RT-PCR negative report will have to undergo a rapid antigen test at the station. All the passengers without symptoms and without needing to be moved to quarantine centres by district management authority, without fail shall be stamped on their hands for compulsory home quarantine for 15 days. This is required for those passengers who are carrying the negative RT-PCR test as well as those who have tested negative in a rapid antigen test at the station or otherwise, said the standard operating procedure for the place of sensitive origins.Meanwhile, the state government clarified that shops selling meat, fish as well as mangoes will be allowed all seven days but they can be opened between 7am to 11am, according to a clarification issued by Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.However, all these shops can send home delivery for customers after 11am personally or through e-commercial services. There are no restrictions on cargo movements, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uttar-pradesh-and-west-bengal-place-of-sensitive-origins-maharashtra-govt-101619892473901.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid second wave: April accounted for 39% of Maharashtra’s cases, 20.58% of deaths||The second wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra has been massive with nearly 39% (38.88%) of the state’s total cases and 20.58% of its fatalities coming in April alone. Mumbai too saw a huge spike in its tally as it recorded 36% of its total cases and nearly 11% (10.93%) of its deaths in April alone.Maharashtra, on Saturday, reported 63,282 fresh cases and 802 fatalities, taking the total tally and death toll to 4,665,754 and 69,615. The state’s active case count stood at 663,758. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 3,897 new cases and 90 fatalities.Last month alone Maharashtra recorded 1.78 million (1,789,492) cases and 14,164 deaths.While Mumbai added 233,698 cases and 1,435 deaths in April, the number of cases is significantly higher from September 2020 when Maharashtra peaked its first wave. In the first wave, Maharashtra saw its peak on September 11 with 24,886 cases. The state added 591,905 and 12,079 deaths in September alone. The cases added in September were 42% of the total cases then. The deaths reported in September was nearly 33% (32.94%) of the total deaths. The state had tested 2,646,276 in September and a positivity rate of 22.36%In the previous wave, Mumbai had recorded 59,463 cases in September which were 29% of the city’s total cases then. It reported 1271 deaths in September, which was 14.23% of the city’s total fatalities then.The high numbers have also resulted due to ramped-up testing, including RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests. In April, the state tested 7,314,139 samples and had a positivity rate of 24.46%.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid task force said, “The second wave has hit Maharashtra massively. It was predicted in October-November last year. The second wave was always anticipated to be ferocious and more lethal. However, the upside was that the positivity rate was under control even though the sheer number was high.”Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed authorities in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad to become self-sufficient with regards to oxygen availability. Thackeray, during a meeting with officials from these municipal corporations, said that authorities must keep the health infrastructure ready to treat children, as it is suspected that the third wave could hit children. Thackeray, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office, said, “The first wave saw many senior citizens and people with comorbidities getting affected. In the second wave, people between the age of 30 and 50 were affected more, along with several cases of children contracting the virus. This could increase further in the possible third wave, therefore we need to prepare and plan. Hospitals should have treatment facilities for children.”The chief minister also said that a separate control room should be set up to ensure that patients with mild symptoms that isolated at their homes are admitted to the hospital at the right time to save their lives. He said that the responsibility of keeping in contact with such patients should be given to experienced and retired doctors. The decision was taken after it was observed the condition of people with mild symptoms suddenly grew critical.The cases are now declining in urban areas, while semi-urban and rural areas are stabilising. The deaths, however, are still high with the state adding over 800 fatalities for the past three days. Thackeray cautioned the corporations in Mumbai, MMR, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad and said, “Currently, many municipal corporations are seeing the daily figures stabilising, but the threat has not passed yet. Looking at the possibility of a third wave, we must make all corporations self-sufficient in terms of medical oxygen supply. They should not depend on others for oxygen in any situation. They should ensure that there is enough stock of drugs and ventilators.” Thackeray also asked corporations to be prepared for monsoon-related ailments. He said that immediate treatment should be given to patients coming in with monsoon-related ailments including fever, cholera, jaundice, leptospirosis, dengue etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-second-wave-april-accounted-for-39-of-maharashtra-s-cases-20-58-of-deaths-101619892293964.html

As we mark the 400th Parkash Gurpurb, the union government should meet all demands of farmers. This will ensure they return home safely, as the covid-19 pandemic has taken a turn for the worse,” said the jathedar. He was addressing a gathering at a function at the Gurdwara Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in the Golden Temple complex. Even as a lockdown is in force across Punjab, devotees thronged the gurdwara in numbers, with most not wearing masks. There was no social distancing. Kar Sewa organisations and Damdami Taksal had made special langar arrangements.When queried on the large gathering of devotees at the function, he said, “When love with the Guru outdoes fear of covid-19, we cannot stop devotees from gathering in gurdwaras. Everyone should take precautions, while paying obeisance. Getting frightened by the disease is not the right approach.” Taking on the Union government on the issue of oxygen shortage, he said, “If people are dying of covid-19 amid oxygen shortage, the Centre is responsible for it.”Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur said a documentary depicting the journey of the ninth Guru from his birth to martyrdom will be commissioned. “Biographies of contemporary pupils of the guru will also be circulated through documentaries. The bani (hymns) of the guru will be translated into five other languages,” she said.“A chair will be set up in the name of Guru Tegh Bahadur at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib. Houses would be set up in the name of Sikhs associated with him, and research will be done,” she added. SGPC held another function at the guru’s birthplace Gurdwara Guru Ke Mehal, where the bhog ceremony of the Akhand Path concluded early in the morning. Sikh religious personalities and preachers addressed the gathering, after which a gurbani kirtan was performed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/400th-birth-anniversary-of-9th-sikh-guru-accept-farmers-demands-to-mark-historic-day-akal-takht-to-centre-101619892114494.html

On average 800,000 passengers are travelling daily by local trains on the Central and Western Railway lines.Nearly 500,000 passengers travel by local trains on Central Railway (CR) and 300,000 passengers travel by local trains on the Western Railway (WR) currently.Before the lockdown, 3.8 million passengers travelled by local trains on the Central and Western Railway, while two million travelled by trains on the CR and 1.8 million travelled by trains on the WR.“We are not allowing any unauthorised passenger to enter the station premises. There are limited entry and exit points to the railway stations and strict checking of identity cards and medical documents of passengers are being done at the entrance of the railway stations.” said a senior railway official.The Maharashtra government under its BreakTheChain measure to curb the spread of coronavirus did not suspend public transport services but has implemented restrictions including not allowing the general public to travel by local trains.Only the citizens working in essential services, travelling for medical purposes and people travelling to and from vaccination centres are permitted to commute by the local trains.Autorickshaws are allowed to have two passengers only, excluding the driver; taxis are allowed to operate with 50% of vehicle capacity, while Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are not allowed to ferry any standees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-impact-only-8-lakh-passengers-travel-by-mumbai-locals-101619891993854.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Good Samaritans help weather the coronavirus storm||On May 6, 2020, as the first wave of Covid-19 hit Mumbai, Tabassum Dhorajiwala , 39, lost her husband, Ahmed. A positive Covid test report – no hospital admitted him without it – took too long to arrive due to the same backlog that Mumbai faces even now, and in the meantime, his condition deteriorated. Dhorajiwala was devastated, but of this loss, a resolve was born. “The struggle to find the right resources at the right time eventually cost me my husband’s life, so that very day I decided to help whomever I can with resources,” said Dhorajiwala, a resident of Mohammad Ali Road. On May 24 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a national lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. What followed was one of the world’s longest (68 days) and strictest lockdowns (even road transportation was not allowed in its initial phases) that epidemiologists largely agree went a long way to arrest the spread of the pandemic on the lockdown. However, millions of migrant workers were affected in Mumbai and other urban centres; many returned to their hometowns in northern India, as they lost earnings and homes. This year, as cases began to spike in Maharashtra – between 18-31 March, the state drove 60% of them - the city began to run short of oxygen and beds. Social media was replete with pleas of people seeking beds, as the city ran out of critical infrastructure.When Rajesh P (name changed) needed help with admission to a hospital and oxygen, a local volunteer group - Choti Si Asha group put together a list of doctor contacts from hospitals across South Mumbai. “The aim was to get in touch with a doctor whenever we need help. After my husband passed away, I stayed in touch with these doctors and now, whenever people need help with hospital beds or oxygen, we reach out to these doctors and other officials and find out how we can help those in need,” she said.In May last year, Dhorajiwala started working with Choti Si Asha to distribute ration kits to people in need. They called it NESH, or No one ever sleeps hungry and it catered to people across Mumbai whose income source had dried up due to the lockdown. Between May and July, the group distributed as many as 80,000 packages. This year, she is volunteering to find oxygen tanks for those affected with Covid-19.Ronita Ghosh, 40, moved to Pune in August last year and started a customised catering service called Jikoni Foods. In the past 10 days, Ghosh’s kitchen has been busy preparing khichdi to distribute to frontline workers, patients and relatives outside Sassoon General Hospital. Up at 7am, Ghosh soaks anywhere between 10 to 12 kilos of rice and lentils, cleans and cuts vegetables, assisted by a team of three staff members. By noon, 500 boxes of khichdi are ready. Around 20 volunteers, whom Ghosh met through social media, help with packing and delivering the food. What started as a small initiative with 50 boxes has now grown into a reliable food service network for those sitting in the waiting rooms of the hospital hopeful to get their relatives admitted. “The packets are for anyone hungry,” said Ghosh, who is now known as “dabba didi” by those at the hospital. All of her food boxes are biodegradable, and spices and rotis procured from home entrepreneurs. Social media has emerged as an important network for spreading information about available resources for those in need of testing facilities, or hospitals where beds, ventilators and oxygen supply are still available. A host of volunteers are helping people with the right leads. One among them is Shatakshi, a 20-year-old student from the Mithibai College in Vile Parle who only goes by one name, who is verifying leads and passing on information to people over social media platforms, Twitter and Instagram. When her grandmother was ill and needed immediate hospitalisation, the family couldn’t find a bed as the hospitals in Bihar, her home state, were full. The leads available on social media were too confusing and the family did not have the time to verify these leads. On April 15, Satakshi’s grandmother passed away. Satakshi and a group of friends from her college wanted to ensure that others wouldn’t have to go through the same thing. “I came up with this idea after I couldn’t do anything for my grandmother and we lost her. My friend and I call up hospitals in Mumbai, Gujarat, Bihar daily and prepare data in an excel sheet and upload it on our Twitter and Instagram accounts,” she said. “If I have verified it personally, then I upload the tweet mentioning my name and time and date of verification for people’s ease along with #SoS tag,” she said. Social media has also helped fund Ghosh’s khichdi dabba initiative: her customers send amounts ranging from ₹100 to ₹1,000 which she uses to buy raw materials for the food and eco-friendly packaging material. “I intend to continue this meal service to those at Sassoon Hospital even after the pandemic,” she said. Not everyone is on social media, but that hasn’t stopped them from helping out. When a close friend residing in the same residential complex tested positive for Covid-19 and struggled to manage the cooking all by themselves, Hemant Shah got together with his family and started a tiffin service for the neighbour. Now, they’re catering to 6 to 10 families in their locality of Goregaon west. The banking professional from Goregaon, his wife and daughter-in-law Krishna, deliver home-cooked food to people till 7.30pm every day. The meal includes chapatti, a vegetable, dal, rice, salad and buttermilk. Shah’s driver uses the family car to make deliveries and the Shahs don’t take any money for it. “As of now less traffic allows faster delivery, hence we can deliver the food in 10 minutes,” he said. Their volunteer efforts have spread through word of mouth, and the Shahs often get calls or texts seeking their help.As the pandemic takes a toll on the mental health of people, professionals are offering free counselling services online. A group of research scholars with a background in psychology, social work and medicine is one such volunteering initiative. Sanket Shirsat, an alumnus of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, who is currently pursuing a PhD from the Department of Social Work, Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi, launched a campaign last Saturday to provide free counselling services in vernacular languages such as Gujarati, Malayalam, Hindi and Marathi. “We’re living in a time of uncertainty, and many people are feeling stressed, anxious and panicked. We’ve received close to 20 calls so far. There’s distress over workload, anxiety over the new virus strain, people laid off from work are depressed. The pandemic has posed a variety of triggers; people unable to switch to new jobs; some are stuck in abusive households. We listen to people and help them develop coping mechanisms,” said Shirsat, founding member of the Affirmative Actions for Inclusive Foundation, which he started with PhD colleagues from various institutes. The Foundation was set up last August when Shirsat and his colleagues distributed dry ration, protective gear, food and clothes in many villages of Maharashtra. Even as this work continues, the foundation has brought together around 30 students (all from psychology and social work courses) from across the country to offer the free counselling service. Contact details have been shared on all social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-good-samaritans-help-weather-the-coronavirus-storm-101619891933920.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Set up national committee under SC to tackle Covid crisis, says Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena on Saturday said that the Supreme Court (SC) must immediately form a national-level committee to tackle the Covid-19 management and distribution of vaccines. Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut said that time has come to keep politics aside and handle the second wave that has gripped the country, if not then the “country will be ruled by corpses”. In the suo moto proceedings on the Covid-19 crisis, SC on Friday had asked the Centre about its plans on implementing a lockdown, oxygen distribution to states, vaccine prices and availability of medicines. Last week, the Apex court took cognisance of the issues related to the oxygen supply, drug supply, and various other government policies and measures concerning the Covid-19 pandemic.Lauding the “interest” shown by the Apex court on the Covid-19 handling, Raut said, “SC should form a national committee to look into all these issues [of vaccination and Covid-19 management]. There are several states where even the government does not know what is happening. Now, politics should be kept aside… Everybody needs to come together. The country will only survive if we do work that is devoid of politics. If not, then the country will be ruled by corpses.”“A committee should be immediately formed with the help of the SC, which looks at the requirement of the state, that there is no discrimination, that there is no political interference,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.The Sena chief spokesperson said that there is no “transparency or clarity” over the vaccination drive in the country. He also raised the inadequate supply of doses to Maharashtra. “Maharashtra is still awaiting the stock; CM said in his address, even Karnataka chief minister [BS] Yediyurappa ji has a similar opinion. Other states are also complaining. So, the question arises what is the Centre doing?” He added, “Maharashtra is not getting the vaccine stock it requires. The vaccination centres are shut for the last two-three days.” According to Raut, the Covid situation has gone out of hand in several states. He added that the Apex court-monitored committee should look at the equal and adequate distribution of drugs, vaccines and medical oxygen. “This is a national calamity and if the Centre is not handling it seriously or if they have lost control, then the Supreme Court should for a national-level committee, which can tackle the issue in conjunction with the central government. From oxygen to vaccination, from Remdesivir to other drugs, from [hospital] beds to other health infrastructure must be given as required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-set-up-national-committee-under-sc-to-tackle-covid-crisis-says-sanjay-raut-101619891753898.html

The coaches can treat up to 414 patients at a time. Rajendra Gavit, MP from Palghar, had written to railway minister Piyush Goyal last week after members of the Dahanu Vaitarna Pravasi Sevabhavi Sanstha (DVPSS) highlighted the shortage of Covid beds in Palghar hospitals. Goyal agreed to provide rail coaches. “On Friday GVL Satyakumar, deputy regional manager, WR, Mumbai signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Palghar district collector Dr Manik Gursal, and on Saturday, we provided the rail coaches,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR.The district collector had sought AC coaches in view of summer heat, but WR agreed to provide non-AC coaches. However, air coolers are to be installed in the coaches with around 9 big desert air coolers in each coach. Each coach can treat 18 patients, said Thakur. “We hope to start admitting Covid-19 patients on Sunday onwards,” he said adding,, “We will send more coaches as soon as the present 23 coaches are occupied at Palghar.”“There are more than 17,500 Covid patients in Palghar district and there is a paucity of hospital beds. Hence, rail coaches are the best option and we need more coaches to manage 2,000 patients — 500 each in Dahanu, Boisar, Palghar and Vasai,” said a government official.Earlier, Nandurbar and Nagpur districts had received such rail coaches to treat Covid-19 patients. In Nandurbar, 57 patients are currently admitted in the special Covid express coaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/palghar-receives-23-rail-coaches-to-treat-covid-patients-101619891693844.html

We’ve started a second war and it will continue till November/December. However, we’ve deferred the march to Parliament due to the risk of infection spreading further and the hot weather,” he said.“Dharna spots are like our villages and colonies, but if the government imposes lockdown, we will follow it like people follow government guidelines in their villages and cities,” he added.Most attendees at the rally were seen flouting the social distancing norms. Except for Tikait and the union’s state president Rattan Mann, no one was seen wearing a mask.On organising mahapanchayats at this hour and recent cases for flouting norms in Bhiwani, Tikait said, “This wasn’t a rally, farmers just gathered here and I informed them about the infection and the state of the agitation.”On supply of oxygen, medical services and movement of ambulances being affected due to farmers’ protest, Tikait said, “It is a rumour being spread by the government to defame farmers. Farmers are providing all support to Covid patients by arranging oxygen and ambulances for them. Farmers have not stopped any emergency vehicles, essential services and school vans in the past five months,” Tikait said.“When there is a good response from the public, the government registers cases. But what about BJP-JJP leaders? Who’ll book them?” he added.He alleged that the Modi government has failed to provide healthcare services and oxygen supply to patients and that he should resign.He refuted the allegations of rift with farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni and said, “He is a senior leader of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and we are working together.”ORDERED PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST THEM: SSP AKHTARThe mahapanchayat took place while the government has enforced Section 144 of the CrPC in Haryana which prohibits gathering of four or more people at a place without permission.SSP Hamid Akhtar said an FIR has been ordered against the organisers and leaders for flouting orders issued by the state government.“On Friday, we asked them to defer the programme, but they still organised it by flouting Section 144,” Akhtar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-infection-spread-at-protest-sites-agitation-will-continue-tikait-101619891154567.html

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||HP’s pharma hub struggles to meet demand as raw material imports dip||The second Covid-19 wave has hit the pharma hub in Himachal Pradesh’s Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh (BBN) industrial area hard as the cost of raw material, particularly active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), has trebled due to the ban on international cargo flights and delayed clearance by China. The pharma hub produces several primary life-saving, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral drugs that are exported worldwide. After the Covid-19 outbreak, pharma companies had also been producing drugs to fight coronavirus and these medicines are being supplied across the country. Also read: All you need to know about oxygen concentratorsThe cost escalation is primarily due to the ban on international cargo flights and delayed clearance by China that supplies 85% of the API, a key drug manufacturing material, to India. Rajesh Gupta, the president of the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association, said: “There is a big demand of API after the second wave, but imports are on a slide, leading to the shortage.” Raw material for Covid drugs costlier The drugs for which the cost of raw material has shot up include paracetamol ( ₹ 350 to ₹790 a kg), Propylene Glycol ( ₹140 to ₹400 a kg) and Ivermectin ( ₹18,000 to ₹52,000 a kg). Similarly, the cost of API for Doxycycline has gone up from ₹6,000 to ₹12,000 a kg and Azithromycin ₹8,000 to ₹12,000 a kg. All these medicines are used for treatment of Covid-19 patients. He said the pharma companies were finding it difficult to boost the production of medicines, including the ones needed for Covid patients. Packing material cost goes up, too Gupta said that the cost of packing material was also weighing heavy on the industry. He said the price of the main packing material, PVC, has gone up from ₹110 to ₹180 a kg. There has also been a 25% increase in the price of mono carton and corrugated packaging material, while aluminum prices are up by 40%. “The industrial association has brought the matter to the notice of the state government, but the price control of drugs is an issue that pertains to the Centre,” said state drug controller Navneet Marwah. API-monitoring cell sought Gupta said the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association (HDMA) has urged the Government of India to set up an API-monitoring cell for regulating the prices of bulk drugs. FACT CHECK *The BBN industrial belt has about 650 pharma units. The ₹40,000-crore drug industry in Himachal Pradesh accounts for every second drug produced in the market. *Indian pharma companies import more than 65% of APIs from China. There are 67 such ingredients that are sourced from different locations in China. They include B12, B1, B6 and vitamin E ingredients and fermentation process-based APIs. *Both active and inactive ingredients come together to form any medication. The API is the portion of a drug that has therapeutic effects on the body, the chemical compound that makes one feel better. Inactive ingredients are the non-medicinal, but important and necessary, components of the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hps-pharma-hub-struggles-to-meet-demand-as-raw-material-imports-dip-101619871473645.html

At least 85 centres have been dedicated to people above the age of 18 years in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Kanpur and Meerut.Vaccination will begin in these seven districts first and will continue for five days following which the vaccination drive for all ages will kick off in the rest of the districts, the chief minister said. He also highlighted that people above the age of 45 will be given free vaccines by the government of India.“At least 2,500 centres for people above 45 years have begun vaccination under Phase III today. We've also begun vaccination for people above 18 years and have included 7 districts where the positivity rate and the number of active cases are highest.

Perhaps not even a cup of tea at roadside kiosks that dot marketplaces, and definitely not medical treatment for hundreds of poor Covid-19 patients whose distressed cries for help are echoing in hospital corridors across the country.But the humble ₹5 coin goes a long way if you happen to be a patient of this octogenarian doctor in Ranchi.Despite his own failing health and old age, compassion drives Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, 85, to treat the poor who make a beeline for his clinic. He even waives the paltry ₹5 consultation fee for those who cannot pay.Honoured with the nation's fourth-highest civilian award - Padma Shri - Mukherjee has one appeal to make to the medical fraternity: "Treat one poor patient free of cost a day"."If you are a doctor, you should ponder how much is enough. Somewhere it has to stop. Compassion and empathy are an integral part of your profession and the pursuit of materialism has to end somewhere," Mukherjee, who has been a messiah for the poorest of the poor for over 55 years, said in an interview with PTI.Inflation and the rising cost of living and maintaining his clinic have forced the doctor to increase his consultation fee to ₹50 now, but he clarified "it is only for those who can afford and are willing to pay. Those who cannot afford need not pay even a paisa".Mukherjee, who has cardiac and prostate problems, said the cost of sanitising his small chamber located in the heart of Ranchi at Lalpur has forced him to hike the consultation fee.The increase is also because of his own rising medication costs which is about ₹200 a day. "But poor are not under any compulsion to pay," he said.Even now he treats up to 20 patients a day."I was compelled to increase my fees to ₹50 as I have to earn for my roti-daal at this age. I have to consume medicines worth ₹200 daily for heart and other complications. However, it is up to the poor how much they can afford to pay...There is no compulsion at all," he said."I cannot bear the sight when a poor mother comes to me and says please see my child as the child specialist has refused to examine for free and I have no money. How can medical professionals be like that? When a child is cured and the mother smiles, it gives me immense satisfaction and pleasure that is beyond any monetary sum," he said.He said he could never understand how doctors, even his students, charge ₹500, ₹1,000 from poor patients who do not have money for one square meal.When asked if he felt sad that none of the NGOs or organisations formed by his students came forward to extend a helping hand for his medication or other assistance in these difficult times, Mukherjee said, "Times have changed and I never expect anything from anybody.""Society has changed a lot. Morality, ethics have to be revived...We are considered not up to date but out of date. It is useless to talk about who helps you. This is a selfish world but give to the society what you can with no regrets and be content," he added.Mukherjee, an MBBS from Patna Medical College in 1957 and a former Head of the Department of Pathology, RIMS (erstwhile Rajendra Medical College and Hospital) has provided medical services in Bihar and Jharkhand and claims to have trained about 3,500 medical students including those holding post-graduate degrees.To keep Covid-19 at bay, this general physician's formula is very simple."I would like to advise one thing which is not being emphasised now neither by the government nor by the media- regular gargle and cleaning of the nostrils. The virus enters through the nose and lodges in the throat before affecting other parts. If we gargle three or four times, then we can kill the virus."Also, apply mulstard oil to your nostrils and keep it clean. This is what I advise to all poor patients. This should be made compulsory for all," stresses Mukherjee.He suggested gargling with antibiotic, antiseptic solutions or with salt or alum besides cleansing the nasal passage with plain water to keep the disease at bay.He held Covid inappropriate behaviour of people responsible for the exponential surge in the pandemic.A documentary on Mukherjee was screened on Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) show where superstar Amitabh Bachhan had lauded him for his appeal "Desh ke sare doctor har roz ek patient ka muft ilaaz karein (Every doctor in the country should treat one patient for free every day)."Mukherjee, who began practising in Ranchi in 1966, was honoured with Padma Shri in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/padma-shri-rs-5-ranchi-doctor-rues-crass-commercialisation-of-medical-services-101619858885789.html

01-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s BMC to vaccinate 1,000 people in 18-44 age group today; all slots full||Mumbai took baby steps to launch the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group on Saturday with 1,000 vaccines to be administered at five vaccination centres run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a symbolic start to coincide with the formation of the state in 1960 on May 1 which is observed as Maharashtra Day.In a tweet well past midnight, the BMC announced that the jabs would be given to 200 people each at five centres from 1pm on Saturday and asked people to get their appointment on the CoWIN app or website. BMC officials said the slots were full within hours.The 5 centres where vaccination begins at 1 pm are Nair Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, and the BKC Jumbo facility. Each centre will have 200 doses.Maharashtra had initially indicated that it would miss the May 1 timeline announced by the Centre for the launch of the immunisation programme for all adults younger than 45 but was later nudged by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to start a limited drive to commemorate Maharashtra Day.Last evening, Thackeray said the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group will begin in a limited way. The slots would be opened up over the next few days and weeks as the state government procures more vaccine doses.In Mumbai alone, the BMC has estimated that 9 million people in the 18 to 44 age group would need vaccination through public and private centres.Many people who saw the BMC’s early morning tweet announcing the limited vaccination were disappointed. One person, Sanjay P, complained on Twitter that they were not able to see any vaccination slots for Mumbai but spotted open slots in other cities such as Pune and Nagpur.Another Twitter user Gunjan Lahiri said, “Why are the vaccination centres not being updated on the app? I heard there are 5 sites in Mumbai that are vaccinating the 18+ but when you search it says “no vaccination centres available for booking.”In line with the Centre’s guidelines, people in the 18-44 age group need an online appointment to get the jab. No walk-ins are allowed.Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar told reporters on Saturday morning that people should not rush to the vaccination centres unless they have an appointment. “If you have registered but have not received a message, don’t go to the centre and crowd for no reason,” she said.The civic body also appealed to people to wear double masks if they are going for the vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-bmc-to-vaccinate-1-000-people-in-18-44-age-group-today-all-slots-full-101619853532128.html

The top court, however, said that no victory rallies shall be permitted during or after the counting of votes. It added that Class I gazetted officials will be responsible for adherence to Covid-19 protocols at each counting centre.Amid concerns raised by the top court over the counting exercise during the distressing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Uttar Pradesh government said that over five lakh local representatives, who will be elected after the result of panchayat polls is announced, will further help manage the crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.The SEC, meanwhile, assured the court all Covid-related guidelines will be followed and no victory procession will be allowed. The UP government also agreed to not lift local curfews till the counting is completed at that particular counting centre. Government officials, candidates and their representatives will be allowed at a counting centre only after they present a Covid-19 negative report or vaccination certificate, it said. The top court has also directed SEC to preserve CCTV footage of the counting centres in till Allahabad High Court concludes hearing the pleas before it, according to news agency PTI.A bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar on Friday asked the state government and SEC about the arrangements for counting of votes in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was hearing the appeal filed by one Sachin Yadav challenging Allahabad High Court order allowing the panchayat elections to continue in the state.Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Friday slammed the government over the polls and demanded that the government provide financial support and a government job to dependents of employees who died due to coronavirus disease while on duty during the panchayat elections. "It would have been better if the government had postponed panchayat polls and extended its date due to the rising cases of coronavirus. It would have prevented a number of deaths of employees on election duty. It is very sad," she wrote on Twitter in Hindi.Polling for the four-phased rural elections in Uttar Pradesh ended on April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/supreme-court-allows-up-panchayat-polls-counting-no-victory-rallies-permitted-101619852511807.html

The state finance department is ready to clear the payment in one go."He said that Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla had told Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that it was difficult for them to provide vaccines in such a large amount, adding that to procure sufficient vaccine doses, the state government has also done bookings with Bharat Biotech."Adar Poonawala told the CM that it is difficult to give the vaccines in large stock. We have done booking with Bharat Biotech as well. We are trying to conduct the vaccination as early as possible.

01-05-2021||Delhi||'State has failed’: Sombre note in Delhi high court hearing after petitioner dies of Covid-19||“The State has failed us,” the Delhi high court observed on Friday, after it was informed in the middle of a hearing that a petitioner, who sought the court’s help three days ago to secure an intensive care unit (ICU) bed, had succumbed to Covid-19.“The State has failed in its fundamental obligation to protect the basic fundamental right -- i.e, the right to life as contained under Article 21,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the teary relatives of the petitioner.The petitioner, Atul Kumar Sharma, was admitted in Maharaja Agrasen Hospital’s casualty wing, and approached the high court on Tuesday to direct the state authorities to allocate him an ICU bed. The hospital told the court that it was taking care of the patient but had no ICU beds free.The high court had said it couldn’t consider an individual case but appealed to all hospitals and authorities to make arrangements. On Friday, when the bench was again appealing to counsels to consider the petitioner’s case, advocate Amit Sharma told the court that his brother-in-law Atul had expired. He burst into tears and said, “I have failed…”The bench stopped him. “No Mr Sharma, you have not failed. The State has failed.” Silence descended among the judges, counsels and over 150 participants who had joined the video conferencing hearing.The emotional exchange capped an eventful day in court where senior lawyers broke down and pleaded for help, the state government counsel expressed helplessness, and judges said it was getting tough for them.“It is the complete failure of the State that everything including hospital beds and medical oxygen is in short supply. It is a war and not a battle,” the court remarked earlier in the day after Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) chairman Ramesh Gupta, broke down while mourning his colleagues who died of Covid-19.Gupta, who was appearing in a petition seeking medical facilities for lawyers, submitted that a private hospital agreed to treat the lawyers but didn’t have ICU beds. “We want my lords to come to our rescue. We do not want to criticise anyone or any government. We have ₹4-5 crore in our funds and will arrange more from lawyers. We only want my lords to help us. Sir kuch karo aap (Sir please do something).”Delhi government’s standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi also became emotional while informing the court about a colleague’s demise.”Daily we are losing our dear ones,” he said.The court empathised. “We understand your pain. We are going through the same. This surge of Covid has such a huge number...nobody could have imagined that this will attack us in this way... Finances are not the issue here. The problem is infrastructure….The problem is we don’t have doctors, nurses, attendants, oxygen and medicines. It is a complete failure of the state,” the bench said.“It’s getting tougher for us,” the bench said.The court criticised the “hotchpotch situation” in Delhi and compared it to the way Mumbai was handling its infection load.“In Bombay what the municipal corporation has done is, you’re asked to register if you have Covid, and then they go door-to-door with bed and facilities. But we cannot do that in Delhi. It’s too late to devise a system now. Its complete hotchpotch. Central government… Delhi government….municipal corporations not one but three…Politically different parties.. Complete hotchpotch,” the bench remarked.The court directed authorities to immediately release 170 oxygen concentrators seized by Delhi Police from the black market . It also recalled an order passed earlier this week, where it had directed the Delhi government to take over a refiller plant. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said supplies were being affected due to this and several stakeholders asked him to bring back the vendor.During the proceedings, advocate Himanshu Dagar, representing Gandhi Nursing Home, told the court that 95 people were on the death bed because the hospital didn’t receive a single oxygen cylinder in the last 48 hours. He said that the hospital suffered two deaths on Thursday and had no oxygen cylinders at present.“We are at the complete mercy of God,” he said. To this, Mehra expressed helplessness and said that problems still existed in the supply system despite allocations being made.The court directed the Delhi government to sort out the issue and also issued notice to the two refillers assigned to the hospital. It asked the government to explain why the supply wasn’t done.The bench asked the Delhi government to look into the possibility of converting SUVs into ambulances and whether buses could be used for carrying oxygen cylinders instead of ambulances.It also asked the administration to look into scaling up Rapid Antigen Test in addition to RT-PCR tests through mobile vans for hospital staffs and using hotels for health workers so that their family members are not infected.The matter will be now heard on Saturday.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals, had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/state-has-failed-sombre-note-in-delhi-high-court-hearing-after-petitioner-dies-of-covid19-101619820415726.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||5 lab staff held for issuing fake Covid-19 test reports||Five employees of a medical diagnostics laboratory were arrested for allegedly giving out fake Covid test reports, Delhi Police said on Friday. According to Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), the arrested suspects handed out 400 such fake reports -- both positive and negative -- since April 23.The company, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, said that the reports were not generated by the lab, and added that they informed police about the wrongdoing of their employees as soon as they noticed it. The company stressed that while some of their staff were involved in the crime, the laboratory had no role to play. It added that all authentic reports have QR codes, which can be easily be used to distinguish them from the fake reports that were being handed out.Police said the probe started after 45 members of a large, extended family in south Delhi’s Khirki Extension said they received false results from Genestrings Diagnostic Centre in Sarvodaya Enclave.The family members was reportedly tested by two technicians of the lab over a few days, and some of them were declared positive for Covid-19, said DCP Thakur. One of them, Rishab Shukla, said he was given a positive result on Monday. “But Shukla didn’t have any symptoms, and decided to get himself tested at another lab again on Wednesday. This time his result was negative,” said the DCP.Shukla then went to Genestrings Diagnostics, and was shocked to learn that his name was not in their records, and that his sample had never reached them.He contacted the police, which registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy at Malviya Nagar police station. The five people arrested are application scientist Manish Kumar Singh, his two colleagues Satender and Nikhil, and two lab assistants, Pragyanand Sharma and Himanshu Sharma.Police said that initially the technicians planned to have doctors test the samples, and share the results without entering the details in the laboratory’s records. They would use the lab’s letterhead to print out a the report, and pocket the money paid by clients of for the tests.“But as the load of the samples increased, the suspects began dishing out fake results without even testing them,” the DCP said.“On being approached by a few patients to authenticate reports bearing our lab’s name, we found out that they were not issued by us, nor tested at our lab. We immediately called the local police station in-charge to investigate what seemed to be a fake report issue,” said Chetan Kohli, COO of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre.“Five of our employees were identified to be a party to this crime without the knowledge of lab management or the lab head,” he added. “All our reports have QR codes which can be easily used to check the authenticity of reports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/5-lab-staff-held-for-issuing-fake-covid-19-test-reports-101619819542369.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||7 held for running factory producing fake remdesivir||A BPharm graduate and a BCom graduate, both from Uttarakhand’s Haridwar, were among seven arrested on Friday for running a factory producing fake remdesivir injections, which were widely sold in Delhi and other states for huge profits, Delhi Police’s crime branch said.Vatan Kumar Saini (32), who holds BPharm and MBA degrees, and Aditya Gautam (33), a BCom graduate, told the police that they have sold more than 2,000 fake remdesivir vials in the black market through their agents in the past few weeks. The police said a 40-year-old woman events manager based in Delhi, who herself recently recovered from Covid-19, was helping them sell the fake vials in the national capital.Remdesivir injections are in huge demand across India, as Covid-19 infections surge. WHO has said there is no evidence it reduces mortality or obviates the need for ventilation in hospitalised people, but it has been found by some studies to help those in early stages of the infection who need supplemental oxygen.Delhi Police’s ongoing investigation into those arrested recently for trying to sell remdesivir injections in the black market helped them trace the vials to the manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand, the crime branch said.The crime branch said on Thursday that they carried out searches in the manufacturing facility in Uttarakhand’s Kotdwar and a trading company in Haridwar, both run by Gautam and Saini. The two were allegedly passing off injections of antibiotic azithromycin as the antiviral drug remdesivir, as the packaging of both drugs are similar. The men would replace the labels on the antibiotic vials with fake ones that they printed out, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.DCP Bhardwaj said 198 vials of the fake remdesivir, one packing machine, one barcoding machine, 3,000 empty vials and packing materials of azithromycin, an antibiotic used in the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, were seized from the factory.Thee duo was selling one remdesivir vial for around ₹6,000 to ₹10,000 to their agents, who further sold it to needy customers for prices ranging between ₹25,000 and ₹40,000. The injection is available for a price between ₹900 and 3,500, but shortages have resulted in a thriving black market. Many states have channelised sales of remdesivir .Delhi has been hit by a severe shortage of drugs such as remdesivir, faviprarir and ivermectin, a scarcity that has been exacerbated by hoarders and black marketeers who are selling them at rates 10-15 times their retail value. For instance, HT reported earlier that a dealer in north Delhi offered to sell a customer a vial of remdesivir for ₹25,000, as against an MRP ranging from ₹899 and ₹3,500.DCP Bhardwaj said police have initiated the procedure to seal Gautam’s medicine manufacturing company, “Nectar Herbs and Drugs” in Kotdwar.According to the police, the first lead about the interstate racket came when the crime branch team on April 23 arrested Mohammad Shoaib (28), and Mohan Kumar Jha (40), with 10 remdesivir vials that they were trying to sell to a decoy customer outside Batra Hospital in south Delhi.After their arrest, the two told the police that they got the vials from two others, Manish Goyal and Pushkar Chanderkant Pakhale, who were subsequently arrested on April 25 from Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar with 12 more vials of remdesivir.The duo disclosed that their main supplier was one Sadhna Sharma and she was arrested the following day from Yamuna Vihar itself. A total of 160 vials of fake remdesivir injections were recovered from her, the DCP said.“Sharma underwent treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Krishna Nagar. Sharma needed remdesivir injections for her treatment but could not get one because of its scarcity. In her efforts to obtain an injection for herself, Sharma came in contact with Saini and joined his illegal trade,” said Bhardwaj.“Prime facie, it appears that except Sharma, the other four arrested persons did not know that the injections were fake. Sharma told us that the fake injections were coming from Uttarakhand through Saini,” Bharadwaj said.On April 27, Saini was arrested from his home in Haridwar from where one packing machine, 3,000 empty vials for packing fake remdesivir injections, and packing materials of azithromycin were seized. During his interrogation, Saini pointed to Gautam, who was arrested on April 29 from Roorkee. His company premises in Kotdwar was also searched. The computer on which fake labels were prepared and 16 fake remdesivir injections were recovered, the DCP said.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria earlier this week asked doctors to exercise caution while prescribing remdesivir to patients and said the drug being used to treat Covid-19 is not a “magic bullet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/7-held-for-running-factory-producing-fake-remdesivir-101619819326549.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||3 private hospital chains say will open jabs up today; others still not sure||Three large private hospital chains– Max, Apollo, and Fortis – said that they will roll-out the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for everyone aged 18 and above from May 1, announcing that they have some stocks from the manufacturers directly. Other private hospitals, however, said they were unsure of whether they will receive any doses from the Delhi government.The Delhi government, which has ordered 6.7 million doses each of Covishield and Covaxin, is likely to get its first supply by Sunday, officials said. Government hospitals, on the other hand, have not received any instruction on immunising people below the age of 45 and are unlikely to do so with the existing stock provided by the Centre, which is meant only for people in the older group.According to a statement by Max healthcare group, four centres at Panchsheel Park, Patparganj, Shalimar Bagh and BLK hospital in Rajinder Place will begin administering Covishield from Saturday. “Max healthcare… will be starting universal vaccination drive from select hospitals in the network in NCR. As the supplies of the vaccine pick up all hospitals in the network will be used to vaccinate citizens,” said the group in a statement.Everyone will have to seek an appointment on Co-WIN platform of the government for receiving the shots, according to the rules previously announced by the government.Indraprastha Apollo hospital, as part of the group’s national vaccine roll-out, will also begin the immunisation drive in Delhi. The hospital hasn’t revealed which of the jabs will be used.All Fortis centres across North India will roll out the drive from Saturday with Covaxin.“Fortis will administer Covid vaccines for 18+ at its centres across North India from tomorrow. Fortis centres in other cities will commence vaccination as soon as supplies are made available by the authorities. The hospital will administer Covaxin from tomorrow at ₹1,250/dose; this includes cost of the vaccine and administration charges,” said a hospital statement.Union government officials said some states will begin vaccinations for the under-45 adult population from May 1, but expect teething troubles. “Government guidelines clearly say those private vaccination centres that will procure vaccine doses can start vaccination. Based on the availability of vaccine doses, and the way states coordinate with vaccine manufacturers, in some states vaccinations will definitely be launched in the 18-plus category. Any new process takes time to grow and stabilise,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health, during the briefing on Friday.“The guidance tools for vaccinating 18-44 years category are being shared with the states by the central government, and we feel that once this (additional) vaccination drive commences the way it has been designed, it will stabilise gradually. When the programme was launched on January 16, there were fewer vaccination centres across the country, which increased in due course. Similarly, this will also pick up speed in coordination between the private sector, the state, and the vaccine manufacturers,” the official said.He also said that the Centre asked the state governments to account for the vaccine doses that have been distributed to the private vaccination centres, and later start vaccination with additionally procured doses.In government-run hospitals in Delhi, officials were unsure of when they will be able to give doses to these groups. A doctor from Delhi government-run Rajeev Gandhi Superspeciality hospital said, “We will continue vaccinating people over the age of 45 years for now. As soon as we get instructions and doses from the Delhi government, we will start immunising people between the ages 18 and 44.”“So far, we have not received any information from the Delhi government on vaccinating those below the age of 45 years. We will continue immunising those who are 45 years and above as usual,” said a senior administrator from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), asking not to be named.Hospitals other than the large chains have been unable to secure any doses from the vaccine manufacturers and are unsure whether they will get any from the Delhi government.“We have contacted Serum Institute of India that has said they will be able to provide doses only after six months. Sputnik will come only in July we have been told. And, we are yet to hear from Bharat Biotech. For now, we will not be able to immunise anyone, even those who have received their first dose at the hospital. We might get doses from the Delhi government, but we haven’t received any communication to that effect,” said Dr DS Rana, chairperson, Sir Ganga Ram hospital.All private centres have been removed from the government’s Co-WIN platform for now and are likely to be added once they get the doses, according to the hospitals.“For now, we have to put everything on hold as there is no clarity on whether we will receive any doses from the Delhi government. From what we have heard, doses will go to government hospitals for the time being. People who have taken their first shot at our hospital will have to be referred to government hospitals for their second dose for now,” said Jasleen Kaur, general manager marketing, Indian Spinal Injury Centre.Experts believe that not vaccinating everyone over the age of 18 years might lead to disproportionate number of severe infections among young people.“The number of vaccinations has already gone down – maybe because of the lockdown, or because people have seen news about others getting the infection even after vaccination (what they do not realise is that the infection is mild), or because they think they might get the infection from the vaccination centres. This will further endanger people below the age of 45 years, who are completely unvaccinated and are getting severe disease during the second wave,” said Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman of Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-private-hospital-chains-say-will-open-jabs-up-today-others-still-not-sure-101619819066298.html
01-05-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram among 9 Haryana districts under weekend lockdown beginning today||The Haryana government on Friday announced Gurugram as one of the nine districts across the state to be put under a weekend lockdown from 10pm on Friday till 5am on Monday.The other districts are: Panchkula, Faridabad, Sonipat, Rohtak, Karnal, Hisar, Sirsa, and Fatehabad.The weekend lockdown order was issued by Vijay Vardhan, chief secretary and chairperson of the Haryana State Executive Committee, under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.“Whereas, the Covid-19 pandemic is again posing threat to public health, the Haryana government has considered it necessary to take effective measures to prevent its spread in the state,” excerpts from the order read.The order states that general public are not allowed to leave their homes, travel on foot or vehicles on the streets or any public places during this time period.The Covid-19 situation has been grim in the city, especially over the past three weeks, with acute shortage of Covid-19 hospitals beds, oxygen, and medicines.Before April 11, the highest single-day Covid-19 recorded cases was 964 on November 8 last year. Since then, the city’s Covid-19 cases have been continuously surging, with Gurugram recording 5,042 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, as per the district administration’s daily health bulletin, the highest single-day figure since the pandemic started.As per Vardhan’s order, only those tasked with law and order, municipal services, health, electricity, fire, government machinery tasked with Covid-19 related duties, executive magistrates, police personnel, military, Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), accredited journalist are allowed movement provided they show their identify cards.For general public, movement for appearing in examination, those on examination duties on production of admit or identity cards, those engaged in manufacture of essential goods are also exempted.Vardhan’s order further stated that there will no curb on movement of inter-state and intra-state essential and non-essential goods.“Hospitals, veterinary hospitals and all related medical establishments, including their manufacturing and distribution units, both in public and private sector, such as dispensaries, chemist, pharmacies (including Jan Aushadhi Kendra) and medical equipment shops, laboratories, pharmaceutical research labs, clinics, nursing homes, ambulance will continue to remain functional. The transportation of all medical personnel, nurses, paramedical, other hospital support services will be permitted,” it says.Under the commercial and private establishment category, those engaged in telecommunications, internet services, broadcasting and cable services staff, IT services; delivering essential goods, including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment; petrol pumps, LPG, petroleum and gas retail and storage outlets are also exempted along with people deputed in power generation, transmission and distribution units and services, cold storage and warehousing services, private security services, and farming activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-among-9-haryana-districts-under-weekend-lockdown-beginning-today-101619818809152.html
01-05-2021||Gurugram||Spike no bar: Gurugram to see 300 weddings in 15 days||Gurugram will see around 300 weddings in the next fortnight, officials said, highlighting one of the factors that could result in a further spike in Covid-19 cases in a district that has seen the number of daily cases rise by 374% in the past fortnight. The district currently has 36,693 active cases, up from 7,741 on April 15.The 300 itself, is a number that has come down from 700, after the district administration on Friday released an order prohibiting such events within so-called Large Outbreak Regions — areas where localised increase in cases are being reported. For operational purposes, a large outbreak area is one where there are 15 or more cases, while a containment zone is an area where at least five Covid-19 cases are reported.“Till Thursday, approvals were given to around 700 weddings, but this has now come down to around 300 as permission for many such events were cancelled, especially those scheduled to take place in areas falling in large outbreak regions,” said a senior official from the district administration.Under the current norms, 50 guests are allowed for weddings taking place outdoors while a limit of 30 guests has been set for indoor functions -- both, if the experience of the first wave of the disease, and the restrictions imposed then are any indication, are likely to be honoured more in breach than observance.A release issued by the district information department on Friday said all permissions given by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Gurugram Jitendra Kumar’s office for weddings and other functions in areas falling in containment zones have been revoked with immediate effect.Officials from the district administration said that they feared the weddings could turn into super-spreader events.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram said: “Permissions are being given for weddings outside containment zones despite the imposition of Section 144 in the district as they are exempt with prior permissions from the administration. But it will be better if people understand that this is not the right time for celebrations.”Many experts believe a spate of weddings in Delhi in the early part of the year were the cause for a spike in cases. In March, a central government panel found that events, such as weddings, were one of the causes for the resurgence of Covid-19 in India.While some fear that these weddings can make things worse, district administration officials said they plan to keep a tight leash on them.Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “We have over 2,000 personnel deployed to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed. We strictly monitor that one chair is left in between guests at tables to maintain social distancing, people do not gather in crowds for photographs and they wear masks at all times.”But representatives of a local hotel association admitted that guests often break rules.Manbeer Choudhary, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Haryana said, “Staff at all hotels follow safety measures of double masks, sanitisation, noting down mobile numbers of guests, and social distancing; but it becomes difficult for hotels when guests do not cooperate.”Choudhary said he expects more people to apply for permission because, according to the Hindu calendar, there are 18 auspicious wedding dates in the month of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/spike-no-bar-gurugram-to-see-300-weddings-in-15-days-101619818707743.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||MCDs offer space to set up Covid facilities||With health care facilities across the national capital burdened by the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases and citizens complaining of difficulties in finding hospital beds, the three civic bodies -- east, north, and south -- have written to the Delhi government, offering to convert their schools and community centres into Covid care hospitals and isolation centres.The second wave of Covid-19 across the country — and the fourth wave in Delhi — has turned out to be the deadliest one yet in terms of cases and fatalities. Delhi is currently recording at least 25,000 new Covid cases and over 300 deaths every day.At present, Delhi has 21,199 beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 5,032 are ICU beds. Besides, there are over 5,000 beds in dedicated Covid care centres and 204 in dedicated healthcare centres.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Thursday sent a list of 20 schools and six community centres to the Delhi government that could be converted into Covid isolation centres. Officials said each school can have 50 beds. The civic body runs around 360 primary schools.East civic body mayor Nirmal Jain said that they have told the Delhi government that these spaces can be immediately used for Covid patients. “We are ready to give these spaces at the earliest. We have assured that we will arrange water, electricity and sanitation facilities. The government can set up beds and other medical infrastructure. We will help in that as well,” he said.Similarly, the North MCD has also offered its primary schools to the Delhi government to convert these into Covid-19 hospitals, isolation, and care centers. The north civic body runs 714 primary schools.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash on Friday said that the municipality had written to the Delhi government on April 19, offering to convert their schools, community centres, and polyclinics into dedicated Covid facilities. He said that around 7,000 beds can be added by letting the government use the municipality-owned buildings, including nearly 5,000 beds at its primary schools. “We have assured the government that we will provide every possible help from our side to fight this pandemic. We all know that citizens are running from pillar to post to find hospital beds and any addition at this time will only help save lives,” he said.He said that they have sent a list of 100 schools where beds can be set up. “In each school building, at least 50 beds can be set up,” he said.Meanwhile, the south Delhi municipal corporation officials also said that they have offered all available resources to strengthen the public health infrastructure in the city. “We are also working with our officials to identify which schools can be offered as dedicated Covid facilities. We will be releasing the list for the government in the coming days,” said south Delhi mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh. The south corporation runs around 580 primary schools.A Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The government is keen on expanding the healthcare infrastructure as much as possible. In case these schools and community centres (offered by MCDs) are required, the government will make use of them. Some isolation centres are already operating in MCD schools in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-offer-space-to-set-up-covid-facilities-101619817767074.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||Distress calls on Delhi’s child helpline surge amid rise in Covid-19 cases||After losing their parents to Covid-19 on Friday, two siblings, aged 20 and 18, attempted to take their lives on the same day but the timely intervention of the neighbours, who alerted police, saved them. They were later rescued from south Delhi.A day earlier, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) helped a 15-year-old boy, who was struggling to take care of his mother alone after she tested positive for Covid-19.Amid a rise in both Covid-19 cases and fatalities, authorities, including the DCPCR, the Delhi Police, and several NGOs, are now working to ensure children of deceased patients and those who are ill are getting all the assistance they need. Officials said the child distress helpline are receiving many calls from children seeking help.The DCPCR has also launched a helpline +91-9311551393 to address the needs of children who have lost parents or whose parents are hospitalised or are in any distress.Anurag Kundu, chairperson of DCPCR, said he will ensure that the calls pouring into the helpline are looked into within 24 hours.“Children are the most vulnerable in these testing times as they remain dependent on others to provide for them. The helpline is receiving numerous cases wherein a child has lost all sources of support and is in need of immediate care. The Commission is committed to resolving all such cases in less than 24 hours,” said Kundu.For instance, after two children lost both their parents within a day, the commission coordinated with NGOs, following which local staff interacted with the duo and counselled them. “The relatives and neighbours are taking care of the children now. The Commission has been checking in on them everyday,” read a statement released by the commission.The commission said citizens could call the new helpline number and inform about children in distress.Sonal Kapoor, founder of Protsahan, said the most important thing is to work on closure for such children. “We aren’t taught how to deal with emotions involving grief, trauma, and death. A lot of adults, including caregivers and NGOs, are also in denial and children too struggle to process these emotions. The challenge is to establish a routine in the child’s life. While government agencies can put children in shelter homes and provide essentials, the focus should also be on psycho-social needs on grief and trauma healing,” she said.In another case, the DCPCR also facilitated the process of cremation for two children who lost their father and provided medical assistance, along with Covid tests, to them while their relatives arrived in a few hours.Last week, in Rohini, three children aged below 10 were living with their grandmother after their father died of Covid-19 and their mother was hospitalized with the infection. Volunteer groups provided essential supplies like fruits, milk, and bread after seeing the SOS call on social media. However, they pointed out that their grandmother was “very old to feed and manage them.”Kundu responded to the SOS asking his team to “make sure the children have all medical help, food and to daily check in on them at least for the next 15 days. Also, see if the children can talk to their mother over the phone.”In another case, a 14-year-old lost all his family members to Covid-19 and has been in home isolation after testing positive for the infection with no one to look after him.

He had also made it to the 24-member Indian hockey probables list for the 1956 Olympics but had missed the cut due to an injury. After he quit playing, Vohra became an administrator and worked for the promotion of the sport. He was the founder secretary general of Chandigarh Olympic Association (COA) and served the unit for 25 years. He had also been the secretary of Hockey Chandigarh for several years. He successfully ran the Rock Rovers Hockey Club and looked after the sport for decades. He was also a first-class hockey umpire and inspired many to take up the role.“He was my hero and I took up umpiring after watching him in that role. I spoke to him just two days ago, and he was doing fine. But this terrible disease took him away from us. His immense contribution took Chandigarh Hockey to great heights,” said Satinder Sharma, an international hockey umpire. Since 1971, Vohra and his late brother SN Vohra had been organising an All India Gurmit Memorial Hockey Tournament (A- Grade) and in 2019 was its 48th edition in a row.“He always wanted to provide a platform to young hockey players. Gurmit Memorial Hockey Tournament was one such meet which gave a chance to talented players from across India. We would like to take Vohra Sahab’s legacy forward with pride and passion,” said Anil Vohra, general secretary of Hockey Chandigarh.Manan’s parents and grandmother had also tested positive for the virus but have recovered. “Manan is in Delhi for the Indian Premier League and wanted to fly back home for the last rites of his grandfather. But I told him to carry on with his game as his grandfather would have also wanted the same. His grandfather was his inspiration and driving force,” said Manan’s father Sanjeev Vohra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hockey-legend-yash-pal-vohra-dies-due-to-covid-at-92-101619816989756.html

Once this is over, they will hand them back to us.”Member of parliament Manish Tewari said, “I took up the issue (after it was reported) with the deputy commissioner of Mohali and told him to either hand them (the ventilators) over to private hospitals in Mohali or to PGIMER in Chandigarh.”DC Girish Dayalan said that the ventilators were received under PM CARES, but were not used due to technical issues: “These ventilators were to be used in the Mohali Medical College; the process of human resource recruitment and infrastructure creation is on.”Abhijit Singh, zonal director of Fortis Hospital said the hospital will administer Covid vaccine at the hospital tomorrow the moment supplies were made available by the authorities.HT had reported how at a time when a Covid patient had died while waiting for an ICU bed at a private hospital in Mohali on Wednesday, eight ventilators were lying unused at the civil hospital for the last eight months in the absence of infrastructure and/or staff to operate them.The district has around 30 private hospitals with 256 ICU beds.

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Police file challan against four in Chandigarh property grab case||Nearly two months after the first arrests in the Sector-37 property grab case, the Chandigarh Police on Friday filed a chargesheet against four accused, including a suspended inspector, a journalist and a property dealer. In the challan, police have also invoked the Prevention of Corruption (PCA) Act against the accused – journalist Sanjeev Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta, suspended Chandigarh Police inspector Rajdeep Singh and Satpal Dagar, brother of a UT deputy superintendent of police. They are accused of kidnapping and torturing Rahul Mehta, 48, the only surviving heir of his family, in April 2017 to secure the general power of attorney of his 338 square yards house and selling it to Manish’s brother Saurabh Gupta for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019.Running into 18,132 pages, the challan has listed 78 witnesses. It will be taken up for hearing on May 3. Sanjeev and Manish were the first to be arrested in the case on March 2, followed by Satpal on March 4 and inspector Rajdeep on March 12.Apart from them, police had also booked liquor baron Arvind Singla and businessman Khalendra Singh Kadyan, to whom the property’s GPA was transferred, slain bouncer Surjit Singh, and Ashok Arora, Shekhar and Daljit Singh, who purportedly acted as witnesses in the sale of the house.After the transfer of the GPA, Rahul was abandoned at a stud farm in Gujarat in June 2017, before being shifted from one charitable home to another in Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan, where he was finally traced. He is now in police protection.IPC’s Section 328 added on victim’s statement The challan has been filed under Sections 328, 331, 344, 365, 386, 419, 420, 452, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 473, 474, 477, 166, 201 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 13(1), (2) of the Prevention Of Corruption Act.Police added Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison with intent to commit an offence) of the IPC against the accused after Rahul alleged that he was intoxicated by the accused.In his statement to the court, Rahul had said he was the sole owner of the house, which he never sold to anyone. But, Sanjeev, Surjit and two others forcibly entered his house and occupied the upper floor in April 2017. They assaulted him and locked him up in a room, and kept torturing and threatening to kill him, he alleged. After forcibly securing his signature on blank papers and cheques, Surjit left him at a stud farm in Bhuj, Gujarat.Victim’s cousin settled abroad also among witnesses Police have listed Rahul’s cousin Rajiv, who is settled in the UK, as a witness. Rahul’s mother (since deceased) had transferred a part of the property in question to her sister, who also died later. Thereon, there was a dispute between Rahul and her son Rajiv, who moved the high court.Rajiv had told the police that he visited the house in 2017 to discuss the court case with Rahul, but met Surjit there and was told that Rahul was not at home. Rajiv had later also met Sanjeev, who told him that Rahul was safe at some place and they were taking care of him. Sanjeev further claimed that Rahul had transferred his share of the house to his name, and offered ₹25 lakh to Rajiv to withdraw the court case.Four accused at largeOn March 26, Chandigarh Police had announced a cash reward of ₹50,000 for information leading to the arrest of four accused – Arvind, Saurabh, Khalendra and Gurpreet Singh Mani, but they remain at large. According to police, after the property’s GPA was transferred in favour of Khalendra and Arvind, Saurabh had purchased it and Gurpreet had acted as a witness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-file-challan-against-four-in-chandigarh-property-grab-case-101619816689837.html
01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Deadly April accounts for 20% of all Covid fatalities in Chandigarh||At 15,725 Covid cases, April has been a sickening month for city residents with an average of 525 persons testing positive for debilitating virus every day. The figure also means that of 41,923 cases in the city to date, every third (35%) has come in this month. There have also been 99 deaths in April, 20.7% of 478 deaths in the city. The number of active cases has surged from 2,900 on April 1 to 6,906 on April 30. According to experts, there is unlikely to be any respite in the first two weeks of May, at least. The sharp increase in cases comes when Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are already in short supply. Testing levels have increased, but are drowned by the surge in infections. The number of infections between March and April increased by 200%, but the corresponding increase in tests has been just 65%. The positivity rate has seen a spurt from 5% to 16%.“The next two weeks are crucial. The trajectory of the past two weeks indicate that cases will go up for the next two weeks. With respect to cases, the fatality ratio has been low. The absolute number of deaths is concerning,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and school of public health at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Dr GD Puri, chairman of Covid-19 management panel, at PGIMER said one of the reasons for increased deaths can be the public’s run over health facilities and hospitals. “When there are lower number of hospitalisations, extra care is provided. Now, admissions are happening at a fast pace and facilities are being exhausted. This impacts health care services and leads to increased fatalities,” Dr Puri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deadly-april-accounts-for-20-of-all-covid-fatalities-in-chandigarh-101619816330604.html

Panchkula enforced it at 10pm, but in Chandigarh, it will come into force at 5am on Saturday.The public movement restrictions will continue through Sunday, before ending at 5am on Monday across the tricity.Thereon, the daily night curfew will remain in force from 6pm to 5am in Chandigarh and Mohali, and 9pm to 5am in Panchkula.Punjab was the first to announce the weekend restrictions earlier this week. Haryana enforced the curfew in nine districts on Friday afternoon. Chandigarh, too, followed suit, announcing its decision around 7.30pm on Friday. “Our imposition of weekend curfew was contingent upon Haryana doing the same in Panchkula. A curfew in Chandigarh can be effective only if it is imposed in the entire tricity,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.The administration has come under criticism for repeatedly changing its stand on the imposition of weekend curfew. After first clamping it on the April 16 weekend, UT decided against it on April 23, only to reimpose it now. Opposition political parties, including Congress and AAP, have termed the administration “confused” on the issue. What it means “No person shall leave their home or shall move on foot or by vehicle or travel or stand or roam on any road or public places,” states the order issued by deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Issuing the same order in Panchkula, deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja appealed to residents to stay indoors till Monday morning.All essential commodity shops and restaurants in the tricity will be allowed to remain open, but only for home delivery. These include shops and vendors dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetable, dairy, meat, animal fodder, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. In Chandigarh, shops will be closed by 2pm, but restaurants can continue delivery till 9pm. Similarly, home delivery by eateries is allowed till 9pm in Mohali as well, but shops here will down shutters by 5pm and by 6pm in Panchkula.All private offices will remain closed, and only industries manufacturing essential products, such as masks, sanitisers and medicines, can operate during the weekend. Those specially issued a restricted movement curfew pass are exempted.Any breach of the order will invite action under Sections 51 and 60 of the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.17 areas sealed in UT, MohaliThe UT administration on Friday declared 15 more micro-containment zones in the city, while two such zones were also notified in Mohali.

Social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp, are flooded with messages of patients’ kin who are looking for hospitals, more so with a ventilator support system available.Many are also claiming that they have lost their loved ones due to non-availability of Level- 3 (L3, critical) beds in Ludhiana. As per the data shared by the district administration, there are 481 beds earmarked for Level-3 Covid patients, out of which 454 are currently occupied. While these are official figures, the long queues of people waiting outside hospitals, waiting for a bed to fall vacant for their ailing kin, tell a different story. Family members of Kamini Garg, a 55-year-old from Barnala who had lost her battle to Covid on April 28, said that they were not able to secure a Level-3 bed for her even as her daughter and son-in-law are practising doctors. Yogesh Agrawal, a relative of the deceased, said that for three days, they kept going from one hospital to another looking for beds but had no luck. “We had even applied online at each hospital but to no avail. She was first admitted at a hospital in Moga and was rushed to Ludhiana when her condition deteriorated. She died in the isolation ward, waiting for a critical-care bed,” he said.The relatives of 50-year-old Gurmeet Singh are also going through a similar ordeal. Her niece Rashminder Kaur said, “I, along with my husband, am struggling to arrange a Level-3 bed for my aunt. She is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital on Ferozepur Road. The hospital authorities have told us that her condition is deteriorating and she needs to be shifted to an L3 facility but all hospitals are turning us away.” Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, the medical in-charge of the Covid unit of Arora Neuro centre, said the situation is grim and the patient load is phenomenal. “The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the fact that for every four patients discharged from the hospital, there are eight others waiting to get admitted. We have 10 ICU beds and are adding three more beds,” said Dr Sachdeva. Burden of outsiders The health infrastructure of the district is also crippling due to the influx of patients from outside. As per information, around 41% of the hospitals in Ludhiana are occupied by outsiders. As the health system is bursting at seams, even nursing homes have no space. While the state government has not framed any policy and has said it will welcome patients from any part of the country in wake of this national crisis, hospitals have no option but to turn away the patients due to non-availability of bed. “My brother’s oxygen is falling below 80. He has been recommended ventilator support but we are not getting any in Delhi or Noida. We tried Ludhiana but all hospitals denied L3 facilities to us as we are not from the city,” said Pragati, a Noida resident, who also shared her ordeal on various Whatsapp groups in Ludhiana. As on April 28, there were 785 Ludhiana residents admitted in private hospitals across the district while the number of residents from outside the district stood at 325. At Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, as many as 90 patients are from Ludhiana while 110 are from outside the city. Similarly at Christian Medical College and Hospital, 120 patients are from city while 35 of those admitted are from outside. At Fortis hospital, 30 Covid patients belong to Ludhiana wile 20 are from outside. On Friday, police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal shared an advisory on Facebook, urging people to not to call their relatives to the district for treatment. “Please do not call your relatives and friends for Covid treatment in Ludhiana. This is choking our hospital infrastructure as beds are almost full,” he wrote. The hospitals are also battling severe staff crunch in these pressing times. “Nearly 80% of our staff is deployed on Covid duty. The doctors are hard pressed and working till long hours to save the lives of those suffering from ailment,” said Dr Baldeep of Deep hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-patients-kin-set-out-on-frantic-hunts-for-beds-as-ludhiana-hospitals-run-full-to-capacity-101619814890782.html
01-05-2021||Chandigarh||No ventilator facility in govt hospitals of 4 Punjab districts||No government-run hospital in Bathinda, southern Punjab’s largest city, is equipped with ventilators to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients even as the pandemic is already into its second year. This despite the fact that the assembly constituencies state cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal and Gurpreet Singh Kangar represent in the Punjab assembly are in Bathinda district. As a result, patients ailing with level-3 infection are forced to shell out 25 times for life support in private hospitals. Even the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, a central government-run healthcare facility, started ventilator facility only on Friday. The hospitals in the district, including private facilities, have about 700 beds for level-2 (needing oxygen support and level-3 patients wherein critically ill are put on ventilator support. Also, the ventilator facility is not available in government-run health care facilities in Mohali, Moga and Fatehgarh Sahib districts. Doctors say a patient may have to pay ₹1,000 a day for ventilator facility at a government hospital while private centres charge from ₹15,000-25,000 for the same. Government hospitals in Moga district earlier had two ventilators which were given to the Faridkot Medical College last year. The government hospitals in the district have 79 beds for level-2 patients. Therefore, all critical patients are referred to GMC Faridkot. “It is an utter failure of the state government that government sector hospitals were not equipped with ventilators. The government claims to have spent a whopping ₹1,000 crore to strengthen healthcare infrastructure since the Covid outbreak. Bathinda is a glaring example of deplorable facilities in civil hospitals,” said public health activist Dr Vitull K Gupta, also president of Association of Physicians of India (Malwa chapter). Even as there are eight civil hospitals in Fatehgarh Sahib district, none has ventilator facility for Covid-19 patients. Critical patients are either shifted to Gian Sagar Medical College or Patiala-based Rajindra Hospital. Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh has given grant to the district administration to arrange ventilators. Not even a single government hospital in Mohali district, which is represented in the assembly by state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, has a ventilator.

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ventilators in many Punjab hospitals lying unused for want of trained staff amid Covid surge||Ventilators in several government hospitals in Punjab are lying out of use amid a health emergency in the wake of the second coronavirus outbreak in the state and elsewhere in the country, exposing the health department’s lack of preparedness to fight the pandemic. In most cases, the ventilators are lying idle as the hospitals don’t have the requisite trained staff to operate them. In Amritsar district, the government and private hospitals have 300 ventilators of which 200 of them are reserved for Covid-19 patients. “Of these, only 30-40 remain occupied. We are prepared for the worst scenario,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh.Amritsar Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) medical Superintendent Dr KD Singh said, “We have 137 ventilators at the hospital, but 50 of them have not been installed yet. We are waiting for technicians to install them. The demand for oxygen beds has increased drastically in the past few days.”A senior doctor said even as the GMCH has enough ventilators to handle rising number of cases, it is short of manpower to operate the equipment. “For every five patients on ventilator, we need four anesthesiologists and as many as technicians and X-Ray technicians besides 20 staff nurses for three shifts in a day. We don’t have enough specialist doctors. Besides, many doctors go on quarantine leave after catching the infection. We have deputed some anesthesiologists and technicians from the civil hospital here due to staff shortage,” he added. In the neighbouring Gurdaspur district, there are only 2 ventilators at a government hospital but they are lying non-operational in the absence of required staff. “We refer critical level-3 Covid patients to Amritsar GMCH,” said Gurdaspur civil surgeon Dr Harbhajan Rao. In Pathankot district, all the 18 ventilators in government hospitals are lying non-operational. Civil surgeon Dr Harbinder Singh said, “We do not have level-3 facility for Covid-19 patients in government hospitals. Also, there is no intensive care unit (ICU) at or specialist doctors to treat patients on ventilators. But we have 13 ventilators in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.” In Tarn Taran district, three ventilators in government hospitals are lying out of use due to staff shortage. “We have 20 level-3 beds in private hospitals but we refer patients to GMC Amritsar for ventilator support. We do not have infrastructure and doctors for treating patients on ventilators in government hospitals,” said civil surgeon Dr Rohit Mehta. In Rupnagar district, none of the 10 ventilators in government hospitals is operational. The administration has written to the higher authorities to make arrangements so that they could handle critical patients. Also, government hospitals in Ferozepur, Fazilka, Mansa and Muktsar districts have seven, six and four each ventilators, respectively, and all of them are not in use. Fazilka civil surgeon Dr Harinder Singh said, “Our team of doctors is learning to use ventilators. The civil hospital may not be a designated government institute to handle a Covid patient with level-3 complications but we will try to provide them life support.” In Jalandhar district, 45 of a total of 165 ventilators in 62 hospitals are occupied, as per details shared by the district administration. In the Jalandhar civil hospital, all of the 18 ventilators were functional with 16 of them in use, officials claimed. Faridkot, Patiala, SBS Nagar districts fare betterGuru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH), Faridkot, which caters to south Malwa districts of Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot, has six Covid-19 patients on life support system. The hospital has 76 ventilators on standby in its 450-bed isolation facility. GGSMCH medical superintendent Dr Shilekh Mittal said the occupancy of level-2 and level-3 beds with oxygen requirement has witnessed a sudden increase. Presently, 270 Ccovid patients, including 65 level-3 patients, are undergoing treatment at the hospital. The Rajindra Medical College and Hospital, Patiala, has nearly 100 ventilators which health department officials claimed are functional with adequate staff to operate them. The hospital is currently getting critically ill patients from Ludhiana, Sangrur and Fatehgarh Sahib districts besides the National Capital Region (NCR).“We are having optimum oxygen and trained staff for ventilators round the clock,” said Patiala Development Authority chief administrator Surbhi Malik, who is Covid-19 nodal officer at Rajindra Hospital.In SBS Nagar district, the administration claimed that all 10 ventilators in hospitals are functional. Civil surgeon Dr Gurdeep Singh Kapoor said they have opened ventilator facilities at government hospitals for patients admitted to private hospitals for free. In Hoshiarpur district too, 10 ventilators installed at the civil hospital were functional, an official said. In Ludhiana, all 16 ventilators are occupied.

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing case: Sikh outfits burn copies of HC verdict, term it political, flawed||Protesting against Punjab and Haryana high court verdict quashing reports filed by special investigation team (SIT) led by former inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in Kotkapura firing case, Sikh outfits, led by former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh, on Friday burned the copies of the judgment while terming it ‘political and flawed’. Number of activists of Sikh outfits and political parties gathered at Kotkapura main chowk, where the firing incident had taken place in 2015. The protesters, who refrained from observing Covid appropriate behaviour, held placards, one of which read ‘Justice did Injustice to Sikhs’. Bhai Ranjit Singh alleged that the judiciary was biased and the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government betrayed the Sikhs in sacrilege-related cases and Maur bomb blast case. “Badals were voluntarily playing into the hands of the establishment to enjoy power, perks and privileges,” he added. Former leader of opposition and Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira said by burning the copies, they have registered their protest against the ‘flawed judgment’, which is totally unacceptable to the people. “Sikh community is upset over the miscarriage of justice. Our act was on the lines of agitating farmers burning three contentious farm laws in Punjab. It’s a democratic form of protest as this verdict has killed all hopes of justice in aggrieved families and Sikh community,” he added. SAD (Democratic) leader and Lehragaga MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa said, “We don’t expect any justice from the present state government as the HC verdict has reflected its utter failure to defend the SIT report in the court.” Dal Khalsa spokesman Kanwar Pal Singh said denial of justice in sacrilege-related cases will push the state back to 80s. Sukhraj Singh, son of Bhagwan Krishan who was killed in Behbal Kalan firing incident, MLA Balwinder Singh Bains, MLA Kultar Sandhwan, MLA Pirmal Singh and ex-MP Sadhu Singh were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-case-sikh-outfits-burn-copies-of-hc-verdict-term-it-political-flawed-101619813929835.html
01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab defers inoculation for 18+, Haryana to start drive today||The Punjab government on Friday deferred the inoculation for 18-45 years category due to “non-availability” of the vaccine. However, Haryana’s home and health minister Anil Vij told PTI that the vaccination for the 18-plus category in the state will start from Saturday. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh made it clear that “due to non-availability of vaccine, Phase III of vaccination for the 18-45 age group cannot be started as scheduled”. He also said all vaccinations at private health facilities will remain suspended from Saturday. Amarinder said as the balance of unutilised vaccines had to be returned to the government of India by all private health facilities by Friday evening, these facilities will have no vaccines to administer from Friday for 45+ population, while they could not vaccinate 18-45 age group as they had no supplies for the same. According to an official statement, Singh said his government was pursuing the matter of vaccine shortage with the Centre, as the situation was critical. “The state had received two-lakh doses but that was not sufficient even to meet the two days’ requirement of the 45+ age group,” said Singh, while reviewing the Covid vaccine situation at a virtual meeting. However, Anil Vij said, “We have got the message from the SII and more vaccines are reaching us. The rollout for the 18-45 year category will start tomorrow as scheduled”. Vij further said Haryana has sought 40 lakh doses from the SII and 26 lakh from Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin. “We will get these in phases,” he said. However, Haryana is still to receive the vaccine meant for 18-plus category.Punjab officials said in the meeting that an order for procurement of 30 lakh doses of Covishield for the age group of 18-45 years was placed with the SII on April 26, only to be told that the availability of vaccine will be known in four weeks. A senior Punjab health department official said, “In the video-conferencing with the Centre, we were told that Serum Institute of India (SII) will supply 3-lakh doses, from the bookings made by the state, in May only. However, we are writing to the SII to be specific with the dates so that we can start the drive for 18-plus category.” Further, the SII had asked the Punjab government to indicate demand for the next three-four months, with advance payments to be made. They had informed the government that supplies would be delivered in a phased manner, every month, the statement said.

The court also warned that any failure in providing the drug in adequate quantity would be considered a breach of Article 21 (Right to Life) and attract penal provisions against erring officials.HC’s directions came after these districts, in the past 10 days, had a backlog of the drug, used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.With this order, Nagpur will get 15,000 additional vials of Remdesivir, while Bhandara and Akola will get 2,000 and 3,000 vials, respectively.A division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, while hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL), passed the order after a five-hour marathon hearing.“If we do not rise to the occasion, it would lead to unmitigated disaster,” the court noted while asking the state to respect the right to life of all citizens and reminding it about the duty to provide all necessary health infrastructure to fight this pandemic.Senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Vijay Waghmare, who is the nodal officer for Remdesivir, informed the court that till Thursday, the state had received 308,000 vials, while another 34,000 vials are in transit, and 94,000 vials are expected in the next two days. HC asked the officer to finalise a district-wise plan and fix entitlement of each district by Friday night and disburse the Remdesivir received as per Centre’s revised allotment letter, dated April 24. HC expressed dismay to note that despite repeated orders, such entitlement order has not been passed so far. Amicus curiae (friend of court) Shreerang Bhandarkar and Indian Medical Association’s counsel advocate Bhanudas Kulkarni informed HC that From April 21-30 (barring April 28-29), Nagpur had received 23,198 vials, with a shortfall of 25,479 vials, as per the Centre’s allotment formula based on active patient load.The senior officers present during the hearing informed that around 3,500 vials are being received and later allotted around 4,423 vials for Nagpur. At Akola, the daily requirement of Remdesivir vials is 900, while there is a deficit of 300-500 vials per day. Similarly, Bhandara requires 1,110 vials per day but receives only 200. Similar shortfalls are reported from all districts. HC noted that the entire state is reeling under acute shortage of Remdesivir, but considering the number of serious patients admitted in these districts, at least additional 25,000 vials are required for Vidarbha districts, and they must be supplied by the state. HC asked the state to discontinue the private purchases of Remdesivir, as it is leading to more confusion. The state can invoke powers under Disaster Management Act to go for direct purchase by discarding tender process and get it from private manufacturer for the price finalised by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority. HC again reminded private hospitals and doctors to use Remdesivir judiciously and stop its indiscriminate prescription. The World Health Organization (WHO) and medical experts have described it only as an investigational drug. But some of the doctors are not paying any heed to WHO guidelines and expert opinion, HC lamented. It directed private hospitals to not give direct prescription to patient or relatives to procure Remdesivir on their own and avoid prevailing chaos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-orders-state-to-allot-20k-remdesivir-vials-to-nagpur-akola-bhandara-101619813809121.html

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab working on revival of 12 pvt oxygen plants to meet demand||Battling with rising oxygen demand due to the devastating second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, Punjab is making efforts to revive and re-energise about a dozen small and medium oxygen plants to augment the supply of life-saving gas in the state. These plants located in Mandi Gobindgarh, Pathankot, Muktsar, Bathinda, Ludhiana and Fatehgarh Sahib and having an installed capacity of more than 20 metric tonnes have been lying defunct or manufacturing oxygen for industrial or captive use. The state authorities, particularly the industries department, are trying for their revival and expediting medical oxygen licenses to units producing industrial oxygen. Director-cum-secretary, industries, Sibin C said the department had identified a dozen-odd such plants for revival and re-energisation of their oxygen plants and facilitating grant of licenses for medical oxygen supply to try and meet the rising demand. Punjab, which is seeing a sharp spike in oxygen demand due to the rising trajectory of Covid cases and panic buying, presently requires 200 to 210 metric tonnes of medical oxygen daily on an average. The state has been managing so far with almost 70% of its supplies coming from the quota allocated by the Centre and the remaining from oxygen generation units in the state barring an occasional hiccup, according to sources. The oxygen demand is expected to jump by 50 to 100 MT in a week or so, according to official projections. Sibin said two units in Pathankot and Mandi Gobindgarh started supplying 550 oxygen cylinders to hospitals on Thursday. Another four units are expected to start the supply of medical oxygen cylinders to hospitals across the state within a week. The air separation unit (ASU) of Green Field Industries Private Limited in Muktsar, which was set up in 1996 and has been lying idle for the past eight years, is being renovated at a cost of ₹20 lakh and will resume its operations in a week’s time and start supplying 400 oxygen cylinders per day. Company owner Rajvir Singh said he had shut the ASU after a jump in power tariffs in the state and started oxygen refilling by procuring liquid oxygen from Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. “The administration and a company, Setia Paper Limited, have come forward to help renovate the plant,” he said. Ramesh Chander of Ajay Gases in Mandi Gobindgarh, which supplies industrial oxygen, is expecting the license for manufacturing medical oxygen from the Food and Drug Administration anytime. “We have been supplying 500 medical oxygen cylinders for the past three days, pending license for medical oxygen. There is a separate unit with capacity to refill 1,200 cylinders per day, but we are not getting liquid oxygen despite efforts,” he said. Also, Ludhiana-based Aarti Steel is exploring the option of setting up a five tonne per day pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plant whereas Modern Steel, Fatehgarh Sahib, has started the process to install a compressor at its PSA for filling cylinders, according to government sources. However, two plants in Amritsar and Bathinda have not been found to be feasible as they have been lying closed for the past five years. The chief minister’s office (CMO) is monitoring the progress. Industries and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora had also on Thursday directed the officials to expedite the licensing process for closed oxygen plants. BATHINDA REFINERY TO SUPPLY O2 HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL), which has an installed oxygen capacity of 35 metric tonnes per day, is getting ready to supply oxygen. The company has placed an order with a Noida-based firm for installation of compressor at the outlet of PSA for filling oxygen cylinders. The compressor will be sourced from Italy and the installation work is expected to be completed by May-end, according to sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-working-on-revival-of-12-pvt-oxygen-plants-to-meet-demand-101619812851970.html

Charing a virtual emergency meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the six worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala and Amritsar, the CM said: “Lockdown is not a solution as it will lead to exodus of labourers and force them to go to states with even lesser medical facilities.” The CM also directed the district administrations to enforce restrictions strictly and to stop dine-in facility in high positivity areas, with Covid testing of staff in restaurants by the health department. Urging the industry to set up Covid treatment centres and makeshift hospitals, he stressed on the teamwork to fight the pandemic.He also directed the chief secretary to encourage retired doctors and nurses to rejoin for handling Covid facilities and suggested setting up of temporary healthcare facilities in halls or gymnasiums. Micro-containment strategy must be strictly implemented and encouraged, he said.Amarinder expressed concern over the fact that 14 districts in the state currently had over 10% positivity rate and five had more than 60% bed occupancy. A prefabricated 10-bedded hospital will come up at Mohali and a 250-bedded temporary hospital is being set up near Bathinda refinery, with oxygen supply from the refinery, he said, urging all departments to be prepared for the peak and identify areas in the various districts for establishment of temporary hospitals. Additional 2,000 beds for Covid patients are being added in the state, he said. Strict action against black marketers: CMAmarinder warned of strict action against black marketing, hoarding of oxygen cylinders or smuggling of the life-saving gas out of Punjab.Urging private hospitals to increase beds, he said these would be supplied adequate oxygen by the government agencies and no punitive action will be taken in case of any mishap due to lack of oxygen.Even as health minister Balbir Sidhu expressed concern over people of Punjab not getting space in hospitals due to patients coming from outside, the CM said he was not in favour of refusing hospital care to any patient from other state. The CM said he had spoken to the Union home minister for additional oxygen allocation to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-no-solution-enforce-covid-restrictions-strictly-capt-101619812669583.html

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||550 court employees infected with Covid in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday said that at least 550 court employees in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are Covid positive. In a statement, the high court said that a large number of officials and their families are afflicted with Covid and numbers are increasing rapidly. As on April 29, two judges of high court, three judicial officers and 62 other officials are positive. In district courts, around 100 judicial officers and 400 other court employees are positive, the high court said, adding that a spouse of a judicial officer in Punjab has succumbed to the virus and an employee in high court too has died. There are around 20,000 employees in high court and district courts in the two states and Chandigarh. The statement appears to have come in the wake of Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association (PHHCBA) threatening to launch an agitation demanding that cases be listed without the “online mentioning” process. The high court said that in view increasing Covid infections, the courts are functioning in a restrictive manner. It further said that cases will be taken up through video conferencing only. Urgency of cases for listing will be determined by the judges nominated by the chief justice. All pending matters listed for hearing between May 1 and May 28 have been adjourned for hearing in August and September. The high court also said that in case of urgency, a lawyer can request for advancing of hearing on old cases through online mentioning. The PHHCBA, acting on the move, passed a resolution requesting the high court to withdraw the order on listing of cases through mentioning. “The executive committee will be left with no other alternative but to resort to agitation mode in case the needful is not done within seven days,” Bar president GBSD Dhillon said adding, that the Bar was not kept in loop while taking a decision. The high court had restarted physical hearing of cases in February. However, it was suspended last week in view of rising number of cases. Now, cases are being taken up through video conferencing and listing of cases in most categories is being decided after an online mentioning for the same is done. The approval is granted for hearing by designated judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/550-court-employees-infected-with-covid-in-punjab-haryana-chandigarh-hc-101619811889514.html

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||Three Punjab-origin brothers get life term for murder in UK||Three Indian-origin brothers found guilty of stabbing to death a 22-year-old man in a dispute in London over a year-and-a-half ago have been sentenced to life imprisonment by a UK court.Kamal Sohal, 23, Sukhminder Sohal, 25, and Michael Sohal, 28, were found guilty of the September 2019 murder of Osvaldo de Carvalho in the Acton area of west London following a trial at Croydon Crown Court in south London on February 16.At the same court on Thursday, Kamal Sohal was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 22 years and Sukhminder and Michael Sohal were both sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 19 years before being considered for parole.Antoine George, 24, a fourth man found guilty of manslaughter in the case, was sentenced to nine-year imprisonment.“This is a particularly tragic case with Osvaldo’s family having to live with the pain of his loss. We know there had been previous hostility between these two groups and sadly that culminated in the events that unfolded that evening,” said Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Vicky Tunstall, who led the investigation for the Metropolitan Police Specialist Crime South Command.“The Sohal brothers had no qualms about arming themselves and – in Kamal’s case – running down a busy main road waving the weapon around in full view of all those around. They then subjected Osvaldo – who had no chance of defending himself – to a brutal and sustained attack. Osvaldo’s family, I hope, can find some comfort to their pain, knowing that his attackers have now been given lengthy prison sentences,” she said.During the trial, the court heard the convicted men and Osvaldo had been involved in an ongoing dispute when Sukhminder and Michael met Osvaldo and two of his friends on September 24, 2019. They went on to call their brother, Kamal, for support and reinforcement.On receiving this call, Kamal grabbed a large hunting knife which he “brazenly brandished” as he ran along the Uxbridge Road in west London to the scene from his home nearby. George, who had also been in the house, went with Kamal to the scene of the dispute.After his arrival and following a brief chase the three men in the victim’s group ran from the scene; the two friends heading one way, and Osvaldo running a different way.Witnesses described him being chased by a group of men, some armed with knives. They caught up with Osvaldo, surrounded him and stabbed him, and then ran off leaving Osvaldo lying on the ground dying. The three brothers left the scene and returned to Kamal’s address, the Met Police said.“Knife crime has a huge, terrible impact on our communities and I hope the sentencing today reflects the seriousness with which violence of this kind will be taken, and deters potential offenders from carrying dangerous weapons,” said DCI Tunstall.“Reducing violent crime in communities across London continues to be the Met’s top priority. We are working tirelessly – day and night – to take weapons off the street, engage and reassure the public, and keep our communities safe,” she added.Later, George is said to have left the area in a car which had been parked on the driveway outside Kamal’s flat. A post-mortem examination revealed that Osvaldo had suffered multiple stab wounds, including a deep wound to his left leg which would have been caused by significant force. But the fatal wound was a stab wound to his back which was so deep it nearly passed through his body.The Met Police found that in a bid to cover their tracks, later that evening Michael and Sukhminder had set fire to clothes they had been wearing at the time of the stabbing.During the police investigation, it was found that on the day of the murder, George and Sukhminder Sohal went to a shop in Hounslow, south-west London, that sold knives and purchased the weapons used and transported them to Kamal’s flat. But the court heard that those weapons were never recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-punjab-origin-brothers-get-life-term-for-murder-in-uk-101619811709531.html

01-05-2021||Chandigarh||14.77 lakh people inoculated in Himachal||Himachal Pradesh has inoculated 14.77 lakh people, of which 2.37 lakh have been administered the second dose as well, a government spokesperson said on Friday. The spokesperson said the number of Covid positive cases was increasing in the state but most patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. “These cases are recommended to be kept under home isolation, as per, revised guidelines issued by the government of India. All Covid positive patients that do not have any symptoms and have oxygen saturation of over 94% are clinically asymptomatic cases,” said the spokesperson. While all positive cases with fever or upper respiratory tract symptoms without any shortness of breath and an oxygen saturation of over 94% are clinically assigned as mild cases and should isolate at home. He said COVID positive patients must isolate in a separate, well-ventilated room and away from other people at home, especially elderly and those with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and renal disease. He said the patient should at all times use triple-layer medical mask and discard the mask after eight hours of use. Patient must take a healthy diet, rest and drink lots of fluids to maintain adequate hydration. Hand hygiene, using soap and water and washing hands for at least 40 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand rub are a must. “The patient must be in communication with their physician and promptly report in case of deterioration. The patient or care giver must keep monitoring their health,” he said. He said immediate medical attention must be sought if serious signs or symptoms develop such as difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation, persistent pain or pressure in the chest or mental confusion or inability to move. Patients under home isolation will end isolation after 10 days of onset of systems and three days after breaking fever. There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over. Regarding medicines in home isolation, he said, it has been categorically advised not to attempt procurement or administration of remdisivir at home. There is limited role of oral steroids too. However, inhalational Budesonide can be added if symptoms do not resolve after five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/1477-lakh-people-inoculated-in-himachal-101619810929573.html

The duo has been arrested for culpable homicide in connection to the April 23 fire that had killed 15 Covid-19 patients at the Virar hospital.Dr Shah and Dr Pathak are lodged in Thane jail, said additional public prosecutor Jaiprakash Patil, who appeared for the state. Opposing Dr Shah and Dr Pathak’s bail pleas, Patil said before the court that only six fire extinguishers were in working condition when the blaze broke out, while 14 extinguishers were non-functional and their operational validity had expired. Patil also submitted that the hospital management had ignored the renewal of the working permits of extinguishers.He further argued that the hospital had not applied for a fire audit to obtain the mandatory no objection certificate (NOC) from the Vasai civic body. Patil also said that the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) in its report said that the hospital “under-used” the sanctioned power supply and was not running on optimum power. On these grounds, the hospital is liable for negligence, Patil submitted.Defence counsel Siddhesh Naik said the fire was caused by the excess presence of oxygen in the ICU and hence the duo should be tried for death due to negligence not amounting to culpable homicide and that it would be unfair to keep them inside the Thane jail during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the court rejected the bail pleas of the two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-hospital-fire-vasai-court-rejects-bail-pleas-of-ceo-director-101619810868912.html

01-05-2021||Other||This April was cooler than usual for Mumbai, says IMD||The city saw a cooler-than-usual April this year, according to the India Meteorological Department. Though officials did not provide comparative numbers for previous years, they confirmed that temperatures have been lower during the ongoing pre-monsoon season and unlike last year, the state also did not see any heat waves. They attributed this largely to the consistent present of rain-bearing weather systems over parts of central India (including parts of western and central Maharashtra). The minimum temperature remained slightly higher, with an average of 25.21 degrees Celsius for April (up from a normal of 24.2 degrees Celisus), as per the IMD’s automatic weather station in Santacruz. The average maximum temperature reading of 33.8 degrees Celsius for the month was just above the normal reading of 33.2 degrees Celsius. “A persistent low level wind discontinuity over the state has also brought in moisture from the Arabian Sea, which is one of the factors why Mumbai in particular has not seen above normal temperatures. Even Pune has seen a cooler-than-usual April due to thunderstorms and frequent precipitation,” said a spokesperson at IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. While the highest daytime reading last month stood at 35.8 degrees Celsius on April 7, it remained at just above 33 degrees Celsius on most other days, settling around 34 degrees Celsius only in the past week. On Friday, the mercury in Mumbai dipped to 33.4 degrees Celsius, but it is expected to climb to about 35 degrees Celsius by May 5. Partly cloudy sky with possibility of thunder lightning has been predicted for Saturday and Sunday. There are no predictions of a heatwave at present, though officials have warned that temperatures will rise sharply this month once the influencing weather systems dissipate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-april-was-cooler-than-usual-for-mumbai-says-imd-101619810269979.html

It added that the mobile phone on which Hiran was called was purchased by Vaze and the SIM in it was provided by Gor, said NIA.The federal agency further claimed that if released, Gor could jump the bail and tamper with the evidence.Gor approached the special NIA court for bail, claiming that he was never contacted by Vaze, an assistant Mumbai Police inspector, who is under suspension.Gor in his bail plea filed through law firm, Diamondwala & Co, claimed that he has been made a scapegoat by the investigating agency at the instance of Vaze. He has also claimed that he was not aware of any conspiracy or the purpose for which the SIM cards were going to be used.The 31-year-old cricket bookie was arrested by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad on March 21, after it started investigating Hiran’s murder. Later, his custody was handed over to NIA, when the federal agency took over the case from ATS.According to NIA, Hiran’s murder was linked to the explosive-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia. On February 25, the Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note, and a case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day.Vaze was originally investigating the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and had reported it stolen on February 17. Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it on February 5.NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was arrested on March 13. The federal agency took over the murder case on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in both the cases.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged management of the case. He subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours. When no action was forthcoming, Singh approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, CBI conducted an inquiry and registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-cops-bookie-part-of-vaze-s-plan-to-kill-hiran-nia-101619809881892.html

The agency moved an application before the special CBI court on Friday , seeking permission to submit the report. The court accepted the report filed in a sealed envelope.On April 21, the central agency registered a case against Deshmukh under sections 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and 120B of the Indian Penal Code.The first information report (FIR), based on Singh’s allegations, came after CBI was ordered to conduct a preliminary enquiry by the Bombay high court on April 5.Singh took legal recourse after his March 20 letter to the chief minister and the governor, alleging that Deshmukh ordered Mumbai police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars. His complaint came after he was removed as commissioner for his handling of the Antilla explosives case.An SUV laden with explosives (20 loose sticks of gelatin; no timer or detonator) was found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, in south Mumbai on February 25. Vaze, who was part of the Mumbai crime branch, was initially lead investigator in the case. However, after a Thane-based businessman linked to the car, turned up dead, Vaze was transferred out of his department. He was later arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as prime suspect in the explosives case. He has also been named suspect in the murder investigation of the businessman, Mansukh Hiran.Deshmukh, a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government sought to brazen out the issue initially as Singh approached the Supreme Court seeking a CBI investigation into the alleged extortion racket. The top court refused to intervene and said Singh could approach the high court. Deshmukh resigned citing moral grounds after the high court asked the CBI to conduct the preliminary inquiry within 15 days and left it to the discretion of the agency’s director to decide the further course of action.In its FIR, CBI claimed, “The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence was made out in the matter, wherein the then home minister of Maharashtra Shri Anil Deshmukh and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty.”“The enquiry has also revealed that Shri Sachin Vaze, assistant police inspector, Mumbai Police, had been reinstated into the police force after being out of the service for more than 15 years.

Later, the controller of examination had said the exams would be held from April 30 but soon that decision was withdrawn.In terms of examinations, the PRO said the meeting of the examination committee will be held shortly and the decision would be conveyed to the stakeholders via appropriate mediums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-university-constituent-colleges-to-remain-closed-till-july-4-101619809368843.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Class 10 internal assessment: The hurdles ahead for Maharashtra board||A few days after the state government cancelled Class 10 (SSC) exams in the state, the education department is weighing in all its options to draw up a fair marking criterion for students. With the academic futures of nearly 17 lakh students at stake, the government needs to first address all the challenges concerning the options that are being considered in place of physical exams.Cancellation of examsOn April 20, the state government following a cabinet meeting decided to cancel Class 10 state board exams owing to growing Covid-19 infections and resultant lockdown. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that students will be marked based on internal assessments. Since then, the state education department has held numerous consultation meetings with various stakeholders including schools, teachers, parents, educationists and technology firms to assess and understand feasible ways of marking students.Anticipating future challengesSome suggestions that were discussed in a few of these meetings included promoting all students and conducting entrance tests for junior college admissions, marking students based on internal exams conducted at the school level, marking students based on their cumulative performance of two-three years etc. Experts who have been a part of these discussions said that while the specifics of each of these options can be worked out later, what also needs to be looked into is the challenges they are likely to pose in future and address them right away. “For instance, if we promote all students without giving them scores, these students might get a college seat because the state will look into it. But they might have problems when they apply for a job, for instance, where the requirement is 50% pass marks in Class 10 exams. These seem minor challenges but it is imperative to address them now to avoid future confusion,” said an expert on the condition of anonymity.Need mechanism for internal assessmentsWhile the education department is mulling the use of scores of internal assessments, experts said there needs to be a mechanism in place to identify and fix the possible inflation of scores. “Schools are likely to inflate marks when it’s left up to them. Hence, it will be better if their inputs are compared with data from the board over the years. The state board has data on school wise and subject wise performance of students across the state. For instance, if the number of distinction holders in a school has always been 10% of the total students and this year the number goes to 20 or 30%, then that deviation can be caught and identified,” said an official. The state board had not asked schools to conduct exams in a specified format this year. As a result of this, many worry that school data on internal assessments might not be consistent.Experts also said that the government needs to ensure that the solution that it comes up with is as fair as possible. “Conducting an entrance exam, for instance, will be unfair because students have not been informed about this in advance. Suddenly, we cannot ask students to write an exam which they are not prepared for. Also, there are various questions about who will set the papers, what the syllabus for these exams will be etc. which will add to the anxiety of students,” said Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board.The challenge of equivalenceRizwana Shaikh, a teacher from a government-aided school in Mumbai said, “The government needs to strike a right balance between equivalence and assessing the child’s performance in the best possible way at the moment. Our students should not lag behind their counterparts from other boards during admissions.” Some solutions the state board has come up with in the last few years to bring about a level playing field for state board students vis-a-vis other boards comprise best-of-five scores of six subjects are considered for calculating overall scores of students. The others include setting aside 20 of 100 marks for internal assessments such as orals and practicals, and between 3 and 25 bonus marks for excelling in areas such as sports, drawing and different performing artsOfficials from the education department said they are awaiting the assessment criteria from CBSE and ICSE before they can finalise their own. This year, the CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE and IB have all decided to cancel physical exams and go with internal assessments and predicted grades for Class 10 students.OPTIONS BEING EXPLORED BY THE BOARD- Internal assessments: Schools will be asked to submit data of internal scores. This data can then be cross verified with the trend for the last year/s and student scores can be calculated with the help of statistical tools.- Entrance exams at junior college level: Junior colleges where competition is fierce can conduct entrance tests at their level. In a recent meeting with principals of colleges, however, it was conveyed that colleges are not equipped to conduct such exams and hence the board will have to handle it if needed.- Calculating cumulative scores: An overall performance of a student over a period of time (2-3 years) will be assessed to arrive at his/her scores for the exam.Boardwise numbersClass 10 student data (2020)SSC: 17,54,367CBSE: 73,484ICSE: 23,336||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-internal-assessment-the-hurdles-ahead-for-maharashtra-board-101619808708904.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Case in cities decline, rural areas a concern||Till a week ago, five districts were contributing the greatest number of cases to Maharashtra’s daily infection and death tally: Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Thane. By April end, two of these districts – Mumbai and Pune -- have begun to record a decline in the numbers, though experts said it is still too early to see this as cause for cheer, as the state’s surge now seems to be driven from rural parts of the state and smaller districts with poorer health care infrastructure. Since mid-March, Maharashtra has seen a sharp uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases. In the week ending April 8, the daily average of new cases reported from Maharashtra was 51,469. In the week ending April 29 the average daily new cases were 63,652. According to Union health ministry figures, Maharashtra also led the surge in deaths reported over a 14-day period: 45.2% between February 18 to March 3; 42.7% in the first fortnight of April. Though it is no longer leading the surge in latter metric anymore, it continues to remain the most affected state in the country. “During the first wave, the virus spread from big cities to smaller ones and then to the peripheral/rural areas. This time it may not be exactly same this time, we expect the curve to tread on similar lines. The districts or the cities with weak health infrastructure and weaker tracking-testing fail to contain the spread effectively. In some districts like Sangli and Amravati which border neighbouring states, the spread become difficult to contain because of the inter-state mobility,” an official from state health department said on condition of anonymity. The surge is no longer coming from densely populated urbanized districts like Mumbai, Thane and Pune, but from smaller ones like Nashik, Ahmednagar, Hingoli and Yavatmal among others, where the tertiary infrastructure is not well developed. “Smaller districts like Hingoli, Parbhani, Ratnagiri do not have tertiary care facility. We have asked these district administrations to ramp up the infrastructure so that they can take on the extra load of cases and arrest the spread,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said. The numbers bear this out. In the week between April 22 and 29, Mumbai’s active cases dropped from 82,616 to 67,255; Thane’s dropped from 80,743 to 56,973; and Pune’s from 117,337 to 104,529. In the same time period, Nashik saw a spike from 46,706 to 52,954; Sangli from 9,600 to 13,095; Chandrapur from 18,388 to 26613; and Amaravati from 6,280 to 7,243. As on April 28, 23 districts reported more growth rate than state’s rate of 1.55%, while in districts like Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Ratnagiri, it was more than 3%. The weekly test positivity rate (TPR) of these districts was high too. Nashik, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Hingoli reported more than 34% positivity rate against state’s rate of 25.38%. Simply put, TPR rises when most of the people who are getting tested are positive anddeclines when most samples tested return negative. But this rate, experts say, has to be correlated to the number of tests. Trends across the pandemic show that when tests declined, TPR went up. Nagpur district has reported 50,000 cases and 638 deaths in the week between April 24 and 30. Of these, 19,002 cases and 239 deaths were recorded in rural areas of the district. The district continues to face an acute shortage of beds and oxygen, along with anti-viral drugs, like Remdesivir. Dr Pinak Dande of Dande Multi-Speciality Hospital said, “We are virtually helpless as we cannot provide beds to new patients as several infected persons are on the waiting list. Moreover, it’s very difficult to cope with the existing patients despite doing our best because of inadequate oxygen supply and life-saving drugs.” On Friday, Nagpur added 6461 new cases while Nasik added 4,696; by comparison, Mumbai added 3,888 and Pune 10,019 new cases to the state’s tally of 62919 new infections. The state now has a total of 4.6 million cases, and the death toll rose to 68813 after the addition of 828 fresh deaths on Friday. The recovery rate in the state is now 84.06%.Experts pointed out that the surge indicated that these districts are yet to reach the peak, which will continue to drive up the state figures. Falling numbers, TPR In the first week of April, Mumbai’s daily case average stood at 9737. In the following week, the daily average dropped slightly to 8879 and to 8074 in the third week. In the ongoing fourth week of the month, the daily case average has further declined to 5628. On the other hand, the number of deaths has shown a rise. There has been a steady downward trend in testing in the city: starting April 22, the number of tests has ranged from 41,826 to 30,428 (April 27). However, Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 test positivity rate – the percentage of tests that are positive, or TPR – has been on a steady decline, data shows. From 30% on April 4, when the city recorded the highest single-day surge of 11,206 cases, the test positivity rate came down to 10.79% on April 29, with cases dropping to 4,174. Maharashtra continued to report a daily caseload of more than 60,000 cases, by reporting 62,919 fresh cases on Friday taking the tally to 4,602,472 and the death toll to 68,813 after the addition of 828 fresh deaths. Mumbai saw a further drop in cases as there was an addition of 3888 new cases, pushing the tally to 648,471 and toll to 13,125 after the addition of 89 deaths.Pune district topped the chart of new cases with 10,019 cases, including 4,365 in Pune city. The district also logged the highest, 150 deaths on Friday, while it continues to have the highest, 106,019 active cases. State’s second capital Nagpur and Nashik district reported 7,170 and 4,696 cases and 44 and 34 deaths respectively.69,710 patients recovered against 62919 new infections on Friday resulting in an improvement in the recovery rate which stands at 84.06%. This also helped to reduce the number of active patients to 662,640.State’s daily test positivity rate dropped to 21.68% after conducting 290207 tests in the last 24 hours. “It is very difficult to predict virus behaviour, but I think, what Mumbai and MMR helped in reducing the number is curbs on local train travel. Major chunk of office too has been shut down helping in reducing the crowding. But in rural areas all activities at marketplaces, wedding ceremonies continue as usual making it difficult to bring cases under control. But I believe that these areas are reaching their peak and are likely to stabilise in next few days. It would help bringing down the overall state cases,” Dr Rahul Pandit, member of state-appointed task force said. Dr Kapil Aher, district health officer of Nashik said, “The spread of virus in Nashik is rapid because of the urbanisation and mobility due to the commercial, agricultural activities. The cases in the district have started stabilising though the downward trend may take a couple of weeks to begin.” Officials said that tracking-tracing and testing in smaller districts and rural areas have been poor. “Many of our backward districts are lagging in the tracing, which needs to be more than 20 people per infection, besides the low testing. Secondly the poor health infrastructure also causes rapid spread as the infected people are not properly isolated,” the official quoted above said. The case fatality rate (CFR) is high across the state: the weekly CFR rose to 0.94%, in the week ended on April 25, from less than 0.5% a month ago. In districts like Sindhudurg and Nanded, it is 3.66% and 3.46% respectively. Dr Avinash Supe, head of the death audit committee appointed by the state government said they expect the CFR to start dropping in next few weeks. “The rise of CFR always lags behind the rise in cases by 2-3 weeks and similarly its fall comes two weeks after the cases start falling. Secondly, the percentage of mortality is not as high as it was in the first wave, when it had crossed 6-7%. Yes, in numbers the deaths are more, but we have been doing our best to bring it down. We have been interacting with rural, district level doctors virtually on individual cases helping them in clinical and ICU management and medical protocol to reduce the mortality,” he said. “The police authorities have been told to pull all strings to ensure that strict implementation of the lockdown SOPs. The administrations have been directed to ramp up tracing and testing which will help them in reducing the cases,” another official from the health department said.

01-05-2021||Mumbai||No response to Maharashtra’s global tender for O2, Remdesivir||Three days after the Maharashtra government floated a global tender to purchase liquid medical oxygen, Remdesivir injections and other essential items, it has not got any response from any company. Food and drugs administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne said the state will again float the tenders, although the shortage is not as acute as before. The list of items to be purchased include 25,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen, 40,000 oxygen concentrators, 27 oxygen ISO tanks, a million Remdesivir vials and 132 pressure swing absorption plants. The tender was floated on Tuesday on the recommendation of a three-member committee. Officials said the three-day deadline was issued as the state needs to immediately procure these items. “No company has shown any interest in supplying so far... Global tenders usually take time. As there is no response yet, the state government is thinking about issuing a fresh tender,” said Shingne. Shingne also said there is still shortage of Remdesivir injections. He said the Centre did not provide 170,000 vials of the drug which were due to come to Maharashtra till April 30, as per the schedule made by the Centre. According to the minister, the lockdown has so far only decelerated the growth in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, while the rest of Maharashtra still continues to report over 60,000 cases. So, the need for Remdesivir is significant. The state needs 65,000 vials a day. “We have around 670,000 active cases so even today, we need around 65,000-70,000 injections daily. Barring Mumbai and its suburban areas, there is no sign of decline in daily cases in the rest of Maharashtra despite the lockdown. We will still need more Remdesivir. Between April 21 and April 30, the Centre has given 170,000 fewer injections. That backlog needs to be cleared and daily 65,000-70,000 shots should be provided.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-response-to-maharashtra-s-global-tender-for-o2-remdesivir-101619808469425.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Confusion over Centre’s directive on Covid vaccine supply to private hospitals||Even as the inoculation of those between the 18-44 age group is slated to start from today, there is still a lack of clarity on the supply of vaccination to private hospitals. Some private hospitals in Mumbai have claimed that they do not have any clarity over the supply of vaccination from the government, which could reduce the pace of the drive.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said that if the Centre directs the state to not sell vaccines to private hospitals for the inoculation of citizens over age 45, the state will follow it as the vaccination drive is a national programme.“The vaccination for above age 45 is a national programme which runs as per the rules of the Centre. Today, we are vaccinating people across 4,200 centres, which including both private and government-run hospitals. If they [Centre] say that it (vaccination) should not be done in private hospitals, we will follow it,” Tope told reporters on Friday.Private hospitals across the state purchase the vaccines, which it gets from the Centre, from the local authorities to carry out the vaccination of people over age 45. Though the exact number of how many people get vaccinated in private and government-run hospitals are not available, a significant number choose private hospitals to get vaccinated, especially in urban areas.The lack of clarity could impact the pace of vaccination of the people above age 45, which is considered a “vulnerable group”. Till April 29, Maharashtra had inoculated 10,964,761 people over age 45. Of these, 1,404,673 or only 12.81% had taken their second shot.Reeling under shortage of vaccines, the drive in Mumbai has already been suspended till May 2. Some private hospital in Mumbai said that there is no clarity over how the drive will proceed after Sunday. Dr S Narayani, zonal head of Fortis Hospital, Mumbai said, “We have no clarity on the drive. We have been hearing about it (purchase from open market). We are awaiting clarification on it. As of now, we do not have any stock left.”A representative of another private hospital in Mumbai, who did not wish to be named, also said that there was no clarity. “The stock was very less in this week. We have not heard anything formally from the government or the local administration on what happens after May 1,” he said. Another doctor involved in the vaccination management at a private hospital in Mumbai said, “The lack of planning and clarity could hurt the state further that is reeling under the second wave. The limited quantity of stock will delay the completion of vaccination for all. The herd immunity will not develop in the population at a stage where there is talk of a third wave later this year.”When asked if the vaccination of this age category will slow down, Tope said, “Whoever has not taken their second dose will have to take it. Whether to do it at a private [hospital] or take the record and take the second dose in the public hospital, will have to be seen. It is important to complete the vaccination process.” Apart from slowing down the drive, senior health department officials said that it will put an additional burden on government and municipal bodies. “So far, a considerable number of people gets vaccinated in private hospitals. If this decision is made by the Centre, the entire traffic will be diverted to government-run centres. It will add to the chaos there,” an official said requesting anonymity.Besides that, the minister said there is no clarity if the Centre will regulate the vaccine supply for the remaining 50% stock for the 18-44 vaccination. Tope sought clarity if the state government will be given preference over private hospitals if there is high demand and low supply.As per the Centre’s orders, the two manufacturers—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—have been told to give 50% of their monthly production to the Government of India. “The remaining 50% includes state governments, private hospitals, industrial private hospitals. There is a big question mark that if there is a huge demand with the two companies, then who will they give priority to? Will the Government of India have to regulate; this is a question [before us]. So far, there is no clarification on this,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-confusion-over-centre-s-directive-on-covid-vaccine-supply-to-private-hospitals-101619808468824.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees positivity rate in single digit after 45 days||After 45 days, the city’s daily positivity rate was down to a single digit – 9.01% – on Friday, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data. Mumbai reported 3,888 cases on Friday. Of the 43,525 tested samples, 3,925 samples were positive. However, deaths continue to rise, with the city reporting 89 deaths on Friday, according to BMC data. The city’s case tally is 648,471 and toll 13,125, according to the state health department. Positivity rate is the number of positive Covid-19 cases in comparison to the total tests. On March 13, Mumbai’s daily positivity rate was 9.48%, which went up to 15% around March 20. In April, the positivity rate hovered around 11-27%, and it went down to 9.94% on Friday. The city’s highest ever positivity rate was 27.94%, reported on April 4. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 5,380,473 tests. The overall positivity rate is 11.9%. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “Our positivity in single-digit now with around 4,400 tests. Of these, 85% cases are asymptomatic today. Mumbai is perhaps the only city in India with single digit positive even with high testing.” The city’s recovery rate is 87% with 568,083 recoveries and the mortality rate is 2.02%. There are 65,670 active cases in the city. According to BMC’s data, Dahisar, Borivali, Kandivali, Malabar Hill, Grant Road, Churchgate and Colaba continue to contribute the most to the city’s daily average growth rate of 0.86%. The BMC has maintained that even though the cases are dipping, the lockdown announced by the state up to May 15 will remain in force in the city. In the past few days, the daily number of Covid-19 cases in the city has been on a decline. The highest number of cases reported in the city so far was 11,206, on April 4. By mid-April, Mumbai was reporting on 7,000-8,000 cases a day. On April 15, Mumbai reported 8,209 Covid-19 cases, which dropped to 5,867 cases on April 24. These further dropped to 3,840 cases on April 26. However, although the positivity rate has gone down, the number of deaths in the city is on the rise. A week-on-week death rise analysis of the state health department data reveals that between April 4 and April 10, 190 deaths were reported, 357 deaths in the next week between April 11 and April 17, followed by 425 deaths between April 18 and April 24. On the increasing deaths, Chahal had on April 20 said, “Mumbai had 953 deaths in the past 70 days since the second wave started with 2.66 lakh positive cases. Our death rate has been 0.03% (13.6 deaths per day). Delhi had 240 deaths in 1 day yesterday.” Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital, said, “Cases in Mumbai are going down slowly which shows that lockdown restrictions have helped in lowering Covid cases. Not only positive cases, but aggressive vaccination will also reduce fresh cases, which will result in reducing the deaths. Heavy load of active serious cases has put enormous pressure on the healthcare system, which has also resulted in increased mortality. Health infrastructure is unable to handle this sudden rise in active cases which has resulted in difficulty in getting life-saving drugs, oxygen, ICU beds for needy patients, even test reports are made available after three to four days after sample collection that is causing delay in treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-positivity-rate-in-single-digit-after-45-days-101619808409506.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes case against senior citizen booked for cheating||The Bombay high court (HC) recently quashed the first information report (FIR) and charge sheet filed against a 72-year-old south Mumbai resident, who was serving as the secretary of a society at Marine Drive, for alleged cognisable offences committed by him in 2013. The court held that as a magistrate inquiry was initiated in the matter in 2013, the complainant could not have lodged a second complaint in 2015, based on which the FIR and charge sheet were filed. The accused, Mahendra Dholakia, allegedly cheated and coerced two brothers who owned a flat in the society to sell the flat to him at a lower rate on false pretext. A bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition seeking quashing of the FIR and charge sheet, was informed by advocate Sneha Singh that an FIR was filed against her client in March 2015 and he was booked under sections 193 (giving false evidence), 211 (wrongful institution of criminal proceedings), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Singh submitted that the FIR was filed based on directions of the magistrate who took cognisance of the February 2015 complaint filed by Deepak Kriplani, under section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Following this, the charge sheet was filed in 2016. Singh then informed the court that in 2013 Kriplani had lodged a similar complaint with the magistrate, but as it was pending adjudication, the magistrate could not have taken cognisance of the second complaint. In light of these facts, she sought quashing of the FIR and charge sheet against Dholakia. Kriplani brothers had come in possession of the said flat in 2010. However, as the share certificate was misplaced, Dholakia, who was the then secretary of the society, offered to buy the flat from them at lower rate. Kriplanis then lodged a complaint of cheating against Dholakia in 2013 before the magistrate. However, the magistrate kept the inquiry pending as Kriplanis and Dholakia reached an understanding in 2014 and it was decided that Dholakia would pay a sum of ₹65 lakh for the flat. Thereafter in 2015, Kriplanis lodged the second complaint with the magistrate. Advocate Subodh Desai, for Kriplanis, submitted that the two complaints were different and hence the petition by Dholakia for quashing the FIR and charge sheet was not maintainable. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as Kriplanis had not informed the magistrate of the first complaint and as the same was alive at the time of lodging of the second complaint, the second complaint and the action initiated against it could not be maintainable and hence quashed the FIR and charge sheet. The court, however, allowed Kriplanis to challenge the rejection of the 2013 complaint by the magistrate while the HC was hearing the petition by Dholakia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-quashes-case-against-senior-citizen-booked-for-cheating-101619808348838.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra DMER extends residency of PG medical students||Days after the National Medical Commission (NMC) asked all postgraduate (PG) medical students to continue working as residents in hospitals as part of the Covid task force, the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) released a circular on Friday reinstating the decision.“We are bound by NMC rules and will have to follow it. DMER has informed all colleges in Maharashtra to ensure that NMC rules are followed,” said TP Lahane, director of DMER. He added that as of yet, there was no clarity on the period of extension from NMC.Final-year PG medical examinations have been stalled in most states due to the deterioration of Covid-19 situation. Similarly, no fresh admissions to PG medical and diploma courses were done due to the postponement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET PG) exams. Students of most PG colleges were roped in last year to augment trained manpower for treatment of Covid and non-Covid patients. The fresh NMC directive seeks to ensure that the current batch continues to serve as resident doctors to help deal with the present crisis until fresh admissions are made to PG courses and final-year examinations are held. NEET-PG exams are generally conducted in the month of February every year and the final-year examinations are generally held between April-May in colleges in the state.“The start of the 2021-2022 academic session will be delayed and the new batch of first-year PG students will join only after NEET-PG examination is held, followed by counselling to allocate colleges,” the NMC circular released on April 27 said. It further stated that the students’ continued deployment as residents will help ensure there is no shortage of hands to deal with the surge of Covid-19 cases. NMC has also advised colleges to continue providing accommodation and stipend to PG students during this extended period.Meanwhile, a group of PG students approached state health minister Rajesh Tope and asked for at least a 45-day period to prepare for their exams. “We’ve been working nonstop for some months now, left with no time to prepare for the exams. We hope the state government considers this before scheduling our final exams,” said the letter addressed to Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-dmer-extends-residency-of-pg-medical-students-101619808289334.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Urgent need to streamline Remdesivir supply, say doctors||Proprietors of small to mid-sized hospitals and nursing homes said they are struggling to obtain adequate quantities of antiviral drug Remdesivir under the new allocation system introduced in the state 10 days ago. Where hospitals were earlier able to procure vials directly from manufacturers (through medical representatives of pharma companies), they now have to obtain them from district collectors, based on requests sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“This has made the supply extremely erratic. Our need is about 40 vials per day. Before FDA stepped in, we could buy between 200 to 300 vials at a time and that would keep us steady for a short period. Now we are on our toes every day wondering how many vials will come. We get about 20 vials every two days. In the past five days, we have received stock only on three days,” said Dr Prince Surana, proprietor of Surana Hospital in Chembur which has 70 Covid beds.Under the existing protocol, a particular hospital or nursing home is eligible to receive Remdesivir for 10% of the active Covid patients under treatment, on a day-to-day basis. Each hospital raises their daily requirement with the area’s concerned health officer, who then forwards the same to FDA, which makes the doses available at the collector’s office.“But this quota is not enough. In every hospital, more than 5% of admitted patients will need Remdesivir. After all, they are admitted because their oxygen saturation is low. Every patient whose oxygen level is less than 95 should get the injection. So yes, one consequence of this system is that the drug is not reaching the facilities as per their need,” said Dr Deepak Baid, former president of Medical Consultants Association.Another consequence, doctors said, is that relatives of patients are unnecessarily sent on treasure hunts to find the drug elsewhere (usually in the black market), which is exhausting and also puts them at risk of fraud. “If we don’t have enough doses, we have to give patients’ relatives prescriptions and ask them to find vials elsewhere. But we know this is futile given the demand,” said Surana.Nevertheless, doctors largely agreed that FDA’s active oversight in the matter is required so that smaller districts do not run out of supplies, as witnessed recently in Latur, Bhandara and Aurangabad. They also said the procurement system has improved over the past 10 days, but not enough to assuage their concerns. “Initially through FDA, we were only getting about 10% of the daily need. Now we are getting about 40% of the requirement, which is also not enough. The biggest worry is whether tomorrow’s stock will come or not,” said Dr Amit Thadani, director, Niramaya Hospital in Kharghar which has 60 Covid beds. “Some days you get five doses, some day six doses, and someday 20 doses. But our requirement is about 30 to 40. We are at the mercy of the collector’s office,” he added.“The Centre has kept the control of Remdesivir supply with itself. We have streamlined its distribution through district collector to curb black marketing. The supply of Remdesivir from the Centre is still less. Compared to the schedule given to Maharashtra till April 30, we have got 170,000 fewer injections. We need 65,000-70,000 injections on a daily basis,” said FDA minister Rajendra Shingne.Even though Remdesivir has been proven to have “little or no impact” on Covid mortality, it remains in high demand, with Maharashtra’s daily requirement of around 70,000 vials. The consensus among doctors is that while it may not be a “silver bullet”, it does cut down the patient’s hospital stay and reduce their viral load. “So not having adequate doses is, in fact, a strain on the system even though the drug has little impact on mortality. In my experience, it can play an important role in recovery, especially when used in the right combination with other drugs,” said Sandeep Kothari, a chemist at CritiCare Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-urgent-need-to-streamline-remdesivir-supply-say-doctors-101619808170439.html

Delhi is currently recording at least 25,000 new Covid cases and over 300 deaths every day.At present, Delhi has 21,199 beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 5,032 are ICU beds. Besides, there are over 5,000 beds in dedicated Covid care centres and 204 in dedicated healthcare centres.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Thursday sent a list of 20 schools and six community centres to the Delhi government that could be converted into Covid isolation centres. Officials said each school can have 50 beds. The civic body runs around 360 primary schools.East civic body mayor Nirmal Jain said that they have told the Delhi government that these spaces can be immediately used for Covid patients. “We are ready to give these spaces at the earliest. We have assured that we will arrange water, electricity and sanitation facilities. The government can set up beds and other medical infrastructure. We will help in that as well,” he said.Similarly, the North MCD has also offered its primary schools to the Delhi government to convert these into Covid-19 hospitals, isolation, and care centers. The north civic body runs 714 primary schools.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash on Friday said that the municipality had written to the Delhi government on April 19, offering to convert their schools, community centres, and polyclinics into dedicated Covid facilities. He said that around 7,000 beds can be added by letting the government use the municipality-owned buildings, including nearly 5,000 beds at its primary schools. “We have assured the government that we will provide every possible help from our side to fight this pandemic. We all know that citizens are running from pillar to post to find hospital beds and any addition at this time will only help save lives,” he said.He said that they have sent a list of 100 schools where beds can be set up. “In each school building, at least 50 beds can be set up,” he said.Meanwhile, the south Delhi municipal corporation officials also said that they have offered all available resources to strengthen the public health infrastructure in the city. “We are also working with our officials to identify which schools can be offered as dedicated Covid facilities. We will be releasing the list for the government in the coming days,” said south Delhi mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh. The south corporation runs around 580 primary schools.A Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The government is keen on expanding the healthcare infrastructure as much as possible. In case these schools and community centres (offered by MCDs) are required, the government will make use of them. Some isolation centres are already operating in MCD schools in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-civic-bodies-offer-to-convert-their-buildings-to-bolster-city-s-health-infra-101619808168770.html

01-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: What will it take to make work from home stick?||As the country enters its second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, work from home (WFH) has moved from being a lockdown trend to a signal that the future of work — and the open office — is no longer what we’re used to.Murat Erer, senior insights analyst, LinkedIn, pointed out in a blog post that globally the volume of job searches using the “remote” filter increased by 60% between March and May 2020. “India leads the pack in terms of remote job application growth,” Erer said. Even the ministry of commerce is considering making WFH a permanent solution for employees of IT companies working out of special economic zones, the Economic Times reported recently.The benefits outweigh the pain, professionals agree.When the lockdown was announced in 2020, Parveen Mahtani was just over a month into her new job as chief legal officer at Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. She now believes that WFH is the ecologically-sound choice, not just because of the reduction in vehicular emissions, but also the reduced reliance on paper it necessitates.“It was tough to juggle between work and home discussions and have meetings with my kids doing their work in the background or the dog barking,” Mahtani said. But the return to WFH has one unique advantage: “Because we started relying more on document management software in 2020, it’s reduced the volume of paper we go through.”A few, like author and columnist Aparna Piramal Raje, saw productivity peak in the absence of distractions. “I could focus my complete attention towards writing my book, as there was no way to travel or do anything else,” she said.“In 2020, when the pandemic required us all to switch to remote work, it [wasn’t easy in the beginning]. Now, over a year into it, we’re looking at this as a possible new working model,” said Minakshi Achan, executive vice-president of network brand and creative head, Star & Disney India. In the pre-pandemic world, commuting between her apartment in Bandra (West) and her Parel office took an hour and a half. “Now, one isn’t stuck in traffic jams for hours.”However, WFH had its downsides. Anil Nair and Sheetal Parekh, partners in STEM card games company Pretty Geeky said their earnings dried up in 2020 as the restrictions on movement meant they couldn’t transport products from their Sion warehouse to buyers.So what will it take for WFH to become truly sustainable?Accentuating inequality According to Vivek Pandit, director, McKinsey & Co, a consultancy firm that helped its clients make the shift to WFH last year, a hybrid work model, which involves a combination of WFH and clocking in at an office would likely stay even after the second lockdown ends.He based his findings on a McKinsey survey — which built on research conducted by McKinsey Global Institute and looked at 800 jobs and 2,000 tasks carried out by working professionals in nine countries — which also pointed out that the potential for remote work is highly concentrated among “highly skilled, highly educated workers in a handful of industries, occupations and geographies”. “Remote work thus risks accentuating inequalities at a social level,” the report said.What’s more, the report stated, certain sectors lend themselves more readily to remote work. “Finance and insurance have the highest potential, with three-quarters of time spent on activities that can be done remotely without a loss of productivity. Management, business services, and information technology have the next highest potential, all with more than half of employee time spent on activities that could effectively be done remotely.”By comparison, sectors like agriculture and retail services — where a vast majority of India’s 464 million work force is employed — don’t lend themselves to remote work.All the same, the report found that globally, more than 20% of the workforce could work remotely three to five days a week as effectively as they did from an office, and if remote working took hold at that level, then at least three times as many people would be working from home than before the pandemic. This would have a profound impact on everything from transportation to consumer spending.Studies have shown that companies need to re-look at work flexibility more seriously, to enable their employees to work from their homes, as these often come with multiple demands: of space, time, and attention.“Last year, we realised that many in our team were experiencing inner turmoil. This time, we’ve been able to assure them on many levels – including on the issue of job security – and keep morale high. But a lot of organisations aren’t able to do the same,” Shobhan Kothari, partner at the award-winning architectural firm ADND, said.Recently, Columbia University looked at the experiences of 226,638 people across Asia, Europe and North America. The study found incidences of depression and anxiety across all regions on account of the deterioration of relationships and the distancing due to the pandemic. Other studies have shown how a lack of communication with employees results in anxiety, which is known to decrease work performance, reduce job satisfaction, and negatively affect interpersonal relationships at work.“A lack of vision for post-pandemic work puts talent at risk. Teams should share frequently what works and what doesn’t, and companies should listen actively,” Pandit said.Nair of Pretty Geeky believes his employees could be just as productive working from home, but Nair, himself, can’t wait to get back to an office. CEO and managing partner of advertising firm L&K Saatchi & Saatchi until 2019 – where his “office was like a lounge” -- Nair isn’t at all thrilled about going back to working at his dining table due to the second lockdown in Maharashtra. “At home, people will always talk to you when you’re on a business call.”Design solutions Space Matrix, a multinational design consultancy headquartered in Singapore, recently set up an experience centre in their Gurugram office to showcase new features that can be incorporated into the design of workspaces.“‘Work’ isn’t the operative word when it comes to designing office spaces now,” says Akshay Lakhanpal, CEO, Space Matrix, India. The beta lab – as this space is called -- also allows clients to get an idea of how a contactless design might work: with features like a café that employees need not queue up at (orders can be placed on phones), remote-parking access, touchless sign-ins and so on.Having got a taste of WFH, many executives now want to work in an environment that offers the sort of comfort that home does, he said. For those who cannot take work home, his company has found ways to bring a little touch of home to work: by introducing multisensory experiences like music and fragrance.“Over the past year many organisations have made design changes for better air circulation; placing acrylic partitions between individuals; positioning workspaces to allow for six-feet distance between individuals. But this is all so new, how efficiently it works, remains to be seen,” Kothari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-what-will-it-take-to-make-work-from-home-stick-101619808048808.html
01-05-2021||Other||In trying times, how the young wielded social media to provide succour||As anguished relatives searched for hospital beds, oxygen and medicines in these troubled times, social media platforms came alive with youngsters taking the responsibility of helping them. In Kanpur, where chaos prevailed in the third week of this month, countless people were helped. The youngsters kept tabs on availability of beds in Covid-19 hospitals. They helped with the admission of people, reached out to people who could help with procuring/refilling oxygen cylinders, arranged for medicines like Fabiflu, which had disappeared from pharmacies, and even found plasma and blood donors. Their network helped in different cities of Uttar Pradesh constantly passing on leads to each other. “People were desperately looking for genuine information and help; along with others, I built resources calling hospitals and Covid command centres about availability of beds,” said Harsh Chauhan, a law student and blogger from South Kanpur. “We check and cross-check the information, which we share on our accounts,” said Mudit Sapra, who is Covid-19 positive but continues with the work. “The biggest problem was finding ICU beds or beds with ventilators. But I will continue to work day and night till as long as this phase lasts,” he said. Punit Bhatia, working with a private firm in Alwar, Rajasthan, got help for his sinking father-in-law, and moved from Chunar to Varanasi, after he got support from one such group. He was not being admitted in any hospital, he was alone with his wife in a car with SPO2 level critically low at 60. “My friend shared the information on Twitter, and in less than an hour, a girl called Anushka Tulsyan contacted us and got a bed in the district hospital. Now, he is recovering. I can’t thank her enough and her friends,” said Punit, who is from Kanpur. Tulsyan was contacted and appraised of Bhatia’s situation by a Kanpur poet. In his 20s, he doesn’t want his identity to be known. This young poet is part of a bigger network comprising students of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, IIT Kanpur, Delhi, Jamia Milia and other institutes. Apart from beds, this group extended help with oxygen cylinders, referral letters of chief medical officer (CMO) need for hospitalisation, and medicines. They created a limited database of plasma donors whom they cajoled to donate. “The toughest part was the oxygen; looking for resources was tedious. Everyone worked tirelessly to keep sharing information about its availability. We put up doubly verified information, complete with location and phone numbers, for people to avail,” he said. Like them, Sharad Tripathi used multipleplatforms to reach out to people to help. “At a point, I was getting 200-250calls in a day for help. The number of calls had gone down now. I used mycontacts and developed resources. I think I could help one person out of 15-20people, but even that is very satisfying,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-trying-times-how-the-young-wielded-social-media-to-provide-succour-101619807929455.html
01-05-2021||Other||5 lab staff held for issuing fake Covid reports||New Delhi: Five employees of a medical diagnostics laboratory were arrested for allegedly giving out fake Covid test reports, Delhi Police said on Friday. According to Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), the arrested suspects handed out 400 such fake reports -- both positive and negative -- since April 23.The company, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, said that the reports were not generated by the lab, and added that they informed police about the wrongdoing of their employees as soon as they noticed it. The company stressed that while some of their staff were involved in the crime, the laboratory had no role to play. It added that all authentic reports have QR codes, which can be easily be used to distinguish them from the fake reports that were being handed out.Police said the probe started after 45 members of a large, extended family in south Delhi’s Khirki Extension said they received false results from Genestrings Diagnostic Centre in Sarvodaya Enclave.The family members was reportedly tested by two technicians of the lab over a few days, and some of them were declared positive for Covid-19, said DCP Thakur. One of them, Rishab Shukla, said he was given a positive result on Monday. “But Shukla didn’t have any symptoms, and decided to get himself tested at another lab again on Wednesday. This time his result was negative,” said the DCP.Shukla then went to Genestrings Diagnostics, and was shocked to learn that his name was not in their records, and that his sample had never reached them.He contacted the police, which registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy at Malviya Nagar police station. The five people arrested are application scientist Manish Kumar Singh, his two colleagues Satender and Nikhil, and two lab assistants, Pragyanand Sharma and Himanshu Sharma.Police said that initially the technicians planned to have doctors test the samples, and share the results without entering the details in the laboratory’s records. They would use the lab’s letterhead to print out a the report, and pocket the money paid by clients of for the tests. “But as the load of the samples increased, the suspects began dishing out fake results without even testing them,” the DCP said. “On being approached by a few patients to authenticate reports bearing our lab’s name, we found out that they were not issued by us, nor tested at our lab. We immediately called the local police station in-charge to investigate what seemed to be a fake report issue,” said Chetan Kohli, COO of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre.“Five of our employees were identified to be a party to this crime without the knowledge of lab management or the lab head,” he added. “All our reports have QR codes which can be easily used to check the authenticity of reports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-lab-staff-held-for-issuing-fake-covid-reports-101619807930134.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||7 held for running factory producing fake remdesivir; already sold 2,000 injections in Delhi||A BPharm graduate and a BCom graduate, both from Uttarakhand’s Haridwar, were among seven arrested on Friday for running a factory producing fake remdesivir injections, which were widely sold in Delhi and other states for huge profits, Delhi Police’s crime branch said. Vatan Kumar Saini (32), who holds BPharm and MBA degrees, and Aditya Gautam (33), a BCom graduate, told the police that they have sold more than 2,000 fake remdesivir vials in the black market through their agents in the past few weeks. The police said a 40-year-old woman events manager based in Delhi, who herself recently recovered from Covid-19, was helping them sell the fake vials in the national capital. Remdesivir injections are in huge demand across India, as Covid-19 infections surge. WHO has said there is no evidence it reduces mortality or obviates the need for ventilation in hospitalised people, but it has been found by some studies to help those in early stages of the infection who need supplemental oxygen. Delhi Police’s ongoing investigation into those arrested recently for trying to sell remdesivir injections in the black market helped them trace the vials to the manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand, the crime branch said. The crime branch said on Thursday that they carried out searches in the manufacturing facility in Uttarakhand’s Kotdwar and a trading company in Haridwar, both run by Gautam and Saini. The two were allegedly passing off injections of antibiotic azithromycin as the antiviral drug remdesivir, as the packaging of both drugs are similar. The men would replace the labels on the antibiotic vials with fake ones that they printed out, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.DCP Bhardwaj said 198 vials of the fake remdesivir, one packing machine, one barcoding machine, 3,000 empty vials and packing materials of azithromycin, an antibiotic used in the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, were seized from the factory.Thee duo was selling one remdesivir vial for around ₹6,000 to ₹10,000 to their agents, who further sold it to needy customers for prices ranging between ₹25,000 and ₹40,000. The injection is available for a price between ₹900 and 3,500, but shortages have resulted in a thriving black market. Many states have channelised sales of remdesivir . Delhi has been hit by a severe shortage of drugs such as remdesivir, faviprarir and ivermectin, a scarcity that has been exacerbated by hoarders and black marketeers who are selling them at rates 10-15 times their retail value. For instance, HT reported earlier that a dealer in north Delhi offered to sell a customer a vial of remdesivir for ₹25,000, as against an MRP ranging from ₹899 and ₹3,500.DCP Bhardwaj said police have initiated the procedure to seal Gautam’s medicine manufacturing company, “Nectar Herbs and Drugs” in Kotdwar.According to the police, the first lead about the interstate racket came when the crime branch team on April 23 arrested Mohammad Shoaib (28), and Mohan Kumar Jha (40), with 10 remdesivir vials that they were trying to sell to a decoy customer outside Batra Hospital in south Delhi. After their arrest, the two told the police that they got the vials from two others, Manish Goyal and Pushkar Chanderkant Pakhale, who were subsequently arrested on April 25 from Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar with 12 more vials of remdesivir. The duo disclosed that their main supplier was one Sadhna Sharma and she was arrested the following day from Yamuna Vihar itself. A total of 160 vials of fake remdesivir injections were recovered from her, the DCP said.“Sharma underwent treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Krishna Nagar. Sharma needed remdesivir injections for her treatment but could not get one because of its scarcity. In her efforts to obtain an injection for herself, Sharma came in contact with Saini and joined his illegal trade,” said Bhardwaj.“Prime facie, it appears that except Sharma, the other four arrested persons did not know that the injections were fake. Sharma told us that the fake injections were coming from Uttarakhand through Saini,” Bharadwaj said.On April 27, Saini was arrested from his home in Haridwar from where one packing machine, 3,000 empty vials for packing fake remdesivir injections, and packing materials of azithromycin were seized. During his interrogation, Saini pointed to Gautam, who was arrested on April 29 from Roorkee. His company premises in Kotdwar was also searched. The computer on which fake labels were prepared and 16 fake remdesivir injections were recovered, the DCP said.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria earlier this week asked doctors to exercise caution while prescribing remdesivir to patients and said the drug being used to treat Covid-19 is not a “magic bullet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/7-held-for-running-factory-producing-fake-remdesivir-already-sold-2-000-injections-indelhi-101619807928828.html
01-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body assures HC of Covid preparedness||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in its affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC) has informed that it has more than 21,000 beds in dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) and dedicated Covid healthcare centres (DCHC) in the city, of which more than 4,000 beds were vacant. The affidavit, filed in response to the allegations of mismanagement of Covid-19 treatment facilities during the second wave by state and civic authorities, also stated the civic body has sufficient supply of Remdesivir and oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients. BMC also said that it has floated tenders to install oxygen generation plants at 12 hospitals under it to resolve the issue of shortage. BMC added that the number of Covid-19 testing had gone down due to lockdown restrictions as there were lesser people outside. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city-based lawyer Sneha Marjadi through advocates Simil Purohit and Arshil Shah, was informed by senior advocate Anil Sakhare for BMC that as per court directions, it had filed an affidavit enumerating the various measures initiated by it to tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave. The affidavit filed by Dr Mangala Gomare, in-charge executive health officer, addressed the various issues pertaining to mismanagement raised in the PIL and stated it has listed the same under the heads of bed management, supply and availability of Remdesivir, supply and availability of oxygen, Covid-19 testing and crematoriums. With regards to beds, the affidavit states that BMC has full-time ward-wise war rooms to inform people of availability of beds in each ward. On receiving calls, a team visits the caller and if needed advices hospitalisation and calls for an ambulance. It further states that as on April 27, the total bed capacity in all DHC and DCHC was 21,706, of which 17,021 were occupied and 4,685 were vacant; thus, the civic body was well equipped for admission of Covid patients. The affidavit stated that it has sufficient supply of Remdesivir. BMC on April 27 had a stock of 13,110 vials of the antiviral drug whereas its requirement for a seven-day period was around 12,033, leading to some excess which was then sent to Pune (500 vials) and Thane civic bodies (1,100). BMC also said there are a total of 72 crematoriums for Hindus, 70 for Muslims and 8 for others. Among the 72 crematoriums, 14 are electric furnaces while 17 are PNG furnaces. The civic body also added that one of the PNG furnaces run by a private trust at Walkeshwar was not functional, and that it had asked the trust to get it functional soon. It also added that it will install air pollution control system in private crematoriums under its jurisdiction if the need arises. With regards to Covid-19 testing, the affidavit stated that 5.5 million tests were conducted since the beginning of last year, of which 3,816,386 (69%) were RT-PCR tests and 1,727,116 (31%) were antigen tests. BMC has submitted that in April, till the date of filing affidavit, 1,172,559 tests were conducted — the highest monthly testing count so far. “However, from the day of strict lockdown, from April 22, testing has gone down to some extent. Since testing at crowded places like malls, railway stations, markets etc. has gone down, this has affected average testing per day. Normally, the number of testing reported on every Monday is less than average, due to weekly off to the staff of testing labs and weekly maintenance of machinery used for testing in these labs,” stated the affidavit.While the HC on Thursday sought details from BMC about fire audits of hospitals and their compliances, it will hear the PIL next on May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-assures-hc-of-covid-preparedness-101619807868728.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||State has failed’: Sombre note in Delhi high court hearing, after petition dies||: “The State has failed us,” the Delhi high court observed on Friday, after it was informed in the middle of a hearing that a petitioner, who sought the court’s help three days ago to secure an intensive care unit (ICU) bed, had succumbed to Covid-19. “The State has failed in its fundamental obligation to protect the basic fundamental right -- i.e, the right to life as contained under Article 21,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the teary relatives of the petitioner.The petitioner, Atul Kumar Sharma, was admitted in Maharaja Agrasen Hospital’s casualty wing, and approached the high court on Tuesday to direct the state authorities to allocate him an ICU bed. The hospital told the court that it was taking care of the patient but had no ICU beds free. The high court had said it couldn’t consider an individual case but appealed to all hospitals and authorities to make arrangements. On Friday, when the bench was again appealing to counsels to consider the petitioner’s case, advocate Amit Sharma told the court that his brother-in-law Atul had expired. He burst into tears and said, “I have failed…”The bench stopped him. “No Mr Sharma, you have not failed. The State has failed.” Silence descended among the judges, counsels and over 150 participants who had joined the video conferencing hearing.The emotional exchange capped an eventful day in court where senior lawyers broke down and pleaded for help, the state government counsel expressed helplessness, and judges said it was getting tough for them. “It is the complete failure of the State that everything including hospital beds and medical oxygen is in short supply. It is a war and not a battle,” the court remarked earlier in the day after Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) chairman Ramesh Gupta, broke down while mourning his colleagues who died of Covid-19.Gupta, who was appearing in a petition seeking medical facilities for lawyers, submitted that a private hospital agreed to treat the lawyers but didn’t have ICU beds. “We want my lords to come to our rescue. We do not want to criticise anyone or any government. We have ₹4-5 crore in our funds and will arrange more from lawyers. We only want my lords to help us. Sir kuch karo aap (Sir please do something).”Delhi government’s standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi also became emotional while informing the court about a colleague’s demise.”Daily we are losing our dear ones,” he said.The court empathised. “We understand your pain. We are going through the same. This surge of Covid has such a huge number...nobody could have imagined that this will attack us in this way... Finances are not the issue here. The problem is infrastructure….The problem is we don’t have doctors, nurses, attendants, oxygen and medicines. It is a complete failure of the state,” the bench said.“It’s getting tougher for us,” the bench said.The court criticised the “hotchpotch situation” in Delhi and compared it to the way Mumbai was handling its infection load. “In Bombay what the municipal corporation has done is, you’re asked to register if you have Covid, and then they go door-to-door with bed and facilities. But we cannot do that in Delhi. It’s too late to devise a system now. Its complete hotchpotch. Central government… Delhi government….municipal corporations not one but three…Politically different parties.. Complete hotchpotch,” the bench remarked.The court directed authorities to immediately release 170 oxygen concentrators seized by Delhi Police from the black market . It also recalled an order passed earlier this week, where it had directed the Delhi government to take over a refiller plant. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said supplies were being affected due to this and several stakeholders asked him to bring back the vendor. During the proceedings, advocate Himanshu Dagar, representing Gandhi Nursing Home, told the court that 95 people were on the death bed because the hospital didn’t receive a single oxygen cylinder in the last 48 hours. He said that the hospital suffered two deaths on Thursday and had no oxygen cylinders at present.“We are at the complete mercy of God,” he said. To this, Mehra expressed helplessness and said that problems still existed in the supply system despite allocations being made.The court directed the Delhi government to sort out the issue and also issued notice to the two refillers assigned to the hospital. It asked the government to explain why the supply wasn’t done. The bench asked the Delhi government to look into the possibility of converting SUVs into ambulances and whether buses could be used for carrying oxygen cylinders instead of ambulances.It also asked the administration to look into scaling up Rapid Antigen Test in addition to RT-PCR tests through mobile vans for hospital staffs and using hotels for health workers so that their family members are not infected.The matter will be now heard on Saturday.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals, had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/state-has-failed-sombre-note-in-delhi-high-court-hearing-after-petition-dies-101619807750343.html
01-05-2021||Delhi||Centre has a ‘special duty’ towards people of Delhi, Supreme Court says||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to urgently consider Delhi’s enhanced medical oxygen requirement in light of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the city, observing that it has a “special duty” to the people of the national capital. “Delhi represents the nation. There is hardly anyone ethnically Delhiite. Forget that somebody (Delhi government) wasn’t able to lift oxygen, but you have to push through because you have to protect lives. You have a special responsibility towards Delhi as the Centre,” a bench, presided over by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The remarks came after Mehta, representing the Union government, pointed out that all the states were required to gather their resources to lift oxygen from the points of procurement, but the Delhi government failed to do so because it did not have enough tankers to carry the oxygen. The law officer made this statement as the bench, which also included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, heard a public interest litigation registered suo motu (on its own) by the top court to manage various issues arising out of the second Covid-19 wave in the country and iron out issues between states and Centre at the national level. The court also asked Centre to consider increasing Delhi’s medical oxygen quota from the current 490MT, which has been a repeated demand of the Delhi government, and ensure that supply reaches the Capital. The allotted 490MT, the bench said, has not reached the Capital even once because of logistical constraints. “Please give them 200MT straightaway and make sure it arrives there. The Centre has a very valuable responsibility when the citizens of Delhi are concerned. Otherwise between today and Monday, we will have 500 deaths on our hands if we don’t do anything. I’m shaken. Please, do something. You have to do it,” justice Chandrachud told Mehta. While the S-G retorted that the death of 500 people could not be attributed to the oxygen shortages, the bench said the Centre’s role was not confined to allocation of oxygen, and that it also has a “very important role” in arranging for tankers for their transportation. “We will place your submission at the highest [pedestal], and we will accept Delhi’s inability, but we are not here on recrimination. We are not criticising you at all. But you should also know Delhi represents people from the entire country. The Centre has a peculiar role. You are the national government, and it is the national capital,” the bench told Mehta. “According to you, Delhi has not been able to lift [oxygen], but we cannot tell people that your parents or children or spouse cannot be helped because of this situation. This is a commitment we owe to the citizens and people who live here and not to different levels of government. You have to give us the solution,” it told the S-G, who assured the bench that the Centre will look into all the issues and will try to resolve the matter. The matter will now be heard on May 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-has-a-special-duty-towards-people-of-delhi-supreme-court-says-101619807688797.html

The federal agency made the claim while opposing Gor’s bail plea on Friday and stated that the SIM cards used by Vaze were provided by the bookie. Also, the mobile phone through which Hiran was called was purchased by Vaze and the SIM in it was provided by Gor, said NIA. The federal agency further claimed that if released, Gor may jump the bail and tamper with the evidence. Gor has approached the special NIA court for bail, claiming that he was never contacted by Vaze, an assistant Mumbai Police inspector, who is under suspension. Gor in his bail plea filed through law firm, Diamondwala & Co, has claimed that he has been made a scapegoat by the investigating agency at the instance of Vaze. He has also claimed that he was not aware of any conspiracy or the purpose for which the SIM cards were going to be used. The 31-year-old cricket bookie was arrested by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad on March 21, when it was investigating Hiran’s murder case. Later, his custody was handed over to NIA, as the federal agency took over the case from ATS. According to NIA, Hiran’s murder was linked to the explosive-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia. On February 25, the Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note, and a case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day. Vaze was originally investigating the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and had reported it stolen on February 17. Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it on February 5. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was arrested on March 13. The federal agency took over the murder case on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in both the cases. To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged management of the case. He subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours. When no action was forthcoming, Singh approached the courts. The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, CBI conducted an inquiry and registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-arrested-mumbai-cops-bookie-part-of-sachin-vaze-s-larger-conspiracy-says-nia-101619787287739.html
