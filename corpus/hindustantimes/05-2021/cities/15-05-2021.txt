The state Congress has been raising the issue of “sub-standard” quality of ventilators provided to Maharashtra from the PM Cares fund.Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said merely an audit would not be enough and demanded that the Center and the state government conduct a joint audit and take action against the “culprits”. According to a statement by Sawant, these ventilators are lying unused at many locations including Aurangabad and Nashik. Welcoming the decision by PM Modi, Sawant said he should have taken the decision last year as the machines would not have been lying unused in the hospitals.“During the Covid-19 outbreak, the Central government has been supplying ventilators to the states and Union Territories from the PM Cares fund. Under the Make in India initiative, some companies have been given the task of making ventilators. Over the past year, objections have been raised from various states about the quality and uselessness of these ventilators. Similar objections were raised in Gujarat. Recently, Aurangabad Medical College had appointed a committee to give a comprehensive report on the quality of ventilators provided to them. The report of the committee is very serious and concludes that all the ventilators supplied by Jyoti CNC, a Gujarat-based company, are useless,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-pm-directs-audit-of-ventilators-congress-calls-for-joint-audit-with-state-101621101004746.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: CISF constable duped of ₹1.24 lakh by online fraudsters||Trombay police on Friday booked unknown persons for duping a 30-year-old constable from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) of ₹1.24 lakh.According to the police, the complainant Ananda Shelke is posted at the BARC. The fraudster posed as an executive from a courier-logistics company, and under the pretext of processing a complaint of non-delivery of a product his wife had ordered online, managed to convince Shelke to download an app. The accused later fraudulently extracted money from his account. Shelke’s wife had ordered sarees from a popular e-commerce site. However, the product was not delivered on time, following which, Shelke tried to track the delivery of the product. He looked for the customer care number of the shipping company online. “He contacted the shipping company and asked for the contact of the delivery boy who would be delivering his ordered product. The executive sent a link to the complainant to re-verify his address and also asked him to make a transaction of ₹5. Shelke clicked on the link, but as his transaction of ₹5 got declined the executive asked him to download an app,” said a police officer.After opening the app it asked the user to press the ‘allow’ button for certain permissions. Later, ₹50,000 got deducted from Shelke’s account. When he enquired, the executive told him that it would be refunded soon and told him to ‘allow’ the app to process further.On following the said instructions, ₹50,000 and ₹24,000 got deducted again from his account. Shelke then realised that he has been duped and he approached the police.The Trombay police have registered a case of cheating and impersonation and are investigating further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cisf-constable-duped-of-1-24-lakh-by-online-fraudsters-101621101004161.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Family members renew plea for release of the accused||Family members and friends of the accused in Elgar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon violence case have renewed their plea for release of all the accused in the case from jails, claiming that death is staring in their faces because of the inhuman conditions in Taloja and Byculla jails where they are lodged.They have alleged that there was mismanagement in prison with regards to Covid-19 protocol and medical facilities available in prisons.Family members and well-wishers of the accused held a virtual meet on Saturday narrating the conditions in prisons and inmates amid the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak.Wife of Hany Babu, 54, an associate professor in the department of English with Delhi University who recently tested positive for Covid-19, pleaded that they should be released immediately and taken care of medically and emotionally. She said the condition in the prison is very dangerous in as much as the jail hospital not having doctors or trained staff to take care of patients.One of the well-wishers of accused Harshali Potdar claimed the condition in Taloja jail was very dangerous and added that the inmates who are actually sick and unwell are not being tested for the infection while healthy inmates are being tested. She further alleged that the inmates are also not being taken care of.Father Joe Xavier, friend of accused Stan Swamy, expressed concern for the 84-year-old Jesuit priest and said that Swamy, in their last telephonic conversation, had told him that he was “fragile” and feeling helpless.Sudha Bharadwaj’s daughter Maaysha said her mother’s condition was very poor, as she suffers from several co-morbidities.The kin also alleged that in this situation, the family members have not been able to communicate with the arrested accused. They alleged the letters written by accused got delivered after a month while phone calls are also not clearly audible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-family-members-renew-plea-for-release-of-the-accused-101621100944861.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Missing out on campus experience, say FYJC students||Last year, when Ryan Viegas passed his Class 10 board exam with 92%, he was elated. Viegas, who wanted to pursue Arts, got a seat at one of the city’s most prestigious colleges — St Xavier’s College. In his school days, he had heard a lot about the excitement of being in one of the top colleges of the city and wanted to experience all of it himself. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, colleges in the city and the state remained close and lakhs of students like Viegas had to make do with virtual experiences of college life.“I was really excited about getting to go to the college of my choice. I had heard a lot of things about the college and the activities there. Academically, I am very happy with the online teaching but the physical experience is something I miss,” said Viegas. When asked about the difference between the offline and online format, he said, “Since I do not know what it is to physically attend college, I cannot even make that comparison.”While the pandemic and the resultant shift to online learning had an impact on students across grades, for students who entered first-year junior college (FYJC) last year, the impact was more pronounced. For majority students in Maharashtra, FYJC is the first college experience that students get as they move from schools to junior colleges for Class 11 and 12. In Mumbai itself, nearly 224,000 students were admitted at various junior colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region last year. With colleges remaining closed for physical classes, these students have been deprived of the real college experience — enjoying a new campus, meeting new teachers, making new friendships and, travelling to far-off colleges by themselves at times. Even as junior colleges in the state began their online classes soon after the academic year began for students, the real experience of transitioning from school to college environment was lost. Students said colleges are doing their best to provide them with excellent online learning but added that they do miss out on the college experience as a whole, something that they had always looked forward to. Nilakshi Mishra, a student from an aided school in Chembur, worked hard to get to the college of her choice. A student of Ruia College, Mishra was not able to visit her campus even once. “I had heard so many stories from my friends about college life, canteen and hangout places near the college. It all seems like a rosy picture to me now. I have barely been able to make any friends and only know a couple of students who I have worked with for my group discussions and assignments. It is really upsetting,” said Mishra.Satram Verhani, former vice-principal of CHM College in Ulhasnagar, said this year has been particularly difficult for FYJC students. “In college, there are so many extra-curricular activities. Students get an opportunity to participate in events, various clubs etc. which they could not do to that extent this year. While we did conduct some events online, it is definitely not the same,” he added.Aryaman Kumar, a science student enrolled at PACE Junior College in Dadar, said students cannot develop a good rapport with their teachers in the online mode. “The teachers teach us well and handle all our queries, but beyond that there is no discussion at an individual level because both teachers and students are new to each other. We have no reference point for a general conversation, which usually helps a lot in getting to know things during college days,” he added.Teachers said it is difficult to imagine college life without a campus. “When we were in college, we learnt more in canteen and gymkhana than in classrooms. When students come to colleges from schools, a different world opens up for them altogether. Nothing can compensate for these prime years and they will never come back,” said a junior college teacher from a suburban college.Schools and colleges in the state closed for physical classes in March 2020. While admissions to junior college began in August 2020, colleges in the state started only in December-January owing to the Supreme Court stay on admissions under the Maratha quota. Students are now hoping that physical colleges resume soon. “I just hope we get to attend college at least for a few months. I want to take up a professional course later and this is the only college experience where I will get to study and relax a bit at the same time,” said Sana Shah, a student from Vile Parle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-missing-out-on-campus-experience-say-fyjc-students-101621100944246.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Virtual tours of engineering colleges for aspirants as AICTE takes college approval process online||Engineering aspirants aiming at institutes in the country will soon have the advantage of getting a virtual tour of the institute on their respective websites. While this process is common with universities abroad, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has decided to give students in the country the same feature.A year after approving 171 new professional institutes online due to Covid-19 restrictions, AICTE has now decided to take the process to virtual mode only. The decision comes after several stakeholders felt the online mode brought better accountability and transparency to the entire process.“While in 2020, the approval process had to be conducted online due to travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic, we have received very positive feedback from all stakeholders in the past one year. Hence, we decided to permanently do away with physical visits and paperwork involved in the institute approval process,” said Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman, AICTE. Along with new institutes, existing institutes also have to apply for renewal of their affiliation with AICTE every year. As part of the process, colleges submit detailed paperwork highlighting the courses they offer, staff and infrastructure available and the fees they plan to charge students. Once the paperwork is approved, AICTE sends a specially-appointed local inquiry committee to visit the institute and check the facilities as described by the institute in their form.As part of the virtual process now, colleges will be expected to submit all necessary documents in soft copy to AICTE, and the council then participates in a virtual tour of the institute before the final approval. “Time and again AICTE has received complaints against senior members of local inquiry committees demanding bribes at the time of physical visits. Virtual tours should help cut out third-party arrangements and bring more transparency to this process,” said principal of an engineering institute in Pune.AICTE approved 171 new institutes in the 2020-21 academic year, marking a 138% drop compared to last year when it gave approvals to over 945 institutes across professional courses. Experts say the lower number is due to the blanket ban on private engineering and pharmacy institutes across the country, despite a year-on-year seat vacancy of up to 50%.According to AICTE, almost 70% institutes which were approved this year are government-run, whereas in the past few years, private institutes have dominated engineering and pharmacy sectors. Every year, AICTE starts accepting approval applications for new as well as existing institutes by November. However, this year applications were accepted February onwards. The governing authority now has the permission from the Supreme Court to complete the approval process till June-end. “Online applications are helping us go paperless and at the same time, making the otherwise cumbersome process easier for the institutes as well as for us. The advantage of virtual tours is that the institute can then upload the same video on their website, making it convenient for students to check the institute before choosing to apply for a seat,” added Sahasrabuddhe.This year, AICTE has also introduced the concept of digital signatures on online application forms, making it clear that no application will be accepted without the validated digital signature of the head of the institute or management governing the institute. “This process brings better accountability because every year institutes would blame their juniors for errors in the application process, but henceforth we will hold the heads of the institute accountable for errors, if any,” added Sahasrabuddhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/virtual-tours-of-engineering-colleges-for-aspirants-as-aicte-takes-college-approval-process-online-101621100824139.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man acquitted of murdering neighbour||Mumbai sessions court recently acquitted a 29-year-old man arrested around five-and-a-half-years ago for killing his neighbor who stalked and harassed his wife. The man was cleared of all charges as the prosecution failed to prove that the weapon used for committing the murder belonged to the accused.The accused, Shrinivas Lakka, was arrested for allegedly killing his neighbour on December 22, 2015. Lakka then went to Chunabhatti police station to surrender, the prosecution claimed.The prosecution had alleged that the deceased used to follow Lakka’s wife and verbally harassed her, following which Lakka met with him asking him to stop. However, as he continued with the stalking and harassment, Lakka assaulted him on neck, head and abdomen multiple times. The court, however, acquitted Lakka as the prosecution failed to prove that the weapon was Lakka’s. Police claimed they seized and sealed the weapon around 8pm on the day, but evidence on record suggested that a constable was seen carrying the weapon around 10.30pm while investigating the crime. This discrepancy turned out to be fatal for the prosecution case.Lakka’s lawyer Wahab Khan claimed the confession at the time when he allegedly surrendered, as claimed by the police, was not admissible as evidence. The prosecution had also failed to examine an eye witness, wife of the deceased, to prove the case.The court accepted the submissions and acquitted Lakka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-acquitted-of-murdering-neighbour-101621100765457.html

A resident of a building near the scene of the crime filmed the act and alerted an NGO, which in turn informed police, said senior inspector Rajendra Kamble, Tulinj police.“We saw the clip and registered a case under section 377 (unnatural sex) of the Indian Penal Code and section 11(1)(a) of the Animal Cruelty Act, 1960. We did not arrest him as he is suffering from a series of dreaded disease including sexual transmitted disease (STD), diabetes and other ailments. We will also conduct RT-PCR test for Covid-19 detection. But it would be risky if we arrest him due to his contagious disease,” said the officer. The police will present a charge sheet in the case before Vasai court and will also produce Patil before the court. “We are investigating further to check if he is a habitual sex offender,” said Kamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/78yearold-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-stray-dog-101621100764772.html

Tope, while addressing media in Jalna on Saturday, also said that independent team of experts and nurses should be formed to treat these patients.The health minister said cases of mucormycosis, which is colloquially referred as black fungus, are a new challenge for the health department in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic and added that patients with this disease need ear, nose, throat (ENT) specialist, ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, plastic surgeon. He said government hospitals and medical college hospitals have some experts, and therefore a separate ward should be set up there. “Not every place will have so many experts under one roof. Therefore, treatment is being provided in large hospitals. And the disease can be treated in certain large hospitals participating in Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana,” Tope said. He further added that the state is taking efforts to make available the injections required for the treatment of black fungus. So far, he said, 5,000 injections have been distributed and the state is in process to purchase 100,000 injections from Haffkine Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/set-up-separate-wards-teams-to-treat-mucormycosis-maharashtra-health-minister-101621100764212.html

Director of public instruction (DPI) Paramjit Singh, who is a member of the committee representing Punjab, has written to the chairperson of the committee, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, vice-chancellor RP Tiwari asking that the governor be restored as chancellor of the university.The government has also asked the university’s senate to consider the recommendations. The subcommittee is of the view that four senate members should be elected from among registered post graduate fellows. Of the four, three may be from Punjab, and one from Chandigarh. It has also recommended that 18 members of the senate be nominated by the chancellor from among academicians, of which nine should be in consultation with the government of Punjab. Singh has asked that these recommendations be incorporated in the main body of the final report and not as an annexure.These comments were supposed to be sent to the chairperson of the committee by April 26. However, the DPI had said that the government was busy with Covid management of the state. The 11-member panel of experts was constituted by the chancellor in February to recommend governance reforms in light of the New Education Policy after the University Grants Commission in November 2020 asked the varsity to initiate governance reforms as per provisions of the PU Act and Regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/governance-reforms-punjab-wants-governor-to-be-pu-chancellor-101621100704679.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 4 booked in illegal death certificate racket||City police crime branch officers have booked a doctor and three others suspected to be involved in a death certificate racket. The accused would arrange death certificate in ₹3,000 for those who wish to take the body of their relatives to their hometown for the last rituals and urgently require a death certificate. The group was allegedly issuing death certificate without a doctor examining the (deceased) person. Those booked on charges of cheating and forgery have been identified as Sunny Kawle, Somnath Gaikwad and Dashrath Gurav. A doctor is also been named in the case. The crime branch had unearthed the racket after sending a bogus customer to one of the group members who issued a death certificate for ₹3,000 without examining the body, the police said. Crime branch officers have handed over the case to Nagpada police for further probe. The police are trying to find out when the group is illegally issuing death certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-4-booked-in-illegal-death-certificate-racket-101621100464142.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: At 37.4 degrees Celsius, May temperature hits 10 year high||With the maximum daytime temperature on Saturday settling at 37.4 degrees Celsius — up from 34.5 degrees Celsius the day prior —Mumbai recorded its hottest day in May, in a decade. The city had earlier recorded a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius on May 3, which until Saturday was the highest reading since 2016. Officials attributed Saturday’s sudden rise in mercury to the dense cloud cover that has been forming over the city since Thursday.“As a result of weather activity due to Cyclone Tauktae, there is a dense cloud cover which has formed over the Konkan coast, and which is acting as a heat trap. Hot air is unable to rise beyond a certain height and this pushes up the atmospheric temperature closer to the earth’s surface. But this phenomenon should reduce significantly toward Sunday evening once it rains,” said a meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for its automatic weather station in Santacruz, the maximum daytime temperature on May 16 may drop to as little as 31 degrees Celsius, falling further to 30 degree Celsius on May 17 — which would mark the city’s lowest daytime May temperature in 10 years. Generally, cloudy skies with moderate to heavy rain at isolated locations in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar are expected to prevail during this period. Wind speeds are likely to be between 35 to 50kmph.At 7pm on Saturday, IMD’s regional forecasting Centre in Mumbai reported that Cyclone Tauktae was located about 250kms off the coast of Goa. It is expected to cross Mumbai’s latitude late Sunday, at a distance of 300 to 350kms from the coast. Parts of south Maharashtra — including Ratnagiri and Raigad in the Konkan belt — began to heavy rains on Saturday itself, however, officials said that the impact on Mumbai and the north Konkan belt will be minimised by the cyclone’s movement toward Gujarat, where it is expected to make landfall between Kutch and Gir Somnath around May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiat-37-4-degrees-celsius-may-temperature-hits-10-year-high-101621100404132.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Pension for Covid orphans good move by Madya Pradesh: Sena||Lauding the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Madhya Pradesh government for announcing a monthly pension for children orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic, Shiv Sena on Saturday said that this could be a role model for other states. The Sena, through its mouthpiece Saamana, said that the governments — state or Union — have to take cognisance of children who have lost their parents due to Covid-19 and must give the “shield of humanity”.Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday announced that children who lost their parents or guardians to Covid will be provided free education and a ₹5,000 monthly pension. The state will also bear the expenses of the education of these children.The editorial in Saamana said that any amount of praise for Chouhan’s decision was not enough. Sena lamented the loss of the many adults due to Covid-19 leading to several children left bereft of guardians.“Many children are unaware that their parents who are fighting Covid may not return from the hospital. The government will have to take care of these orphaned children by becoming their guardian. Whether is the Union government or the state, they would have to take note of these children and give them the shield of humanity the way Madhya Pradesh’s Shivraj Chouhan has done,” the editorial said.Earlier this week, the Maharashtra government decided to form a task force in each district under the district collector to identify the children who have been orphaned due to Covid-19 to ensure their safety. The editorial added that many have expressed concern over the issue and it has been discussed on several occasions. “This was discussed in Maharashtra too, but Madhya Pradesh did not merely discuss this serious matter, they also announced that they would give pension to such children,” the editorial said in a critical tone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pension-for-covid-orphans-good-move-by-madya-pradesh-sena-101621100284154.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital to start genome sequencing||Kasturba Gandhi hospital, Byculla, will start genome sequencing of a few Covid-19 patients in the city to find out any possible presence of a mutation of Sars-Cov-2—the virus that causes Covid-19 — and understand its role in the transmission and spread of the infection. This will make Kasturba hospital the first civic-run hospital in the city to conduct genome sequencing on Covid-19.Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) received approval from the central health department to commence genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital. Alongside, a committee has also been formed to do undertake research on the microbiological characteristics of mutated strains of the virus. Dr Jayanthi S Shastri, in-charge of the hospital’s microbiology department, will head the programme.Genome sequencing is a technique that involves analysing the genetic code of an organism and is done with the help of powerful computers.Talking to HT, Dr Shastri said that samples will be collected from adults with atypical clinical presentations, children with Covid-19 infection, international passengers and patients who contracted the infection in clusters with high positivity rate. “The in-house sequencing of samples will enable us to get results faster, which will enable rapid policy planning to take appropriate measures. Genome sequencing is required for medical preparedness in any outbreak of a disease,” she said. “Linking information of genome sequencing with patients’ data is essential for genome epidemiology for better understanding of disease like its progression, severity, transmissibility and therapeutics,” she added. So far, on a weekly basis, BMC has been sending 50 random samples for genome sequencing of infected patients with travel history, belonging from hot spots and families with higher infection rates to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. But health officials said it is time-consuming, which often delays delivery of the reports. “We get reports of the samples from NIV after 15-20 days. Kasturba hospital has one of the advanced laboratories in India, so we decided to start the sequencing in the hospital,” said a health officer. In March, the central health department confirmed the presence of ‘dual mutation’ of Sars-Cov-2 in the state. According to a press release by the government of India issued on March 24, “The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E4840 and 1452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOC.”In Mumbai, 22 positive samples out of 220 samples sent by BMC to NIV were detected with the United Kingdom strain of the novel coronavirus. But no other strain of the virus was detected in any other samples from Mumbai.“With the starting of the sequencing in Kasturba Hospital, our dependence on NIV will decrease. On Monday, I will hold a meeting with the experts advising them to fasten the process,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.“Also, through the research, we would be able to understand how the presence of the new strain is affecting the pandemic. This can provide scientific insight if we are heading into the third wave of the pandemic,” he added.All viruses constantly mutate into new versions or variants. The genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. Most are inconsequential, but a few variants can make the virus more infectious.Dr Lancelot Pinto, a pulmonologist and an epidemiologist said, “Variants are expected to evolve when a highly transmissible virus moves rapidly through a host population. Such new variants of the coronavirus could have escape mutations which help the virus evade the body’s immune system, thereby conferring the virus with a survival advantage. Escape mutations in the spike protein could result in infections among individuals who had existing antibodies to earlier strains of the virus”When asked about the presence of the mutated strains in the recently sent sample to NIV, he said, “We have found a few UK strains but the number of double mutations has declined since March. However, I don’t have the aggregated data at present.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-kasturba-hospital-to-start-genome-sequencing-101621100224136.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Four inmates die of Covid in Maharashtra jails in a fortnight||Four prisoners have died of Covid in state prisons in last two weeks. The casualties occurred in Mumbai’s Arthur Road central jail, Byculla’s women’s prison, Taloja prison and Nagpur prison. Cases of active cases of Covid among prisoners have also slightly increased in last two weeks.According to the prison officials, till April 30, a total of nine Covid deaths were reported across the jails in state. The death toll jumped to 13 till May 14. Currently, there are 411 active cases in state jails, which includes 317 prisoners and 94 prison staffs. The maximum active cases have been reported in Kolhapur jail (83) and Thane prison (66), a jail officer said.Seeing surge in cases of infection in the second wave the prison authority had decided to carry out random testings in jails. As a result of this drive last month, major outbreak of Covid was detected in Byculla’s women prisons where nearly 40 prisoners were found Covid-19 positive, including the Sheena Bora murder case accused Indrani Mukerjea. Most of them have recovered now.Since last April, prison authorities have conducted 69,818 Covid-19 tests across 47 prisons and jail administrative offices in the state. A total of 3,757 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19, of which 13 have succumbed to the disease. 3,427 infected inmates have recovered fully. To minimise the impact of the infectious disease in jails, the prison authority last month has started building ‘two-tier protection’ system. Along with temporary prisons, that were set up last year across the state, this year the arrangements are also made for Covid care centres with the help of the local administration.If a new prisoner is to be lodged in a jail, they will have to mandatorily undergo Covid testing and spend 14 days at a quarantine centre (temporary prison), irrespective of their test results. The prisoner will be admitted to a regular jail only if they show no symptoms after 14 days.If a prisoner shows any symptoms during their stay at the centre, they will be shifted to a Covid care centre for treatment. If their condition deteriorates, they will be hospitalised. This way, confirmed cases and suspected ones will be separated. This system will keep an effective check on the entry of infected prisoners in jails, thereby preventing further spread of the infectious disease in jails, claims a prison officer.As prison authority believe that the main reason for the spread of the virus in jails is overcrowding, hence jail superintendents across the state are working in close coordination with the undertrial review committees, headed by sessions judges, to enable regular review of decongestion of prisons, a senior prison officer said.Since March 2020, around 10,900 inmates have been released to reduce overcrowding. Approximately 34,000 inmates are lodged against capacity of 24,000 in prisons of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/four-inmates-die-of-covid-in-maharashtra-jails-in-a-fortnight-101621100164084.html

They claimed the firm had not followed Covid-19 protocol and the money is to not take action against them.Police said one of the five accused first extorted ₹20,000 on April 21. But on Friday, four accused again visited the company and demanded more money saying the firm owner was not wearing mask.The company owner informed the police and the four were arrested. “The private agency the five accused belonged to has been authorised by Mumbai civic body for collecting fines from those not wearing mask and spitting in public places. But their jurisdiction was limited to penalising pedestrians or those violating rules in public places. They were not authorised to enter any private premises or company and take action.

The change in the protocol by the Centre has given some breather to the state government which had turned its focus to complete the second dose of nearly 1.6 million people across the state.The state government now has stock that would last for around three days, officials said. With the change in protocol, a chunk of the Covishield doses that were kept to give the second jab to people will now be also used for the first doses. There is no change in protocol for the second dose of Covaxin.State immunization officer DN Patil said that the health department has notified all vaccination centres about the change. However, people will not be turned back from the centre if they wish to take the shot after six weeks, Patil said. “We have issued an advisory to all districts to give the second dose after 84 days, per the Centre’s guidelines. But people will not be stopped to take vaccine after six weeks, unless the change is made in the Co-WIN app, restricting them to schedule booking,” Patil said.According to Patil, the state would now have around 500,000 to 600,000 Covishield doses and about 100,000 Covaxin doses. “The stock that is at the centres now is expected to last us about two to three days. We are not expecting any fresh stock before next Monday or Tuesday. The doses that were earlier kept for second doses are being used for first doses after the change in protocol,” Patil said. The state is inching closer to the 20-million mark in vaccination, as it administered 192,438 doses. As of Saturday, the state has administered 19,911,343 doses, of which 4,206,220 are second doses. The state is expected to surpass the landmark on Sunday.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Saturday went past a grim landmark of 80,000 deaths due to Covid-19 as it added 960 fatalities, taking the death toll to 80,512. The state continued to see fewer cases on Saturday, while the positivity rate also dropped. Maharashtra added 34,848 fresh Covid-19 cases to its tally with a positivity rate of 14.68%. The active cases came under 500,000 to reach 494,032, while the total tally rose to 5,344,063.Mumbai reported 1,450 fresh cases, taking its tally to 686,295. The active cases in the city declined to 34,083. The state has recorded nearly 29,000 deaths between February 15 and May 15. The second wave of the Covid-19 has been particularly deadly for the state as it saw 28,960 fatalities in the last three months, averaging 9,650 deaths every month. Between the outbreak in Maharashtra in March 2020 and February 15, 2021, the state had recorded 51,552 deaths—an average of around 4,685 deaths a month.Though the overall cases are declining in the state, some districts continue to report a high number of cases. The state health department has identified 15 districts including Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri, Beed, Buldhana, Yavatmal, and Chandrapur, where the surge continues. Officials said that they have ramped up the testing drive along with increasing the hospital beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/change-in-covid-19-vaccine-protocol-a-breather-for-maharashtra-government-101621100044120.html

The Delhi government is getting 700 MT oxygen on 85,000 active cases while the Haryana government is receiving 282 MT oxygen in papers and actually getting less than 225 MT. Twelve of 22 districts in Haryana are receiving only 0.5 MT oxygen each,” he added.He, along with party’s Haryana affairs in-charge Viveik Bansal, launched Congress’ ‘Seva and Samarpan’ campaign in Jind to provide oxygen and medicines to the needy.“More than 18,000 people have died in rural areas in Haryana over the past few days as per media reports and people have no testing, tracing or treating facility in villages,” he said.The Congress leaders distributed masks and sanitized the city. “Ministers, MPs and MLAs of the BJP-JJP government are not receiving phone calls of people who are reaching out to them for oxygen, beds and medicines,” Bansal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-dying-of-covid-in-rural-areas-of-haryana-says-surjewala-101621098064491.html

Prior to this week, the positivity rate stood at 16% in the second week (April 29-5) of the ongoing lockdown. The weekly detection of cases also came down to 38,142 in the third week from 41,626 cases in the second week.The decline in cases and positivity rate indicates the spread of infection has slowed down. Noticing a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the first three weeks of April, the state government clamped a partial lockdown in the fourth week (April 22-28), that has been extended further with certain new embargo.While the state has now entered the fourth week (May 13-19) of the lockdown, the first two weeks saw a decline in growth of cases, but reported a significant rise in positivity rate.The state discovered 44,133 cases in the first week (April 22-28) of lockdown. These cases were detected after testing 322,392 samples, with 13.68% positivity rate, meaning thereby that every 100 samples tested, at least 13 returned positive.The second week (April 29-May 5), however, brought witnessed stricter norms and the growth of positive cases registered a 5.68% decline in comparison to the first week. The state unearthed 41,626 cases in between April 29-May 5. The positivity rate, however, didn’t go down, but jumped to 16.25% from the previous week of 13.68%, as 41,626 cases were discovered after testing 256,134 samples.But the third week (May 6-12), for the first time after the pandemic’s second wave hit the state in early April, saw a drop in cases as well as the positivity rate.With 9% positivity rate, the state detected 38,142 cases after testing 421,479 samples in between May 6-12. Comparing these figures with the previous week, the growth of cases and positivity rate both dipped significantly.The state reported weekly positivity rates of 4.85%, 7.16%, 10.96%, 13.68%, 16.25% and 9% in April 1-7, April 8-14, April 15-21, April 22-28, April 29-May 5 and May 6-12, respectively.Health experts, however, opined that the lockdown has greatly impacted the fast spread of infection.Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine, RIMS, said, “The lockdown has definitely slowed down the spread of the disease. Besides, people are more alert now. If we see the results of sample tests conducted at RIMS laboratory, we can say that positivity rate has gone down. We had seen positivity rate as high as 45% on April 17, when 278 positive cases were detected after testing 605 samples. This has been coming down gradually. We have also been noticing that there has been a significant decline in number of people seeking beds and consultation through telemedicine. This shows a positive trend as the rush in hospitals is gradually waning.”According to health department’s Covid-19 bulletin on May 14, the state has so far reported 310,024 cases including 260,602 recoveries, 45,056 active cases and 4,366 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/positivity-rate-dips-to-9-from-16-101621097764019.html

Bihar, which planned to vaccinate aggressively its 7.51 crore target population of 18 years and above by setting up vaccination centres at schools, similar to polling booths during elections, now finds that many of its beneficiaries, who took the first jab in March, are still not eligible for the second dose. Given the reluctance among the rural populace to take the vaccine, it is still not easy to get them to the vaccination centres. As a result, footfall at vaccination centres is dwindling. “Our planning has been hampered by recurrent changes in vaccination guidelines for Covishield. This is the third time in three months that the Central government has widened the interval between Covishield doses. This has also created confusion among the public,” said an officer associated with the vaccination programme in the state. Patna district immunisation officer Dr SP Vinayak said many people were enquiring why the interval between doses of Covishield was being changed frequently while that of Covaxin was constant (4-6 weeks). “We tell them we have to follow government guidelines,” he said. The revised recommendations come as several states, including Bihar, experience a shortage of vaccines. Bihar could vaccinate 124,104 people on Saturday as against 116,441 on Friday. A few high caseload states of coronavirus like Maharashtra and Karnataka have halted vaccination for their 18-44 years population and diverted vaccines for 45 years and above people, especially those who have received the first shot, but couldn’t take the second jab due to paucity of vaccines. Though Bihar has no immediate plans to curb vaccination for the younger age group, its vaccine availability is low. The Centre had communicated an allocation of 7,64,850 doses of Covishield and 2,52,040 doses of Covaxin for the first fortnight of this month. However, the state was yet to receive 1,27,040 doses of Covaxin for the 45 years and above population till May 14, said sources. Similarly, in the 18-44 years age category, Bihar’s allocation of Covishield was 16,39,250 doses, but the state had received 8,85,000 doses. For Covaxin, the allocation was 4,12,450 doses, but it had received 1,12,450 doses. The state was left with 3,28,530 doses of vaccines for the 45+ population and 5,51,140 doses for the 18-44 years age group, as per government figures available till May 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/change-in-covishield-dose-interval-throws-vaccination-plan-offgear-101621097644741.html

They share the information with their UP counterparts to allow the funeral. The arrangement has been made to ensure bodies are not disposed of in Ganga river without cremation, SP Kumar said.Ghazipur SP Dr Om Prakash Singh said there was no ban on entry of bodies from Bihar for funeral. The administration was only ensuring bodies are not thrown in Ganga, he said.Singh said urban local bodies in towns and block development officers in rural areas have been directed to arrange firewood for bodies whose kin were helpless and unable to purchase it. People in Kaimur and Rohtas districts of south-west Bihar traditionally go to Varanasi to cremation of their loved ones, but the waiting time at their preferred Manikarnika ghat in Varanasi has gone up to 20-24 hours due to rising Covid deaths. Now, the people from these districts prefer to go to Zamania in bordering Ghazipur district in UP for cremations. Because of the sudden surge of crowds, firewood has become dearer at Zaminia, tehsildar Ghanshyam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-up-border-districts-resolve-cremation-issues-101621097645310.html

Instead of consulting doctors, he just visited the medicine shop and took medicines as advised by the shop owner. There was no relief and suddenly his oxygen level went down after a few days. He was rushed to Ara Sadar Hospital on May 10 but died on May 11, said his cousin R R Singh.Chandan Singh of Chandi village said his uncle Arun Pratap Singh (45) developed fever, cold, cough and breathing problem in the last week of April. He took medicines as advised by quacks for a day and was rushed to a private clinic the very next day at Ara. All along, his oxygen level kept on falling. He was referred to Ara Sadar Hospital where he died.In Chandi village of Bhojpur district alone, 10 people have died over the last three weeks, mostly affected with Covid symptoms, including falling oxygen level. Pramod Singh of Chandi village said, “Out of them, seven to eight had breathing problems. Most of them instead preferred to take advice from quacks present at Chandi market. Those who died were mostly in the age group of 40 to 60 years.”Jaga Kushwaha, a social activist and resident of Chandi, who also lost a relative to Covid-19, said almost 90% residents of adjoining villages had been suffering from fever, cough and breathing problems. “There is no doubt that the facilities of testing and treatment are limited, but the people at large are wary of getting tested for Covid-19. They rely on local quacks,” he says.Kushwaha also blames the non-functional health centres as the reason behind people’s growing reliance on quacks.“There is a health and wellness centre at the village, but they are run by ANMs (auxiliary nursing midwifery). Doctor never comes,” he said. Manju Devi, a resident of Narhi, adjacent to Chandi village, said the administration should distribute masks and sanitize the village, but it has not been done. Dr Navin Kumar, in-charge of the nearest primary health centre at Koilwar, said health centres are run by ANMs themselves. “There are three doctors at PHC Koilwar. Doctors are not appointed at health centres. It is not possible for doctors to reach at each and every health centre under the PHC of Koilwar regularly. I have no information about deaths in large numbers at Chandi village,” said Dr Kumar. Of late, Covid cases in districts with more rural population have been increasing. For example, on Friday, Begusarai reported 334 cases, Gaya 285, Madhubani 360, Samastipur 392, Vaishali 353 etc., to name a few.Bhohpur reported 29 cases on Friday and its total active cases stood at 602.

The state government launched a special drive from May 5 to detect corona cases in villages and claimed to be carrying out adequate testing and treatment. But BKU leaders alleged that the situation was grim in villages and due to resource crunch, the government was under-reporting corona deaths. BKU’s state spokesperson Dharnendra Malik said that villagers were fearful and the government had failed to provide facilities of proper testing and treatment. People were suffering from fever and dying in villages and in most of the cases deaths are being under reported, with hapless villagers silently cremating bodies of their dear and near in villages. Malik said that taking stock of the situation, the BKU had directed its activists in villages across the state to collect details of suspected Covid 19 deaths in their villages and send them to the union. “ Union activists and leaders have already started collecting details and hope that lists from villages would be made available in a week or so”, said Malik. BKU Saharanpur division’s general secretary Raju Ahlawat claimed that the situation in villages was grim, but officials had their own way of functioning. They overlooked complaints and concerns shown by union leaders and instead of understanding pain and sufferings of people. Citing example of his village Bhainsi in Muzaffarnagar district, Ahlawat claimed that the village had panchayat poll on April 19 and barely a few days after that people started showing corona symptoms. “At least 18 people died in one month in the village and hundreds are still suffering from fever,” said Ahlawat, expressing anger for under-reporting deaths in villages. He said, “ We need actual data of deaths and people suffering from Covid 19 so that the real situation of villages may be known.” He questioned how a government could evolve policies and facilities with fudged data. Harnam Singh Verma, BKU Lucknow division president, said that he had also mobilized union activists in villages to prepare the list and hoped that it would be prepared within a week. He also said that there was a mismatch between data of Covid-19 deaths released by the government and reality. Verma said that his village Naubasta Kala was situated barely 2 kms from Chinhat and more than two dozen people had died after showing corona like symptoms, but government data showed very few deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bku-to-prepare-list-of-corona-deaths-in-villages-101621096804016.html

Anshu used the pistol to kill two gangsters Mukeem alias Kala and Meraj Ahmad alias Merajudeen inside the prison before being shot dead in police firing on Friday. The officials said preliminary investigation hinted towards the involvement of jail personnel, as no outsider was allowed inside. To note, the family members of prisoners are not allowed to visit since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020. The state government has already suspended jail superintendent SP Tripathi and jailor Mahendra Pal, holding them responsible for the security lapses initially and ordered departmental enquiry. A senior official said initial probe hinted that there was only way to smuggle a firearm inside the jail: by hiding it in eatables and ration packets supplied for prisoners. He said the sequence of the incident also hinted that Dixit was provided the firearm during the breakfast hour. “Breakfast was given to prisoners at around 9.30 am on Friday. At the same time, we heard a bullet staccato and rushed towards the high security barrack where Anshu Dixit and Meraj Ahmad were lodged together since the latter was shifted to Chitrakoot jail on May 7,” said the official, sharing the statement given by a jail guard during the probe. The official said Anshu Dixit opened fire on Meraj Ahmad after two other inmates gave him breakfast and left his barrack.. “After shooting Meraj Ahmad, Dixit walked towards the near-by barrack where Mukeem alias Kala was lodged along with some other prisoners and shot him dead after a short conversation. Dixit was later gunned down in police firing when he held some prisoners hostage after returning to his barrack,” he said. Planned shoot-out ? No specific motive, unprovoked firing as well as open latches of the barrack’s gate were some points suggesting a planned shoot-out, said senior officials privy to the investigation. “So far we are had unable to find any motive behind Anshu Dixit killing the two gangsters. No personal or gang rivalry has surfaced during the probe,” he an official said, adding, “There was nothing to suggest that Anshu was asked to eliminate the duo and was provided the firearm inside the jail.” He said the gates of Anshu’s as well as Mukeem’s barrack were found open during the incident. He said Anshu came out of his barrack after shooting dead Meraj Ahmad and then entered Mukeem’s barrack. The question is : were the gates of the two barrack intentionally left open? Sources also claimed that CCTV cameras installed in the gallery where the incident happened were not functional for many months. They said the investigators had not able to find any video footage of the incident that could help in solving the mystery behind the unprovoked firing by Anshu. Anshu ensured death of both The post-mortem examination of the bodies of the three gangsters killed in the shootout revealed that Anshu shot Meraj Ahmad thrice before pumping over 10 bullets into Mukeem’s body. He himself was later killed in police firing. The post-mortem examination revealed that Anshu suffered over 16 gunshots. Anshu had over two dozen bullets The investigation suggested that Anshu fired over 15 rounds of bullets to eliminate Meraj Ahmad and Mukeem and over 10 rounds when he held five prisoners hostage and police team was asking him to surrender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chitrakoot-jail-shoot-out-jail-staff-hand-suspectedin-smuggling-pistol-inside-101621096623951.html

It has been decided to stop this immediately and all those infected should be admitted to isolation centres or CCCs for treatment," Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan said.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the DCM who also heads the task force said, CCCs will be established at PHC level.The DCM said at the meeting it was decided to start administering the first dose of Covishield for those above 45."As the gap between first and the second dose of the Covishield vaccination has been increased from 4-6 week duration to 12-16 weeks, it has been decided to give a second dose to those whose are due and to start administering first dose to those above 45.It was earlier decided to stop first dose until those due for second are completed," he said.However in the case of Covaxin, it has been decided to administer the second dose to those above 45 years who are due on priority and then start administering the first dose, he said, adding that "for those between 18-45 years, it has been decided to give vaccine after the app that is being developed is interfaced with COVIN app."The subject of global tender for vaccines also came up at the taskforce meeting and it has been approved, Narayan said. "We will be sourcing it from various companies.""Earlier it was mentioned about sourcing 2 crore vaccines from one company, now it has been decided to split it into four with 50 lakh vaccines each," he said.Global tender for vaccines needs funding of ₹843 crore and the task force approved this, a release from his office said. It has also been decided to vaccinate more front line workers and those providing essential services on priority, like those working with banking, postal and internet services, and those who come in contact with the public, the DCM said.It has been decided to consider those working at crematorum as frontline workers and also to provide them with insurance under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, he added.It was decided at the meeting that in every district hospital 100 ICU beds shall be made available on a permanent basis, and for this, required infrastructure and manpower need to be provided and all these should have oxygen generating units.According to the release, the Centre will be asked to provide 20,000 vials of Amphotericin B to tackle black fungal infections as there is shortage of the drug and it is estimated that about 400 cases are expected per week in the days to come.Oxygen bottling plants will be set up in 9 districts that do not have this facility.Oxygen generators of 200-300 ltr/minute will be set up in community health centres. All the beds will be oxygenated in all taluk hospitals and to facilitate this, oxygen generators of capacity 500-600 ltr/minute will be set up, it said. Global tender will be issued to procure 5 lakh Remdesivir injections and ₹75 Crore kept reserved for this purpose.Also it has been decided to procure 1 lakh pulse oximeters, and to set up 100 bedded secondary hospitals in each assembly constituency of Bengaluru and 1 tertiary care hospital for every 4 constituencies.On relieving the city civic body, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, from the responsibility of health management of the city, the release, quoting the DCM, said, the task force decided to review bifurcating the health management system in Bengaluru and proposed to move it to Health and Family department.However, to make this a reality certain technical issues need to be studied and a committee will be constituted to look into this and will be asked to submit the report at the next meeting of the task force, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/home-isolation-not-allowed-in-rural-areas-and-urban-slums-of-karnataka-govt-101621094754871.html

A police control room (PCR) motorcycle team has been delivering food to needy patients and has already catered to at least 20 patients. The move comes after Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta issued directions to launch Covid canteens in all districts.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, law and order) Ashwani Kapoor is the nodal officer for the initiative in Ludhiana. Kapoor along with four assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) — ACP traffic Gurdev Singh, ACP crime-1 Mandeep Singh, ACP crime-2 Surinder Mohan and ACP command centre Naveen Kumar are ensuring that only those in genuine need are availing the service. Covid patients can call on the helpline numbers 181 and 112 to seek the police’s help in getting cooked food delivered. Personnel in the PCR will collect the address and contact details of the caller and share it with teams, who will verify the details of the caller and check their Covid report.Patients who have availed of the service once need not call every day. “After receiving the first call, we will provide two meals (lunch and dinner) a day to the patient until he or she is under isolation,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/polices-bike-squad-delivers-meals-to-covid-patients-101621094343933.html

15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Chandigarh’s pretty chicks||A definitive indicator of habitat acceptance by a wild creature is that the species is able to breed and rear its offspring to maturity. So it is with the grey partridge (francolin), an iconic bird of the North-west Indian countryside facing a rapid decline in numbers in its stronghold habitats, but one that has adapted and settled down in the heart of Chandigarh. It can be encountered in parks in pairs or small coveys or perched on boundary walls like a common dove or babbler. At the sprawling and verdant complex of the Government College for Girls, Sector 11, birder and conservationist Vikas Salil Sharma has photo-documented the successful breeding of partridges, a species whose reproductive season is currently underway.Zoologist and author Dr Rajive Kalsi has undertaken extensive field research and conducted radio collar studies on the breeding ecology and conservation status of partridges. He explains why this bird has been able to breed successfully in an urban habitat. “Chandigarh sports mature trees which partridges use to roost at night and be safe from ground predators. The city is landscaped with shrubs, hedges and bushes and these not only provide cover to partridges but are the habitat for insects, which partridge chicks feed exclusively on. The city has abundant ‘deemak’, which chicks relish. The grey partridge, as compared to the black partridge, is a bolder species and ventures into new areas to find suitable habitat. Hence, the grey partridge adaptability to diverse habitats. Hunting and trapping is of relatively low incidence in the city. Finally, the application of pesticides is lesser in the city as compared to the partridge’s traditional habitats spanning the agriculture-jungle-scrubland mosaic. Pesticides constitute the main factor for partridge decline in the countryside,” Dr Kalsi told this writer. Beauty at our feetThe soil from where these violet flowers bloom is riddled with pebbles and is stone-dry. Hugging the ground in humility, the blooms smile at the clear sky even though they lie bang in the centre of a winding cattle track that leads over the Mirzapur check dam’s embankment to the waters below. The cattle’s heavy hooves have somehow missed these flowers attended by fabulously fiendish, upright thorns, festive yellow berries and greenish, deeply-lobed leaves that resemble a human palm with more than five, awkwardly jutting and stubby fingers. This lovely shrub inhabiting the arid terrain of the Shivalik foothills goes by the intriguing common English names of dwarf wild brinjal, Jacquin’s nightshade, prickly brinjal, prickly nightshade, Thai eggplant, thorny nightshade and yellow-berried nightshade. In Punjabi, it is known as kandiali, chhoti mauhari or unt katara and in Hindi as kantkari. It is recognised in the scientific world by the botanical nomenclature of Solanum virginianum.Despite its seemingly unobtrusive life at the mercy of the various clumsy feet of men and big beasts that may trod and trample over it at the peril of inviting a thorny jab, derivatives of this shrub are an important ingredient in the preparation of the ayruvedic dashmool formulation used in the treatment of cough, asthma and chest complaints. Pastes derived from the shrub find application in traditional and folklore medicines, too. As a research study pointed out while underscoring the pharma potential of Solanum virginianum: “Herbal medicines are of growing interest because of their cost effective and eco-friendly attributes.”So, the next time when out for a nature ramble in the Shivaliks, pay attention to the beauty and utility of these self-effacing shrubs that lie at your feet and smile up at you amid the perennial adversity of existence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-chandigarh-s-pretty-chicks-101621091530284.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Not just women rights, men’s lives matter too!||“Tell me, do wives frequently harass their husbands or is the incidence directly proportional to the number of years of marriage?” an unmarried friend asked me recently. I told her that it was indeed true in several cases. “Oh! this is completely new to me. I have heard of husbands harassing their wives and not vice versa,” she said, with a hearty laugh. As she fished for more information, I asked her to read the newspapers attentively every day. Many advertisements and movies show domestic violence against women, little realising that it is a two-way street. Incidentally, Aamir Khan’s TV show, Satyamev Jayate, had also observed that men do not suffer from marital hostility. Several years ago, a woman was conferred a socio-cultural award because she had the guts to incriminate her husband and in-laws in her marital home when she found that her husband was earning less than her! How did it matter who earned more when the money one earns is for mutual comfort? Legal terrorism : Guilty until proven innocent Around two decades ago, men became acutely aware of this legal terrorism by wives. False claims of dowry harassment leading to psychological abuse and incarceration of husbands became the norm. Once in custody, which is non-bailable, husbands generally lose their jobs. Who will reach out to such men in misery? A person is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but here a person is held guilty until proven innocent! Consequently, men have become gynophobic and have begun viewing the institution of marriage as a snare. This has put the institution in danger and has resulted in a reduced wedding rate in the country. As most men marry after becoming financially stable, the likelihood of losing their wealth and property due to false implications, has discouraged many a man from committing to a partner. Domestic violence against men is increasing in leaps and bounds and the novel-coronavirus lockdown has added to incidents of violence against the ‘stronger sex’. Most cases of domestic violence against men go unreported as they feel too humiliated to report abuse and fear false accusations against them in reprisal. Men activists have been asking for laws that are gender neutral and not women-centric because anti-dowry laws are often being misused to extort husbands and to harass them. Reversing trend in domestic violence These laws are responsible for the high rate of suicide among married men who are tortured by their wives and their relatives. A recent survey showed that around 65,000 married men had died by suicide against 28,000 married women. This certainly shows that the trend of domestic abuse is reversing. If a married woman commits suicide within seven years of marriage, her husband and his family are taken into police custody, whereas hardly any action is taken when a man ends his life due to the torture by his wife and in-laws. We must definitely empower women but not at the expense of men. After all, their lives matter too!

15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Bar or bench - a tough balancing act amid Covid||The Punjab and Haryana high court and all courts subordinate to it in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, suspended their normal functioning in the third week of March 2020. The HC has been hearing a limited number of matters through video-conferencing mode. Things began to look up when the Centre and state governments began to open up all sectors of the economy. However, courts failed to keep pace with the sectors that were opening up. The limited listing of matters has adversely affected the livelihood of thousands of advocates and their associates. Since September 2020, the advocates have been demanding that steps be taken to normalise courts’ functioning in a phased manner. However, the demand hardly evoked a favourable response, which led to passing of a resolution dated February 1, demanding the transfer of the chief justice and boycotting his court until then. A middle path was struck where the court administration agreed to open courts for physical hearing in a phased manner and also agreed to make all courts functional through video-conferencing mode. The listing of fresh matters increased to approximately 1,000 cases per day, bringing respite to advocates and litigants. As the Covid curve steepened in April, the HC administration yet again started restricting the listing of cases from April 23. Only around 117 matters were listed for hearing on May 10 before 13 benches of the HC. Even anticipatory bails and other matters concerning life and liberty of citizens are not being listed. The bar association tried to prevail upon the HC administration to open up listing and hearing through video conferencing, but to no avail . Consequently, on May 7, the executive committee of the bar association decided to revive the resolution seeking transfer of the chief justice. The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana was prompt to intervene and issued a letter highlighting the surge in virus cases and also delved on the safety of advocates, judges, judicial officers, and court staff. The bar council went ahead to stay the May 7 resolution . It is a matter of debate as to under what provision of law the bar council stayed the resolution passed by a bar association, which is an independent body registered under the Society Registration Act. During the last year, advocates’ income has drastically decreased. Unable to bear the cost of living in the tricity, many were forced to leave for their home towns and villages. Those who have stayed behind are struggling to make ends meet. An overwhelming majority of advocates, to borrow a phrase, have to virtually dig the well every day to drink water. The Bar Council has also not taken any tangible steps to alleviate the sufferings of the advocates in the last year. Experts are now predicting a third wave of infections, so Covid is here for the long haul. The Bar Council must also clarify its plans for advocates in case courts continue to work in a restricted manner for the rest the year. With listing of cases curtailed to such an extent, the high court administration should consider rescheduled the summer vacations to an earlier date along the lines of the Supreme Court and Allahabad HC. This will allow the HC to work through June. The former Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had once remarked, “The Bar is the mother of the bench. After all most judges commence their careers at the bar and then join the judiciary. All of us, I like to think, are co-parceners of an undivided family.” The chief justice of the HC is the karta of this undivided family and it is hoped that he will take into consideration the extreme hardship faced by a large number of family members and will perform a balancing act to address concerns of the bar and the bench.

15-05-2021||Pune||NDRF deploys teams to Goa, Mumbai||In order to prepare and assist in the possible rescue and relief operations of cyclone Tauktae, the National disaster response force’s (NDRF) Pune unit has sent a team to Goa and three teams to Mumbai. “We have deployed three teams in Mumbai, one in Goa, and 14 teams are ready in Pune. These teams can be deployed in any part of the country in a short time. The cyclone is around 250-300km away from the western coastline. The possibility of it hitting Maharashtra will be either late night today or tomorrow morning. It is at quite a distance from Maharashtra. Therefore, the effect on Maharashtra’s coastal districts will be less. There may be wind and rainfall in some areas but to deal with this, the state government and NDRF are completely equipped,” said commandant Anupam Srivastav of NDRF. The teams left in the early hours of Saturday and is expected to have reached Goa by afternoon. “The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a weather forecast regarding pre-cyclone watch for south Gujarat and Diu coasts (Depression over Lakshadweep area). As per the forecast, it is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and will possibly intensify further. It is very likely to move north-north-westwards and reach near Gujarat coast by May 18th morning and the warning has been issued for Lakshadweep Islands, Kerala, Tamil Nadu (ghat districts) and Karnataka (coastal and adjoining ghat districts),” read a press release by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India. IN Murthy, the operations official at corporate headquarters of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Delhi has directed all concerned airport officials to take measures. “Keeping safety in mind and to minimize damage to the airport infrastructure, airports are advised to plan as per as per the SoPs and guidelines. To safeguard the airport infrastructures, precautionary measures as per check lists for pre-cyclone and post-cyclone are being ensured by concerned airports,” read the PIB release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ndrf-deploys-teams-to-goa-mumbai-101621090144937.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: What post-vax world looks like for kids||“Vaccines are magic.” The words of our microbiology professor in the ‘honeymoon phase’ of medical college resonate with me all the more now that I am a paediatrician. While the world was grappling with the novel coronavirus, scientists over the world were busy launching a defence of their own: vaccines. Much has already been said, heard and read about them, which can be summarised in three words – get your jab! For the time being, the vaccine will protect parents while the kids patiently wait for their turn. This divide prompts the question: What is the world going to look like for kids? The rules do not change for children. India is still at war with the virus, and a third wave, which is also likely to target children, looms large. Statistics reveal that 0.5-2% of paediatric cases were seen during the first wave, which has now increased to an alarming 8-10%. The reason for the virulence of the new strain among children is that the previous strain was known to attach itself to the ACE 2 receptor and multiply, which was not seen in paediatric cases due its low expression rates in kids. Thus, children mostly remained unscathed during the first wave of the pandemic. The B 1.617 strain has undergone mutations, which allow it to surpass antibodies and weaken immune defences. All age groups from newborns to teens have been testing positive for the virus. The second wave is expected to peak in mid-May and last for another four to six weeks. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has thus issued some guidelines on how to keep kids healthy during this grim time. What can parents do? In these difficult times, parents have a lot on their plate be it work from home, household chores or home-schooling. However, they can take a slew of steps to create a friendly environment at home by “being creative and searching for safe alternatives,” says epidemiologist Dr Yvones of Stanford. The alternatives include: •Visual Socialising : Going for online play dates, hobby classes, doing crafts or even watching a movie together once a week. •Outdoor activities: Kids may wear a mask and play outside with their friends in groups of two to three, which could include playing ball, lemon race and relay races. Infrequent play dates with the same family or friend who is also practising everyday preventive measures poses medium risk. •Birthday parties: Set up zoom calls, plan a movie night , fancy dress in the family, face painting or set up a bowling alley at home. What kids should do? The best way to teach children is to set an example. Since the virus is literally in our hands we must teach and re-teach the importance of: •Washing hands : With an alcohol-based soap for 20 seconds •Mask up: Children over five years require to wear a mask outside . They can wear a cloth mask but make sure it is washed before each use. Children less than two years should not wear a mask as they may suffocate. A surgical mask should be worn by children above five years in high-density areas or around Covid positive cases in their household. The mask should snugly fit and cover the nose. •Sanitisation: Sanitising hands before going for and after coming from grocery runs, playing outside and meeting people should be practised. Though the CDC does not recommend that children go out to grocery stores or to their friends’ houses. How to boost your child’s immunity? A well-rounded diet, good sleep and three basic supplements will do the trick: •Vitamin C : Co-factor to many metalloproteins, collagen formation and a powerful antioxidant, it is used in the defence mechanism of our bodies and is widely known to delay the progression of cold. •Vitamin D : Breast-fed children tend to have vitamin-D deficiency. It is imperative to treat the underlying deficiency as it may lead to increased inflammation and increased risk of pneumonia. •Zinc: Deficiency leads to stunted linear growth and impairs immune response towards infections. •Vaccination: Due to the pandemic, parents have not vaccinated their children against other diseases, which also influences and affects immunity. According to the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) guidelines, there is no contraindication of vaccination during the pandemic. Children in containment zones who have missed vaccines can have multiple vaccines in one sitting and using the minimum permitted interval between two doses of the same inactivated vaccine can be practised to complete the schedule in the shortest possible time. The light at the end of tunnel is vaccination for our kids. Pfizer has already formulated a vaccine for kids between 12-15 years of age, which will be produced by the end of this year or early 2022.We must understand that we do not live in a zero-risk world and need to evaluate our risks prudently before letting our guard down since our children do not live in bubbles anymore.

15-05-2021||Pune||10 per cent rise in PMC’s share for the Swargate-Katraj metro project||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will have to increase its financial share in the proposed underground Swargate-Katraj metro extension route. The PMC, which is already battling a shortage of revenue in light of the pandemic, will have to now contribute 15 per cent of the overall project cost. Earlier, the PMC was to contribute 5.44 per cent; however, the Centre has reduced its contribution. PMC Commissioner Vikram Kumar has now tabled a proposal in the standing committee to approve 15 per cent financial contribution for Swargate-Katraj Metro extension project, which is expected to be a major relief for those living on Satara road. The standing committee meeting scheduled next week is likely to discuss the proposal. While the total estimated cost of the project is ₹4,283 crore, PMC will have to contribute ₹733.85 crore in the project including ₹248.62 crore of land acquisition and rehabilitation cost. Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman said, “As per Central government directives, PMC will have to increase its share in the project.” In the existing Pune Metro project which is underway between Swargate to Chinchwad and Vanaz to Ramwadi, PMC’s financial contribution is only 10 per cent. As per Central urban development ministry officials, the union government has reduced their financial contribution and instructed PMC to contribute 15 per cent of the overall project cost.” Ulka Kalaskar, chief accountant officer of PMC said, “Earlier, the civic body was supposed to contribute only 5 per cent of the amount in the project. Now, our share has increased, and we will have to pay 15 per cent of the total project cost.” The administration has sought a nod to cancel the earlier (March 2021) proposal passed in the general body meeting earmarking 5.44 per cent on the total project cost, which was ₹233.00 crore for the land acquisition and rehabilitation purposes. The new proposal has now sought a standing committee nod for the increased allocation of ₹733.85 crore including ₹485.23 crore as 15 per cent financial contribution in the project and land acquisition and rehabilitation cost of ₹248.62 crore. A PMC official said, “During recent project monitoring meeting, Maha-Metro informed deputy chief Minister Ajit Pawar that centre is not going to give 20 per cent share in Swargate- Katraj project. After that deputy chief minister instructed PMC to increase its share. Now, PMC and state will contribute 15 per cent each and central will give 10 percent contribution. Remaining 60 per cent will be raised in the form of loan.”The PMC has also mentioned that they will not take any financial liability in the terms of state and Central government loans. Maharashtra Metro railway Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) will follow up with the state and Central government for implementation of the project. According to the Detailed Project Report (DPR) prepared by Maha Metro last year, the per kilometre cost of the metro line is estimated to be ₹783.85 crore. The 5.4 kilometre Swargate-Katraj stretch will be underground and will cost ₹4,283 crore. There will be four stations on the stretch, which is an extension of the Swargate-Nigdi line being developed by MahaMetro. -------------------------------------- Header: The Swargate-Katraj Metro Length of the proposed project-5.464 km- Estimated per kilometre cost - ₹783.85 crore- Total estimated cost of project - ₹4,283.72 crore Estimated cost for rehabilitation, resettlement and land acquisition- ₹248.62 crore Land required for the project: 19,350.733 sq. m Name of four stations *Swargate *Gultekdi (Market yard) *Sai baba Mandir *Katraj junction Expected footfall Year Footfall 2027 –95,000 2037 –158,000 2047 –187,000 2057-197,000||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/10-per-cent-rise-in-pmc-s-share-for-the-swargate-katraj-metro-project-101621090083834.html
15-05-2021||Pune||Man cuts himself to evade arrest, booked for attempted suicide||A man was booked for attempted suicide for cutting himself to evade arrest by Pune police in the early morning hours of Friday. The man is identified as Billusingh Prabhusingh Taak (30), a resident of Dhangarvasti in Haveli. He is currently undergoing treatment at Sassoon General Hospital for the wounds caused during his attack on self and the fall from a motorbike that he suffered while running from the police. A complaint in the matter was lodged by police naik Amit Babasaheb Salunkhe of Lonikalbhor police station. The parliament had passed the Mental Health Care Act in 2018 which states that “Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said code.” However, cases do get registered under Section 309 of IPC on multiple occasions. In fact, the use of hurting oneself to evade arrest is witnessed by police on multiple occasions. The police had gone to arrest him after he was identified as a suspect in a case under Section 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 380 (theft in a dwelling house etc.,) Of the Indian Penal Code. The crime detection team of Lonikalbhor police station had set a trap near his house to arrest him in the theft case around 5am on Friday. The man realised the set-up and tried to flee from the police on a motorbike. However, he slipped and fell on the road along Urulidevachi Palkhi in Haveli. He fell near a field and started running in it. However, when he realised that the police were closing in, he used the knife in his possession and cut himself on his hands, neck, and stomach, according to the police. The case was registered against him under Section 309 (attempted suicide) of the Indian Penal Code at Lonikalbhor police station. While his relation to the Taak crime family of Ramtekdi, Hadapsar is not yet confirmed, this method of evading arrest is known to have been used by the criminals from Ramtekdi - Taak, Kalyani, and Dudhani families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-cuts-himself-to-evade-arrest-booked-for-attempted-suicide-101621090023841.html
15-05-2021||Pune||110 graduated medical cadets to join fight against Covid Armed Forces Medical Services||As many as 110 medical cadets, including 21 female cadets of the 55th (C3) batch of the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) were commissioned as medical officers into the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) on Saturday. The Passing out Parade (PoP) for commissioning AFMC Medical Cadets had to be called off for the first time since 1982 due to the prevailing Covid-19 restrictions. The medical cadets were commissioned by Lt Gen Nardeep Naithani, commandant AFMC, in a brief ceremony at AFMC. Among the 110 cadets, 94 Cadets were commissioned into the Army, 10 in the Indian Air Force, and six in the Indian Navy. The newly commissioned medical officers were administered oath of allegiance to the Constitution of India by Col AK Shakya, Col Training, AFMC. In his commissioning address, Gen Naithani congratulated the newly commissioned officers for joining the AFMS which is the finest integrated medical organization in the country. He stated that C3 batch has the unique distinction of having the entire batch that entered AFMC in 2016 graduating together with 100 per cent success, which he said is the best tribute to the teachers at AFMC. Gen Naithani reminded the graduating batch that they were joining the medical profession at a time when the country was passing through a difficult phase and exhorted them to put their knowledge and skills acquired at AFMC to provide the best possible care to their patients as they join the Nation’s battle against Covid-19 as Covid warriors. He expressed confidence that, given their academic rigor and training, the newly commissioned medical officers would always measure up to the highest standards expected from military doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/110-graduated-medical-cadets-to-join-fight-against-covid-armed-forces-medical-services-101621089963710.html
15-05-2021||Pune||Tauktae’s impact on onset of monsoon in Maharashtra too early to predict, scientists say||As cyclone Tauktae further intensifies in the Arabian Sea, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the southwest monsoon may now reach Kerala by May 31, a day prior to the normal date. However, how the cyclone will impact the monsoon’s arrival and withdrawal in Maharashtra is being studied, said IMD scientists. OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group (CMPG) at IMD Pune said that once the cyclone conditions are over, the picture will get clearer. “It is difficult to say at this time when the monsoon will reach Maharashtra. We can get an idea after the dissipation of the cyclonic storm currently over the Arabian Sea. However, the current formation of the cyclone will strengthen the cross-equatorial flow and help strengthen the monsoon flow. At the same time, a direct correlation cannot be made between the cyclone and the monsoon onset,” said Sreejith. According Sreejith, cyclones in Arabian Sea which are moving towards Yemen and Oman may adversely affect the southwest monsoon. “But for cyclone Tauktae, it’s path is parallel to the Indian coast and so there are chances that it will help the monsoon to advance,” said Sreejith. As per the weather department, the monsoon advance over Andaman and Nicobar Islands is very likely around May 21. However, the past data suggests that there is no association of the date of monsoon advance over the Andaman Sea either with the date of monsoon onset over Kerala or with the seasonal monsoon rainfall over the country. As per a recent paper published by Elena Surovyatkina, researcher from Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany, monsoon will reach central part of India which includes south-eastern part of Maharashtra state, western part of Chhattisgarh state and the northern part of Telangana state between June 21 to June 29. “Pre-monsoon isolated rainfall may appear in the period from 14 -17 June. The continuous monsoon rainfall is expected to start from June 29 in the region,” stated the paper. Cyclone watch Meteorologists from IMD said that the cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm until Saturday evening. Thereafter, it is further expected to intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm until the morning of May 16. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon/ evening according to weather department. On Saturday, no rainfall was reported in Pune city. As per IMD, the day temperature in Pune city was 36.8 degrees Celsius and the night temperature was 24.4 degrees Celsius. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department at IMD Pune said that ghat areas around Pune may receive heavy rainfall. “There is a chance of cloudy weather in the city on May 16. The ghat areas may receive heavy rainfall. Moderate rain (15.6 – 64.4 mm) with isolated heavy (64.5-115.5mm) rainfall is very likely in ghat areas. Thunderstorm and lightning, likely on May 16,” said Kashyapi. Kolhapur and Mahabaleshwar reported rainfall on Saturday. In Konkan and Goa, Ratnagiri and Panjim also reported rainfall. The highest maximum temperature reported in Maharashtra was at 42.2 degrees Celsius at Akola and the lowest minimum temperature reported was at 18.4 degrees Celsius at Mahabaleshwar on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tauktaes-impact-on-onset-of-monsoon-in-maharashtra-too-early-to-predict-scientists-say-101621089843700.html

15-05-2021||Delhi||As Covid deaths go up, Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan crematorium will add 150 more pyres||Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan crematorium will soon be extended an additional 1,000 meters on its east side to create space for 150 more pyres and 10 electric crematorium facilities. Construction will begin once the ongoing lockdown ends, crematorium officials told news agency ANI on Saturday.Crematoriums in the national capital have been inundated with a massive number of bodies amid the raging second wave of the pandemic. In the face of this increased pressure, crematorium authorities had to turn the family members of the deceased away and people had to run pillar to post and wait for up to 20 hours to get their loved ones cremated. Delhi has recorded a total of 21,244 deaths since the pandemic began last year.Crematoriums have also been dealing with the issue of ashes piling up as family members are unable to collect them either because they are themselves infected or they fear getting infected. Delhi’s Nigam Bodh Ghat and Ghazipur crematorium have huge amount of ashes uncollected. As per Hindu tradition, the ashes of the deceased need to be immersed in the Ganga after the last rites have been carried out.South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s sanitary superintendent KC Bhardwaj who looks after the operation of eight crematoriums told news agency ANI that currently, the Sarai Kale Khan crematorium is operating on 3,000 meters of land and that the planned extension will be near the Yamuna river."At present, we are operating on 3,000 meters. However, the proposal of increasing another 1,000 meters has been granted. Space won't be a problem at all because a repetition of the scenario that Delhi witnessed is unthinkable." said Bhardwaj"Extension at the eastern side has been well calculated as it will be near the Yamuna River," he added.Delhi has been witnessing a decline in the daily tally of cases, as the number of tests conducted daily has also been decreasing. On Saturday, the national capital recorded 6,430 new Covid-19 cases and 337 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-covid-deaths-go-up-delhi-s-sarai-kale-khan-crematorium-will-add-150-more-pyres-101621089035343.html

On arrival in Zagreb, the crew was told that orders have changed. SpiceJet crew rested in the aircraft for 21 hours (as mandated by regulation). They then flew back to Delhi," said the spokesperson.The massive surge in Covid-19 cases across the country is the reason for asking India-based airlines for a compulsory RT-PCR test report at the Croatian airport."Due to sudden and massive increase in Covid-19 cases in India, they have now been instructed that RT-PCR is required. This came as a surprise," added the spokesperson.India's low-cost airline SpiceJet has submitted a full report related to the case to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and complied with the rules."Since the crew could not fly back immediately due Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) restrictions, bedding, food, water was provided in the aircraft. The plane was cleaned and DGCA permission was obtained," said the spokesperson.India's aviation watchdog DGCA official has admonished the SpiceJet pilots and officials on the said incident.In the last 24 hours, India has recorded 3,26,098 new Covid-19 cases and 3,53,299 recoveries.

15-05-2021||Lucknow||This is the best time to improvise held over projects: Tanmay||Filmmaker Tanmay Telang is all glad about his debut feature film doing rounds at international festivals, but equally bothersome that many of his upcoming projects are on hold due to the ongoing pandemic surge. Though the UPite is trying to make most of the time he has by working on the projects that will be shot in continuance once things get normal. “We were supposed to start the shoot of our first web-series ‘Pirates’ in Ukraine from May 10 but now it has been delayed for at least two months. The series has already been commissioned by a leading platform and we are looking forward to shoot as early as possible,” said Tanmay. His first film as co-producer is Marathi film ‘Dristhant’ which featured a visually impaired cast. “Not only actors, the singers, musicians and dubbing artistes all have same special-abilities. We have submitted the film in various film festivals and after a year we will release the film.” His mega project on slain gangster Vikas Dubey too got delayed. “We now plan to shoot the OTT series by year-end. We have taken rights and permissions to shoot from his wife Richa, son Akash, Special Task Force (STF) and other government departments. This is going to be a mega series which we will shoot in Kanpur and Mathura where we will re-create Bikroo village (originally in Kanpur Dehat where the shoot out took place killing eight cops).” Tanmay shares that his team had lined up production for ‘Hurdang’ (Sunny Singh and Nushrratt Bharuccha) which was shot in Agra followed by Abhishek Bachchan starrer ‘Dasvi’. “Besides, we had many more projects that were in advance stage of pre-production. Now, with everything on hold, this is the best time to improvise those projects,” he adds. Talking about his journey he said, “I was born in Vrindavan and was brought up Noida. I went to a college in Pune where I completed my graduation in film making. Then I along with my friend-partner Harshvardhan joined the team of producer Sailesh R Singh the maker of like ‘Tanu Weds Manu’ and ‘Shahid.’ He is our mentor and inspiration so that’s how we got hands-on experience in production work and since then we have been handling all his UP projects in some capacity or other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/this-is-the-best-time-to-improvise-held-over-projects-tanmay-101621087624225.html
15-05-2021||Dehradun||As of now, my priority is my state & its people: Raghav Juyal||Battling Covid infection dancer, actor and TV anchor Raghav Juyal, who was in midst of professional commitments, came back to his home state Uttarakhand to restore his health. But, putting everything behind he started helping those in need in the best possible way. “I just can’t go back leaving my people who are like my family in lurch and join the bandwagon to earn money. I am no big star, in fact I’m in the beginning of my career and absolutely respect my work but for now my priority is my state and its people who are fighting the second wave of this deadly pandemic. I am giving my all to be of some help to those who are living in the worst hit areas,” said the ‘Bahut Hua Samman’ and ‘ABCD-2’ actor. With regular posts and appeals on social media, Raghav wants more people to come forward and help. “I am making constant appeals for help as I know social media has a vast reach. It’s a challenging phase for the entire country where people are constantly losing their loved ones. In such gloomy times, I have seen many celebs making fun videos, flashing abs and what not! This actually left me baffled thinking what’s wrong with us? Have we crossed the line of selfishness and become too practical because for me this is inhuman!.” Giving an insight on his emotions side, he said, “I am fun loving person and trust me I too never knew that I have such strong emotional side to myself. Maybe seeing so much pain and agony around made me go out the way and forget all. I came back home to get better but when I reached here, I saw my brother and numerous young volunteers doing so much for people on ground level. This inspired me. I along with my close friend Cheenu, who runs Khushi Foundation in Mumbai, decided to work together towards helping as many as we can and save lives. We are all set to open our first help desk at Pawri following many more villages,” he said. Raghav did call up actor and social worker Sonu Sood and asked how to go about it. “It was in the beginning I called him: ‘Bhai please tell me how to go about it?’ He guided me and then him team recently helped me in getting an elderly woman admitted in a big hospital. Also, I am grateful to Uttarakhand Governor’s office for providing me with a team helping me take efforts far and wide. Now, I want more celebs to come forward and help in whatever capacity they can,” said Raghav who was last seen anchoring reality ‘Dance Deewane 3.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/as-of-now-my-priority-is-my-state-its-people-raghav-juyal-101621087504228.html

Acting on the recommendation of a high-powered committee, constituted on the Supreme Court’s direction, the jail authorities released the convicts. This was stated during a virtual meeting of the committee, headed by justice Ravi Malimath, the executive chairman of State Service Authority, on Friday. The meeting was also attended by justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan as special invitee, additional chief secretary (home) Manoj Kumar, director general of police (prisons) N Venu Gopal D and Prem Lal Ranta, a member secretary. In a release issued later, Ranta said it was once again ordered to decongest the prisons by releasing the inmates on interim bail or parole. At present, 71 inmates are out of jail on parole. Besides, 33 life convicts have also been prematurely released from jails on the recommendations of the HP State Sentence Review Board. “It has been resolved that convicts, who are at present on parole, will be granted special parole, according to the decision of the high-powered committee. Those who surrendered on time will be entitled for an additional period of 90 days,” he said. It has been directed that inmates and jail staff are entitled to medical facilities and Covid-19 safety equipment such as masks, sanitisers and PPE kits when required, according to the health department’s protocol. “The jail superintendents shall maintain appropriate levels of hygiene and sanitation in the jails and suitable precautions be taken to prevent the transmission of diseases among inmates,” Ranta said. Last year, from April 1 to December 31, 2020, as many as 236 convicts were released on parole, four undertrials were released on bail and 15 life convicts were prematurely released on the recommendation of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/245-convicts-released-to-decongest-jails-in-hp-amid-second-covid-wave-101621082704128.html
15-05-2021||Jaipur||Volunteers step in to deal with Covid-19 crisis in Rajasthan||Jaipur/Kota/Udaipur: Volunteers have stepped in across Rajasthan to help deal with the shortage of critical supplies like oxygen and dispel misinformation about Covid-19 as infections have surged in the state. In Jaipur, Isha Juneja, a journalism student, leads a group that tracks people, who have recovered from the illness and can help others by donating plasma. The group of over 500 volunteers verify leads on social media and help potential donors connect with families of the patients. She said when she started the group, she would receive 50 distress calls a day. “There has been some decline in the calls and now we get about 25 to 30 calls daily,” Juneja said. “If some people have oxygen cylinders but do not need them anymore, we connect them to those in need.” In the Dungarpur district, a group of women volunteers have joined hands with police to encourage people to wear masks and stay home till the infection rate is brought under control. The group has also been creating awareness. Dungarpur police superintendent Sudheer Joshi said this “Police Sakhi” project has been very successful. “The girls also visit important junctions of the city where they tell people about the pandemic and the ways to prevent it. They are present at pickets where they carry out important duties as volunteers.” Similarly, young men have been helping people with hospital admissions and last rites in cities such as Udaipur and Kota. Imran Qureshi, 37, has been ferrying oxygen cylinders from the refilling centre in Kota on his bike. He is a part of a 15-member volunteers’ team. Amaranth Chaurasia, 52, who contracted Covid-19 along with his wife, Rani, 50, in Kota, said Qureshi helped them arrange oxygen as there was no one in their family who could help them. “Imran and his volunteers brought Oxygen from somewhere. We will remain indebted to him throughout our lives.” Qureshi and his colleagues have also performed last rites in crematoriums and graveyards. “We are available round the clock for the service of Covid-19 patients and their families who are in dire need of assistance and cooperation,” he said. Qureshi has also been facilitating hospital admissions and motivating those who have recovered from Covid to donate plasma. Rahul Jain, Founder of Social Youth Club, and its president, Zeeshan Ansari, have been providing water and buttermilk as well as oxygen cylinders in Kota. “...we have been doing this for over a fortnight now while we are running an Oxygen Bank in which we have 22 oxygen cylinders which we are providing free to those who are in need of them for refilling...,” said Jain. Farid, 40, and his friend, Tauseef Germanwala, 33, have been offering food to people under home isolation in Udaipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/volunteers-step-in-to-deal-with-covid-19-crisis-in-rajasthan-101621081504427.html

Gurpartap, who was the complainant in the case, and Paramjit were arrested by the Fazilka police on Friday evening for staging the robbery, while their accomplice, Gurpreet Singh, is absconding. Also read: Cases of post-Covid mucormycosis are increasing, says AIIMS chiefPolice recovered the cash and a licensed weapon from Paramjit, a resident of Prabhat Singh Wala near Jalalabad in Fazilka district. In his complaint, Gurpartap had claimed that two unidentified motorcycle-borne thieves robbed him and his subordinate Luvpreet Singh at gunpoint on May 12. He had said that the robbers targeted their car and threw chilli powder in their eyes before fleeing with a trunk containing the cash when they were taking it from the Muktsar branch to the bank’s Jalalabad branch. Forensic experts find shots were fired at parked car Forensic experts, however, raised doubts during investigation. Ferozepur range deputy inspector general of police (DIG) HS Mann said on Saturday that contrary to Gurpartap’s claim, it was found that the bullets were shot at the car when it was parked. “The complainant stated that they had to stop the car after the accused shot at the tyres. But forensic examination showed the bullets were shot at the rim of a parked car. This was the clinching evidence followed by technical and human intelligence inputs that helped our team crack the case,” the DIG said. He said Luvpreet has not been given a clean chit and more arrests are likely to be made in the case. Mann said Paramjit and Gurpreet were previously involved in drug peddling in Fazilka and Amritsar districts, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/complainant-held-for-bank-robbery-of-rs-45-lakh-in-jalalabad-101621078743846.html
15-05-2021||Gurugram||Caught in lockdown, thousands of workers in Gurugram have nowhere to go||With Haryana’s Covid-induced lockdown crippling industries and construction projects, thousands of migrant workers in Gurugram and Manesar are under financial stress. Not being able to make rent, buy groceries or return home, they say they are living on a thin line of hope that the lockdown would be lifted soon. As per local trade unions and industrial associations, the lockdown imposed from May 3 had affected over 100,000 daily wagers. They warn that if corrective measures were not taken up, they may choose to walk back to their home states, hundreds of kilometers away, like last year. Daily wagers worst-hitIn Gurugram, the worst affected were daily wagers at small construction sites, while in Manesar and Udyog Vihar it is the the employees of small auto companies and garment export units. Naveen Kumar, 38, had to vacate his rented room in a Manesar villageon May 3 after he failed to pay rent. Although getting new work was unlikely in the lockdown, he decided that heading back home in Bihar would not solve his problem as his family had no money there either. Kumar said that he used to unload consignments but for the last one month there has been no work. “We are left with no money to even return home. We get free food from the police and sleep on the pavement waiting for the lockdown to get over,” he said. Arvind Kumar, 33, said that it’d been eight years since came to Manesar as a daily wager. “All these years were smooth and I used to save ₹5,000 a month. But since last year (when the first lockdown was announced in March and lasted 68 days) it is becoming tough to make ends meet. There are no jobs and factories have reduced manpower. Many companies have shut their operations permanently. I sleep under a tree and roam around in search of a free meal,” he said. The suspension of operations of big companies such as Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki has also forced smaller vendors to stop production. Hero MotoCorp on Friday said that it was moving towards a gradual resumption of operations by starting single shift production at three of its plants – Gurugram and Dharuhera in Haryana and at Haridwar from Monday. “Strict safety and hygiene protocols are in place at all plant locations and offices in preparation for the gradual resumption of operations,” the company spokesperson said. Maruti Suzuki did not respond to request for comment. Anil Kumar, general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress, Gurugram, said, “The major problem is of pay -- daily wagers don’t get it if they don’t work and even regular and contractual employees of mid-size units don’t get it for lockdown days when work came to a complete stop. This happened last year as well.”Rajender Saroha, general secretary of the Bhawan Nirman Kaamgar Union, said, “Around 50,000 daily wage earners reside in Sheetla Colony, Surat Nagar, Tekchand Nagar, Lakshman Vihar, Manesar and other areas. They have no money to pay rent, buy ration and also no resources to return home.”Industries help outManmohan Gaind, general secretary of the Manesar Industries Welfare Association acknowledged the workers’ issues. “We have decided to provide dry ration to around 500 families daily for a month. We will increase the supply as we don’t want our workers to suffer hunger, which will force them to rush back to their villages,” he said. Factory owners based in Udyog Vihar said that most of the small units owners have accommodated workers on their premises. “The real extent of this problem will be revealed on pay-day in June. Many business are not able to execute orders due to shortage of labour and other issues,” said Ashok Kohli, president, chamber of industries of Udyog Vihar. Shalini Sood, director of a packaging factory in IMT Manesar, said that their staff strength had gone down from 180 to 60 since last year. “Employees left early as they feared a lockdown. Many fear getting infected and prefer working from home,” she said.Police pitch inAs reported on Friday, police in Manesar have been providing free meals to the jobless and homeless at four designated spots. Yashwant Yadav, station house officer (SHO) of IMT Manesar police station, who estimated that there would be at least 600 workers at these four locations, said that they have started receiving groceries and dry ration from 15 private companies and eight residential societies. “We will also start distributing medical kits to the workers, ” he said. KK Rao, commissioner of police said that anyone in need of shelter and food can call the police control room number-100 - for help. All police stations were directed to feed those in need. “Free medical facility will be provided those in need and our vehicles will shift patients, and in case someone cannot make it to the free meal sites, it will be delivered to them,” he said. Government relief awaitedThe Supreme Court on Thursday had directed the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to provide meals, dry ration and transportation to migrant workers in the National Capital Region.But the Haryana government is yet to announce a major relief package for migrant workers. Trade Unions had demanded the government pay ₹7,500 per worker and implement the directions of the Supreme Court. Amit Arya, media advisor to Haryana chief minister, said that all efforts would be made to provide help to workers. “Last year also the government, industry and civil society had joined hands to help the workers. Likewise, we will provide food, meals and transport to workers this year as well,” he said. Arya, however, added that the problem was less acute this year as industries and factories were allowed to work even during the lockdown. A Gurugram district spokesperson said that directions have been issued to officials in the field to provide help to workers facing any problem. “If any workers is facing problem, they can call the helpline at 1950 for assistance,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/caught-in-lockdown-thousands-of-workers-in-gurugram-have-nowhere-to-go-101621078504052.html
15-05-2021||Gurugram||Senior citizens in Gurugram with Covid-19 to get oxygen cylinder for free at their doorstep||From Saturday, Haryana will provide free doorstep delivery of oxygen cylinders to senior citizens and people from economically weaker sections.Adviser to the chief minister Anil Rao said on Friday that these people need only to contact their nearest police station to avail the service.Rao said senior citizens living alone found it difficult to get a cylinder.“Many of them didn’t have their children nearby due to the lockdown in various part of the country, including Haryana. It was difficult for them to seek assistance from the administration and had no support to get oxygen refilled from stations. Many people died this way,” he said. “Similarly, people from economically weaker sections who were not technology savvy could not request for support.”Those who would like to avail the service need to provide either doctor’s prescription for oxygen or show their oxygen saturation (SPO2) level on their oximeter. An SPO2 of 95% and above is considered safe.“All police officials have been informed to check their records and proactively contact senior citizens in their jurisdiction and the 20 police control room vans converted into ambulances will be ready to assist them. Also, all the resident welfare associations have been asked to ensure they allow domestic helps and medical assistance for them even during the lockdown,” said Rao.Since the second wave of Covid-19 gripped the country in April, Haryana soon turned into one of the worst affected states. Like neighbouring Delhi, Gurugram too suffered shortage of oxygen and hospital beds.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that there was no oxygen shortage. “We are getting nearly 50 metric tonnes of oxygen and the hospitals have increased Covid beds following which there is no shortage of beds either. The demand is increasing but we are balancing it,” he said. Last Sunday, the Gurugram district administration had started doorstep delivery of oxygen to those who needed.

15-05-2021||Mumbai||FYJC students miss campus life due to college closures||Last year, when Ryan Viegas passed his Class 10 board exam with 92%, he was elated. Viegas, who wanted to pursue Arts, got a seat at one of the city’s most prestigious colleges — St Xavier’s College. In his school days, he had heard a lot about the excitement of being in one of the top colleges of the city and wanted to experience all of it himself. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, colleges in the city and the state remained close and lakhs of students like Viegas had to make do with virtual experiences of college life.“I was really excited about getting to go to the college of my choice. I had heard a lot of things about the college and the activities there. Academically, I am very happy with the online teaching but the physical experience is something I miss,” said Viegas. When asked about the difference between the offline and online format, he said, “Since I do not know what it is to physically attend college, I cannot even make that comparison.”While the pandemic and the resultant shift to online learning had an impact on students across grades, for students who entered first-year junior college (FYJC) last year, the impact was more pronounced. For majority students in Maharashtra, FYJC is the first college experience that students get as they move from schools to junior colleges for Class 11 and 12. In Mumbai itself, nearly 224,000 students were admitted at various junior colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region last year. With colleges remaining closed for physical classes, these students have been deprived of the real college experience — enjoying a new campus, meeting new teachers, making new friendships and, travelling to far-off colleges by themselves at times. Even as junior colleges in the state began their online classes soon after the academic year began for students, the real experience of transitioning from school to college environment was lost. Students said colleges are doing their best to provide them with excellent online learning but added that they do miss out on the college experience as a whole, something that they had always looked forward to. Nilakshi Mishra, a student from an aided school in Chembur, worked hard to get to the college of her choice. A student of Ruia College, Mishra was not able to visit her campus even once. “I had heard so many stories from my friends about college life, canteen and hangout places near the college. It all seems like a rosy picture to me now. I have barely been able to make any friends and only know a couple of students who I have worked with for my group discussions and assignments. It is really upsetting,” said Mishra.Satram Verhani, former vice-principal of CHM College in Ulhasnagar, said this year has been particularly difficult for FYJC students. “In college, there are so many extra-curricular activities. Students get an opportunity to participate in events, various clubs etc. which they could not do to that extent this year. While we did conduct some events online, it is definitely not the same,” he added.Aryaman Kumar, a science student enrolled at PACE Junior College in Dadar, said students cannot develop a good rapport with their teachers in the online mode. “The teachers teach us well and handle all our queries, but beyond that there is no discussion at an individual level because both teachers and students are new to each other. We have no reference point for a general conversation, which usually helps a lot in getting to know things during college days,” he added.Teachers said it is difficult to imagine college life without a campus. “When we were in college, we learnt more in canteen and gymkhana than in classrooms. When students come to colleges from schools, a different world opens up for them altogether. Nothing can compensate for these prime years and they will never come back,” said a junior college teacher from a suburban college.Schools and colleges in the state closed for physical classes in March 2020. While admissions to junior college began in August 2020, colleges in the state started only in December-January owing to the Supreme Court stay on admissions under the Maratha quota. Students are now hoping that physical colleges resume soon. “I just hope we get to attend college at least for a few months. I want to take up a professional course later and this is the only college experience where I will get to study and relax a bit at the same time,” said Sana Shah, a student from Vile Parle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fyjc-students-miss-campus-life-due-to-college-closures-101621077603344.html

The state is currently under complete lockdown till May 24. "Lockdowns have been successful and have yielded results, cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Karnataka's Bengaluru are examples. There has been a decline (in Bengaluru) since the last couple of days," Gowda said. Speaking to reporters here, the union minister who represents Bengaluru North parliamentary seat said, there is a need to break the chain.

We have to save lives, leading life may become difficult, governments will have to take steps to improve it," he added. Gowda's statement came a day after Revenue Minister R Ashoka batted for the extension of the statewide lockdown, aimed at controlling the spread of the pandemic. Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the Karnataka government that had initially announced 14 days "close down" from April 27, subsequently imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24, amid continued spike in cases. Noting that the state and central governments were ready to take all the criticism regarding Covid management, Gowda said, those in the government will not get disturbed by it. "We have a responsibility and the commitment and we will have to fulfill it," he added. Conceding that the government's action plan on vaccination got disturbed as people of all the age groups started coming in large number to take it, with the intensity of the second wave increasing, the Union Minister said necessary steps and policies will be implemented soon so that everyone gets the vaccine.Karnataka on Friday reported 41,779 new cases of Covid-19, and 373 fatalities, taking the total number of infections to 21,30,267 and the death toll to 21,085.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/covid19-lockdown-yielding-results-should-be-extended-if-needed-union-minister-sadananda-gowda-101621075899889.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana government fudging Covid-19 figures, alleges Congress||Haryana Congress unit chief Kumari Selja on Saturday attacked the BJP-led government in the state, alleging that it is hiding figures of Covid-19 infected and fatalities.She also said black marketing of medicines, which are required for treatment of coronavirus patients, and oxygen cylinders have "broken all records"."The spread of the coronavirus is increasing rapidly in the state. Instead of preventing it, the government has been making false statements and claims. The figures of those infected and deaths are being hidden," the Congress leader said. There is a huge shortage of doctors and health workers in hospitals, and the situation in government health facilities in the state is that relatives have to look after their ailing themselves, Selja claimed. "People are not getting treatment. For the last several days, the situation in rural areas has become worse," she told an online press conference.Selja said that medicines required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and oxygen are being black-marketed in the state. "This time, black marketing has broken all records. Patients in the state are neither getting oxygen on time nor beds. There is a huge lack of ventilators and the government is sitting blindfolded," she added.Selja said that the Covid-19 cases in Haryana are continuously increasing, but the vaccination campaign is going on at a "very slow" pace.The positivity rate is 45% in three districts and more than 40% in one district of the state, the Congress leader claimed.She said at the same time, the positivity rate in 11 districts is more than 30%. Besides this, it is more than 25% in four districts and more than 10% in three districts, Selja added.On average, around 60,000 tests are being done daily in the state which is only around 2,000 on a population of 10 lakh, she said.The party's state unit chief also said that at this time, Haryana is getting only 258 metric tonnes of oxygen. The central government should at least double the oxygen quota of the state, she added. The government should increase the number of RT-PCR tests and speed up the pace of testing, Selja suggested. Permanent place of testing should be made in villages, she said.Selja said that Covid-19 hospitals with bed facilities of 500 to 1,000 should be built in each district with the help of the army.Covid-19 patients should get free medicines and treatment, and besides this, everyone should get a vaccine at no cost, Selja said adding that the Haryana government should bear this expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-government-fudging-covid-19-figures-alleges-congress-101621076657458.html

During travel, it is seen that they don’t wear masks which is increases the chance of virus spread. Hence penal action is being taken on a daily basis against the violators.”According to the crime branch officials who are monitoring and assessing the cases, an average of 2,000-3,000 persons are being challaned on a daily basis for not wearing masks and violating social distancing violations.The police observed while taking action against those not wearing masks under Section 188, the citizens had been quarrelling with the policemen for paying ₹500 as a fine.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) national directive for Covid-19 management states: “Wearing of face cover is compulsory in public places; in workplaces; and during transport”.The directive empowers the police to prosecute people without masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/035-million-people-fined-in-pune-for-violating-covid-norms-101621077245738.html
15-05-2021||Pune||Shelters in Pune see rise in enquires, admissions of children, elderly||As the pandemic hit the city, people were not only worried for their health, but also for their well being. Loss of jobs and drastic fall in income forced many to abandon their old parents and in some cases seek shelter for their kids. Thus leading to a rise in the number of enquiries and admissions at shelter homes in the city.Maher Ashram, which has two centres, at Bhima Koregaon and Wagholi located in the periphery of Pune city is now seeing a large number of requests for admission for old people as well as kids.Sister Lucy Kurien, founder and director of the shelter home, said, “Since March 2020 we started getting calls seeking admission for old people, men and women and also kids. We even had an enquiry for a kid who lost both his parents to Covid-19 and is still undergoing treatment in the hospital. However, for such orphans the state is responsible and every admission has to be through and child welfare committee and so we cannot directly admit the child,” she said.“We do keep getting request for such admissions even on a temporary basis as both the parents are in the hospital or have died due to Covid-19 and the child needs a caretaker and a place for quarantine,” she said.Kurien also said, “We have opened our shelter home for Covid-19 affected kids and senior citizens who need admission on a temporary basis. In some cases, the younger members are infected and they cannot risk keeping old parents at home.”“From March 2020 to March 2021, we have admitted about 251 women for various reasons including husband’s job loss or suicide. We admitted about 119 children who came for temporary shelter because both the parents are sick or even because of increased tension in the house leading to domestic violence we have even had young girls who are brought in by the police because their parents were forcing them to get married. We have had 53 men who came to seek admission after they were forced to stay on the street. We have also had nine deliveries. We are also getting requests seeking ration kits from single parents who do not have any source of income,” she said.Priti Vaidya, director of Kinara Old Age Home, also saw an increased number of requests and a rise in homeless people on the streets.She said, “We are seeing a rise in the number of requests for admissions and we have also got more homeless people on the streets now. Earlier there used to be just 1-2 admissions in months, now we have admitted about 8-10 people in the last three months. These are senior citizens who are aged about 60 years of age who had come here to seek work. These are mostly from the Hindi-speaking belt of the country. They had come here to seek work but during the lockdown, they could not leave as they did not have any money.”“Before taking them in we also test them for Covid-19 so that other members are safe. Also, we often get enquiries from children who want to admit their senior citizen parents, but we scrutinize every case before we admit them,” she said.Another old age home, Manuski NGO’s owner Sayli Gayatre said, “We do keep getting a lot of enquiries, however, we have stopped taking in new admissions. In fact, we do not even allow visitors and relatives to come in because this would expose all our members to the infection. So when we get any calls we simply refuse admission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shelters-in-pune-see-rise-in-enquires-admissions-of-children-elderly-101621077123833.html

While earlier in the month of March we were conducting 2,000 to 3,000 tests daily this went up drastically to 8,000-9,000 tests on a daily basis. This has now again come down to 2,000 to 3,000 tests daily.”Pune city’s positivity rate for May 13 (18.78%), May 12 (13.81%) and May 11 (20.04%) has been lower than that of Pune rural which was about 23.70%, 23.86% and 30.83% which is much higher than the district’s overall positivity rate.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) Zilla Parishad, said, “The rate of new Covid-19 cases from Pune rural is increasing just like those from other rural areas of the country. However, since last week the number of Covid-19 tests in rural Pune has also increased which will help in early detection and controlling the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-positivity-rate-of-covid-over-23-private-labs-see-sharp-drop-in-tests-101621076943862.html

Beds are planned in Sassoon, Naidu and YCM, but private hospitals such as Ruby Hall Clinic, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Research Center, Bharati Hospital among others also should plan accordingly.

15-05-2021||Pune||Maharashtra govt should get 50% of Covaxin produced in Pune, says Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has emphasised that given the dire situation the state government should get 50 per cent of Covaxin produced at the Pune plant in Manjari Khurd.Pawar was in the city to attend the weekly Covid review meeting on Friday.The Bombay High Court has cleared Bharat Biotech’s way to make idle vaccine manufacturing unit in Pune district operational, the company will soon conduct a dry run of the machinery. Covaxin a vaccine against Covid -19 is likely to be produced at the plant.“Bharat Biotech’s machinery has arrived in Pune. Their effort is to manufacture Covaxin in the city and it will take at least three months. Once this production starts it will add to the supply. I have instructed divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao to talk to officials from Bharat Biotech to get 50 per cent vaccine from states’ quota to Maharashtra government. So that our citizens will benefit,” said Pawar.A division bench of Justices KK Tated and NR Borkar on May 6 heard an application filed by Karnataka’s Biovet Private Limited, seeking direction to the Maharashtra government to hand over possession of the manufacturing unit at Manjari Khurd village in Pune.The unit was first being used by Intervet India Pvt Ltd, a multinational and subsidiary of Merck & Co after the land was granted to it in 1973 to manufacture vaccines for foot and mouth disease. Later, Intervet decided to exit business operations in India and entered into an agreement with Biovet for the transfer of the land and manufacturing unit.Pawar said that though the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech have been trying to enhance the production capacity of vaccines, there are limitations for the production and the central government has not given permission to other vaccines after the Sputnik V vaccine.He added that in the remaining 50 per cent quota of produced vaccines, there are a lot of contenders for the vaccine procurement.“Vaccination has begun in private companies, private hospitals and industries for their employees. Out of the total production of the vaccine, it will be distributed as 50 per cent to the Centre and the rest of the 50 per cent includes all the states plus private establishments. Vaccination in the private sector has started in Mumbai but the rate for a dose is different. Some may be able to afford it. But common people have the right to get vaccines,” Pawar said.Health minister Rajesh Tope, on Wednesday, announced that the inoculation drive of the 18-44 years age group was being temporarily halted by the state government. On being asked when this drive will be resumed, Pawar responded that the drive will begin as soon as more vaccines would be available.“We started vaccination for 18-44 years, age group, from May 1, but vaccination supply is low. Many people from the 45 and above age group are due for a second shot. So we decided to halt inoculation of this age group and add state procured vaccines in the Centre’s vaccine quota. It will be used for the second dose,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-govt-should-get-50-of-covaxin-produced-in-pune-says-ajit-pawar-101621076464935.html

They also snatched my gold chain and looted ₹7,000 cash,” Pareek said.Police have registered a case against the gang under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), and 379 (theft).A police officer said they have stepped up night patrolling. “...men dressed in women’s attire have robbed someone. We are trying to retrieve the footage from CCTVs of the nearby areas,” said the officer.Pareek said the gang members were ruthless and repeatedly hit him,” They hit me before taking away my cash and gold chain. I could not seek help from anywhere because it was a desolate stretch of the highway,” he said.Pareek added he tried to resist. “Next day when I was passing through the same area, I spotted the same suspects... I quickly alerted the police about it. It is very unsafe now to pass from the same highway as the gang has many members and can quickly overpower anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/jaipur-man-stopped-to-help-a-woman-on-highway-was-robbed-by-gang-101621068963405.html

We have often seen that oxygen levels of people have dropped after being infected with Covid-19. If they are provided oxygen immediately, their condition may not worsen. If the lifesaving gas is not provided on time, they have to be admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and sometimes they succumb to Covid-19.”Kejriwal added the Delhi government officials will deliver the oxygen concentrator within two hours to those patients which are under home isolation. A technical person will accompany the officials and will educate the family members on how to use the machine, the chief minister said.Also Read| Delhi's daily Covid cases down to 6,500; CM announces oxygen concentrator banksThe government will also provide the concentrator to the hospitalised patients who recovered from Covid-19 and have come back home but need oxygen for a few days, as per the advice of the doctors, Kejriwal said during the briefing.“Our doctors will be in constant touch with patients who have been given an oxygen concentrator. These patients will be hospitalised if the need arises. And when they recover, the concentrator will be taken back, sanitised and provided to some other patient.” the CM added.The infected patients which are not a part of the government’s isolation program can dial 1031 and be a part of it and request for a concentrator, Kejriwal said but the doctors will first make sure whether the patient needs it or not.Also Read| Free education, financial aid for Covid orphans: KejriwalIn April, Delhi witnessed the worst health crisis during the pandemic as hospitals ran short of oxygen supplies on a daily basis and were unable to procure them on time.

The clarification on Friday came after reports of a ban on the transportation of corpses to Varanasi for last rites. Sharma maintained there was never such a ban. Bringing bodies for cremation to the city is permitted during full, partial, and weekend lockdown, he added.He said the Varanasi (rural) superintendent of police has been instructed to convey to police station in-charges that bringing bodies for performing the last rites at the ghats is permitted. Sharma added no one should be stopped.Sharma has issued instructions that if people from outside come to Varanasi with bodies, they should be helped to reach the ghats for the cremations. Municipal authorities late last month made alternative arrangements for cremations of bodies by setting up a temporary crematorium near Vishwasundari Bridge amid a surge in Covid-19 and fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-ban-on-bringing-bodies-to-varanasi-for-cremation-district-magistrate-101621061523194.html

15-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up panel to monitor use of tocilizumab||The Delhi government has set up a three-member technical expert committee to ensure that the immune-modulator medicine tocilizumab, used to control the hyperactive immune response in the later stages of severe Covid-19, is not indiscriminately used.The committee consists of three doctors from the departments of pulmonology, anaesthesiology, and medicine from Maulana Azad Medical College (attached to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital).“To prevent indiscriminate use of this injection (tocilizumab) and to establish a transparent, efficient, and time-bound system of distribution on clinically approved evidence-based grounds, the competent authority has approved the constitution of a three-member technical expert committee,” reads the order by special secretary (health) Raj Kumar.To get the medicine, hospitals — government and private — have to apply to the technical expert committee, which will meet twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to take decision on the requests. If a request is refused, the reason will be conveyed to the hospital by email.On recommendation of the committee, tocilizumab will be issued by the DGHS to the hospital representative, on payment for the same for the private ones. The DGHS has been directed to ensure that the drug is issued on the same day. It will be the responsibility of the hospital to ensure that there is no pilferage, as per the order.The order also states that the drug will be distributed in this manner till stock remains; no waiting list shall be maintained. Fresh applications will be called in when the next stock arrives.State health minister Satyendar Jain added, “For remdesivir and tocilizumab, all the management and control is in the hands of the central government which is supplied to the hospitals through a website managed by the centre... So, we have passed the order and formed the expert committee to streamline the supply effectively and mobilise it.” The government has an online portal from where hospitals can requisition it after submitting the patient’s details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-up-panel-to-monitor-use-of-tocilizumab-101621034470698.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Lawyers’ group sets up Covid field hospital with 50 O2 beds||After observing a lack of resources and scarcity of beds amid the fourth wave of the pandemic, a group of lawyers in the national capital have joined hands to set up a Covid care facility or field hospital with 50 oxygen beds in order to help boost Delhi’s heath infrastructure.The facility, which has oxygen beds, oxygen concentrators and other medical support, has already been set up in a private school in southeast Delhi’s Jamia Nagar. While the facility is yet to receive an approval from the Delhi government, the lawyers — Vaibhav Kakkar, Karan Chandiok, Pooja Mahajan, and Akshay Jain — said it will become operational in “4-5 days”.Chandiok said that he had struggled for 16 hours to get an ICU bed for his uncle who tested positive for Covid-19 last month, and attributed this delay to the relative’s death. “Even as we were helping people in verifying leads for oxygen cylinders, concentrators, beds and medicines, we realised that there was a dearth of medical resources for Covid-19 patients. We decided to pool funds to augment oxygen supply and import oxygen contractors,” he said.The group started working with Aster DM Healthcare, an organisation that runs several hospitals in India and abroad, and Al-Shifa hospital in Delhi.“The field hospital will be managed by Al-Shifa, which will provide doctors and nursing staff. We are looking at a staggered approach in terms of opening. We have placed orders for BiPaP ventilator machines as well. We are waiting for all the required stuff to arrive before approaching the Delhi government for final approval. We might be able to start it in four-five days,” Chandiok said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lawyers-group-sets-up-covid-field-hospital-with-50-o2-beds-101621034240491.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Hobby classes in schools to utilise summer break||With schools in the national capital closed for an early summer break, children are now pursuing their hobbies, engaging in extra-curricular activities, taking up entrepreneurial activities, and even volunteering for Covid relief using digital platforms.Taking lessons from her entrepreneurship classes, Nisha Yadav (15), a Class 11 student of a government school in Shakarpur, is now working on her own website by following YouTube tutorials. “I am trying to design an e-commerce platform for people living in villages so that they can get groceries and basic necessities at their doorstep,” said Yadav.On April 19, the Delhi government ordered public and private schools in the Capital to begin their summer vacation three weeks earlier than planned, amid the rising Covid cases. The vacation started on April 20 and will continue till June 6, during which period there will be no online classes, except activity lessons.Recognising the need to maintain connection with children, several top private schools in the city, such as The Indian School, Springdales in Pusa Road, Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, and Tagore International School in Vasant Vihar, are organising experiential activities and hobby classes online.For instance, Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh has tied up with various private firms and alumni associations to offer online summer internships to its students of classes 9 to 12 on various topics. Class 12 student Bhavidhi Malhotra, who had enrolled for an internship last year, opted for two this time. “One is on astrophysics and the other is on psychology. Since the workshops are online, I can easily attend them and keep myself engaged,” she said.Several cultural centres are also offering language courses. For instance, Korean Cultural Centre, India, (KCCI) has offered a Korean Language program as a hobby class in eight schools. “Due to the increasing popularity of K-pop and K-drama, Korean language has been gaining global popularity in recent years, specially in India,” Hwang IL Yong, Director, KCCI, said.For primary classes, schools are using innovative approaches to keep them engaged. Vandana Tiwari, a teacher at The Indian School, said, “Children in classes 1 to 5 are being engaged in lessons involving experiments that can be done at home.”Several senior students are also engaging in Covid relief work by collating resources, arranging for food and ration for the marginalised. “We started a helpline number last year during the lockdown. So we are continuing with it this year and are arranging for meals, ration, or medicines based on the needs of the people who call,” said Asees Kandhari, a Class 12 student.Schools have also offered counselling services for children unable to cope with the stress of the pandemic. For instance, Mount Abu Public School has started a helpline for its students and teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hobby-classes-in-schools-to-utilise-summer-break-101621028097419.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Free education, financial aid for Covid orphans: Kejriwal||The Delhi government will provide free education to children who have lost their parents to Covid-19 and financial assistance to all those, especially senior citizens, who have lost the only earning member of their family to the disease, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said that after some time, the Capital’s daily tally of Covid-19 cases has fallen below the 10,000 mark, with around 8,500 cases being recorded in the past 24 hours and the positivity rate further declining to 12%. At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20. On April 22, the positivity rate touched 36%.The CM added that in the past 10 days, nearly 3,000 Covid-19 beds have become vacant, although he admitted that the occupancy of ICU beds remains almost 100%.To provide adequate beds and timely treatment to serious Covid-19 patients, he said, about 1,200 ICU beds are nearly ready -- 1,000 at the two Ramlila grounds and the rest at the Radha Saomi Satsang, Beas campus in Chattarpur.“In the past few days, despite all our efforts, we could not save many Delhi people. In many families, there have been more than one death. I know several children who have lost both their parents... Delhi government will bear all the expenses of their education and living. There are also several senior citizens who have lost their children who used to earn. Do not worry, your son is still alive. Delhi government will provide financial assistance to all those families who have lost their sole earning member to Covid-19,” Kejriwal said.Since April 14 (till May 14) Delhi has recorded 9,471 deaths on account of Covid-19, as the surging second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the Union Territory’s health care system.The Kejriwal government announced a week-end lockdown from April 17 and then extended it on April 19. Delhi remains under the lockdown currently.On Friday, the Delhi cabinet approved the disbursal of financial assistance of ₹5,000 to all auto rickshaw and taxi drivers registered with the state transport department. On May 4, Kejriwal announced the revival of this scheme, which benefited 156,000 drivers having a public service badge or a permit for such vehicles during the lockdown last year. The amount will be directly disbursed to their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts.While the lockdown is supposed to end at 5 am on Monday, the chief minister hinted at retaining the restrictions. “Even today, 8,500 fresh Covid cases have come. We have to bring this down to 0 and hence, we cannot lower our guard at this moment at any cost. If we become lax, then cases might spike again. So, we have to strictly follow the ongoing lockdown and adhere to all the Covid-19 protocols,” he said.The Delhi government said it is ramping up the number of oxygen beds to prepare for any potential surge in cases.A total of 8,506 new cases were reported on Friday, the lowest daily tally since April 10, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin. The positivity rate – the proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – continued its sharp decline and touched 12.4% on Friday, the lowest since April 12.On Friday, Kejriwal also visited the makeshift Covid-19 treatment facility at Ramlila ground which is attached to the Lok Nayak hospital.The 500 ICU-bed facility, which was readied in 15 days, will be operational from Saturday, he said.“From tomorrow, 250 ICU beds, linked to Lok Nayak hospital, will start, and another 250 beds will be operational in 1-2 days. I also visited GTB hospital in east Delhi the day before yesterday (Wednesday), where another 500 ICU beds have been set up. This makes it a total of 1,000 ICU beds added to the bed count in Delhi. Another 200 ICU beds are being arranged at the Radha Soami Covid facility in Chhatarpur, which means that a total of 1,200 ICU beds will be added in Delhi in the next 1-2 days,” he said.At the peak of the fourth wave, in late April, there were no beds to be had in Delhi, and hospitals were running short of oxygen. The situation with respect to both has improved significantly since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-education-financial-aid-for-covid-orphans-kejriwal-101621026891453.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi cases below 10k first time since April 10||Delhi recorded 8,506 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, the lowest since April 10, with a nearly four-week long lockdown in the Capital finally bringing its overburdened health infrastructure some breathing room , although ICUs remain mostly full.The city’s test positivity rate too fell to 12.4%, the lowest since April 11, suggesting that the outbreak is receding after a punishing surge that began in mid-April and abated only in recent days.There were 289 more deaths due to Covid-19 on Friday, the government’s health bulletin showed.“Delhi has recorded fewer than 10,000 cases in the last 24 hours. This has been possible only due to a strict lockdown and the discipline of the people in Delhi. For now, we must remember not to let our guard down,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday. The current lockdown ends on May 17, but it will likely be extended.Kejriwal added that in the past 10 days, 3,000 beds have been freed, “but, ICU beds are still full”.Average daily cases have now fallen by roughly 40% compared to two weeks before, with the test positivity rate reducing by roughly 12.74 percentage points. At its worst, the outbreak led to 28,395 new cases on April 20 and the positivity rate touched a record 36% on April 22.Kejriwal announced a lockdown on April 19 (after announcing a weekend lockdown on April 17) , and the protocol has now been renewed several times and will stay at least till May 17 in order to further flatten the curve.As on Friday, there were 71,794 active cases in the Capital, the lowest since April 19. Roughly a fortnight ago, active cases in the city were hovering close to the 100,000 mark – the number peaked at 99,752 on April 28 -- the highest ever recorded.The crisis stretched the city’s hospitals to breaking point, and triggered a severe shortage for medical oxygen that came into focus on April 22 and would not be resolved until at least May 5, when the Capital finally received over 700MT of stocks in a day after a long-drawn battle between the state and the Centre, which also played out in the high court and the Supreme Court.“There has been a consistent decline in the number of cases and positivity rate for a few days now; Delhi has certainly crossed the peak. Now, even if the government does remove the lockdown, I do not think that the numbers will go up drastically. This is because the infection is following its natural course, with a large chunk of the population already having been exposed to it,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The government, he added, must now focus on strengthening its own systems rather than creating makeshift facilities.Concerns over reopening are also in focus due to new clues surrounding the B.1.617 variant, which has led experts in western countries such as the UK to urge the government there to defer plans to lift the lockdown.Experts have identified surge vaccinations as one of the few ways the threat from the variant can be tackled without having to stay locked down, but Delhi – as well as large parts of India – have faced a shortage of doses, slowing down the pace of vaccinations. The Capital has so far delivered 4.4 million doses -- 1 million people have received have received both doses --- to its roughly 15 million people over the age of 18.Kishore added that the government must now focus its vaccine strategy on the vulnerable. “The people who have had an infection now are more or less protected from a second one for now. So, we should target those who haven’t had an infection and immunise them first,” he said.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a part of Lancet’s Covid-19 task force said: “Right now, we need to focus on breaking the chain of transmission by following Covid appropriate behaviour, testing, and isolating positive cases rigorously”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cases-below-10k-first-time-since-april-10-101621026914142.html

Four gunmen have been attached with Bhasin. The accused duped two leaders in Sangrur, a former MLA in Batala, and a former mayor in Jalandhar. They also tried to defraud a Ludhiana MLA, it is learnt. Ludhiana joint commissioner of police (rural) Sachin Gupta said the accused have no links with Kishor. He added that Rakesh used to pose as an MLA from Rajasthan, Bihar or Haryana, while Rajat acted as his personal assistant. Since Rakesh had security, people would easily get fooled. Rakesh and Rajat used to approach political leaders, MLAs, former MLAs and other ticket aspirants of different political parties. Then would make them talk to Gaurav Sharma who would impersonate as Kishor. They also duped people in Rajasthan, Bihar and Haryana too, the official claimed. “Gaurav Sharma also has connections with international smugglers who push drugs into India,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (city 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said that Gaurav has been involved in frauds, cybercrime and drug peddling in the past four years and is already five criminal cases. The other accused joined him a year ago, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/conmen-posing-as-kishor-aides-duped-cong-mlas-others-of-rs-5-crore-by-promising-tickets-101621024680948.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Pandemic in Punjab turns grimmer in May||The number of coronavirus causalities in the first 13 days of this month in Punjab has already crossed the cumulative figure of April, an analysis of the state health department’s data reveals. In April, 2,154 people succumbed to the infection, but the state’s death toll was 2,275 from May 1 to 13. The maximum 217 deaths were witnessed on Wednesday (May 12) due to the contagious disease. Ludhiana is the worst-hit district in Punjab with 288 deaths this month so far, followed by Bathinda, Amritsar and Patiala at 233, 206 and 191 fatalities, respectively. Also, Sangrur, Muktsar and Fazilka districts saw 183, 127 and 117 fatalities, respectively due to the infection. 30% deaths this month in four Malwa districts The four districts in the Malwa region — Sangrur, Bathinda, Muktsar and Fazilka —registered 670 deaths this month, nearly 30% of the state’s total deaths. In the past one week, the number of fresh cases in these districts witnessed an unusual spike while registering a positivity rate as high as 20%. All these districts, considered as a hub of the ongoing farm agitation, are predominantly rural. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the health department was working on the data to ascertain if the rural areas have witnessed surge in the recent days. “As far as overall deaths are concerned, the case fatality rate (CFR) in urban areas of Punjab has increased in the past few days. While the rural-urban death ratio was 55:45 earlier, it was 48:52 till few days ago,” he said.The government data shows the state’s overall CFR at 2.4%. “There is surge in deaths but the number of fresh cases has also gone up. Therefore, the CFR is almost the same as it was two weeks ago,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pandemic-in-punjab-turns-grimmer-in-may-101621024260944.html

However, its deadline was extended till April 30. Officials of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), which is overseeing the project, said due to the coronavirus-induced restrictions, the project has missed its deadline.“Ninety percent of the construction work has been completed. Only the interior works are pending. Indian Railway Construction Limited (IRCON), which is responsible for the construction works, had sought a three-month extension citing shortage of labourers. Now, the project will be completed by August 31,” said LPAI’s ICP manager Sukhdev Singh.He said once constructed, the project will be handed over to the BSF. Most of the migrant labourers have gone back to their native towns fearing lockdown, he added.For now, the troops manning the ICP and the JCP have been accommodated at the BSF’s Khasa headquarter, which is around 20km from the border. A BSF official said, “It takes around 25-30 minutes to reach the border from Khasa. We will be able to guard the border 24x7 once the residential buildings are constructed.”The project — comprising one four-storey and one two-storey building — has already missed three deadlines. The construction of the barracks was started in December 2018.The flats in the four-storey building will be for jawans, while BSF officials will reside in flats in the double-storey building, said a LPAI official. A dormitory is also being built for women personnel of the BSF.The projectTotal cost: ₹33 croreNew deadline: August 2021Total facilities: 370 flats: a 4-storey and 2-storey buildingDorm for women personnel: 1||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2nd-wave-further-delays-construction-of-bsf-barracks-at-attari-border-101621022700851.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Nearly 3,000 prisoners set to be released from Punjab jails amid Covid’s 2nd wave||The Punjab government is all set to release nearly 3,000 prisoners lodged in various jails as the second Covid wave continues to ravage the state.The decision was taken during the meeting of the high-powered committee convened by Punjab Legal Services Authority chairperson Justice Ajay Tiwari, along with members principal secretary (jails) DK Tiwari and ADGP (prisons) PK Sinha.So far, 24,000 people have been imprisoned in the state’s 24 jails which have the capacity to house only 23,500 inmates. The process to decongest prisons across the state — some of them are immensely overcrowded — will start from Monday.The Supreme Court had directed the states to examine releasing inmates, convicted or facing trial in non-serious charges, from jails either on regular bail or on parole to prevent overcrowding and spread of Covid in prisons during the current surge.“During the committee’s meeting that was held on the direction of the apex court, it was decided to release around 3,000 prisoners. The process to release them will begin in a day or two,” said Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.He said most of these prisoners were those who were released last year during the first Covid wave. In March 2020, the state had planned to release around 6,000 prisoners. “These prisoners will be brought back to the jails once the Covid situation improves,” he said.Sources said convicted prisoners will be released on parole and undertrials on interim bail for 90 days. Prisoners sentenced up to seven years with maximum two undertrial cases (both on bail), and further should have availed last parole peacefully, will be considered for release on parole.A senior jails official said, “We will also release the inmates with comorbidities, besides those who are above 65 years. Those convicted or charged under murder, rape, snatching, acid attack, POCSO Act, UAPA, Explosives Act and foreign nationals will not be considered for release. Such prisoners can avail their regular parole.”He said, “So far, we have recorded 3,000 positive cases and six deaths among the inmates. We have also vaccinated 35% of the total inmates and 85% of the staff in the jails.” The superintendents of jails concerned have been empowered to process the cases of parole in order to expedite the release. Amritsar jail superintendent Arshdeep Singh Gill said they have decided to release 150 to 200 prisoners — whose lists are being prepared. The high-security Amritsar Central Jail has been overcrowded with 3,200 inmates. The jail, however, has the capacity to house 2,200 inmates.Randhawa said, “We have asked the police department to conduct Covid tests of all the accused being arrested. Our jails receive only those accused who test negative for the virus. Those who test positive are sent to the quarantine jails until their next tests’ reports come negative. After testing negative, these accused are sent to the isolation cells of the various jails for another 14 days before being shifted to general wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nearly-3-000-prisoners-set-to-be-released-from-punjab-jails-amid-covid-s-2nd-wave-101621021861084.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Six tocilizumab vials go missing from Patiala’s Rajindra hospital||Six tocilizumab vials went missing from the isolation ward of Covid care centre at government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, police said on Friday. An FIR has been registered against unidentified persons after the hospital authorities filed a written complaint with the senior superintendent of police (SSP). A single vial of the medicine costs around ₹34,000 and is provided to hospitals at government price only. These injections are administered to critical Covid patients, mainly on ventilator support. “An internal committee has been set up to investigate the matter,” said Surabhi Malik, in-charge of Covid-19 care facility of the hospital. She added that it was a serious issue and must be probed thoroughly. It may be mentioned here that the isolation wards of the hospital are under tight surveillance of CCTV cameras. Even cops have been deployed outside the wards to restrict entry of outsiders. When asked about the role of hospital staffers in the theft, Malik said it was too early to come to a conclusion as the matter was under investigation. This incident took place early this week, but came to the light only after police registered an FIR under section 380 (theft) of the IPC on Thursday evening. “There is already severe shortage of these injections in the market. The hospitals procured remdevisir and tocilizumab on demand from health department. Moreover, the price of a single tocilizumab injection in black market is pegged between ₹80,000 and ₹1 lakh,” said a senior doctor.Meanwhile, medical college principal Dr Rajan Singla said a three-member committee of senior professors has been constituted to investigate the matter so that responsibility could be fixed.Civil Lines SHO Gurpreet Singh said they were scanning footage from the CCTV cameras installed at the hospital.“Other technical and physical evidences are also being looked into to identify the accused,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-tocilizumab-vials-go-missing-from-patiala-s-rajindra-hospital-101621021803241.html

Acting on a tip from the public, three teams was sent to recce the area to verify whether poppy was being cultivated illegally on May 12, said Mandi superintendent of police Shalini Agnihotri. On confirmation, four teams headed by the Padhar station house officer and sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) were mobilised and at least 15 lakh plants were destroyed. “TActing on a tip from the public, three teams was sent to recce the area to verify whether poppy was being cultivated illegally on May 12,” Agnihotri said. While heavy rain and hailstorms impeded the teams’ movement, the party continued with the operation. The teams had to trek for three hours to reach the first hill top. “When the news of the police reached the people, locals started uprooting the poppy plants at one of the spots,” the SP said. Around 66, 14, and 13 bighas of government and private land was found to be under illegal cultivation of poppy plants over the three hills. “The operation started with an initial recce on May 12 and the final raid began on May 13. The teams left the police station Padhar (Drang) at 8:30am on May 13 and the last team returned at around 3pm on Friday. The raid took around 17 hours amid heavy rain and hailstorms,” the SP said. Four cases have been registered so far under Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act. As per estimates, around five to six kilograms of opium is produced on a bigha of land. Around 330kg of the narcotic could have been produced in the area.” I have congratulated the teams, great efforts were made by the teams to detect and destroy the opium,” director general of police Sanjay Kundu said. Any tipoffs about drug trafficking can be directly shared with SP Mandi on 93172-21001.

Ask them to bring a (COVID-negative) certificate from the doctor,” he said.Exhorting people to “save your mohallas and villages to save yourself, your families and Punjab”, the CM asked them not to delay going to hospitals on time. “We have teams of doctors everywhere, approach them if you feel unwell,” he urged them, stressing that delay in going for treatment was leading to people ending up in critical category. While occupancy of L2 beds is 50%, at the L3 level (critical), around 90% of the beds are currently occupied, and the state government is in the process of adding another 2,000, he said, attributing this to people not going for treatment in time.Amarinder reiterated his plea to the people to go to the doctor at the first sign of symptoms. “Let the doctor decide the course of treatment, don’t get into diagnosis and medication yourself,” he appealed to them. I fail to understand why we are harming the interests of the state and your families in this manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-asks-villagers-to-restrict-entry-of-covid-positive-people-101621021680813.html

The drop in cases detected can be attributed to the fewer tests conducted as only 31,500 tests were conducted on Friday against the average of 44,000 tests being conducted daily for the past 10 days. Owing to Eid, fewer people ventured out to get themselves tested. Of the 60 deaths in J&K, 39 were reported in Jammu division and 21 in Kashmir and of the new cases, 1,516 were detected in Kashmir, 1,511 from Jammu and 56 were travellers. The Union territory has logged 3,027 fatalities and 2, 36,790 cases so far. May has proved to be the worst month for Jammu and Kashmir in terms of Covid cases and deaths as the monthly infections reached 60,707 and fatalities to 745 even as 36,321 patients recovered this month.Dr Yasir Rather, professor, department of psychiatry, GMC, Srinagar, said that the Covid pandemic and its second wave had created fear and anxiety among the people, which had taken a toll on their mental health.“It is equally important to take care of mental health as well as the respiratory system,” he said. “People should not focus on the issues which are beyond their reach. They should spend time with family and children, create innovative ways and hobbies for interaction ,” he said.Officials said with 534 cases, Jammu had the highest number of new infections, followed by 379 in Srinagar district, 308 in Budgam, 221 in Udhampur and 197 in Kathua. Dr Yasir stated that due to the panic, people keep hoarding essential items including oxygen which affects others who are in need of them. “This practice aggravates the situation and creates further pani,” he said. He stressed on the routine of physical exercises and brisk walk. “Exercises and brisk walking release endorphins and keep the mood of a person elevated and helps to overcome and alleviate anxiety”. As many as 1,81,762 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 76.76 % against around 98% in the first fortnight of February. Srinagar and Jammu districts have together contributed for about 99,700 cases and 1,436 deaths. After 3 Jammu doctors succumb Three Jammu doctors succumbed to the coronavirus on Thursday.

Citing the three deaths, Udhampur deputy magistrate Indu Chib urged the public to follow all coronavirus protocols “at least for their sake.”2nd wave highly virulent, fatal: ExpertDr Sandeep Dogra, microbiology consultant, Government Medical College, Jammu said, “The Covid virus variant from the second wave is more transmissive and more fatal than the previous one. If we do not stop its chain of transmission, nothing can stop the virus from mutating further and producing deadlier variants.” Dogra said that while the first wave mostly affected the middle aged, the old and the sick, the second wave is targeting all age groups and is more transmissive on the whole. He says that the second wave has reached far into the rural areas of the country unlike the first one. Cong welcomes expert team’s visit to JammuCongress has welcomed the Centre’s decision to send a team of experts to assess the Covid situation in Jammu hospitals amid high mortality rate and a large number of daily casualties for the last several days. Last week, the Congress had asked the government to send a team of experts from AIIMS and PGI Chandigarh to ascertain the causes behind spiraling Covid deaths in Jammu.

Making the announcement virtually from Chandigarh, the chief minister said a medical college, a degree college, a women’s police station and a smart school would be set up in Malerkotla, Punjab’s only Muslim-dominated town. Malerkotla, which is around 35km from the Sangrur district headquarters, a district status was a pre-poll promise by the Congress.The CM said initially the sub-divisions of Malerkotla and Ahmedgarh, as well as the sub-tehsil of Amargarh, would be included in the new district. The process of bringing villages under the jurisdiction of Malerkotla district would begin later, after the census, he added.Amarinder directed Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir to find a suitable building to immediately start the functioning of the district administration office. The deputy commissioner for the newly carved out district would be appointed soon, he said.“A government medical college in the name of Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan, who raised his voice against the inhuman act of torture and bricking alive the younger Sahibzadas, would soon be set up at a cost of ₹500 crore. The state government had already allotted 25 acres of land on Raikot Road to enable the local boys and girls to pursue medical education. The first instalment of ₹50 crore for the purpose had already been sanctioned,” the CM added.Amarinder also announced the establishment of a government college for girls, a women police station, to be exclusively managed by women, and a new bus stand to be constructed at a cost of ₹10 crore and ₹6 crore under the Urban Environment Improvement Programme (UEIP) for the new district.

15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Rising Covid infection among pregnant women sparks concern||The second Covid wave is impacting pregnant women in the state adversely and this has sent alarm bells ringing in the medical fraternity. In the recent weeks, hundreds of women in their late 20s and 30s across the state have tested positive with over a dozen of them succumbing to the virus. Cases are only rising and doctors fear that such fatalities may further increase. According to doctors, two such deaths have been reported in the last two days alone when pregnant women in their 30s, one from Patiala and another from Ludhiana, died after being infected with the virus. “Such severe complications in pregnant women were totally unheard of during the first wave. Doctors are witnessing a challenge attending to Covid positive pregnant women, whose number have increased substantially over the last few weeks. There is already a high positivity rate in the state and the number of pregnant women testing positive have increased proportionately,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, senior cardiologist at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Ludhiana, and a member of the panel of doctors of the Dr KK Talwar committee to manage Covid-19 in Punjab. “Out of every 100 pregnant women who test positive, 10 to 15 % of them now need advanced tertiary care. This percentage was barely 2% in the previous wave,” said a gynaecologist working in a state-run hospital, while requesting anonymity. Faced with this major challenge, the doctors have devised a strategy to treat the Covid positive pregnant women. “Saving both the mother and child is a highly challenging task faced by doctors in cases with severe complications. The mother’s safety is always on our priority and in severe cases, where saturation is falling very low, wherever we find that a woman is in an advanced state of pregnancy, our effort is to save both by facilitating a premature delivery,” added Dr Mohan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rising-covid-infection-among-pregnant-women-sparks-concern-101621021320683.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Experts divided as Srinagar’s daily cases hold steady for a week||With the daily average cases in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, hovering around 800 for a week, it appears that the infections in the district have plateaued out. However, experts remain divided. The district, which is the worst-hit in the UT with 10,687 active infections, had witnessed a record breaking spurt in daily infections in May, with the daily cases going as high as 1,311 on May 4. However, after May 8, the daily cases have mostly been below 1,000 with an average 775 cases per day. There has been an imperceptible change in the daily infections since May 11, with the district recording 846 cases on May 11, 863 on May 12, and 872 on May 13. Srinagar clocked 115 deaths from May 1 to 13, of the total 685 fatalities in the UT. Kashmir Doctors’ Association president Dr MY Tak said the declining numbers are a sign that Srinagar is hitting a plateau. “The figures in the coming days will tell whether we have hit a plateau. However, we are hopeful as the cases have started declining. Cases in Delhi and UP had plateaued out a week back, we are achieving it now,” Tak said. On whether the lockdown had been instrumental in bringing down the infections, Tak said the impact of the restrictions will manifest in around 10 days. J&K has registered the highest cases and fatalities in the first 13 days of May, with 57,680 cases and 685 deaths, of which at least 13,000 have been reported from Srinagar. Aabid Maqbool, president, Resident Doctors’ Association, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, said that it was premature to say that the cases in Srinagar had stabilised.“There may be many factors at play for the apparent phenomenon. We are not sure if the tests are the same or have decreased. The lockdown restrictions have been enforced strictly and many people may not be getting themselves tested. It is a dynamic situation and it is premature to say we have hit a plateau,” he said. Cautioning people against becoming lax, deputy commissioner Srinagar Ajaz Asad said, “371 Positive Cases in Srinagar today is the lowest in last 20 days. Still not a good data for good conclusion. Pl remember, the Virus loves to troll. Loves to ambush.”Srinagar is J&K’s worst-affected district with overall 56,416 cases (till May 13) and 651 fatalities. Jammu comes at a close second with 42,442 cases, of which 7,589 are active and 758 fatalities. Jammu’s deaths surpassed Srinagar’s this month with the unusually high 280 fatalities in May. “Srinagar’s population density is more and the movement of people is more. In fact cases and mortality in Srinagar was also more. Srinagar will tell us about how Covid is going to unfold in other places of J&K,” the DAK president Dr Tak said.The administration has tightened the restrictions in the capital city after Eid and has installed roadblocks in many parts of the city to stop private transport from plying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/experts-divided-as-srinagar-s-daily-cases-hold-steady-for-a-week-101621021203788.html

A passerby, Rahul Kumar, entered the pond to save the children, but he too drowned. Later, villagers informed the police. Joint commissioner of police (JCP, Rural) Sachin Gupta said a police team reached the spot and took divers’ help. All the six bodies were fished out after two hours, he said. The JCP said the bodies were found on the deeper side of the pond and they were stuck on the pond bed. The bodies were sent to the civil hospital for postmortem. Kokila, the mother of four siblings, passed out seeing the bodies of her children. The victims’ father, Sanjay Kumar, a factory worker, said they used to deter the children from going near the pond. Farzana, the mother of Mohammad Kaleem, her son left the house in new clothes and took ₹10 from her as Eidi for buying chips. He had promised to come back in a few minutes, said the mother. Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced an ex gratia of ₹50,000 each to the families of the six victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-children-among-6-drown-in-ludhiana-village-pond-four-were-siblings-101621021202635.html

The drone is suspected to have flown back into the Pakistani territory after it dropped the consignment 250m inside Indian territory, officials said.BSF Jammu frontier deputy inspector general of police (DIG) SPS Sandhu said, “BSF troops recovered a consignment of arms and ammunition meant for overground workers working with terrorists near the Regal Post of the BSF along the IB in Samba at around 12.15am.” The consignment, which was wrapped in polythene, included an AK-47 assault rifle, a 9mm pistol, a 9mm magazine, 15 pistol rounds and a wooden frame used to support the payload in the drone, Sandhu said. Sandhu said, “We immediately lodged a protest note with the Pak Rangers, but they always remain in a denial mode.”Congratulating the troops, IG, BSF Jammu, NS Jamwal termed the recovery as a “big achievement”, and said the force is ever alert and vigilant on the IB to thwart away the nefarious designs of Pakistan. The weapons were recovered from the same area where a trans-border tunnel was detected on November 22 and a Pakistani intruder was killed on May 5, he said. On April 24, two Pakistani drones had entered Indian territory in Arnia sector of Jammu district. After the BSF guards opened fire, they flew back into Pakistani territory. On May 3, after truce was upheld for around two months, Pakistan had breached the ceasefire agreement with unprovoked firing at the Border Security Force (BSF) patrol in Ramgarh sector of Jammu’s Samba district. On May 10, around 9.55pm suspected terrorists hurled a grenade at a police picket at Nud in Samba that exploded but missed the intended target.  The BSF had also shot down a Pakistani hexa-copter carrying a huge cache of arms and ammunition on June 2020 in Kathua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pak-drone-drops-pistol-ak-47-in-j-k-s-samba-101621021023545.html

One person lay underneath the van, The Independent reported.The protesters chanted “Leave our neighbours, let them go” and “Cops go home” being heard as a ring of police stood around the van, local Scottish newspapers said.Officers said they were freeing the men for the safety of everyone involved following a stand-off in Glasgow.The protest prompted Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon to accuse the home office of creating “a dangerous and unacceptable situation”.Announcing the men’s release, Police Scotland said in a statement: “In order to protect the safety, public health and wellbeing of all people involved in the detention and subsequent protest in Kenmure Street, Pollokshields, chief superintendent Mark Sutherland has, following a suitable risk assessment, taken the operational decision to release the men detained by UK Immigration Enforcement back into their community meantime.” One of the men, Lakhvir Singh, 34, said: “I’ve been astonished and overwhelmed by the support I’ve received from the people of Glasgow. At 9.30am, immigration enforcement carried out a raid and we were taken to security in the van. There were only five or six people at the time but word spread and then there were crowds of hundreds. We are so grateful for the support,” he was quoted by The Independent newspaper as saying.Scotland’s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, asked to speak to UK home secretary Priti Patel about the events.The Sikhs in Scotland group said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” and urged the home office to “abandon forced removals and to adopt an immigration policy based on human rights, compassion and dignity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/immigration-offences-two-punjab-origin-men-detained-in-scotland-released-after-protest-101621020840944.html

The daily figures have been dropping consistently after peaking at 2,612 on May 10. At 20, the tricity also recorded the lowest fatality figures in the past eight days. The all-time high was recorded on May 5 with 38 deaths. The number of active cases is also on the downward trajectory, falling by 7.6% in a day from Thursday’s 23,432 to 21,630 on Friday.While seeing the trend as a “ray of hope”, experts say it will have to be observed for a few more days before confirming whether the “worst is over” in the pandemic’s second wave.On Friday, Mohali district reported 661 cases and 10 deaths, followed by 650 cases and eight casualties in Chandigarh and 418 cases and two fatalities in Panchkula. With the number of patients being cured and discharged remaining higher than the daily case load for the past few days, the number of active cases has dropped to 8,158 from the peak of 8,653 on May 10 in Chandigarh.Meanwhile, with eight people, including two in their late 30s, succumbing to the virus, the death toll has reached 617. Of 54,043 people tested so far, 45,268 have recovered in the UT.In Mohali, a record 1,942 patients were discharged on Friday, which brought down the number of active cases to 10,914 from 12,203.The district has reported 59,524 cases so far, of which 47,870 have been cured and 740 patients have died. In Panchkula, both fatalities concerned two men in their late 30s, which took the toll to 274.The infection tally has reached 27,071, of which 24,249 patients have recovered and 2,548 are still undergoing treatment.Curbs should continue to sustain trend, say experts“There is a ray of hope with the current trajectory of cases, as the seven-day average of cases as well as the number of active cases are seeing a declining trend,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the PGIMER’s school of public health and community medicine department, while adding that there is a need for constant enforcement of the lockdown and safety measures, which have “possibly resulted in stabilising the situation”. “The decrease in daily numbers may be due to the restriction measures being taken by the tricity authorities,” concurred Dr PVM Lakshmi, an epidemiologist at the same department. However, Dr Lakshmi said a consistent trend for over a week will present a better picture about which direction the pandemic is leading to. “Even in terms of positive cases among health workers at the PGIMER, we have seen a marginal dip, which is a good sign. Tracing, testing, and treatment can make this trend sustain,” she said, adding that lockdown helps in restricting the number of contacts of an infected person. Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said the cases were expected to plateau and there has been no decline in testing as such.Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, said: “Our efforts will be directed towards maintaining the current trend, but people should take all precautions. Even if the restrictions are eased, residents should avoid venturing out for non-essential works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-on-downward-trajectory-in-chandigarh-tricity-101621020061614.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Amid Covid surge, Chandigarh’s crematoria facing wood shortage||With an unprecedented number of cremations taking place in the city during the current wave of Covid-19, cremation ground operators are beginning to see a shortage of wood. According to them, each funeral pyre requires about 3-4 tonnes of wood.The caretaker of Industrial Area cremation ground, Deen Dyal Tripathi, said, “The number of cremations taking place here, both Covid and non-Covid, have gone up and though we require 60 tonnes of wood daily, these days it is hard to get. Each cremation takes up around 3-4 tonnes of wood.”While the average number of monthly cremations in 2019 was 15-20, these days as many are being performed daily. Moreover, the price of wood has doubled, said Tripathi, adding that there is a shortage of supply from the contractors, partly because of wood being diverted to other cities in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, besides unavailability of labourers.A similar situation has gripped Sector 25 and Manimajra cremation grounds. Ashwani Kumar, caretaker of Manimajra crematorium, said, “During the first Covid wave, every day we would get three to four trucks full of wood, but now supply has reduced even as the demand is high. The municipal corporation fixes the rates, but procurement is done by the crematorium staff from contractors in Punjab, Yamunanagar and Uttar Pradesh.”“We had a backup of around 3,000 tonnes of wood at the cremation centre before April, however, now about half of it is left. It will last us till the end of the month, but if the situation does not improve, an acute shortage is expected in June,” said an official from the Sector 25 cremation ground.Residents complain of overcharging Amid the ongoing Covid crisis, some residents have raised complaints of overcharging at the city’s crematoria.A resident who had paid for a cremation on April 26 at the Industrial Area crematorium said he was charged ₹6,000.However, caretaker Tripathi refuted the allegations saying, “The cost of wood is fixed at ₹3,500 here. Other expenses like ‘samgiri’ and donation to the pandit must have been included in the total amount.”MC leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla has also submitted a complaint regarding this to the civic body. The MC will now bear the cost of cremation for poor Covid victims.Even though wood used for traditional cremation in Sector 25 is priced at ₹3,000, the LPG crematorium next to the cremation ground charges only ₹30. However, according to the officials here, people still prefer the traditional way.“The low cost is not bringing more bodies to our crematorium. Most people who use our facilities come from affluent families and choose it because it causes less pollution. Mostly Sikh families use our facilities, and Hindu families prefer the traditional method of cremation,” they said.While last year there was a shortage of lockers at the city’s crematoria, this problem has been resolved this year, according to Ashwani Kumar. “Last year, due to movement restrictions, people were unable to collect the mortal remains on time, which led to the lockers running out of space,” he said, adding that now people have been told to collect the remains within one day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-surge-chandigarh-s-crematoria-facing-wood-shortage-101621019701423.html

Diya is about eight years old and the cubs’ sire is Aman, a nine-year-old Bengal Tiger.Both the cubs are healthy and under Diya’s care and constant CCTV monitoring.Chhatbir Zoo field director Naresh Mahajan said, “The veterinary wing and zoo management are observing the tigress and the cubs, who were born on May 8. While some privacy has been given to Diya, no one is allowed to go near them except the zookeeper and veterinarian concerned. The cubs will remain under surveillance till they grow bigger.”This is the second time that Diya has given birth. In 2019, the tigress had delivered three cubs, one female and two males. However, the 18-month-old female cub died on May 9 this year. The cub had been behaving normally till she passed away and was taken for postmortem examination to Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, however, it was found to be a natural death.The cub was also tested for Covid-19, but the results came out negative. All other carnivores at Chhatbir Zoo have also been tested.Meanwhile, the zoo is closed for the public till May 31 to keep the animals safe from Covid. After the first virus wave in 2020, the zoo had been closed in March and was reopened in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-bengal-tiger-cubs-born-at-mohali-s-chhatbir-zoo-101621019641341.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Local ID not needed to get hospitalised in Chandigarh||Complying with the Supreme Court’s order, the Chandigarh health department has ordered that no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in the UT over the lack of local residence or identity proof.Chandigarh sees an influx of patients from neighbouring states, including Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, and with the overwhelming Covid-19 situation, a larger ingress, majorly for critical care services, is being witnessed.At one point, the UT administration had denied sharing the bed occupancy details of the hospitals with officials citing reasons of “patients rushing to the city for better medical services”. However, after directions of Punjab and Haryana high court, the administration started to put out the data.Last year, the hospitals under the UT administration had restricted normal childbirth services for women living outside the city jurisdiction as a measure to check the spread of Covid-19.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had stated in a press conference in April that the majority of beds had been occupied by people from outside Chandigarh, posing a challenge for the administration to ramp up the medical facilities.Even UT adviser Manoj Parida, had last month appealed to Chandigarh residents not to “choke” the city’s health infrastructure by “inviting friends and relatives from outside”.In a May 12 order, the UT director of health services ordered that no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in the Chandigarh in absence of local residence or identity proof.Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has asked all department heads to comply with the Supreme Court directions.The apex court had earlier ordered that the central government shall, within two weeks, formulate a national policy on admissions to hospitals which shall be followed by all state governments and till then, no patient shall be denied hospitalisation or essential drugs in any state or UT for lack of local residential proof of that state/UT or even in the absence of any identity proof.UT health officials, requesting anonymity, said though there were no strict instructions on denying treatment to patients from outside, the verbal directions would discourage admissions and that beds should be reserved for local residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/local-id-not-needed-to-get-hospitalised-in-chandigarh-101621019592625.html

There were 1,000 slots and 929 people got vaccinated, with 71 missing their appointments due to personal reasons. No on-the-spot walk-ins were allowed. Proper social distancing was ensured at the vaccination centres.”Seven centres that were designated as vaccination centres witnessed long queues with people lining up from 9am to receive the jab.Phulkit Arora, a 34-year-old IT professional who received the first dose at Government Multispeciality Hospital, Sector 16, said it was a seamless experience. “I was excited to take the shot and was the first one to get it here. The staff guided me well about the precautions I was supposed to take,” he said.Gap of 84 days must till second shot In line with the Centre’s guidelines, the mandatory gap between the first and second vaccine doses has been extended to 84 days, said Dr Amandeep Kang. She added that the Co-Win will not accept bookings for the second shot before 84 days.As the administration threw open vaccination time slots for the 18-44 age group on Thursday afternoon, it took only an hour for all 7,000 slots till May 22 to get booked.There is no facility for walk-in registration, and the beneficiaries will have to book the slot and obtain the time and place of vaccine through the Co-WIN portal.Private hospitals are to get the vaccines directly from manufacturers. For example, the Serum Institute of India has allocated 12,000 doses of Covishield to Chaitanya Hospital in Sector 44 for May.They may also start the vaccination drive on payment basis immediately after the actual receipt of vaccines. They are already registered on the Co-WIN portal and will be able to offer the slots after they receive the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/929-get-jabbed-in-chandigarh-on-day-1-of-drive-for-18-44-age-group-101621019521471.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Vijay Zade is the new Chandigarh finance secretary||Vijay Namdeorao Zade, a 2002-batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer of the Punjab cadre, will be the new finance secretary in the Chandigarh administration. He will have a three-year tenure.The central government has taken nearly a year to approve his appointment. The tenure of the last incumbent, Ajoy Kumar Sinha, had ended on August 31 last year. Ahead of that, the Punjab government had forwarded a panel of three names to the Chandigarh administration. The latter sent it to the Union home ministry in June last year, with Zade as the first choice. The other two officers were Kumar Rahul (2000 batch) and Arun Sekhri (2014 batch). The post is reserved for a Punjab-cadre IAS officer, and is the third important in the UT administration, after the adviser and home secretary. In addition to the finance department, some other important departments under the officer are engineering, urban planning and estate.Meanwhile, the administration is still awaiting the Centre’s decision on the extension requested for the home secretary and municipal commissioner, confirmed UT adviser Manoj Parida. The three-year deputation of Arun Kumar Gupta, a Haryana-cadre IAS officer of 1992 batch, and MC chief KK Yadav, a Punjab-cadre IAS officer of 2003 batch, ends this month. The administration had requested a three-month extension to their term in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vijay-zade-is-the-new-chandigarh-finance-secretary-101621019460515.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Now, get O2 cylinders in Chandigarh through e-permit||The UT administration on Friday said that Covid-19 patients who have been prescribed oxygen support at home will now be able to get oxygen cylinders through online e-permit.Yashpal Garg, the nodal officer for oxygen supplies in UT, said an application for e-permit can be submitted on the Chandigarh administration’s website http://chandigarh.gov.in/health_covid19.html from 11am on May 15. He said a doctor’s prescription and any address proof of Chandigarh is to be uploaded at the time of submitting the application. “Once the application is approved, it will be valid for two days and the applicant will receive an intimation. Though e-permit may be downloaded from the website, a hard copy is not required and the cylinder (maximum two) may be obtained even on the basis of the approved application number,” he said, and added that cylinders would be provided by M/s Super Agencies, 40-MW Industrial Area-I, Chandigarh. The firm can be contacted through phone at 9888035000 or email at superchandigarh@gmail.com.The consumer will have to pay ₹295 plus 12% GST for a ‘D’ type cylinder and ₹175 plus 12% GST for each ‘A & B’ type cylinder. For a new cylinder, the consumer has to deposit a security amount of ₹25,000, which would be refunded after deduction of rent at ₹100 per day.When asked why the security amount was so high, Garg said the private vendor was of the view that if the security amount was lower, no one would return the cylinder and it could be sold illegally in the market at higher prices.“We are just starting this facility, we will definitely rationalise it. I don’t want to delay the process. It may give relief to at least some persons. For rest of the patients, we will find out some solution. We need to take all, including the private vendor,along,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-get-o2-cylinders-in-chandigarh-through-epermit-101621018500559.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC paves the way for promotion of govt employees with disabilities||The Bombay high court (HC) last week relaxed its earlier status quo order and allowed the state government to promote the employees due to retire by June 30, on a condition that the government will also promote employees with benchmark disabilities on Group A and Group B promotional posts identified for them.The division bench of justice Amjad Sayed and justice Madhav Jamdar further directed that the affidavit shall set out what exercise has been carried out and proposed to be carried out, including the data and statistics that have been collated so far to identify the posts and the outer limit within which the exercise would be completed.The court was hearing a bunch of petitions filed through advocates Vinod Sangvikar, Sugandh Deshmukh and Mahendra Shingade, by persons with disabilities complaining about denial of reservation-in-promotion to Group-A and Group-B posts.Acting on their petitions, HC has on November 3, 2020, stayed the process for finalising promotions to Group-A and Group-B posts in some departments after noticing that the right to reservation in promotion of the physically challenged persons was recognised by the Supreme Court, and a proposal for identifying the posts and working out modalities for providing such reservation was already placed before the state cabinet for approval.HC had thereafter also refused to vacate the stay on January 15 this year by observing that the promotion process cannot be allowed without securing the rights of the petitioners - employees with benchmark disabilities - the general administration department had renewed the plea claiming that the Apex court had subsequently thought it fit to place the matter of reservation-in-promotion for persons with benchmark disabilities for review before a larger bench.During the course of hearing on the petitions on May 7, counsel for the petitioners pointed out that some departments in the government had completed the process of identifying posts to be filled by promotion to the employees with disabilities. The lawyers pointed out that in some cases promotion orders were also issued and what remained to be done was to issue posting orders.Against this backdrop, HC allowed the state government to promote general category employees due to retire by June 30, 2021, but on the condition that the employees with disabilities are also issued posting orders due to them.The bench has added that it expects that the process to identify promotional posts for employees with benchmark disabilities in all departments is completed by June 22, when the petitions will come up for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-paves-the-way-for-promotion-of-govt-employees-with-disabilities-101621018140005.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||SSC cancellation: Unfair to have single formula for marking, say schools, students||As the state education department is yet to announce the marking criteria for Class 10 (SSC board) students in the state, there is a concern among students and teachers that a single criterion for marking might not do justice to all students as there is no uniformity in the format for internal assessments across schools.In a recent survey conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT), it was found that schools have assessed students between Class 8 and 10 in many different ways- using Whatsapp based assessments, through online sessions and tests, offline exams and workbooks and worksheets. Teachers said that in the absence of uniform evaluation criteria, it will be difficult to mark students on a single formula.For instance, many schools which reopened for offline classes in November 2020 and conducted sessions until April 2021 have evaluated students based on offline exams, conducted in the school and strictly supervised by teachers. The principal of a school in Chandrapur said, “In our region schools had reopened and we conducted offline exams. Our students sincerely wrote these papers and there was vigilance to see that there is malpractice. But in places where students gave tests online, there was no way to check malpractices. How can one evaluate these two sets of students on the same criteria?”With the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra and the resultant lockdown, the state government decided to cancel Class 10 SSC exams in the state that was earlier scheduled to be held in June. The department is yet to announce the formula for assessments. Students said that they are getting more worried by the day. “There is no decision almost a month after the announcement of the cancellation of exams. We cannot even estimate how much and how well we will score because we do not know what marks will be calculated, to begin with,” said Shweta Wagh, a Malad-based student.Officials from the education department said a decision in this respect will be announced soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssc-cancellation-unfair-to-have-single-formula-for-marking-say-schools-students-101621018080570.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Contempt notices to Cidco, Raigad collector as NGT order on Panje not implemented||A civil society group, which works to protect Maharashtra’s mangroves and coastal wetlands, has served contempt of court notices to Cidco and the Raigad district collector for non-compliance of a month-old order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that ordered that all tidal water inlets to Cidco’s 289-hectare (ha) property in Uran be opened immediately to ensure flow of sea water to Panje coastal wetland and its mangrove forests.NGT’s western regional bench had, on April 15, directed Cidco and the Raigad district collector to ensure that chokepoints at five tidal inlets are removed, upholding previous orders from the state environment department. Environmentalists have repeatedly emphasised in statements to the press over the past month that this order has not been implemented. Nandakumar Pawar, head of NGO Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, had moved NGT for urgent interim relief in April as the state government’s earlier orders to clear the inlets had been ignored.“You are hereby called upon to ensure that the order dated April 15, 2021 passed by the National Green Tribunal and the directions contained therein are complied with forthwith and the blockages to the 5 culverts at Panje are immediately removed, failing which my client will consider himself at liberty to file appropriate proceedings including those for contempt against you,” stated the notice, which was served by Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan’s legal counsel Meenaz Kalia.An official with Cidco, who did not wish to be identified, said, “The NGT order does not apply to us directly. The particular culverts are on Navi Mumbai SEZ land, which has been leased out to a private company in 2019. They need to implement the order, not Cidco.” Nidhi Chaudhury, Raigad district collector, did not respond to a request for comment.Environmentalists, however, took issue with this claim. “NMSEZ is only leasing land from Cidco. Besides, Cidco is also a partner in the NMSEZ, and the ownership of the land belongs with them. They are still the rightful custodians,” said BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation who has been campaigning for Panje to be declared as a wetland and a bird sanctuary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/contempt-notices-to-cidco-raigad-collector-as-ngt-order-on-panje-not-implemented-101621018080017.html

Holding Pond 2 is a contiguous 237-hectare running waterbody and even in the nomenclature of local planner Cidco, the area is supposed to be a flood control mechanism. “But unfortunately, the holding pond itself is being shrunk with the burial of lush green mangroves,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of NGO Shri Ekvira Aai Prartishtan.Members of Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti, whose artisanal fishing livelihood is threatened by the resulting ecological damage, also alleged the frequency of landfilling activities has visibility increased during lockdown, and first picked up pace a little less than a year ago. “The scale of mangrove loss is plain to see. But most of the work happens at night, when trucks come and blatantly dump debris and mud directly over the water bodies,” said Deepak Koli, a member of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uran-mangroves-being-buried-during-lockdown-allege-activists-101621018021050.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Ventilators procured under PM Cares were of inferior quality: Maharashtra Congress||Congress on Friday alleged that the ventilators procured by the Central government under PM Cares Fund were of inferior quality and could not be installed in hospitals, even when they were badly needed to treat Covid-19 patients. Ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), however, refuted the allegations saying they were ‘baseless and incorrect’ and without the support of full information.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that about 100 ventilators supplied by the Centre to government hospitals in Nashik and Aurangabad could not be installed because of flaws in them. Citing a probe committee appointed by the Government Medical College in Aurangabad, Sawant said that the ventilators could not be repaired even by the technicians appointed by the manufacturing company. He said 60 ventilators provided to a hospital in Nashik were lying idle because the parts required for their installation were not provided.“It is a big scam of procurement from the money received in donations to PMCares Fund. The procurement needs to be investigated by a state-level committee. Modi government forced corporate houses in the country to donate to this fund, but information about the donations was kept under the wrap. The fund was kept out of the purview of the Right To Information Act. The public need to know how and why such highly incompetent manufacturing company got the contract to supply ventilators,” Sawant said.In its clarification issued through Press Information Bureau, the MoHFW has said, “The ventilators in question are not funded under PM Cares fund. In Aurangabad Medical College, 150 ventilators were supplied by Jyoti CNC. Of them, 100 ventilators reached Aurangabad on April 19 and another 50 on April 23, followed by their installation as per the allocations received from the State authorities. Some of them were installed in private hospitals by state authorities. On getting complaints, the engineers appointed by manufacturers attended the calls by recalibrating some of them and replacing parts for few others. The ventilators were made functional and commissioned subsequently. Some of the complaints were for the improper mask fitting on patients.”The statement further stated that the team of service engineers is still in the hospital and as soon as a ventilator is fitted on a patient with NIV mode, they shall be in a position to demonstrate this to the hospital authorities there. At present the ventilators have been put on Invasive mode on the patient and functioning fine, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ventilators-procured-under-pm-cares-were-of-inferior-quality-maharashtra-congress-101621018019948.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Asking to deposit ₹22 lakh fraud amount not a valid bail condition: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) recently set aside the bail condition of depositing ₹22 lakh imposed on an accused in a fraud case by an additional sessions judge on the grounds that such an onerous condition for bail was not maintainable. As three other accused in the fraud case had already been granted bail, the HC granted bail to the accused on grounds of parity, albeit with conditions applicable in normal bails. A bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail application of Mohammadali Saiyyed, was informed by advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud that the additional sessions judge, Malegaon had granted bail to the accused on August 21, 2020 and in the operative part of the order, his client was directed to deposit ₹22 lakh before the magistrate as a condition precedent for his release on bail. Dr Chandrachud submitted that his client had initially applied for bail with the judicial magistrate first class on the grounds that the charge sheet was not filed within the stipulated time, which was allowed by the magistrate. However, before Saiyyed could fulfil the bail conditions imposed by the magistrate of depositing ₹50,000 as personal bond and furnishing solvent sureties of like amount, the police filed a charge sheet within four days of the bail order. After this, Saiyyed approached the additional sessions judge. According to the prosecution, Saiyyed in connivance with three others had posed as officials of a financial firm based in Gujarat and collected ₹22 lakh from a developer from Manmad as commission for processing a loan of ₹5 crore. However, after the loan was not sanctioned, a case was lodged at the behest of the developer and the four were arrested. While the three others were granted bail by the HC, Saiyyed was the last as he was considered the mastermind of the fraud. Dr Chandrachud informed the HC that the condition precedent imposed by the additional sessions judge had been deprecated by the Supreme Court, and as his client could not arrange the amount, Saiyyed’s right to be released on bail was frustrated. In light of these submissions, he sought setting aside of the bail condition and urged the court to grant bail to Saiyyed. The application was opposed by the complainant’s advocate who informed the court Saiyyed had two passports and could abscond if released on bail. The additional public prosecutor for the state, while submitting that though the condition of depositing ₹22 lakh for release on bail was onerous, said that Saiyyed could not be released on bail on merits. After hearing the submissions, the bench agreed with Dr Chandrachud about the condition precedent and noted, “Obviously the condition is onerous and it is prejudging the issues between the parties without trial. This condition proceeds on the footing that the FIR is the complete truth without necessity of any further proof. This approach obviously is not permissible.” The bench then set aside the precedent condition and granted bail to Saiyyed on the grounds that he would appear before the concerned police station on the first Monday of every month and would be present during trial and disposed of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/asking-to-deposit-22-lakh-fraud-amount-not-a-valid-bail-condition-bombay-hc-101621017961147.html

In many of these districts, the health infrastructure is very poor and the need of this hour is to beef up the entire system. Covid-19 can be contained in Maharashtra not by a reduction in selected pockets but when the numbers across the state come down,” said Mandot.After Mumbai, drive-in vaccination has started in Nagpur at Global Mall which was inaugurated by Union minister Nitin Gadkari.Meanwhile, in Nashik, four people were arrested for selling Remdesivir in the black market at ₹27,000 per dose.In Kolhapur, two convicts undergoing their sentence for murder escaped from Covid-19 centre.In Buldhana, 13 doctors working in private Covid-19 hospital resigned en-masse protesting against the mental stress they were facing from the politicos. Similarly, the local administration in Buldhana has enlisted the help of drones to keep a watch on those roaming on the streets without any valid reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-39-923-new-covid-cases-state-to-focus-on-districts-with-maximum-cases-101621017960006.html

He has also alleged that phones of many leaders from the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and even Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were tapped.“I have received information that my phone was under interception, and the permission for the same was sought by giving the reason of narcotic links associated with me. My phone was under surveillance under the name of Amjad Khan. The telephones of many other leaders from leading parties and that of IAS and IPS officers too were intercepted. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government should investigate into the illegal tapping and the motive behind it, as it is a serious violation of the fundamental right of privacy. It should also be brought to the fore about who gave permission for such tapping and who were associated with the act,” Patole said.The Congress leader said the tapping was done by naming the telephone numbers under fake accounts. He has demanded strict action against the people involved in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-seeks-probe-into-alleged-phonetapping-101621017901276.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra govt extends ₹50L relief scheme for families of deceased cops||The state government on Friday issued a fresh government resolution (GR), extending the scheme providing for solatium of ₹50 lakh to the kin of the government employees, including police personnel, who died due to Covid-19, while performing Covid-related duties.The scheme that had lapsed on December 31, 2020, has now been extended till June 30, 2021. The families of over 100 police personnel, who died of Covid since January 2021 will now get due compensation, a senior IPS officer said.HT had first published a report on May 4, highlighting how families of police personnel who died due to Covid this year were left in the lurch, as the scheme ended in December 2020.Very few families of deceased policemen could get compensation this year in the absence of a relief scheme. Their case was presented before the finance department and was marked as a ‘special case’ by the police department. However, dozens of claim files had remained unprocessed due to the non-renewal of the scheme. Sanjeev Singhal, additional director general of police (administration) said, “We welcome the government’s decision. The police department has been continuously following this matter with the government and requesting them that the funds be released so that the grieving families of deceased policemen could get much needed financial aid.”During the initial days of the pandemic, many police personnel pressed into Covid-related work had contracted the virus and were falling sick. The disease was spreading among the police force rapidly, and thus there was a sense of fear and panic among the men in khaki.The state government had in May 2020 announced the scheme extending financial help of ₹50 lakh to the families of deceased policemen and a government job to a family member. Mumbai Police went a step ahead and announced an additional ₹10 lakh fund for each family from the police welfare funds. Hundreds of families of cops who died last year got benefits and many family members even got jobs in the police force.So far all 446 police personnel have died due to Covid-19 in Maharashtra, including 128, who have lost lives this year.Kavita Mahale, 30, wife of late Sanjay Mahale, a constable posted with Nardana police station in Dhule, said that the compensation will help her start her life afresh. Her husband succumbed to the disease on March 25 and eight days later his father also passed away. Sanjay’s mother had already died six months ago due to a prolonged illness. Mahale is now left with her two kids. Gaurav Wani, an engineering student and son of head constable Sanjay Wani, who was posted with Kolshewadi police station in Kalyan, is equally perplexed. Three months have passed since his father’s death due to Covid, but the family hasn’t yet received any compensation from the state. The family now hopes that the claim file would be processed soon.Similar is the case of the family of head constable Ramesh Survase from Chunabhatti police station who died last month due to Covid. Survase’s brother Vishnu said the compensation money will help his brother’s wife take care of her two children aged 17 and 12 years.Covid care cell for cops The state police have started a 24x7 Covid care cell where any police personnel can contact and take any information related to Covid 19, bed availability, medicines availability, etc. The cell will also have information on medicines like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, and oxygen concentrator, etc. They can also lodge any Covid0-related complaint on this helpline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-maharashtra-govt-extends-50l-relief-scheme-for-families-of-deceased-cops-101621017899980.html

15-05-2021||Mumbai||State may cross 20-mn vaccination mark this weekend||Maharashtra on Friday inoculated over 150,000 beneficiaries, inching towards becoming the first state in the country to administer 20 million doses by the weekend. The state is currently short of around 300,000 inoculations to achieve the landmark. Meanwhile, the second shot for people over 45 years of age is expected to get a boost this weekend, as Maharashtra is expecting a batch of vaccines from the Centre on Friday night or in the wee hours of Saturday, officials said. A day after the Union government said the second shot of Covishield should be taken between 12 and 16 weeks after the first jab, from the earlier six to eight weeks, the state anticipates easing of the rush. However, there is no clarity from the state on how many citizens will be eligible for the second dose once the new gap is implemented. As per the state government’s estimates, currently 1.6 million people are due for their second shot of Covishield and 400,000 for Covaxin. However, the Centre has not provided any stock of the Bharat Biotech-manufactured vaccine since Sunday, a senior health department official said. The civic body has decided to suspend vaccination on Saturday and Sunday. The health department officials said they will give preference to second dose in the drive. The state is planning to keep 80% of the vaccine doses received for second dose and 20% for first dose, an official said. The state has already decided to divert around 900,000 doses, including the doses it purchased for 18-44 years category, and utilise for the second doses of people over 45 years. From Monday, for three days in a week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has allowed walk-in for people over 60 years and differently abled at vaccination centres. “There is a discussion to bring down the proportion from 60:40 to 80:20 to finish the second doses. Even if the interval has been increased by the Centre, the department, through the state government, will continue to demand higher number of doses to cater to the demand,” said an official requesting anonymity. Over the past seven days, the state has administered 1,490,994 shots, of which 59.16% or 882,101 are second. The state has averaged 212,999 doses daily between May 8 and 14. On May 14, the state administered doses to 150,926, including 96,336 second shots, data from the Co-WIN portal showed. So far, the state had administered 19,700,398 shots since January 16, when the vaccination drive began in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-may-cross-20-mn-vaccination-mark-this-weekend-101621017781698.html
15-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body plans mobile vaccination centres in city||To make the vaccination drive more aggressive, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to start mobile vaccination centres in the city. According to BMC officials, once it procures additional vaccine doses from the international market, the mobile unit vehicles will visit housing societies and complexes where citizens will be able to come and get the vaccine shots. The city has been facing a shortage of vaccine due to which the civic body has suspended vaccination for the 18-44 category. Most of the available stock is being used to give second dose due to around 100,000 beneficiaries. The number of beneficiaries, however, will come down, once the state government directs the BMC to follow the interval gap of 12-16 weeks, from the current 8-12 weeks, for second dose of Covishield vaccine, as advised by the Centre. The BMC has planned a special walk-in drive for second dose of Covishield for around 100,000 citizens between May 17 and 19. This number may come down now, which would mean the civic body can use some of the stock for first dose. On Friday, 23,924 citizens were vaccinated in the city, of which 3,180 were between the age of 18 and 44, 12,323 in the 45-59 age group, 7,888 above the age of 60 years, 134 health care and 399 front line workers. Overall, so far, 2,841,349 citizens have been vaccinated in the city. Meanwhile, civic officials said looking at the current stockpile, the plan to have mobile vaccination centres will not materialise in the next one month. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We plan to aggressively vaccinate citizens once we get sufficient vaccine doses. By sufficient doses, I mean two million to three million doses, after which we plan to start mobile vaccination centres. This will be possible after we procure bulk vaccine doses from the international bid that we floated.” Earlier this week, the BMC floated a global expression of interest, inviting international vaccine manufacturers to deliver around 10 million vaccine doses to the city. However, the BMC has restricted the entry of China. Kakani added, “We are thinking that rather than going door-to-door, going to societies or complexes will be much faster and everyone will be comfortable this way. We will aim for locations where we can cover maximum population. This will be apart from the permission that the BMC is giving to housing societies and corporates to tie up with private hospitals for vaccination.” According to the BMC, the required infrastructure will be set up within days after the procurement of bulk doses. A BMC official from the transport department said, “When we say mobile vaccination centres, we just need a simple ambulance to vaccinate one person at a time. The observation will be done outside the mobile vaccination centre. We can use the existing 550 Covid ambulances that will be used for arranging the cold storage. The modalities will be worked out in the coming days. Additional vehicles can be procured, if required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-plans-mobile-vaccination-centres-in-city-101621017781093.html
15-05-2021||Other||Himalaya Bridge at CSMT likely to be ready by mid-2023: Mumbai civic body||If everything goes according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) plan, the Himalaya Bridge near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) will be ready for pedestrians by mid-2023, civic officials said. The BMC’s standing committee on Friday finalised the contractor for the construction of the bridge that had collapsed in 2019 killing seven. The contractor has been given a period of 15 months – excluding the monsoon period – for the construction, at a cost of around ₹6.5 crore. Earlier, the plan was to have the bridge constructed by the end of 2022, but the tendering took time owing to the second Covid-19 wave. The standing committee approved the construction almost five months after bids for the purpose were floated. BMC has proposed the Himalaya Bridge’s length to be 33m and width to be 4.4m. The construction is expected to be done using stainless steel that will be supported by pier. As per the draft design prepared by BMC, there will be three entry and exit points for the bridge.Congress corporator Javed Juneja, who is a member of the standing committee, said, “I had suggested that the BMC should have drawn plans in a way that there was an entry and exit from either side of the FOB (foot overbridge) considering that the current design leads a person directly into the railway station premises and the bridge will not be useful for crossing roads. But BMC said the heritage committee would have a problem with it.”The Himalaya Bridge was constructed by BMC in 1988 and was mainly used by rail commuters. Prior to its collapse, the civic body had carried out the bridge’s beautification – including colouring and replacement of tiles with granite – in 2016. BMC had also appointed a private consultant for a structural audit of the bridge in 2017-18. The audit report declared that the bridge needed minor repairs. However, the structure collapsed on March 14, 2019, and BMC’s engineering department was blamed for the mishap, and a chief engineer was jailed. Following this, BMC ordered the reaudit of hundreds of bridges in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himalaya-bridge-at-csmt-likely-to-be-ready-by-mid-2023-mumbai-civic-body-101621017779913.html
15-05-2021||Chandigarh||Model gaushala to come up on GADVASU campus in Ludhiana||The Punjab government has sanctioned a project to set up a model gaushala at the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) campus. The project will be carried out a cost of ₹1.7 crore.Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor of the university, said that there are nearly 1.6 lakh stray cattle in Punjab and 50.22 lakh across the country.“Stray cattle is one of the major reasons for road accidents and damage to crops and forest plantations. Some people let loose the cows after their productive life is over. Moreover, stray animals are usually malnourished and wounded, and thus suffer themselves,” said Singh.SPS Ghuman, dean, college of veterinary sciences, said that the aim of this gaushala will be to manage the stray cattle on a self-reliant basis on scientific lines, with available inexpensive techniques involving low-cost comfortable housing, feeding and healthcare facilities. JPS Gill, director research, GADVASU, said that demonstrating low-cost management and feeding systems of stray animal management will help the dairy farming industry of the state and society at large.The team comprising of RS Grewal, director, livestock farms; ST Singh, Puneet Malhotra and Ravi Kant will initiate the work on this project immediately. The model gaushala will be a demonstration unit, depicting scientific cattle management with economic rearing and zero-waste production, that can be replicated at gram panchayat / taluka levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/model-gaushala-to-come-up-on-gadvasu-campus-in-ludhiana-101621017542441.html

15-05-2021||Delhi||PIL on hoarding: Delhi Police question Youth Cong chief BV Srinivas||The Delhi Police’s crime branch visited the office of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) on Friday and questioned its president, BV Srinivas, over the source of oxygen cylinders and other life-saving drugs with which he was helping Covid-19 patients and their families, at a time when the Capital is struggling with a shortage of both resources and essential drugs amid the fourth wave of Covid-19.The police’s action invited the criticism from the Congress, although Delhi Police has questioned politicians across the spectrum delivering such aid on the direction of the Delhi High Court.Videos of the police team inside the IYC headquarters made the rounds on social media, after which many people, including senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, tweeted with the trending hashtag #IstandwithIYC.Over the past few weeks, Srinivas has emerged as the humanitarian face of the crisis that gripped many parts of India and especially the national capital, delivering oxygen cylinders and concentrators, and finding hospital beds for those that needed them.Government officials aware of the matter said Srinivas was questioned as part of their ongoing probe into the alleged black marketing and hoarding of medical supplies. A pubic interest litigation was filed in the Delhi high court alleging that some politicians were hoarding and distributing essential medicines required in the treatment of Covid-19.The crime branch, in the last five days, has questioned people from other political parties too. Police have recorded statements of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Dilip Pandey, BJP Delhi spokesperson Harish Khurana, former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma, among others.Khurana confirmed that he too was contacted by the crime branch. “The police investigation is based on court’s direction. They are asking all those, including people from BJP, who provided help to others. It is wrong to say that this is being done on the directions of the Centre,” he said.Srinivas said: “Somebody filed a PIL asking how we were getting Covid-19 medicines while there is a shortage. The police team came to find the source of our supply. They said they have to submit a reply to the high court. They took the statement of people from other parties too. We have done nothing wrong. We will continue to help people.”Commenting on Srinivas’ questioning by the Delhi police, Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary of the Congress, tweeted, “People of this country must decide if helping people with oxygen or providing medicines… is a crime. Is it a crime to help people in getting beds at the hospital? Maybe this is a crime, so Delhi police is questioning our youth Congress president BV Srinivas.”Though Delhi police did not issue any statement on Friday spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, said they had already issued a clarification on Wednesday. “On a writ petition filed by a person identified as Dr Deepak Singh about politicians involved in illegal distribution of Covid-19 medicines etc, the honourable high court of Delhi has directed the Delhi Police to conduct an enquiry. In compliance to the directions of the high court, an enquiry is being conducted and we are questioning several people.”Singh did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.When contacted, senior AAP leader Dilip Pandey said, “People like us have some form of political backing, but think about those hundreds and thousands of individuals who are selflessly helping others. In the coming days, if we see a third wave, fewer people will come out to help fearing they will be questioned by the police. As for people like us, we will continue to help people in whatever way we can.”Pandey added the timing and manner in which these investigations are being carried out is wrong.“They must do it in a considerate way. It should not be that they waste all their time going after innocent people while the actual culprits roam free,” he said.BJP MP from East Delhi Gautam Gambhir put out a tweet on Friday saying that the opposition should not indulge in needless politicization of due process. “Delhi Police has asked for a reply from us & we’ve provided all details. I will keep serving Delhi & its people to the best of my abilities always!” he tweeted. Gambhir did not respond to requests for comment.(With inputs from Umar Sofi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pil-on-hoarding-delhi-police-question-youth-cong-chief-bv-srinivas-101621017241213.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Low-quality health gear has flooded city markets: Delhi police||The skyrocketing demand for masks, PPE kits, hand sanitisers and gloves, fuelled by the surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic, has led to the mushrooming of unauthorised manufacturing units that are producing these essentials using substandard material, the Delhi Police’s intelligence unit has said in its report submitted to the police brass.According to the report, these unauthorised units are being run out of local markets and industrial areas around Delhi-NCR. In most units, apart from the quality of materials used in the production, cleanliness and health hygiene are grossly compromised, officers privy to the intelligence report has said.Also, the units are defying labour regulations by employing children, and unskilled and semi-skilled women for low wages and then putting them to work in unhygienic conditions, posing a threat to their health, the officers said.Parallel to the action continuing against people involved in cheating, hoarding and black-marketing of medicines, injections and medical equipment used for treating Covid patients, the Delhi Police has now planned a crackdown on manufacturing units involved in producing spurious sanitisers and substandard PPE kits, masks and gloves, a senior police officer said, not wishing to be named.The police have also urged the public to dial the Covid helpline -- 011-23469900 -- and share information if they come across adulterated sanitisers or low-grade medical gear, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said.“We have been receiving information that people have started selling/supplying low-quality masks, PPE Kits, gloves and sanitisers. The Delhi Police has zero tolerance to people who, by resorting to such malpractices, are risking the lives of innocent persons. If anyone has any information about such people, (s)he should inform us on our helpline,” said Biswal.Apart from the 15 police districts and other units, the city police has also written to the civic agencies, Delhi government’s health, drugs control, labour, and home departments for taking steps to counter such spurious trade.A senior police officer, in the know of the report, said on condition of anonymity, “Employing children in these units is not only illegal but also dangerous -- they are exposed to the infection as there is no social distancing protocols in these units. Adulterated sanitisers can cause skin ailments in people and also lead to fire incidents, as sanitisers are inflammable by composition. In local production units, any and every kind of fabric is being used to make face masks and PPE kits. The production in these units is totally unregulated.”Health and medical experts also believe that use of substandard sanitisers, PPE kits, masks, gloves and other medical gear may put the lives of people at risk, especially doctors and medical personnel looking after Covid patients.“Masks, PPE kits, gloves, and sanitisers are life-saving gear that are used by a person to avoid contracting the infection. Sale and use of substandard items means that we are playing with the lives of people. It’s a heinous crime and the police as well as other agencies should take strict action against people involved in such illegal activities. People must make it a point to buy products that are genuine and have all necessary standard compliance marks and labels,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department, community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-plan-crackdown-on-units-manufacturing-low-quality-medical-gear-sanitisers-101621017179953.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Decongestion drive at Tihar excludes those caught for Covid-related crimes||At least 100 Tihar jail prisoners, arrested for non-heinous crimes like hoarding or black marketing of Covid-19 medical supplies, or cheating during the pandemic, have been denied interim bail by the Supreme Court-appointed High Powered Committee (HPC) in charge of decongesting the prison complex, according to officers privy to the development.The HPC excluded them from the list of prisoners eligible for interim bail after Delhi police wrote to the committee, pointing out that such people took advantage of the chaos during the pandemic “to make wrong and undue profits by black marketing and selling drugs”.Agreeing with the police’s contention, the HPC -- consisting members of the high court, state government, prison department and the Delhi police -- added such prisoners to the list of those not eligible for interim bail, whenever the government takes steps to decongest the jail complex. While their cases will be seen at par with those arrested for terror crimes, who are also excluded from interim-bail, they can apply for regular bail in courts as part of their ongoing trial.On Thursday, the prison department, on the directions of the HPC, released at least 700 prisoners from the first batch of 1,133, who have been granted interim bail to decongest the prison complex. Nearly 19,500 prisoners were lodged at Tihar jail, against a sanctioned capacity of 10,026. The released prisoners will have to surrender after 90 days.Senior prison officers said that in the last 10 days, jail superintendents had received requests from at least four persons arrested for black marketing and hoarding Covid-19 medical supplies, requesting to be considered for release.“It is good that such category of prisoners have been excluded. This will send a message to all people outside who are misusing people’s helpless in this pandemic. The crimes of hoarding medicines or selling it at exorbitant rates at a time like this is a crime on humanity,”said a senior police, officer, who wished not to be named.In the last few weeks, police have arrested 102 people for various crimes, including hoarding Covid-19 supplies such as medicines, oxygen cylinders, and oxygen concentrators, and cheating people after promising to provide them medicines. At least five nurses have been arrested for stealing medicines such as remdesivir. Five ambulance drivers were arrested for overcharging while four others were also arrested for duping relatives of Covid-19 patients by passing off fire extinguishers as oxygen cylindersWOMEN AND CHILDREN RELEASEDAt least seven pregnant women undertrial prisoners along with 25 other women and their children -- about 26 of them, aged below 6 -- were also released from the women’s jail at Tihar on Thursday and Friday. Prison officers said the decision to release the women and children came in the backdrop of rising cases of Covid-19 inside women’s jail.HT had on May 5 reported how jail number 6 (women’s jail) had the most number of cases despite housing the least number of prisoners -- about 444 prisoners compared to 1,500-2,000 in other jails. The spread of the infection inside the women’s jail had prompted jail officers to start a Covid ward inside the women’s jail. Of the six prisoners, who have died of the infection, a women’s jail inmate, Kahkashan (41), succumbed to the disease on Aprl 29 at GTB hospital.Meanwhile, prison authorities are still awaiting the state government’s orders for the release of 1,000 convicts, who are eligible for release under “emergency parole”. These prisoners had been released on “emergency parole” last year at the start of the pandemic and surrendered in February 2021, when Covid cases in Delhi were at its lowest.The HPC has laid down categories for undertrial prisoners -- such as those in civil imprisonment,senior citizens facing trial for offences with a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail, those suffering serious illnesses and are facing trial for offences with punishment ranging from 10 years to life, first time offenders arrested for none heinous crimes where punishment, if convicted, is less than seven years. -- to be eligible for grant of 90 days interim bail on furnishing a personal bond.<Lama trying for on-record quote>||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/decongestion-drive-at-tihar-excludes-those-caught-for-covid-related-crimes-101621017120646.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Unclaimed ashes pile up at crematoriums||Twenty-two-year-old Rahul straps on his mask, pulls up his gloves, and gets ready with a scoop every evening to collect the remains of Covid-19 dead bodies that have turned to ashes at the Nigambodh Ghat crematorium, one of the largest funeral facilities in the city. He bags the ashes, and stores them in lockers on the cremation ground premises, waiting for families to come and collect the remains.While the remains from each of the pyres are stored inside the facility’s lockers, there are some bags where the ashes and remains from different bodies are mixed together and stored separately.Pointing at these abandoned bags kept on the side of the lockers, Rahul, who goes by one name said, “These are the ashes of people whose families have not come forward to collect them. Maybe they fear infection. We wait for a month, and then move the ashes into these sacks, because there isn’t enough space in the lockers considering the high number of deaths we are seeing these days because of Covid-19.”Caretakers and volunteers at crematoriums across the Capital say that, since the second national wave of Covid-19 cases hit the city, several families of the infected dead chose to not come forward to collect their remains. They say that possible reasons could be fear of contracting the disease, or that the family members are already infected.Suman Gupta, general secretary of the Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti (coordination committee), the organisation that manages the crematorium for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said if the families of the dead do not come to collect the remains for one or two months, or if they remain unreachable, the ashes are kept aside. The coordination committee plans to take the ashes to Haridwar and immerse them on the behalf of the families.Also Read | At Delhi crematoriums, corpses wait in 20-hour queues to burn“Our organisation has been doing this even before Covid-19 hit the country, for poor people who could not afford to conduct the last rites of their dead family members. But now, of course, the volume of the abandoned remains that we are getting is much higher. We believe that unless the last rites of the dead are not conducted, the soul doesn’t depart,” said Gupta.In some cases, he said, the all immediate family members are either admitted to hospitals or are in home isolation, and are unable to perform the last rites of their dead relatives.Delhi government data shows that over the last seven days, the city has recorded a total of 2,168 Covid deaths, of which 289 were recorded on Friday.Surendra Rana, a resident of west Delhi’s Janakpuri, lost his brother to Covid-19 on April 26. At the time, his entire immediate family was infected, and only six friends and neighbours could attend the funeral.“The situation was such that none of us could be there to set fire to his pyre, and it was only after 15 days that we could collect his remains from the crematorium,” Rana said.Since the second wave hit the national capital, the crematoriums are lined with dead bodies waiting their turn. In the first week of May, when cases were at its peak, the waiting time at these facilities was anywhere between 16-36 hours. Many instances of good samaritans, including NGO volunteers, policemen and regular citizens helping with cremations of abandoned Covid infected bodies have been reportedOther cremation facilities said that they, too, were facing increased instances of abandoned remains lying with them.Mukesh Singh, a caretaker at the Ghazipur cremation ground, said that while the crematorium does not provide storage facilities for the Covid infected bodies, there are NGOs and citizens’ group who step in.“Most people prefer collecting the remains of their loved ones themselves, but where families don’t turn up, there are NGO volunteers who pick the remains, and then immerse them as per ritual,” Singh said.Madhukar Trehan, chairperson of the Shiv Shakti Sangathan, a volunteer group helping collect the abandoned remains of Covid infected bodies at the Ghazipur and Mulla Colony crematoriums, said “Picking ashes is a very important part of the last rites of the dead. Every day our volunteers assist the crematorium staff in collecting the ashes of bodies, whose families have not turned up for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abandoned-remains-of-covid-dead-bodies-pile-up-at-crematoriums-in-delhi-as-families-fear-infection-101621017060734.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||After several days of delay, Delhi govt to begin distributing free rations||The Delhi government on Friday told its officers to start distributing fully subsidised rations for May and June to the city’s 7.2 million ration beneficiaries, a programme that has been delayed due to the Covid-19 surge in the Capital, adding to the hardships of thousands of families amid a lockdown that has deprived several of their daily incomes.The government said in a statement on Friday: “Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain today convened a high-level meeting to review the distribution of free ration to all Public Distribution System (PDS) cardholders of Delhi under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 and under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY) for May 2021 and June 2021… During the meeting, the minister directed officers to ensure that ration distribution is carried out in a smooth, convenient and transparent manner.A senior government official said the distribution of free ration for two months allotted under NFSA is likely to start from Saturday, and the additional ration allotted under PMGKAY is scheduled to be distributed from Monday.Approximately 1.78 million households in Delhi hold ration cards, which cater to 7.2 million beneficiaries. Rations are distributed through a network of 2,000-odd shops.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 4 said the state will give free ration for two months to card holders in the light of the ongoing lockdown. A similar scheme was announced during the lockdown last year as well.Ration in Delhi is usually distributed in a week-long window between 27th of the previous month and 3rd of the concerned month – which means the distribution of rations for May have been delayed by more than 11 days, which a senior government official attributed to the unprecedented fourth wave of the pandemic.“The decreasing number of cases and the fall in positivity rate suggest that the situation is slowly getting stable. However, while collecting ration, people will still have to take utmost precautions,” said the official, who asked not to be named.“We are struggling for food. For the last few days, we have been going to a nearby shelter where meals are distributed for free. But that entails an immense amount of risk in terms of getting infected by the virus. We have two children,” said Ramesh Prajapati, a 45-year-old factory worker in west Delhi’s Mayapuri industrial area, who along with his wife Anita, a domestic worker, have been without any stable income for around three weeks now.Right to Food campaign member Anjali Bhardwaj said, “Lockdown was imposed in Delhi nearly a month ago, which has resulted in cessation of income earning opportunities for the working poor. They have been struggling to afford two square meals a day for themselves and their children. In such a situation, it is shocking and absolutely unacceptable that the Delhi government has delayed the distribution of ration for the month of May, forcing people to buy grains in the open market.”Shailendra Kumar, president of Delhi public distribution system welfare association, said “Distribution of ration for May has witnessed immense delay causing hardships to large number of people. Now that ration will finally be distributed, the government has to ensure that all protocols are in place for safety and security of beneficiaries and ration shop owners and managers. Ration shops should be given PPE and safety gears too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-several-days-of-delay-delhi-govt-to-begin-distributing-free-rations-101621017059985.html
15-05-2021||Delhi||Oxygen concentrator case: High court refuses interim relief to Navneet Kalra||The Delhi high court on Friday refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Khan Chacha owner Navneet Kalra in connection with the alleged black marketing and hoarding of oxygen concentrators.“I am persuaded by the reasons given by the trial court which is a valid ground for me not to grant any interim protection now,” said the single-judge bench of justice Subramonium Prasad.He posted the matter for further hearing to Tuesday (May 18), after additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for the police, sought more time to file a reply and argue the case.Raju also opposed any interim relief to Kalra by arguing that the present case was not one where such a protection can be given.In recent searches by the Delhi Police, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra.Demand for oxygen concentrators had swelled during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital as many hospitals had ran out of medical oxygen as the number of critically ill patients rose. Such concentrators, which can derive 80-90% pure oxygen from ambient air, was also a crucial part of the medical supplies and aids provided by many foreign countries to help India’s efforts against the pandemic.Also, investigators said they possess evidence to prove that the oxygen concentrators, which were bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, were being sold for prices upwards of ₹75,000.Kalra has been on the run since the equipment were seized from his restaurants, according to the police. The police said he could not be traced despite searches being conducted in Delhi and adjoining states such as Uttarakhand.On Thursday, a city court had denied him anticipatory bail observing that the allegations against him were serious and his custody is required to “unearth the entire conspiracy”. Subsequently, he moved an anticipatory bail plea before the high court, which heard the matter late Thursday evening and had posted the matter to Friday for further proceedings.On Friday, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikas Pahwa, who appeared for Kalra, sought interim relief for their client till the matter was heard on Tuesday (May 18). Singhvi argued that this was a case of harassment and punishment cannot be given to a person before fixation of price of an essential commodity.He also contended that the prosecution’s claim that the oxygen concentrators were of substandard quality. He referred to the police’s reply in another case, where they had told the court that the seized equipment had been given to Covid care centres.On Thursday, Singhvi had said that his client bought the concentrators from Matrix Cellular after paying GST and the payment was made via credit card, therefore, there was nothing clandestine about the purchase of the equipment. He had said that Kalra sold the equipment within the labelled price that Matrix, which imported the concentrators, had fixedFollowing arguments, the court posted the matter to May 18 for further hearing..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-concentrator-case-high-court-refuses-interim-relief-to-navneet-kalra-101621016999973.html
15-05-2021||Pune||Like a bridge over troubled water... friends in deed||Fear of getting infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus has left a severe impact on people’s mind, and even relatives are refusing to come forward to help patients. While on the other hand, friends are extending help without any hesitation.Many of those living as tenants or staying in paying guest accommodation (PG) in the city are facing trouble after testing positive for the virus.Ashok Rungta, who stays alone in a rented room at Wakad, was caught in a fix when he was told to get admitted at the New Jijamata Hospital, Pimpri, after testing positive for the virus.“I called my cousin who stays in Aundh, with his family, so that he can complete formalities at the hospital. But he politely refused, due to the fear of infecting his family and himself,” explains Rungta, who spent six days in the hospital before getting discharged.During tough times, Rungta’s friend-cum-colleague working at Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Bhosari, Vishal Diwanji stepped up by providing home-cooked food thrice a day and also handled all the administrative procedures of the hospitals.“I followed all the norms while visiting the hospital. My family members know Ashok for the last two years and did not hesitate to help. Even now, we are providing him food from home as he has been told to take rest for 15 days,” said Diwanji.Sunil Lakhan, a watch guard at the garden near Dange Chowk, performs his duty from 8 am to 3 pm and then goes to Aditya Birla Hospital to help his neighbours, who are taking treatment for Covid.“Sunil sir and Sunita ma’am (Rajan) have supported me and my family in the last two years. For the last five days, their kids who tested negative are living with us. We provide them tiffin and whatever they need in the hospital,” said Lakhan.Sunil adds, “I thought my brother would take care of my eight-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter and take them to their house in Baner, but they denied help due to the fear of getting infected. I was not expecting this since my children are Covid negative. Glad my neighbour is helping me.”Meanwhile, elderly couple Prasad and Urmila Girme, who were advised home quarantine after suffering from mild symptoms were offered help by their maid Rachana Shete, who has stayed back in their house at Karvenagar.“Their son stays out of Pune so I could get myself accommodated in one of the rooms. I am happy that their second test came negative,” said Shete.“My sister who stays on Paud road could not help me as her son was reluctant to deliver tiffin at my place. I am blessed to have a maid like Rachana,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fighting-covid-supportive-friends-stand-through-thick-and-thin-101621000439092.html
15-05-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 in Gurugram: Positivity rate dips below 20% after five-week surge||The district on Thursday reported 2,159 new Covid-19 cases that took the test positivity rate (proportion of positives out of the sample tested) below 20% after almost a month in the district, according to the health department data.Even as the active case count continues to remain below 3,000 over the past few days, the health department and hospitals confirmed 17 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll in a day at the district level that took the total toll to 638.The dip comes at a time when the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT–PCR) test has declined in the last two days, compared to the number of tests administered on April 16, when the positivity rate was almost 19%. Officials and experts claimed that the lockdown has led to the declining positivity rate.Also Read| Vaccinations for 18-44 suspended, 8K doses left for 45+ in GurugramAccording to the district health bulletin, in the last two days, over 6,000 RT-PCR tests were administered along with 4,500 rapid antigen tests and on Thursday, the positivity rate reached nearly 19.5%. At the state level too, the positivity rate decreased to 32.5%, which is still the fifth-highest in the country.At the district level, the total tally of active cases reached 30,352, of whom 2,292 are currently admitted to hospitals, while 27,981 are in home isolation.According to health department officials, the impact of the surge is seen on deaths, which, they said often increase a few days after the peak. “The surge in deaths is expected as the district has seen a spike in new infections in the last few weeks. Although cases are stabilised now, the impact of surge can be seen on deaths. It fluctuates between one and two per cent of the currently active cases,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.At 5,024, the district reported the highest number of cases on April 29, after which an ongoing night curfew was extended to a total lockdown. Currently, the lockdown, which is labelled a Mahamari Alert, Surakhshit Haryana by the state government, is going to last at least till May 17 to control the transmission of infection.Containment zonesTo control the surge, at least 165 containment zones under 27 urban primary health centres have also been formed. It has declined from 176 zones created in the last week of April, as cases have dipped. Currently, the maximum number of containment zones are under the Tigra urban primary health centre (UPHC), which covers sectors 42 to 57, including Golf Course Road.Also Read| Uttarakhand, Haryana, Bihar now among states with highest Covid-19 deathsAccording to the containment zone order issued by the district administration, there are at least 19 containment zones under Chanderlok UPHC, covering Sushant Lok, 15 under Patel Nagar, 14 in Nathupur, which covers DLF Phase-3, and nine each in Badhshahpur and Chauma.In densely populated areas of Firoj Gandhi Colony, Kasan and Wazirabad have seven containment zones each, while there are six zones each in Rajiv Nagar, Bhangrola and Fazilpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/positivity-rate-dips-below-20-after-five-week-surge-101620927232766.html

Due to this, three major projects of Dwarka Expressway, Delhi-Mumbai highway and Gurugram-Sohna flyover have been affected, said officials.“Labour force has reduced in the past few weeks, even before the lockdown was announced in Gurugram. We have tried to assure them that all Covid-19 related safety measures are being taken at project sites, but still, labourers are continuing to go back to their villages due to various reasons. So far, 20% of the workforce has reduced in the city,” said an NHAI official, requesting anonymity.The official cited above said that delay in completion dates of the projects cannot be estimated at present as Covid-19 cases are still increasing, but work is being managed with the available workforce.Meanwhile, infrastructure projects of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) — including the four key road development projects underway at Huda City Centre, Mahavir Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk and Umang Bharadwaj Chowk — that are scheduled to be completed and inaugurated by August this year, are now likely to get delayed.Sunil Kundu, the superintending engineer of the Infrastructure-I division of GMDA, said, “Our main projects like the underpass at Huda City Centre and new flyovers that were being constructed in the city have been affected due to the lockdown and lack of labour. But we are managing with in-house workforce available with us. The projects that were scheduled to get completed by mid-2021 will get extended by another few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/infra-projects-hit-due-to-reduced-workforce-101620927172069.html
