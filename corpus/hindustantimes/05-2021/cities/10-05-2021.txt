The high court has acted on a plea by Chanchal Singh, an assistant professor in the department of physiology and biochemistry at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana. The court was told that the petitioner is a Covid-19 warrior, who acquired kidney disease when he was posted for virus testing at Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, Ludhiana, in November 2020. Suffering from chronic kidney failure, for which the cause is unclear, the petitioner is undergoing dialysis at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, and Max Super Specialty Hospital, Mohali. The court was told that he has been enrolled in the list of kidney transplant patients by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education Research, Chandigarh, and directions be issued to the authorities concerned for getting his transplant done at the earliest under the Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant Scheme. The petitioner has argued that as he is a Covid-19 warrior, he should be given priority over other patients. The Centre, Punjab government and PGIMER have been asked to respond by May 24, whether there are any specific instructions or policies for providing such preferential treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/can-covid-warriors-be-treated-on-priority-hc-asks-centre-punjab-101620670520018.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||RWAs complain over biomedical waste pile-up, raise health concerns||At least 52 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) submitted a joint complaint to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the district administration on Sunday over the poor collection of waste from Covid-affected households in their respective areas over the past few weeks and also raised health concerns due to piled up biomedical waste.The RWAs, under a collective front called RWAs United, also alerted the MCG and the administration via social media on the matter. They complained that the workers of Ecogreen, the civic body’s agency for door-to-door collection of waste, visit their areas infrequently and when they do visit, collect only 20-30% of the accumulated biomedical waste due to the limited capacity of their vehicles.Officials of Ecogreen said that they have recently increased the total number of biomedical waste collection vehicles from eight to 12 to handle higher capacities.“Dedicated Ecogreen vehicles are going to different corners of the city on a daily basis for collecting biomedical waste from Covid-19 houses. They are often making multiple trips to one location. Numbers of Ecogreen supervisors have been shared by the MCG so that residents can reach out to our staff and accordingly waste is being collected from such places on a priority basis,” said Sanjeev Sharma, the official spokesperson for Ecogreen.In the letter to MCG and administration, the RWAs of Vatika City, Orchid Petals, Tatvam Villas, Princeton Estate, Unitech Harmony, Ridgewood, Central Park 2, Uniworld Garden, Vipul Greens, Omaxe Nile and Malibu Condominium, alleged that their areas were the worst affected.“Until last month, Ecogreen vehicles were coming to the society twice a week. But over the last four weeks, they came once every 10-15 days and as a result, there was a huge pile of biomedical garbage accumulating inside the society. Even when the vehicles arrived, of the nine 900-litre dustbins reserved for biomedical waste, they were only able to empty three or four dustbins at a go as their vehicles ran out of space,” said Jyoti Ahuja, joint secretary, Vatika City RWA.Ahuja said that following their complaint, the MCG reached out to them and sent a waste collection truck to clear out the waste on Monday.However, representatives of RWAs United said on Monday that of the 11 residential areas where the situation of biomedical waste is severe, waste had only been cleared from Vatika City.“The remaining RWAs are still waiting for Ecogreen vehicles to arrive. The situation of biomedical waste has been severe over the past four to five weeks, Ecogreen vehicles are collecting waste once every seven to 10 days, and when they come they are only able to lift 20-30% of the total biomedical waste load. In the interim, balconies of Covid-19 houses are getting filled with biomedical waste and people are running out of space to store them,” said DIG (retd) of the Indian Coast Guard Siddharth S Sood, president, Harmony Apartment Owners Welfare Association (HOWA).In residential societies and condominiums, two in-house staff collect biomedical waste from each floor. One person is responsible for collecting it while the other person has to ensure that the area is immediately sanitised. Subsequently, the collected waste is either directly dumped in the Ecogreen vehicles or dropped at a designated area. In June last year, the MCG had issued a public release stating that to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and cope with logistical difficulties, Ecogreen vehicles will lift biomedical waste from each of its 35 wards on two fixed days in a week.On April 21, amid complaints from residents, the MCG issued a public release reiterating that Ecogreen has eight dedicated vehicles for this task, two for each of its four zones. The MCG had also given the mobile numbers of supervisors of these vehicles so that residents could contact them directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rwas-complain-over-biomedical-waste-pile-up-raise-health-concerns-101620670160574.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||100-bed facility at Tau Devi Lal stadium to start in a week, aid in treating cases from rural areas||A 100-bed makeshift Covid-19 facility being set up at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium is likely to be operational within a week, which will aid in handling patients from rural areas that are witnessing a gradual surge in infections, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner said on Monday.“The construction of the facility has been going on at a fast pace and will be ready within six to seven days. Medical supplies have already been procured and health staff is also being arranged to run the facility. It will ease the Covid-19 burden and mitigate the current crisis, especially emerging in rural areas that lack proper healthcare infrastructure,” said Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner.In rural areas falling under Pataudi, Farrukhnagar and Sohna, the test positivity rate (the proportion of positives out of the sample tested) has gone up to 21%. Subdivisional hospitals in these blocks lack the infrastructure to handle moderate to severely ill Covid-19 cases. Even the existing healthcare infrastructure in the city is under immense pressure in catering to patients from urban areas. Until Monday, at least 2,402 critically ill patients were admitted to the Covid-19 hospitals in the city.According to Garg, since many people from villages cannot afford treatment in private hospitals, the new facility will help in providing timely treatment to patients from rural areas and will also cater to the urban population. The facility will be run and managed by the district administration.The facility will have at least 10 ventilator beds and 10 beds in a high dependency unit, along with 80 beds with oxygen support systems. “The administration has been working on setting up an oxygen plant at the facility so that we are prepared for the next wave,” said Garg.The district health department has sent a request for hiring at least 84 health workers, comprising 60 staff nurses, 16 medical officers, three physicians and five anaesthetists to run the facility. “The list has already been shared with the deputy commissioner,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The facility was earlier planned to come up in Sector 27 but faced resistance from residents of the area, following which the district administration shifted it to Tau Devi Lal stadium.On Monday, more than 80 workers were involved in setting up the makeshift facility. The construction in-charge, who requested not to be named, said, “Within a week of the announcement, the basic infrastructure has been set up. Now, electricity, air conditioning and water support systems are being arranged. In all likelihood, it will be ready in seven to 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/100bed-facility-at-tau-devi-lal-stadium-to-start-in-a-week-aid-in-treating-cases-from-rural-areas-101620670159478.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||RTI activist, sons arrested for duping banks of ₹15 crore||A Gurugram-based RTI activist and his family members were booked on Monday for allegedly duping two banks of ₹15 crore by taking multiple loans against a property by transferring it among the family members, the police said.Right to Information (RTI) activist Harinder Dhingra and his two sons were arrested on Monday, while his wife, daughter-in-law and grandson were issued a notice asking them to join the investigation, the police said.According to the police, the family members attached the house, constructed over 500 square yards in DLF Phase-1, in 2003 for a business loan of around ₹3 crore. When the bank issued a notice over the non-payment of the loan and filed for the attachment of property, he allegedly transferred the property to his elder son, Prashant, and took another loan for ₹8 crore, by mortgaging the property with another bank. He, however, allegedly failed to repay the second loan as well.The police said when the second bank filed for attachment of the property, Dhingra’s younger son, Tarun, filed a case claiming a stake in the property. The family is accused of cheating the banks and keeping courts in the dark about the pending loans while seeking a transfer of property through court.The police received a complaint from a resident of Malibu Town on April 16 against the family and after investigation, registered a case under the Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468, 471 and 120B (criminal conspiracy) on Monday. However, the police did not disclose how the complainant was affected.Dhingra and his two sons, Prashant and Tarun, were arrested while the rest of the family members were issued notices.Dhingra and his wife, Poonam, purchased the 500 square yard property in DLF Phase-1 in 2001. In 2003, Poonam and Prashant allegedly took a loan for their export firm from a bank against the property. In 2004, the loan of around ₹3 crore was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) by the bank, which filed a case before the debt recovery tribunal (DRT) in New Delhi for attachment of the property in lieu of the pending loan amount.Karan Goel, an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), said to save the property from being attached, Prashant approached a district court seeking a claim in the property. “In November 2006, they reached a compromise at the Lok Adalat and transferred the property to Prashant Dhingra. The bank could not attach the property as its ownership changed. The family members had conspired to dupe banks and did not disclose the facts before the court,” he said.In 2007, Prashant mortgaged the property with another bank for a loan of ₹8 crore for his export firm and this loan was also declared an NPA in 2008. The bank issued a notice for recovery of ₹10 crore (including interest) and approached the DRT Chandigarh seeking attachment of the property.To allegedly avoid attachment of the property, Tarun filed a case before a Gurugram court challenging the order of the Lok Adalat decision of 2006 and staked a claim in the property. The court stayed the 2006 order of Lok Adalat, following which it was challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court in February 2016, and the order of the Lok Adalat was overturned. The property was transferred back to Harinder Dhingra and Poonam.Goel said as a case for attachment of property was pending before the court, Dhingra forged papers and transferred the property to Tarun Dhingra and his grandson Garv, who is Prashant’s son, in December 2016. “All of them live in the same house and kept transferring property among themselves after taking loans from banks,” he said.“During the investigation, it was found that Dhingra and his family duped the bank as per plan and they took loans that were never repaid and kept on transferring the property to avoid attachment,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rti-activist-sons-arrested-for-duping-banks-of-15-crore-101620670160056.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Real estate developers worry slow vaccination may adversely impact sector||While the lockdown has already impacted many construction sites after workers preferred to return to their native places, the slow vaccination process has added worry to the real estate developers who feel the inadequate supply may further affect the sector. “Under the second wave of lockdown which has hit us very badly, all sectors have been affected including real estate. Vaccination is the only solution and if vaccination drives speeds up, then we will soon see near to normalcy by the year end,” said Satish Magar, chairman of Credai National. He was speaking at the webinar organized by Credai Maharashtra to guide developers during pandemic.Those present on the occasion were Credai national vice president Shantilal Kataria and Anant Rajegaonkar, Credai national advisory board chairman Jitendra Thakkar, Credai Maharashtra president Sunil Furde, secretary Sunil Kotwal along with 854 members of Credai Maharashtra along with many developers from across the country.In Pune, as many as 14.5 lakh persons have been given the first dose so far while the process has slowed down in the past few days due to inadequate supply of vaccines. “Many home buyers in Maharashtra, who are caught in the second wave of Covid should be given a four-month extension for property registration and should not be penalized after the extension,” expressed Kataria. “Construction workers, who are the backbone of the construction sector, are currently returning to their villages. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the construction on time. This sector is facing endless difficulties. Today, there are more than 12 lakh registered workers in Maharashtra and about 250 businesses are directly and indirectly dependent on this sector. It is our role to co-operate fully with the state government to prevent layoffs”, he added.“The honourable high court has proposed the state government to consider a strict lockout to prevent the further outbreak of Covid-19 but if this is implemented it will have an adverse effect on the construction sector. If the labourers go back to their hometowns, then there will be a delay of several months to complete the projects,” Furde said “Not only are the developers supplying groceries and other necessities to construction workers, if there is sufficient availability of vaccines, the Credai will soon undertake a comprehensive campaign to vaccinate the workers in proper coordination with the state government.” added Furde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/real-estate-developers-worry-slow-vaccination-may-adversely-impact-sector-101620669739395.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement nears end, but no clarity on what Centre owes to Punjab||Wheat procurement is nearing its end this Rabi season in Punjab, but the Centre has still not released the cost sheet on what it owes to the state government.A cost sheet is a document that confirms the accruals, such as rural development fund, market fee and labour and transport charges to be paid to the state for procurement. Postponed due to the Covid-19 surge, procurement in the state began on April 10. Against the projections for 130 lakh tonne procurement, the four state agencies — Pungrain, Punsup, warehousing corporation and Markfed — and the Centre’s Food Corporation of India have so far procured at least 129.25 lakh tonne wheat and made ₹22,500 crore payments to the farmers. However, there is no clarity on various taxes the state agencies charge from the buyer of foodgrain, ie, the Centre. The procurement figures are expected to go up further in this week. Sources in the food department said the payment for gunny bags supplied by arhtiyas (commission agents) have been made after the Centre’s clearance as procurement was hit due to their shortage. Payments to contractors stuckThe cost sheet is released by the Centre’s food and public distribution ministry. The same ministry mandated direct benefit transfer (DBT) of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers, which was implemented despite the opposition from arhtiyas. Earlier, these agents were a link between the government and farmers, and the entire payment was routed through them. “Why can’t the ministry release the cost sheet when they have forced the DBT upon us?” said an official of the state food and civil supplies department, who didn’t want to be named. Sources in the department said that all other states engaged in wheat procurement have also reported delay in cost sheet. After opposition by arhtiyas, the Punjab government managed to bring them on board by making minor changes in public finance management system and allowed them to view payments transferred to farmers attached to them. “In the past, the Centre used to release provisional sheet before the start of every procurement season, but this time the season is almost over, but there are no signs of the document. It is very important, as without it, all expenditures made by the state government in transportation of wheat from mandis to godowns and the labour involved will be deemed illegal, halting the disbursal,” said the official.According to another senior official in the department, MSP has been disbursed through the cash credit limit received at the start of the procurement. “But for making other payments, we need clearance from the Centre, and so far payments to the tune of ₹2,000 to be made to transporters and labour contractors are pending,” he said. The Centre has fixed ₹46 per quintal as dami (commission) to be paid to arhtiyas, but in the absence of the cost sheet, even that can’t be transferred into their accounts. RDF, market fee and moreThe Centre has also failed to provide any clarity on the rural development fund (RDF) to the state government. During paddy procurement in the last Kharif season, the Centre provisionally allowed the state to charge 1% RDF, instead of 3%, according to provisions of its Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act.RDF goes to the rural development board led by the chief minister and is used for development in villages.On being asked for a justification for charging 3%, the state has sent all facts and figures to the Centre, explaining the fund’s importance, but so far there is no response, and the issue remains unclear in the current procurement season. The cost sheet will also give clarity on market fee (3%) that goes into the kitty of the mandi board that manages 1,850 mandis for procurement of wheat and paddy in Rabi and Kharif seasons. Principal secretary, food and civil supplies, Punjab, KAP Sinha said he would take up the matter with the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-nears-end-but-no-clarity-on-what-centre-owes-to-punjab-101620669562857.html

Under the banner of Dron Rehdi Patri Feri committee of Gurugram, street vendors submitted a copy of the letter to the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, seeking financial aid of ₹7,500 per month.Yogesh Kumar, the president of the committee, said, “The government has allowed even small restaurants to operate for deliveries, but no provisions have been made for the street vendors who depend on daily earnings. At present, we are able to manage food, using the ration we had purchased for our stalls, but there is no option available to us for medical expenses or paying the school fee of our children.”“We are requesting the government to allow us to function so that at least packed food can be delivered from our stalls, which will help us in earning some money. If the government does not allow us to start our shops, then we request them to pay ₹7,500 to each street vendor in the district,” added Kumar.At present, there are around 50,000 street vendors associated with the committee of which “around 40% have gone back to their villages as it is difficult to manage major expenses like rent, without daily earnings.”Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that as the matter was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, the letter was forwarded to them.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Last year, after the lockdown, the government had started a scheme where street vendors could take loans of ₹10,000 on low interest rates from banks to set up their work again and the same scheme is continuing. We will be looking into this matter again and see that all possible help is given to them.”Rajendra Singh Saroha, the general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said, “Since the lockdown was imposed, I have been getting calls daily from street vendors and daily wage earners seeking help as they are not able to manage daily expenses. Keeping the situation in mind, we have written to the chief minister seeking financial assistance so that the street vendors can sustain themselves.”Ashok Kumar, who worked as a helper at a food stall in Sector 40 market, said, “The lockdown was imposed at the starting of the month, so the owner did not pay me last month’s salary as he himself did not have money. Now, with the lockdown being extended, there is no clarity on when I would get paid and without money, it is difficult to stay here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/street-vendors-seek-financial-aid-from-government-101620669563306.html

MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh drafted an order in this regard on April 29, a copy of which is with HT, before he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Singh’s order was circulated by the MCG internally on Monday and subsequently, made public. He stated in the order that the civic body had been receiving complaints from the public that caretakers of the cremation grounds in MCG limits are overcharging different amounts for cremation within MCG limits. “Therefore, to bring uniformity in the fee/charges for cremation of a human corpse at different cremation grounds..... I do hereby prohibit the charging of a fee beyond a sum of ₹5,500 per cremation, including the charges for wood, the fee of a priest, and sanitation charges,” the order stated.Singh further directed the in-charges of cremation grounds to submit a daily report to the MCG office about information, including the amount charged for each cremation. The order was issued under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, and further stated that any person found violating these orders will be prosecuted under the relevant provisions of the act. “At certain places, we received complaints that the in-charges were asking over ₹15,000-20,000 for doing one cremation. Hence, a standard fee has been introduced and the rates will be displayed across all the four major crematoriums as well,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The four major crematoriums falling under the MCG area at Madanpuri, near Pataudi Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, Sector 32 near Medanta Hospital, and at Carterpuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-fixes-fee-of-5-500-per-cremation-including-covid-19-deaths-101620669561683.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||Rural areas hit by Covid-19, positivity rate remained over 21% in April||The second wave of Covid-19 has hit rural areas too, officials of the district health department said, with the test positivity rate (proportion of positives out of the samples tested) reaching 21.8% in April, as per the department’s data. Seven high-risk areas have also been identified, where mass surveillance by conducting door-to-door rapid antigen tests started from May 8.“The second Covid-19 wave has penetrated rural areas of the district. Through aggressive and timely testing, we are trying to control the transmission. At least 138 teams have been formed who will do antigen testing in seven rural areas where test positivity rate has been high,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.The worst-affected rural blocks of the district are under Sohna and Pataudi, said officials, pointing to an increase in cases in Bhondsi, Palra, Kasan, Bhangrola, Bhangrola, Badshahpur and Farrukhnagar.The health department data shows that in April, the test positivity rate was 16.6% in Bhorakalan, 19.3% in Bhondsi, 17.7% in Farrukhnagar and 14% in Mandpura. Kasan primary health centre (PHC) in Pataudi and Palra PHC in Sohna showed the highest positivity rate, of almost 21%, officials said.These high-risk areas are inching closer to a positivity rate of almost 26% that is reported in large outbreak regions of the city. Gauging the seriousness of the matter, antigen testing started in rural areas on May 8.Of 2,194 rapid antigen tests administered on May 8, at least 33 tested positive while on May 9, at least 25 people were confirmed positive for Covid-19 out of the 1,169 who were tested. Antigen test delivers results within 15-20 minutes but has lower specificity to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus despite people exhibiting symptomsAccording to health officials, people in rural areas do not come forward for testing compared to those in urban areas. “Therefore, antigen testing is one of the ways to control the spread before it creates a crisis-like situation in the coming time. Most of these areas have a mix of urban and rural populations, leading to faster transmission of coronavirus. Many people commute every day to the city for work or other tasks. All these factors have led to the Covid-19 spike in rural areas,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer.In May, at least 1,392 new infections have been confirmed in Badshahpur, 1,552 in Bhangrola, 305 in Kasan, 374 in Farrukhnagar and 281 in Bhorakalan. On the other hand, over 5,521 cases have been reported from urban areas of the new Gurugram under Tigra urban primary health centre until May 9. Likewise, in areas under Chanderlok UPHC, which covers Sushant Lok and adjoining societies, about 4,832 cases have been reported this month, whereas 2,970 cases have been reported in Wazirabad and Sector 56 in nine days of the month, said officials.On Monday, 2,794 cases were reported in the district, taking the total count of active cases to 33,185. As many as 12 deaths were also reported, taking the toll to 599.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rural-areas-hit-by-covid-19-positivity-rate-remained-over-21-in-april-101620669559441.html
10-05-2021||Other||Oxygen supply to private hospitals increased||Officials of the health department, as well as hospital administrations, said that the oxygen supply has stabilised in the district, with fewer SOS calls, an increase in oxygen cylinders and reduced waiting time for oxygen beds and cylinder refills pointing to a move in the right direction.The district is receiving nearly 46 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen at present, against a demand of 60 MT, district administration officials said.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that they are regularly getting oxygen supply from Rourkela and Angul in Odisha, Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and neighbouring Panipat, following which the situation has stabilised. “We are getting nearly 46 MT of oxygen every day and we need 60 MT to meet the demand. The process is streamlined and the district administration is monitoring the demand and supply directly to ensure families (of Covid-19 patients) do not have to arrange for oxygen cylinders,” he said.Private hospitals that were receiving five to 10 cylinders earlier are now getting as many as 50 cylinders, as they no longer have to shuttle between different plants to get oxygen.Dipankar Sethi, general manager (operations) of Sethi Hospital in Model Town, said that they are receiving at least 19 oxygen cylinders per day and the supply is regular. “Earlier, we hardly used to get six cylinders and were facing challenges to admit Covid-19 patients. Now, with the regular supply, the staff are focussing more on the Covid ward and only one vehicle is used to get supply from the designated station,” he said.The queue at all refilling station has also been streamlined and the stations are divided between the hospitals to avoid confusions.SP Yadav, the managing director of Pushpanjali Hospital in Civil Lines, said that their quota has been increased to 50 cylinders a day. “We have 31 Covid beds and are getting regular oxygen supply. The families do not have to struggle to arrange for the same,” he said.Garg said that the demand is rising exponentially as the number of serious patients is also rising. “We are distributing as per the demand and also to ensure there is no distress situation at any hospital. In case of any emergency, we have directed the hospitals to get in touch with me so that oxygen can be sent to them without any delay,” he said.Anil Khatana, the head of operations at W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said that they have 37 Covid beds and hardly used to get 20 oxygen cylinders earlier but the same has now increased to 100. “The district administration increased our quota to 100 on Monday. More than three vehicles used to run to different locations to get oxygen and used to wait for more than seven hours to get them refilled. Now, we get supply from only one station and there is no waiting period also. We also used to ask patients to arrange for cylinders, which is no more the case,” he said.The regional transport authority, in a bid to streamline oxygen supply in the district, converted 12 nitrogen and argon tankers into oxygen tankers to enable transportation of oxygen from two plants in Odisha.Officials said that the increased supply of oxygen over the past two days has helped in reducing the number of distress calls from hospitals.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, the director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, there are nearly 80 Covid patients admitted to the hospital, for whom they are getting 70 oxygen cylinders every day. “The refilling stations which were demanding exorbitant rates are controlled by the district administration and now, there is no struggle to get cylinders refilled. The staff which was busy getting oxygen waiting in long queues are now taking care of Covid-19 patients and regularly updating district administration regarding the oxygen supply,” he said.Garg appealed to hospitals not getting a regular oxygen supply to contact him for a quick resolution of the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-supply-to-private-hospitals-increased-101620669560017.html

Officials said that wedding processions, including baraat, are banned and ceremonies should be held only at homes or in courts.Besides the additional restrictions, the state administration, this time, has allowed tree cutting operations of the forest department and Haryana Forest Development Corporation during the lockdown for meeting fuelwood requirement of the municipal corporations and district administrations.“The extended lockdown period will be observed as Mahamari Alert- Surakshit Haryana in compliance with the state government’s directive. Covid-19 cases in the district will start plateauing after May 13 as the impact of lockdown could be seen in Delhi-NCR now,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram.With Gurugram likely to reach its second Covid-19 wave peak before May 15, Garg said that the ongoing lockdown from May 3 has already started showing its impact.On May 9, Haryana chief secretary Vijay Vardhan issued an order on the extension of restrictions, which was imposed from May 3 till May 10, after the state home minister Anil Vij had tweeted: “Mahamari Alert / Surkshit Haryana announced from 10 May to 17 May. Stringent measures will be taken to contain the spread of Corona in Haryana”.Under the previous lockdown, wedding functions could be conducted with a ceiling of 30 persons in indoor spaces and 50 persons in open spaces, if granted permissions by the district administration. Even for funerals and cremation, at least 20 people were allowed. However, officials said that the cap was decreased for stricter enforcement of safety protocols.As per the current lockdown regulations, all educational, training and coaching institutions, cinema halls, malls, shopping complexes, gyms and religious places will continue to remain shut.No restriction has been imposed on the movement of domestic helps, cooks, drivers, nurses, medical attendees and caregivers to senior citizens and specially-abled persons.Hotels and restaurants including those within malls will remain open only for home deliveries and takeaways until 10m. Roadside dhabas and food stalls have been allowed to provide parcels for takeaway and delivery services.Movement of private vehicles will be allowed only for emergency services vaccinations, hospital visits, veterinary care and getting essential commodities.Passengers returning from airports, and railway and bus stations are also allowed to move.

While the second dose of Covishield is to be taken within four to eight weeks of the first jab, the interval for Covaxin is four to six weeks.However, due to the non-availability of doses, especially of Covaxin, many beneficiaries are unable to book an online slot or are being sent back from government vaccination centres without getting the second jab, according to ground reports from many parts of the state.“More than 200 eligible teachers and staff members of our school were administered Covaxin in March and April, but many are still awaiting their second dose,” says Sukhpreet Kaur, who teaches at a private school in Amritsar. Kaur says she is trying to book a slot for the second dose, which is due for the past two weeks, but no slot for Covaxin is available for the next seven days at any of the hospitals in Amritsar. “I also visited the civil hospital, but to no avail,” she says.In Ludhiana, Kiran Malik, 67, who got her first Covishield dose on April 14, has been unsuccessfully trying to book a slot for the second shot on May 26. “At a time when it is so risky to step out of our houses, how can the authorities expect us to visit the centres and try our luck with on-the-spot registrations,” says her husband, BL Malik. A 73-year-old woman from Amritsar, who is not willing to be named, claims she visited the local civil hospital twice, but failed to get the second Covishield dose that is due for the past three weeks. “I took my first dose in the second week of March. I have visited the civil hospital for my second dose twice, but due to limited stock of vaccines, I didn’t get the jab,” she says, while adding that instead of extending the drive to others, the first preference should be given to beneficiaries eligible for the second dose. Only 1.64 lakh got second dose in past week In the past one week, only 1.64 lakh people have been administered the second dose in Punjab, as compared to 2.44 lakh who got their first shot.In all, around 6 lakh people have completed their vaccination cycle, which is just 18% of the people inoculated with at least one dose. Among these 6 lakh people who have received both the doses, 2.25 lakh are health care and frontline warriors while 3.75 lakh are other citizens in the 45+ age group.Dr Puneet Juneja, district nodal officer, vaccines, Ludhiana, said that due to limited stock, the department is not scheduling online appointments. “We release a list of centres where residents can get vaccinated daily,” he said.Though claiming that many people, especially frontline workers, are willingly skipping the second shot, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, admitted that the second dose of vaccine, especially Covaxin, is being delayed due to limited stock.”The vaccination drive in Punjab picked up the pace in April, after it was opened for all people above 45 years of age. So far, the state health department has administered 2.34 lakh doses of Covaxin, but we have received only 75,000 doses for the second shot, which are insufficient,” he said, while adding that around 15 lakh beneficiaries will get eligible for their second dose, of both the vaccines, in Punjab by May 31.

10-05-2021||Gurugram||Ventilator beds increased in city hospitals||Officials said that the number of ventilator beds in private hospitals has increased after pending orders were supplied this month. At least 20 of the 43 Covid-19 hospitals HT spoke to on Monday confirmed that they have increased the number of ventilators beds, by 280 in total at the 20 facilities.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that private hospitals are increasing ventilator beds as the number of patients has increased following the Covid-19 surge. “Critical patients need immediate medical support systems to prevent fatalities. This is a medical emergency and private hospitals should increase the capacity of ICU or ventilator beds,” he said.Garg said that nine new ventilators and life support systems were installed in government hospitals, including four ventilators at Civil Hospital in Sector 10.Garg said that at least 10% of all hospital beds must be equipped with ventilators. “The demand is increasing with the number of cases and the situation will improve within a week as more and more hospitals are procuring ventilators,” he said.At present, only 2% of the total beds have ventilator facilities, officials of the health department said. At present, there are around 350 ventilator beds in the district.A ventilator is a life-support apparatus that breathes for a patient who is physically unable to breathe or is breathing insufficiently. Private hospitals charge ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 per day for a ventilator.Anil Khatana, the head of operations at W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said they only had one ventilator bed for Covid patients earlier, which has been increased to five at present, with four more in the pipeline. “The price of a ventilator has increased from ₹4.5 lakh to ₹9 lakh in the last two months. The number of patients is increasing and ventilators are required,” he said.“We have already increased our ICU bed capacity, added more ventilators and are trying to procure more. We see admissions are predominantly for ICU beds now,” said Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent of Artemis Hospitals.Dr Subhash Khanna of Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14 said that they are increasing ventilator beds as critical patients are not finding beds in other hospitals. “Many families have to shift them to Delhi or nearby districts risking their lives without a life support system. We are increasing five more ventilator beds, but are waiting for the nursing staff. The hospitals have to increase the numbers of ventilators for serious patients to save their lives,” he said.Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy Hospital, said that at their two hospitals, the number of ventilators has been increased from 15 to 55 over 10 days. “We have demanded 20 more as the number of critical care patients is increasing and shifting a patient from one hospital to another is risking their lives. Many patients have died in this process, so we decided to increase the number of ventilators,” he said.Amit Bhura, the facility director of Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, said that to help save more lives and be able to better serve the patients, they have added six more ventilators. “Now, we have 16 ventilators in total to treat patients from Delhi-NCR,” he said.Many people lost their relatives and loved ones due to the non-availability of ventilators. Families find it difficult to even shift patients in critical condition.Kriti Parmar, a resident of Sector 31, said she lost her mother last week as she could not get a ventilator bed in any of the hospitals. “We were told that demands have been sent, but they were awaiting the consignment for ventilators. We tried in six hospitals but could not get a bed anywhere. Doctors said she could survive only on ventilator support but unfortunately, we didn’t get any,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ventilator-beds-increased-in-city-hospitals-101620669501242.html

The move came at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik.During the meeting, it was also decided to form a technical team for swift procurement of vaccines and vaccination.Odisha is seeking to import vaccines to vaccinate its people in the 18-44 age group. Currently, the state is getting Covishield and Covaxin vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech respectively.The state expects to get the Sputnik V vaccine, with an efficacy of 91 per cent, that was invented by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Sputnik V recently got central approval for production and use in India.The government’s decision to float global tender came as the vaccination drive has slowed down due to a poor supply of vaccines. On Monday, several senior citizens in districts like Balasore, Keonjhar and Bhadrak, who had come to a vaccination centre to take the second dose, staged dharna protesting the unavailability of the Covid-19 vaccine.The beneficiaries alleged that they have been visiting the centre every other day for the second jab, but to no avail. So far 62,84,644 doses of Covaxin and Covishield have been given to beneficiaries.In another move to strengthen Odisha’s preparedness to fight the second wave of Covid-19, the Cabinet has also approved amendments in Industrial Policy Resolutions 2015 incentivising the production of medical oxygen in the state. This will offer benefits to those manufacturing medical oxygen and containers.While appreciating the hard work and sacrifices of Covid-19 warriors across the state, the CM expressed heartfelt gratitude to the people for their cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-becomes-5th-state-to-float-global-tender-for-covid-19-vaccine-101620668000003.html

10-05-2021||Other||Haryana stops wheat procurement operations||After procuring around 81 lakh MT wheat, government procurement agencies in Haryana have stopped the procurement operations in all 394 mandis in state.As per government, 83.49 lakh MT wheat arrived in the mandis in state and government procurement agencies have procured 80.77 lakh MT wheat.However, there were reports that payments of farmers are pending.Expecting a bumper produce this year, the government had increased procurement target to 80 lakh MT against 74 lakh MT of last year.But the government figures revealed that around 83.50 lakh MT wheat arrived in mandis and around 2.72 lakh MT is still lying unprocured.The procurement operations were stopped on April 30 but the government could not disburse payments of all farmers as only ₹12,977 crore has been paid to farmers and payments of around ₹3,000 crore are still pending. Most pending payments belong to farmers of Uttar Pradesh.Additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department) Anurag Rastogi had said that the target of procuring 80 lakh MT wheat was fixed by the Union government but the actual procurement can be less or more than the target.On whether government has any plans to procure more wheat from Haryana as crop is still arriving in mandis and procurement has exceeded the target, he had said that the target does not change.Ground-level mandi officials said that there are no instructions to resume procurement operations so far.On the other hand, farm union leaders and arhtiyas are demanding that government should resume procurement operations to ensure that entire wheat arrived in the mandis can be procured in MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal.As per officials of the food and supplies department, arrival of wheat in some grain markets has reached beyond expectations. In Karnal grain market, around 15 lakh quintal wheat has arrived against 12.40 lakh quintal of last year.Rajnish Chaudhry, president of the association of commission agents in Karnal grain market, said that over 50,000 quintal wheat was of hundreds of farmers not procured by government and they are waiting for government orders so that wheat of all registered farmers can be procured.Haryana BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has threatened to hold protests in mandis if the government does not resume procurement in mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-stops-wheat-procurement-operations-101620664947088.html

10-05-2021||Pune||Ramwadi underpass diversion causing inconvenience to commuters||The Ramwadi underpass was closed by Pune traffic police on April 24, 2021, in anticipation of MahaMetro starting work on construction of six pillars, which is causing problems among residents living in Kalyani Nagar and Viman Nagar, causing them to take longer detours to travel between Koregaon Park and Viman Nagar. “I was going to my doctor for a follow up and we had to go round up, although there is not much traffic, it causes a lot of inconvenience when a person is in a hurry to complete his work and return back home. I am aware of the metro beginning their work on this stretch but with almost 60 per cent of the labourers not there, why close the underpass early,” said Qaneez Sukhrani, Viman Nagar Citizen’s Forum. The forum has also written to DCP traffic and to PMC authorities demanding to open up Ramwadi underpass so that inconvenience is not caused to public. Currently, commuters are subject to a long 7-km detour from Kalyani Nagar to Viman Nagar. They have also suggested that traffic police should not shut down Ramwadi when there is no immediate work from Metro in those areas where the underpass is without work, man and machinery, it is unnecessarily inconveniencing local public and those going to airport. DCP traffic Rahul Shrirame stated that he personally visited the Ramwadi underpass and diversion made for completion of work until October 2021. In a letter, DCP said, “I would like to submit in broad sense of public interest that MahaMetro undergoing construction work from Civil court to Ramwadi work is in progress. Ramwadi underpass is a small narrow path so pillar cannot be installed at the centre of road so pillars are to be constructed at both sides of the narrow underpass road. MahaMetro rail has assured to complete the work in six months so they sought permission for work and diversion of traffic as the underpass road is narrow and cannot run traffic when work is on. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic and lockdown, there is less traffic on the road so instructed the metro to gear up the work. As we do not know till how much time the pandemic will stay, I discussed with metro officials to fasten the work and complete it on time. This decision is taken in public interest and there is no such interest to cause inconvenience to traffic and public. Hence, the decision to close Ramwadi underpass is taken practically considering the less traffic during lockdown along with traffic diversion with utmost convenience for people and traffic.” Ganesh Sonawane from Maha Metro said, “We are working on the stretch from Kalyani Nagar to Viman Nagar and we feel that this is the best period to work as there is less traffic on the road. We are working with 50 percent of the labour force and have brought all the resources to work on this stretch to meet with the deadlines and if possible, finish before the deadline. We are aware that it is causing an inconvenience to the locals at this moment but once this mega project is ready, traffic will be smooth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ramwadi-underpass-diversion-causing-inconvenience-to-commuters-101620664578796.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Pune market faces shortage of Konkan Alphonso, traders say price unlikely to come down||The supply of Alphonso mangoes from Konkan has almost been reduced by 40 per cent to 50 per cent this year and the rates are still higher than usual and unlikely to come down, according to traders. According to the APMC officials, currently 2,000-2,500 boxes are coming in daily in the Pune market which is far less than the normal supply during this time of the year. Traders claim that the rates are unlikely to come down as the Devgad mango season will be over in 3-4 weeks and the supply may not improve in the required proportion. From the beginning of this year’s season, the demand has dominated the supply of Ratnagiri mango. “The supply is low, and the rates are still high for a box of mangoes from Konkan. Currently, around 2,000-2,500 boxes are coming in daily in the market. Each year the supply is more than double during this time of year. This year the supply has come down to almost 50 per cent. Akshya Trutiya is delayed almost by a month this year. The chances are less that the supply would increase before Akshay Trutiya. Monday was the day when more boxes were expected as the mangoes require 3-4 days to ripe before they can be consumed,” said Baba Bibawe, head of fruit market department, Market Yard Pune. As the supply is lower than the demand, the rates of mangoes produced in Konkan areas of Ratnagiri and Devgad are still high. “Each year during this season 8,000-10,000 boxes of mangoes from Ratnagiri and Devgad arrived in the market daily. Now, only up to 3,000 boxes are coming into the market. Last year, in this season the cost of one box of 4-7 dozen mangoes was around ₹1,000- ₹1,500. But this year the same box costs around ₹1,500- ₹3,000. Karnataka mango is available in ample quantity, a box of two dozen costs around ₹350 ₹700. Mangoes were expensive during the time of Gudi Padwa. Now, Aksay Trutiya is this week, but the shortage supply and high cost has continued,” said Yuvraj Kachi, mango trader in Market Yard Pune. Vilas Bhujbal, president - Market yard commission agents claimed that the rates are unlikely to go down as the Konkan mango season is coming to an end in next few weeks. “Karnataka mango is available, but the supply is lesser than last year. The rates are unlikely to go down now as the season is coming to an end. The demand is still there, families at least buy one box as per their budget. Currently, hotels, juice centres are closed due to curbs. That’s why, the demand is comparatively less. If these establishments had been open, the demand would have increased exponentially and the rates would have gone much higher than the present rates,” said Bhujbal. The export of mangoes has continued this season. Officials in the Maharashtra State agricultural marketing board said that export in the USA may begin after May 14th. “Last year, the export to America didn’t happen.

10-05-2021||Pune||Despite centralised Remdesivir distribution, cops recover 27 vials from black market||Two separate units of police in Pune district have collectively seized a total of 27 Remdesivir injections that had landed in the black market, within a day. The injections are floating in the clandestine black-market weeks after the district collector’s office centralised the process to regulate the flow of the experimental drug from the manufacturers to the hospitals treating the patients directly through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In one raid, the Pimpri-Chinchwad police found 21 vials of the drug, while in the other raid, the Pune rural police found six vials of Remdesivir. The three arrested by officials of Wakad police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police were identified as Krushna Ramrao Patil (22), a nursing staff member at Crystal Hospital in Thergaon; Nikhil Keshav Neharkar (19), a delivery executive living in Annex Hospital, Chinchwad; and Shashikant Raghunath Panchal (34), a chemist working at Ayushri Medical store in Chinchwad. They were collectively found in possession of 21 vials of the drug and cash, according to the police. Patil and Neharkar were arrested by police at 2:45am on Sunday at a check post along Kalewadi Phata. Two vials of Remdesivir were found in their possession while the permit for sale was absent, according to the police. “After taking them in custody, they revealed that the Remdesivir injections found from them was taken from Ayushri Medical in Chinchwad in order to sell at a price higher than the one prescribed,” read a statement from Pimpri-Chinchwad police. Upon searching Panchal’s Maruti Swift car, the police found a total of 19 more vials. All the vials were of Hetro company. They have been booked under Sections 420 (cheating) and 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with relevant sections of Drug Price Control Order, 2013; Essential Commodities Act, 1955; and Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 registered at Wakad police station. In another incident, the Pune rural police found three men in possession of six Remdesivir and one Actemra (Tocilizubam) injection in Kurkumbh MIDC area in Daund at 2pm on Sunday. The three men were identified as Dattatray Maruti Londhe, Aditya Anirudha Wagh, and Amol Narsingh Munde, according to the police. The three also had cash worth ₹51,500 and were found moving near the gates of a company in the MIDC area on one Activa and one Santro car. A case under relevant sections of IPC and Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 was registered against them at Daund police station. As per the district collector’s order, the distribution of Remdesivir has to be done directly to the hospitals. In a nutshell, the seven distributor companies and hospitals in the district have to give their stock availability and requirement numbers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials respectively and the FDA, along with the district collector’s office deconstructs the figures to put the hospitals in touch with the right distributor. However, due to various lacunae, including friction in the procurement process and leak in the hospitals, the vials land up in the black market. “The Pune Municipal Corporation has provided us with a Google form. This form does not ask for the names but the number of patients who require Remdesivir. The information that we fill in the google form goest to the FDA every evening. The information is processed and on a WhatsApp group, a list is published. This list lets us know which distributor has been allocated to us for the drug. We contact the distributor, and the location is decided thereafter,” said Anuradha Temkar, executive assistant of director, Poona Hospital while explaining what the hospitals are required to do. “The process is highly monitored. Hospitals have to register the patients in their hospital who require the injection and submit it to the FDA officials. The district collector’s office along with FDA allocates stock to the hospital. Procurement is done by hospital. Every company gives their list of availability to the district authorities. Every hospital representative comes to the distributor to purchase the stock. It is random allocation as per available stock with stockists in particular region,” said Nilesh Amritkar, Shloka Enterprises, Sadashiv peth who is a distributor for Jubilliant. While the process has reduced the struggle for patients at major hospitals, the fear instilled by unavailability by the hospital forces relatives of patients to explore the black market to save their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/despite-centralised-remdesivir-distribution-cops-recover-27-vials-from-black-market-101620664338786.html

In the Remdesivir distribution order issued on Monday from the collector’s office, hospitals are specifically asked not to handover Remdesivir prescription to relatives. The order states that because of these prescriptions, black marketing of Remdesivir has been taking place. From April 11, the retail sale of Remdesivir was banned in Pune district and the Remdesivir injections have been distributed in a centralised control room established in the Pune collector’s office. The district administration warned Covid hospitals that if they continue to handout Remdesivir prescriptions to relatives, the supply of Remdesivir from the collector’s office will be stopped the concerned hospital. The same warning had been tendered in the order issued on Saturday. On Monday, 7,740 Remdisevir injections were distributed among 624 hospitals in Pune district. Currently, in order to procure Remdesivir, hospitals need to place an order with the control room in the collector’s office. Then as per availability and the proportion of oxygen beds, the vials of this anti-viral drug are allotted to the hospital. But there have been instances where hospitals are still handing out prescriptions to the relatives and they had to go in search of the injections. Hospitals are also asked to use this drug judiciously and keeping the guidelines issued by the task force in mind. “From April 11, Remdesivir has been made available directly to the hospitals by the collector’s office. Remdesivir is not available at chemist shops as hospitals are still handing out Remdesivir prescription to relatives, the black marketing of this drug is encouraged. Hospitals should not give Remdesivir prescriptions to relatives to get the drug otherwise the supply to such hospitals will be stopped,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dont-hand-out-remdesivir-prescriptions-to-patients-or-relatives-dist-admin-to-hospitals-101620664278705.html
10-05-2021||Pune||SCERT surveys students for decision on CET exam for FYJC admission||After the state education department cancelled Class 10 exams due to the rising cases of Covid-19, questions have been raised by parents, students on the structure of Class 11 admissions. In an attempt to find a solution, the state education department with the help of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Pune is conducting an online survey, through which all Class 10 students are asked their opinion about holding a Common Entrance Test (CET) for First Year Junior College (FYJC) Class 11 admissions. Earlier the deadline to submit this online survey form was until Sunday which has now been extended until May 11. This survey is for students from all boards including the state, CBSE and CICE where they need to give answers to simple questions and their opinion on whether CET should be held or not. The state education department has given a link of the online form for the survey: https://www.research.net/r/11thCETEST. While only students are allowed to participate in it, school administrations have been asked to send out the survey link to maximum students. “It is a simple survey to be done by students of Class 10 from all the boards. The link has been sent on our official website and its deadline has been increased until May 11. Till now we are getting a very good response from students and over 2 lakh students have submitted their response. We appeal to all the Class 10 students to please give their valuable opinion which will help us to take further important decisions regarding conducting CET,” said Vikas Garad, SCERT deputy director. While students have welcomed this move, Siddhant Miraje a class 10 student said, “We are happy that the state government cancelled the examinations in such tough times and now are asking students’ opinion to conduct CET exams. In my view CET should be taken so that students will get proper marks through which admission can be given to them.” The proposed CET exam will be held around in the month of June or when the Covid cases decrease in the state. It will be a multiple-choice questions (MCQ) test and students will be provided optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets for answering them. There will only be one paper with 100 marks with questions from all subjects and two-hour duration to complete it. Those students who clear this CET exam will get the Class 11 admissions as per their performance. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar said, “This year’s Class 11 admissions are going to be tough, but it is good that the state education department is thinking about CET exam. It will help the college administration to fill up the seats and there will be proper allocation of seats as per the performance of students in the CET exam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/scert-surveys-students-for-decision-on-cet-exam-for-fyjc-admission-101620664218840.html

He was 90 years old and is survived by his wife, three children and their families. Kakade, the last of socialist leaders from the city, represented Baramati Lok Sabha seat, which is currently the stronghold of Sharad Pawar family. During his active days in politics, Kakade was known as an arch-rival of NCP president Sharad Pawar. Known as Lalasaheb in social and political circles, Kakade was elected to the Lok Sabha from Baramati in 1977 and 1984 as a Janata Party candidate. Expressing grief, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said Baramati had lost a strong political personality. “He was the veteran leader of Janata Dal and put a great impact on the state’s politics. He worked towards giving direction to the new leadership,” Pawar tweeted. During 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Kakade had withdrawn from the race from Baramati after Pawar announced his illness in the middle of the campaign heat. “Kakade had issued a statement to the effect, saying he was withdrawing from the poll race in support of Pawar who was suffering from a serious disease,” he said. He also worked with contemporaries like S M Joshi, Mohan Dhariya and Nanasaheb Gore Kakade defeated congress stalwart Vithalrao Gadil in 1977 Lok Sabha polls, which happened after emergency was lifted. During 1984 by polls, he won from Baramati when Pawar extended his support. Kakade’s nephew Viraj had also once contested from Baramati but lost the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/former-mp-shambhajirao-kakde-dies-at-90-101620663618684.html

MSiNS have categorised incubators in three categories based on the work and progress so far namely beginners, emerging and leaders. In a very short time, the centre has created a mark for itself, which will now open opportunities for start-ups to get funds as ‘seed capital funding’ through MSIS funding. Set up in 2018, the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Linkages (CIIL) has been working very closely with start-ups in and around Pune and has quickly scaled up with many innovative start-ups, a sizable number of mentors and a very modern incubation centre.\ The assessment was based on the large number of activities done by the centre to spot the right kind of start-ups, engagement with various colleges from the affiliating system with more than 275 colleges attached to the university through this, support through funding of patents, large scale ongoing events and meaningful partnerships with the likes of Entrepreneurship Institute of India (EDII), Ahmedabad, PCSIC (Pimpri-Chinchwad Start-up Innovation Cell), TiE Pune to name a few. Few of the start-ups here have also received funding from external sources and have received many laurels byways of prizes from IIM-C, IIM Udaipur, and IIT-B. Dr Apoorva Palkar, director, CIIL-SPPU said, “This recognition is really helpful for new incubators like us who are working hard to make a mark by spotting grass root innovators and providing them a platform through incubation centre, providing advisory, mentorship and handholding at the most crucial juncture of their venture,” “The centre today has more than 40 start-up companies engaged with us that are nurtured through SPPU- research park foundation and the next cohort training of 60 start-up companies is underway through the virtual mode,” she added. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “SPPU has focused on innovation, start-ups through systematic work that has resulted in our progression in the direction of job givers than job seekers. This recognition is a baby step, and we shall strive towards innovation excellence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppus-centre-for-innovation-gets-leader-status-by-msis-101620663558740.html

The underlying basis of the Motor Vehicles Act is to ensure that lives are saved on the road, however, with the usage of the same cameras, crucial time is being wasted on the roads, it said.The Bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh is scheduled to hear the PIL on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-suspension-of-challans-by-red-light-violation-cameras-during-covid-19-pandemic-101620659845393.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Exams cancel? High-schoolers come to Covid patients’ rescue||Suffering inspires compassion. Proving this are school going youngsters, who have been led by the Covid-19 crisis to find an opportunity to utilise their time and energy to serve the humanity in this grim situation caused by the pandemic. Amid the second wave of Corona, as exams of most high school students stand either postponed or cancelled, they have taken to saving lives by providing verified leads to those looking for oxygen cylinders, plasma donors, ICU beds, etc. From saving lives of their relatives, to supporting strangers, these youngsters are doing it all and shining bright while they provide a glimmer of hope to the city residents. “I was casually talking to my cousin when she told me about how her friend’s mother needed plasma. I was moved by her condition and really wanted to help, so I started digging up resources and making phone calls,” says Ananya Sharma, a class XII student of a Ghaziabad-based school, adding, “The next day, I saw an Instagram story of a girl looking for an ICU bed for her grandfather. Luckily, I was able to help her too, and felt magical after that! One thing led to another until volunteering became a full-time thing. Eventually, I joined a lot of WhatsApp groups through which I got connected to more volunteers. People posted their requirements on these groups, and the rest looked up resources for them. That’s what I’ve been up to. And due to social media platforms getting flooded with phone numbers, we divide the work among ourselves, to work more efficiently.” With eyes that shine with the dream of seeing a pandemic free world, these youngsters are driven to save every life they can. “I got inspired by a DU student who was saving lives amid the pandemic and decided to help too,” says 16-year-old Bhumik Dirolia, a student of a Haryana-based school, adding, “An 11-year-old boy from Hisar came to meet me after I saved his father’s life, and this was the best feeling ever! Ek insaan dusre insaan ki madad nahi karega to kaun karega? So far I’ve helped 500 people, but out of those I’ve saved approximately 100 and belive that I saved 1,000 lives because every person has 10 family members behind them. Now I’ve set a goal to help 10,000 people. When I had started helping people, I initially got 20-30 calls. But straight from day two, I got 50-60 calls and currently I get 200 calls per day. I verify each and every lead by calling them up, whether it’s 20 or 200, I verify them all and then only share them with the patient or their relatives. Just yesterday I verified 400-500 leads personally by calling each one up, and I’ve been helping people all over the country and not just those in Delhi-NCR. I have also donated a part of my pocket money to the needy, to help provide them ventilators, oxygen, and medicines etc... I want to set an example to the youth of my age that we all can make a corona free India! If only 1,35,000 people out of the country’s population work everyday on helping 10,000 people in a month, it will help all the 135 crore people of IndiaAnd these youngsters even know the significance of a heartfelt conversation, and how it can make a difference in the lives of people struggling due to Covid. “A lot of my friends who were Covid positive needed someone to talk to, and I was there for them. I helped ease their fears, and even read them stories on the phone... Whatever pocket money my parents give me, I donated all of it to the foundations that have been helping Covid patients with oxygen cylinders. Though I can’t go out of my house, but I ensured that I’m able to help in whatever capacity I can, as there’s not much to study right now since exams have been postpones. So I used the time to help those who I know were infected, by verifying leads for their relatives who were running out of time to make so many calls. Now, I’m looking forward to getting vaccinated when it’s my turn,” says Nikhil Kumar, a class XII student at a public school in Delhi.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exams-cancel-high-schoolers-come-to-covid-patients-rescue-101620660501709.html

The announcement came after the state received 2.40 lakh doses of the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, against its purchase orders placed with the two approved manufacturers--Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, respectively. “Against our purchase orders, we have so far received a total of 2.40 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin. We are going to kick start the free inoculation drive for 18-44 age group from May 14,” state health department’s principal secretary Arun Kumar Singh said.The third phase of the nationwide inoculation drive for the aforementioned age group was earlier scheduled to begin on May 1. However, it could not be started in Jharkhand, as the Centre disallowed all states from using the existing doses in their stock for inoculating the 18-44 age group.The Centre, last month, said that the vaccines sent to states earlier were meant for only people above the age of 45 and other priority groups.It then asked the states to purchase the vaccine doses on their own directly from manufacturers to inoculate the younger age group. Following this, the state health department issued purchase orders (PO) to both companies, demanding 25 lakh doses from each of them.According to sources, against the new PO, the state received 134,400 doses of Covaxin and 100,000 doses of Covishield. It was likely to get another consignment of 287,000 doses of Covishield by the end of this week.However, the number of doses received by the state so far was very less, and if the supply chain is not maintained, the inoculation drive will likely come to a halt.When asked about any special preparations being made to carry out a smooth vaccination drive for the third phase, the health secretary refused to divulge details. The 18-44 age group constitutes around 48% of the state’s population. According to an estimate of the health department, the state has around 16 million people in this group, for which it requires 32 million doses of the vaccine.With only 2.40 lakh doses at its disposal, the department will require to meticulously plan division of vaccines among the 24 districts in order to keep the vaccination drive going. If calculated, each of the 24 districts will likely get an average of 10,000 doses only.Chief minister Hemant Soren announced to provide free vaccination to all eligible citizens between 18-44 years of age. Jharkhand till May 9 inoculated 2,731,546 beneficiaries, including health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens aged over 45 with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 585,950 of them have also taken the second dose. This accounts for around 8.30% vaccination coverage against the state’s 32.9 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/1844-group-to-get-the-jab-from-may-14-101620659418483.html

The RJD chief has spent nearly 40 months in jail after his conviction in fodder scam cases. In his statement, Prasad said the onus to get every eligible citizen get vaccinated free of cost in a phased manner rested on the central government and cited the example of polio vaccination undertaken during the sting of HD Deve Gowda as the prime minister.“At the time when the country lacked facility and sensitization for healthcare, around 12.73 crore children were administered polio vaccine in a single-day drive on January 8, 1997. This is still a world record. On December 7, 1996, as many as 1.74 crore children were offered polio drops,” claimed Prasad.The then JD-led government had confronted a lot of difficulties in convincing the people to go for vaccination, who had many misconceptions. “But the government overcame all the obstacles with its firm determination. It is unfortunate that the present government being led by a leader having reputation as Vishwaguru is unable to arrange the required number of vaccines even after charging the common people for the jabs,” said Prasad.Earlier, on Sunday, Prasad held a virtual meeting with party leaders from his daughter Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti’s residence and urged them to set up Covid care centres in their respective areas of influence and help people fight the pandemic.The party leaders were also urged to “expose and thwart” any instances of black marketing of oxygen cylinders and other important medicines, and help needy patients with food and other logistics like ambulances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/give-free-vaccination-to-all-against-covid-lalu-tells-pm-101620658998428.html

10-05-2021||Kolkata||Ex-TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari becomes leader of the opposition in Bengal||After serving in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December last year and defeated her at Nandigram in East Midnapore district in the recent state polls, on Monday emerged as the leader of the opposition at the state assembly. “As the leader of the opposition, my priority will be to carry out a movement to free Bengal of political violence and establish a parliamentary democracy. The killings and arson must stop,” said Adhikari. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) routed the opposition by winning 213 seats but Adhikari made news by defeating Banerjee by around 1,900 votes. Challenging the result, the TMC demanded recounting of votes but the Election Commission (EC) turned it down. Adhikari, who underwent training at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) camps in his youth, started his career as a youth Congress leader before joining the TMC under the guidance of his father Sisir Adhikari, the TMC’s Contai Lok Sabha member who joined the BJP recently. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy, one of the founding members of the TMC and now a BJP national vice-president, proposed Adhikari’s name for the post of leader of the opposition when the BJP’s newly-elected legislators met at the party’s election office at Hastings in south Kolkata on Monday afternoon. Of the 77 BJP MLAs, 52 were present at the meeting while the rest were in their constituencies in the districts.  <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”hi” dir=”ltr”>पश्चिम बंगाल में श्री <a href=”https://twitter.com/SuvenduWB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@SuvenduWB</a> जी को विधानसभा में प्रतिपक्ष का नेता चुने जाने पर हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं।<br>मुझे पूर्ण विश्वास है कि आप के नेतृत्व में <a href=”https://twitter.com/BJP4Bengal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@BJP4Bengal</a> विपक्ष की जिम्मेदारी को पूरी मजबूती के साथ निभाएगी और प्रदेश की जनता के लिए न्याय और अधिकार प्राप्त करने का माध्यम बनेगी।</p>&mdash; Jagat Prakash Nadda (@JPNadda) <a href=”https://twitter.com/JPNadda/status/1391757072316784640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>May 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8”></script>Since Roy is senior to Adhikari and he won the polls from Krishnanagar in Nadia district, many leaders in the party thought he would be elected leader of the opposition. While arriving for the meeting, Roy brushed aside the speculations, saying, “I am too old.”“Twenty-two MLAs supported Suvendu Adhikari’s nomination. I asked the others if they wanted to propose any other name. Since there was no other nomination, Adhikari was unanimously elected leader of the BJP’s legislative party in the West Bengal assembly,” announced Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who, along with the BJP’s central election observers, attended the meeting. Manoj Tigga, who won the Natabari seat in north Bengal for the second time, was elected the BJP’s chief whip in the assembly. Asked why only 22 of the 52 BJP MLAs supported Adhikari’s nomination, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “He was unanimously elected. Even those who are the districts told us that they would accept the party’s decision.” Adding to this, Adhikari said, “The fact that no other name was proposed means the decision was unanimous. All wings of the BJP and people supported the nomination.”TMC leaders did not want to comment on one of their former colleagues becoming the leader of the opposition.Kolkata-based political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Adhikari joined the BJP five months ago. His becoming leader of the opposition may demoralise many leaders who worked hard for years and helped the saffron camp grow in Bengal.”Adhikari became a legislator for the first time in 2006 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha. He was also made president of the TMC’s youth wing but Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee replaced him in 2014. His younger brother Dibyendu Adhikari is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Tamluk. The youngest sibling, Soumendu, headed the Contai civic body before joining the saffron camp in January.Polls were held in 292 of Bengal’s 294 assembly seats. Polls at two seats in the Murshidabad district will be held later as two opposition party candidates died of Covid-19 during the unprecedented eight-phase polling held between March 27 and April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/extmc-minister-suvendu-adhikari-becomes-leader-of-the-opposition-in-bengal-101620658519464.html

Chief secretary Vini Mahajan disclosed this after a meeting of the steering-cum-monitoring committee of the midday meal scheme on Monday. The additional funds, according to the chief secretary, were needed as the state-run schools registered a sizeable increase in enrolment during the current academic session.

A police team led by inspector Parkash Singh was enforcing the administration’s left-right formula for opening shops in the market when the incident took place. On Monday, the administration had allowed only those shops that are situated on the left side in the market to open. Police said the trader, identified as Raghav, had violated the norms by opening his shop, which is on the right side. They said a meeting was also held with the shopkeepers on Sunday to make them aware of the guidelines.Closed circuit television footage shows two cops standing outside Raghav’s cloth shop. First, they manhandle his worker and then slap him after he comes out with folded hands.“I had opened my shop to file my returns, as it was the last day,” said Raghav, adding that senior police officials have assured him that appropriate action will be taken against the erring cops.Varun Bhatia, another shopkeeper in the market, said: “Raghav was confused over the left-right formula. We are not criminals. If any rule was flouted, action should be taken as per the law. How can police thrash any shopkeeper like this? We are already suffering due to the pandemic.”Assistant commissioner of police (central) Parvesh Chopra confirmed that the incident involves inspector Parkash Singh. “I have myself apologised to the shopkeeper.

10-05-2021||Kolkata||Durga idol makers in Kolkata's Kumartuli anxious about business in second Covid-hit year||The second wave of coronavirus has made the artisans of Kumartuli, the famed colony of clay modellers in north Kolkata, anxious if they are facing the same scenario of last year when Dura Puja organisers ordered smaller, less priced idols to suit their reduced budget induced by the pandemic. Kumartuli supplies idols of gods and goddesses to various parts of the country and abroad and the artisans earn the most during the Durga Puja, the largest festival of West Bengal.The modellers said they are also worried that the already dwindling number of their workers may further go down as the apprehension of a total lockdown from mid-May is gaining ground in the neighbourhood where many people have been affected by Covid-19."Most of the well-known artists of Kumartuli have got a few orders (of Durga idol) before the sudden rise in cases and various restrictions were imposed," Sujit Pal, one of the leading clay modellers in the potter's colony, told PTI.The West Bengal government has ordered the closure of shopping complexes, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, sports complexes, and allowed shops and markets to operate for reduced hours to check the spread of the infection.Pal received two bookings for Durga idols one from a community puja organiser which is celebrating its golden jubilee this year and the other from a family in late March when the Covid situation was not so alarming in the state.He said that they do not want to press the panic button yet as less than 10 per cent of total orders are booked during the Bengali months of Chaitra and Baisakh from mid- March to mid-May."But the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and the intensity of the second wave are causing anxiety among us. How long will this last? Will there be a third wave as predicted? Pal said.The Durga Puja festival will be held in October this year.He said that a number of cases of infection were reported in the neighbouring pockets of Kumartuli, though the colony was not much affected as yet.The apprehension of a total lockdown after May 15 has made the 100-odd workers currently employed in the workshops scared "and they are planning to leave for their homes in districts", the artist said. Even this workforce is very less as Kumartuli employs at least six-seven times more people in this time of the year when idols of other goddesses are made."Work on all these idols will come to a halt if we don't have labourers," Pal said. Each modeller received orders for one or two idols of goddess Shitala and Raksha Kali, the pujas of whom are held in summer, instead of four-five in other years.The artists of Kumartuli wait for the Rathyatra days in July when booking for Durga idols starts frenetically.However, in 2020 when the Covid-19 and the lockdown triggered a decline in the booking of Durga idols till September, many organisers settled for smaller idols of 6-7 feet height instead of the average 12-13 feet because they were less priced, Pal said.The budget of big-ticket Durga Pujas took a hard knock due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak last year as sponsorship by corporate advertisers was reduced, leading to scaling down of the grandeur."They (organisers) had also opted for low-height traditional ekchala idols which cost less. However, as the situation eased after the Durga Puja, the order for Kali or Jagaddhatri idols went up," he said.Artisan Chaina Pal, one of the prominent women involved in the trade in Kumartuli, said that the situation was very encouraging before the Saraswati puja in February this year "as people thought coronavirus has gone will not return".However, she is keeping her fingers crossed. "I am sure orders (for Durga idols) will start pouring in from July and we can see a spurt in demand from September."Chaina Pal has received bookings for three Durga idols, all household pujas, and the number is not less in comparison to the corresponding period of 2019."My workers are at my studio and the initial work of creating the idols has completed," she said.Another modeller Prodyut Pal said there has been no booking, not even from overseas, and work has stopped in many studios including his."The money at the hands of us, from the earnings last year, has kept us going till now. We don't know what lies in future," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/durga-idol-makers-in-kolkata-s-kumartuli-anxious-about-business-in-second-covid-hit-year-101620655361976.html

Every person should strictly abide by the Covid-19 protocols, and behave like a lockdown was in force across the state," she insisted.Banerjee further said that a negative RT-PCR test will be made mandatory for all those coming to West Bengal from outside, even if they fly to the state via helicopters or special flights.Asking media persons to refrain from causing panic among people, the CM further said that a Pandemic Act will be enforced soon to deal with such issues.Banerjee thanked common people and corporate houses for providing valuable aid to the state government for boosting its healthcare infrastructure.She requested them to continue backing the administration financially for purchase of requisite vaccines, assuring that there will be an audit of all expenditure made with the money.The CM iterated that the Centre should do away with GST on any initiative to build health infrastructure amid the pandemic so that more number of corporate entities can come forward to provide assistance."As the central government is not providing any financial aid, we can strengthen healthcare infrastructure and buy vaccines with the support rendered by corporate entities and other residents."Bengal needs 550 metric tonne oxygen, but the Centre has allotted it a little over 300 metric tonne," she claimed.Claiming that the Centre has reportedly exported 65 per cent of vaccines produced in the country, she said, "I ask the Union government to mull over its options and source more vaccines, if necessary from foreign countries."The CM stated that the cabinet has formed a committee comprising chief secretary and other top officials of home, finance and health departments to address gaps in critical infrastructure."This committee will look into implementation of promises made to the people after the Covid-19 situation is brought under control," she said.Talking about the allegations made in reference to post-poll violence in Bengal, the chief minister claimed that the BJP's IT cell was spreading rumours with fake videos."People have given their verdict (in the recently concluded election) for peace and unity. We will not tolerate any violence," she underlined."Barring one incident in Sitalkuchi (CISF firing), there has been no genocide in West Bengal. A government has taken charge in Bengal following a landslide victory, why should a central team be sent within 24 hours after the new dispensation took over?" she stated, lashing out at the Ministry of Home Affairs that sent a four-member group to find out reasons for post-poll violence in the state.Accusing the central team of adopting a "partisan attitude", the chief minister said that the team was only visiting the houses of BJP workers."Half of those killed are from our party, we have declared relief (of ₹2 lakh) for all, no matter which party they belong to, including the BJP," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/covid19-in-bengal-strict-measures-taken-to-control-spread-of-virus-says-cm-101620654438596.html

I took a break from acting to start my casting agency to help youngsters and ensure that they don’t face the same struggle that I went through after I came from UP to join the industry. Seeing today’s state of affairs, finally many more have started to understand the real meaning of love and support,” said the actor.Known for shows like ‘Maharana Pratap,’ ‘Samrat Ashok’ and ‘Yeh Rishte Kya Kehlata Hain,’ and with a career spanning almost a decade, the Prayagraj-lad wishes to go back to acting soon. Talking about his work, Sanjay said, “I am a trained singer and reached Mumbai to take up singing but landed into acting. My first break was with the show ‘Maharana…’ followed by many more till 2017 before embarking the journey of a casting director.” Sanjay began his casting journey with the show ‘Khidki’. “Since then, I have done casting for shows like ‘Kkundali Bhagya’, ‘Meri Durga’, ‘Chandra Kantha’, ‘Aladdin’ and was working on casting of a number other shows and films when this pandemic struck in 2020. Though we all are trying to keep the work rolling and having virtual meeting almost every day but still uncertainty looms over us and when will the normalcy be restored — none of us have an idea,’ said Sanjay who is working on casting of the film ‘Welcome to Bajrangpur.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/we-should-realise-the-importance-of-helping-each-other-sanjay-101620654438891.html

Of the 990, the highest allocation of 150 ventilators was for the newly constructed Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka that the Delhi government is currently operationalizing for Covid-19 patients. The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said that the hospital will start with 500 oxygen beds for the patients with the viral infection. “To augment medical resources, optimum utilisation of space is being done. 500 oxygen-bedded centre will be set up here by next week,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said last Wednesday.Two new hospitals that were operationalized last year for treating Covid-19 patients by the Delhi government in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar have also been allocated 80 ventilators each. Other hospitals to receive 80 ventilators were Deen Dayal Upadhaya in Hari Nagar and Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini. The government allocated 80 ventilators each to makeshift facilities such as the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in Chattarpur, the extension of Burari hospital, and Sant Darshan centre. Two hospitals of the Employees State Insurance Corporation in Okhla and Jhilmil were allocated 50 ventilators in total. Currently, Delhi has 5,872 intensive care unit beds, not all of which have ventilators. Of these, 98.9% of the beds are occupied. The occupancy is likely to reduce over the week as the number of cases in the city has started going down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-to-add-990-ventilator-beds-in-15-hospitals-makeshift-facilities-101620654019373.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||'In what greed': Manish Sisodia slams Centre for Covid-19 vaccine export||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia once again hit out at the Centre on Monday for exporting Covid-19 vaccines to the country at a time when a resurgent second wave has affected lakhs of people in the country. The experts were conducted as part of the 'Vaccine Maitri' initiative of the government.“In what greed were 6.50 crore vaccines supplied to foreign countries when people in our own country are dying?” Sisodia said at a press conference.The deputy chief minister of Delhi also claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) allegations of the Delhi government ordering only 5.50 lakh doses of vaccines is incorrect as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had placed orders directly with the two vaccine manufacturers in the country for 1.34 crore doses to vaccinate those above 18 years of age.“Today BJP alleged that Delhi govt ordered only 5.50 lakh doses of vaccine. The Government of India decided in April that the two companies can sell vaccines to states directly, states were also told the same. We ordered 1.34 crore doses for Delhi for people above 18 years,” Sisodia further said.Sisodia alleged that after the Delhi government placed orders for vaccines with manufacturing companies, the Centre stepped in to inform the government that Delhi would be receiving only 92,840 doses of Covaxin and 2,67,690 doses of Covishield to inoculate its citizens.“Right after our order, Centre sent us a letter - vaccine companies hadn't responded by then - that Delhi can get only 92,840 doses of Covaxin and 2,67,690 doses of Covishield in May,” said Sisodia.“BJP is lying that we ordered only 5.50 lakh doses. We had ordered 1.34 crore doses,” he added.Earlier in the day, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain told reporters that the national capital is left with only a day’s worth of Covaxin stock. Delhi had received 1,50,000 doses of Covaxin for inoculating those within 18-45 years of age, and after administering 1,02,020 doses till Monday morning only 47,980 doses are available on hand, he said. The national capital’s stock of Covishield is expected to last for 3-4 days more, the minister added.Both Jain and Sisodia’s remarks came a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s letter to Union minister Harsh Vardhan urging an increase in vaccine supply to the capital between May-July.Earlier on Monday, the BJP had slammed Arvind Kejriwal government over the Covid-19 crisis, claiming the chief minister has been busy spending crores on publicity and "misleading" people while washing his hands of responsibility and leaving everything to the Centre.Addressing a virtual press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited a RTI reply to say that the Kejriwal government has spent around ₹805 crore on advertisements since 2015 but not opened a single new hospital in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-what-greed-manish-sisodia-slams-centre-for-covid-19-vaccine-export-101620652424585.html
10-05-2021||Patna||Bihar govt seeks additional support from Centre to tackle second wave of Covid-19||The Bihar government on Monday told the Patna High Court that it needed more D-type (46-litre capacity) and B-type cylinders for smooth transportation of oxygen to far-flung areas in the state and the Centre has already started with the supply of 75 D-type cylinders through the Indian Air Force (IAF), HT has learnt. “Bihar has lifted 208 mt of the 214 mt allocation. Oxygen supply has been streamlined but the real challenge is to have an adequate number of D-type cylinders as they can be directly used with a pipeline to ensure gas supply to beds in hospitals in different parts of the state,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, appearing for Bihar government, said, adding that in the last three days, the number of cases in the state had come down and recovery rate improved to around 82%. Singh submitted the affidavit filed by the chief secretary about the status of healthcare facilities in the state before the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar. Alongside, a letter of principal secretary, department of health, Bihar, to the secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, sent on May 7 for additional support to tackle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was also attached.The additional requirements include 20,000 D-type oxygen cylinders, 10,000 B-type cylinders, 5,000 10-litre capacity cylinders and 3,000 5-litre cylinders, besides 25,000 flow meters, 50,000 oxygen masks, 1,000 high-flow nasal cannula and 50,000 pulse oximeters. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey has also requested the Union government for the same. Additional solicitor general KN Singh said that 3688 D-type and 6400-B-type were delivered in April 2020 and further allocation was coming in. Vikas Singh also informed the court that Bihar’s demand for 300 mt of oxygen had also been enhanced to 400 mt, as the demand was dynamic, and the government was hoping that the allocation of 214 mt would also be accordingly increased. Advocate General (AG) Lalit Kishore told the bench that the government was in the process of constituting a high-power experts’ committee, while the chief minister was himself monitoring the situation and associating senior ministers in the decision-making process. “There is no notification for the constitution of a group of ministers, but the CM is himself monitoring the situation,” he added. The court, however, wanted certain information regarding the availability of beds and their occupancy and demand in every district, the number of positive cases and the number of people in home isolation. The court will again hear the matter on Wednesday. The bench also cited the example of one district, Araria, where just around 400 beds could cater to a population of 28 lakh. The court was also informed that Araria had just six ventilators, and all were lying unutilized. On this, Vikas Singh requested the court not to get down to micro-management as it could involve the officers in data preparation only and not in the actual work. However, the bench said that it could not shut its eyes. “We are just seeking information, as these are the issues that concern all. We are not here to govern. When it comes to oxygen requirement, the court is expected to pass orders. But the court also needs to know the ground situation, as it also gets feedback from its sources,” it added. The AG also requested the bench to pass an order for the release of cylinders seized by police, as they were exhibits and could pose problems at a later stage. The court said that it could be ensured simply by approaching the magistrate. “After taking photographs, the cylinders could be released. There are enough provisions in this regard,” it added. What the govt affidavit says Bihar has 167 Covid care centres, 117 dedicated Covid health centres, 12 dedicated Covid hospitals and 219 private hospitals providing care to patients. Instructions have been given to increase the existing bed capacity of the dedicated Covid health centres by 25% and upgrade CCCs and DCHCs for the treatment of moderate cases. The health department has a total capacity of 855 ventilators, out of which 378 are deployed for treatment of Covid-19 patients at dedicated Covid hospitals and DCHCs. Keeping in view, the need for ventilators in approved private facilities, the nod has been given for their use from government facilities to private facilities also. CT scan service is available in 16 district hospitals and the installation process is underway at additional 15 district hospitals. A total of 95 essential drugs for the general management of Covid-19 and 54 ICU drugs has been notified. Out of these, the Bihar medical services infrastructure corporation limited has a rate contract in place for 70 essential drugs and 31 ICU drugs. For the drugs which do not have a rate contract in place, the civil surgeons have been instructed to procure them locally. The Central government has allocated 87,800 Remdesivir vials to Bihar. Out of that, 42,500 have been distributed to civil surgeons and medical colleges. Special powers have been entrusted upon medical superintendents of medical colleges and hospitals and civil surgeons for procurement of goods, services and manpower for three months under the provisions of the disaster management act, 2005. Vacancies According to the affidavit, against a total of 5,566 sanctioned positions of general medical officers, at present 2,893 are working. Advertisement has been issued for the recruitment of additional 2632 general duty medical officers. Besides, against 5508 sanctioned posts of specialists, the working strength at present is 1,795. An advertisement for additional 3706 specialists has also been issued. The last date to apply is May 24 for both. Against 915 sanctioned contractual posts of general medical officers, the working strength is just 279, while against 769 sanctioned contractual posts of specialists, presently 150 are working. The government has also created 1,000 posts of MBBS doctors at medical colleges and hospitals across districts for appointment on a contractual basis for one year through walk-in interviews. The government has also issued orders to continue the services of final year post-graduate and diploma students of medical colleges and hospitals for three months beyond the academic session at ₹95000/month and ₹90000/month respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-seeks-additional-support-from-centre-to-tackle-second-wave-of-covid19-101620652580147.html
10-05-2021||Other||Covid warriors overcome the odds to fight virus in Haryana||Frontline workers from administrative officials to medical staff are leading by example as they battle the Covid-19 pandemic in Haryana. Some got infected, while others lost relatives to coronavirus but that has only strengthened their resolve.Chairing a meeting of the Rewari district administration last week, Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh appreciated the work done by deputy commissioner Yashendra Singh despite having lost two relatives to Covid.Yashendra Singh resumed office on April 30 after training when the district was in the grip of oxygen supply shortage. Four patients at a private hospital had lost their lives due to the shortage of oxygen cylinders. Singh has since been personally monitoring the distribution of cylinders to hospitals in the district.“I have assured doctors that no patient will die in hospital due to shortage of oxygen. I hold coordination meetings at night too and have started home delivery of oxygen cylinders,” he says. Last week, the demand for oxygen increased in Rewari, prompting him to arrange 120 cylinders from Rohtak, 30 each from Gurugram, Mahendragarh and Faridabad districts after coordinating with his counterparts.FACE OF RESILIENCE, SHE SETS AN EXAMPLEPriyanka, a staff nurse at Rohtak’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, is another face of a resilient Covid warrior. She returned to duty at the Covid ward with a smile on Sunday after defeating coronavirus for the second time.The past three weeks were the toughest for the young mother after she tested positive.“There was no one else at home to look after my two children, both of whom are aged below 10 years, till my husband, a soldier, took leave to be with us after five days. I was confined to one room and the children to another. My in-laws wanted to come from our native village in Bhiwani, but I didn’t want to put them at risk. My husband and I remained away from the children even though we stayed in the same building,” she said.IN ISOLATION BUT CONNECTEDJhajjar civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya has been isolation ever since he developed Covid symptoms, but that hasn’t stopped him from coordinating from a room at the PWD rest house in Beri.“Though 264 employees of the 1,635 health department employees in Jhajjar contracted the virus, services have remained unaffected. A commander is as good as his army and I want to thank my team for rising to the occasion,” says Dr Dahiya. The civil surgeon and his wife, Dr Pamila, who is also a government doctor, had gone home in Gurugram in the beginning April, but had never imagined that they would be battling such a situation.“We have a 23-year-old daughter who is looking after my elderly parents as we work in isolation. She makes it a point to make a video call at 11.30pm every night. My mother is concerned about us, but she wants us to continue our duty,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-warriors-overcome-the-odds-to-fight-virus-in-haryana-101620650958653.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal explains how Delhi is preparing for next wave of Covid-19||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that his government is boosting the infrastructure to prepare the national capital for the next wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Delhi has seen a surge in the number of daily cases of Covid-19, which led the Kejriwal government to announced strict lockdown-like measures to check th spread of the infection in second wave."We're increasing oxygen beds... we must prepare for the third wave. In this wave, Delhi recorded maximum 28,000 cases in a day. The scale at which we're creating infrastructure, we'll be able to deal even if 30,000 daily cases are reported in next wave," the chief minister said.His comments come on a day when the Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said that the city was running out of vaccines, with just three to four days of supplies remaining of AstraZeneca's Covishield, made by the Serum Institute of India and a day for Covaxin."We're left with vaccine stock vaccines for 3-4 days. We're placed orders with companies but I think Central government is allocating the vaccines because we get letter from the Centre about the stock that we would get in a month. We request Centre to give us more vaccines," said Kejriwal.On Monday, Delhi entered a fourth week of lockdown, with tougher curbs such as the shutdown of the suburban rail network (metro trains) and a ban on outdoor weddings and gatherings."This is not the time to be lenient," Kejriwal had said on Sunday. "This phase is so tough, this wave is so dangerous, so many people are dying...the priority at this hour is to save lives," he said in a televised address.Delhi on Monday reported 319 fresh Covid-19 fatalities and 12,651 new infections, the lowest in four weeks, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent, according to health department bulletin.The dip in new cases, the lowest since April 12, can also be ascribed to a smaller number of tests (66,234) conducted on Sunday.At 19.10 per cent, the positivity rate is the lowest since April 16, when it stood at 19.7 per cent, according to government data. On April 22, a positivity rate of 36.2 per cent, the highest so far, was recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-explains-how-delhi-is-preparing-for-next-wave-of-covid19-101620649792755.html
10-05-2021||Kolkata||Suvendu Adhikari chosen opposition leader to take on Mamata in West Bengal house||The BJP on Monday unanimously elected Suvendu Adhikari as Leader of Opposition in the new West Bengal Assembly to take on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the house. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad announced Adhikari's name as leader of the BJP legislature party in the assembly after a meeting of the legislators at the party's Hastings office. The saffron party has emerged as the main opposition party winning 77 seats in the 294-member house. Adhikari has been preferred by the saffron party ahead of senior party leaders like Mukul Roy, who also got elected from Nadia constituency, to take on Banerjee in the house. The ruling TMC bagged 213 seats while Indian Secular Front emerged victorious in one assembly segment and an Independent R S Lepcha, belonging to the Binay Tamang faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) won from Kalimpong. Congress and the Left party drew a blank. Voting in two assembly segments will take place in future. Since BJP has the overwhelming numbers in the opposition camp, Adhikari becomes the leader of opposition in the house, party President Dilip Ghosh later told reporters at a media briefing. While 22 MLAs present at the meeting pledged support to Adhikari, those absent were either on the side of the workers facing TMC attack in the districts while two are down with Covid, Ghosh said when asked about the reason why not all the MLAs were present at the meeting. "If others don't oppose the selection that means they are supporting the name proposed. It is not mandatory for every single legislator to pledge support vocally," Adhikari, who was present, said. Senior leader Mukul Roy, who was elected from an assembly segment in Nadia district, said "Suvendu will lead BJP to greater height in the house and fight the misdeeds of ruling party in state." Roy once considered number two in the TMC, was the saffron party's chief architect in driving away many legislators from the ruling camp to them. Adhikari said "I have been MLA since 2006. I have seen arrogance of the then CPI(M) led regime. We have to constructively perform the role of opposition in the assembly adhering to parliamentary norms." He said the BJP will continue to take up the issue of Trinamool Congress attack on political rivals, the terror unleashed by the TMC and fight for democratic right of every citizen. Union minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad and Bhupendra Yadav were the observers at the election of Adhikari as BJP legislature party leader. Adhikari had won the elections from Nandigram assembly seat, defeating his former boss-turned-political adversary Mamata Banerjee by a narrow margin of over 1900 votes. Adhikari was one of the key associates of Banerjee during the Nandigram land movement in 2007-08 and was instrumental in the formation of anti-land acquisition committee formed in 2007 which launched a fierce struggle foiling the bid of the then Buddhadeb Bhattacharya government to set up a petrochemical hub in the area acquiring thousands of acres of farm land. A former state minister, having handled several key portfolios including transport and environment, Adhikari had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-chosen-opposition-leader-to-take-on-mamata-in-west-bengal-house-101620648539742.html
10-05-2021||Jaipur||Follow lockdown guidelines with sincerity, Rajasthan CM Gehlot tells people||As a strict lockdown came into force in Rajasthan from Monday to curb the spread of coronavirus, chief minister Ashok Gehlot asked the people of the state to follow the guidelines with sincerity and responsibility. Lockdown restrictions were already there in the state but the state government on last Thursday decided to make it more stringent from May 10 to 24. Gehlot tweeted the lockdown guidelines, saying there is a complete lockdown from 5 am on May 10 to 5 am on May 24. He asked the people of the state to follow the guidelines with sincerity and responsibility. Under the complete lockdown, movement from one district/village to another district/village except in case of medical emergency, wedding functions, movement of all vehicles except those engaged in medical services are prohibited and several other restrictions are also there in addition to the guidelines issued earlier. The state government has called it "Pandemic Red Alert Public Discipline Lockdown".Places of worship are also closed, MGNREGA works have been suspended and movement from one city/village to another city/village within the state is prohibited, except medical emergency cases, under the lockdown. Those coming from outside the state will have to produce a negative RT-PCR test report which should be not older than 72 hours. In case there is no negative report, the person will be quarantined for 15 days.In order to prevent migration of workers, works are permitted in factories, construction sites and industrial units have been asked to operate buses for workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/follow-lockdown-guidelines-with-sincerity-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-tells-people-101620647098924.html
10-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan village has unique punishment for those violating Covid-19 norms||A small village in Rajasthan’s Dholpur is punishing villagers, who do not wear face masks, by making them stand guard at village check-posts in its bid to enforce Covid appropriate behaviour.The villagers of Kaithri in Dholpur say the punishment serves a message to the community that one person’s complacency cannot be allowed to put others life at grave risk at a time when nearby towns in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh are struggling to contain Covid cases with hospitals overflowing with patients.“Simple admonishments don’t work. We had some people within the village who shrugged off the gravity [of the situation] by calling Coronavirus an illness confined only to big cities. Therefore, we started community services at check posts to drive home the point that no one is immune from the illness and the attendant suffering,” said sarpanch Ajay Pal Sharma.Rajasthan recorded 159 deaths and 17,921 coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the death toll to 5,665 and the infection tally to 756,707. A strict lockdown till May 24 has come into force in the state from Monday restricting movement from one district/village to another except in case of medical emergency. Movement of all vehicles except those engaged in medical services is also prohibited.According to Kaithri sarpanch, in the last one week, as many as 28 villagers have been made to man the check posts since they didn’t wear masks properly. Apart from standing guard at the check-posts, they are instructed to spread awareness about the importance of social distancing and sanitisation in fighting the disease.Sharma said they realised the need for taking serious steps after noticing that several villagers continued to act irresponsibly despite 11 residents testing positive last month. “We held a meeting that something needed to be done, so we decided to set-up barricades for outsiders, and for people within the village, a two-day duty at the check posts was agreed upon.”The ideas seemed to have worked, at least for now, says the sarpanch Most of the villagers stepping out of their homes are now wearing proper masks or covering their faces with Gamchaas. The village has not reported any fresh case of Covid-19, and all the 11 patients have recovered too.According to the district collector Rakesh Kumar Jaiswal, Kaithri has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. “The village has a very good vaccination record; they also undertake regular sanitization work. The efforts at the panchayat level will go in a long way in our collective fight against the coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-village-has-unique-punishment-for-those-violating-covid-19-norms-101620646698607.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||'Mark of Centre’s failure': Sena on Supreme Court-constituted Covid task force||Shiv Sena on Monday said that the appointment of a 12-member task force of experts by the Supreme Court to tackle to monitor oxygen allocation amid the second Covid-19 wave in the country is a mark of failure of the Narendra Modi-led government. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that the apex court-formed panel will now breathe life into the collapsed health infrastructure in the country.“The Supreme Court has now taken steps, but the rulers of the country are still stuck in politics. They are busy in selecting Assam chief minister. Even though Mamata Banerjee has won the West Bengal election, they are busy whiling away time to not let her run her administration. What will happen to people who are choking to death at such a time? Who is their saviour? Supreme Court has now appointed a 12-member task force of experts in this war against coronavirus. This task force will now breathe life into the collapsed health infrastructure,” the editorial said.Criticising the Centre for lack of planning in managing medical oxygen supply, it said, “Like the situation in Delhi, the crisis is bad in other parts of the country. The nation did not chalk out any supply management plan of medical oxygen. The guidelines will now be prepared by the 12-member task force. Despite getting oxygen from other countries, the situation has remained the same… States such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are counting their dead.”Also Read | Supreme Court-appointed task force holds first meetingThe editorial also slammed Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for staging protests in West Bengal without wearing a mask. “Vaccines, drugs are being black-marketed and Dr Harsh Vardhan is staging protests on the streets of West Bengal without wearing a mask...It seems the health ministry does not know how bad the situation has deteriorated in the country. Therefore, the Supreme Court gave it anaesthesia and gave the responsibility of the war against Covid to the national panel,” it said.Countering the attack, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it was the Centre that suggested the formation of the panel of experts to the apex court and not the other way around. “Today’s editorial is based on the court-appointed panel. But the Centre itself had suggested formation of such a panel. Only Saamana can write an editorial without reading the proceedings. Sanjay Raut’s only task is to criticise the Centre... he should at least get accurate details,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/supreme-court-constituted-covid-task-force-a-mark-of-centre-s-failuresena-101620645078425.html

This is still a world record,” he said.The then JD-led government faced many difficulties, “but the government overcame all the obstacles with its firm determination...It is unfortunate that the present government being led by one with the reputation of being Vishwaguru is unable to arrange the required number of vaccines even after charging the common people for the jabs,” he said.The Centre drew flak from the Supreme Court as well for differential pricing of Covid vaccine for the Centre and the state governments.

10-05-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: The political economy of the Marathas in Maharashtra||Last week when the Supreme Court quashed reservation in jobs and education to Maharashtra’s politically dominant Marathas, every political party came forward to position itself. Understandably so, political outfits cannot afford to be seen against Marathas that constitute almost 33 per cent, including Kunbi-Marathas, of the overall population in the state. For the community, the verdict by the five-member constitution bench is a setback as its finds itself fragmenting among various groups with loyalty to different political parties. The community has over the decades retained its clout in Maharashtra’s politics, keeping its power share intact. If Maharashtra has had more than 60 per cent of its chief ministers from the Marathas, the community has a fair representation in the cabinet or in the state assembly. Over the years, its politics is shaped by identity where Hindutva and caste have been at the core. On the economic front, Marathas are a stratified community. Dalit write Anand Teltumbde, who has written extensively on caste system in India, has observed in his Economic and Political weekly piece that Marathas have witnessed threea -fold stratification. The lowest at the hierarchy are either land-less or marginal farmers. They are mostly from Maharashtra’s Marathwada and account for the largest number within the community. It’s for the same reason, the demand for reservation gained maximum traction in this region. It is for this section many political parties have sought reservation, citing they account for a majority of the community. The same class, attracted towards caste- based outfits such as Maratha Mahasangh, Sambhaji brigade and Chhawa, has largely remained dissatisfied with those within the community holding on to power. This section is largely trapped in the agriculture sector without access to urban resources. The Gaikwad Commission constituted by the then Devendra Fadnavis government in its report had highlighted that a large section of Marathas are economically and educationally backward. The Supreme Court, however, found no merit in exceeding the existing 50 per cent ceiling of quota, which could have accommodated Marathas. In the middle are those having control over land and resources through various institutes like cooperatives and credit societies. Many in this category have control over rural credit and banking. There are many in this category whose next generation has migrated to bigger cities such as Pune and Mumbai for jobs. In the cities though, this section has not been able to dominate the economy. On the contrary, many have had to settle for a secondary position, not in consonance with Maratha pride. The top category in the Maratha stratification is one that has direct control over power. This section, no matter which party is in government, has enjoyed the fruits of power. This has at times led to increasing gap between Maratha elite and the community, with the former using identity politics to gain power without ensuring the benefits reach the community at large. Since 1950s till the 1980s, this class was with Congress party. However, as party’s political fortunes begun to change, the section within the community shifted to first Shiv Sena, then Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and later to BJP. In 2014, many among Maratha-Kunbi voted for BJP. In their paper, prominent political scientists Rajeshwari Deshpande and Suhas Palshikar observed: “The discursive space of backwardness on the one hand facilitates a suitable construction of caste ideology that covers up material deprivations at least in a tokenist manner and also keeps intact the consensus around the theme of social justice. On the other hand, the Mandal discourse legitimises caste as a political category and creates small openings within practices of democracy, for assertions of traditional caste dominance. This is what the Marathas attempted during the more recent times — despite, but also, because of their dominant political position in the state.” Today, the community that assumed control of the state’s political apparatus seeks tag of backwardness as many within it couldn’t taste the benefits of post-globalisation economy. While the community draws its dominance from the caste cluster of Marathas and Kunbis, which makes its numerically strong, economically, a large section of it hasn’t been able to achieve material growth.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Covaxin doses to last a day, Covishield 3-4 days: Health minister Jain||Delhi’s stock of Covaxin will last only a day and that of Covishield will last three to four days, according to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. “There are two vaccines available in India; we have stock for just one day for one and for three or four days for the other. Covaxin stock will last a day and Covishield three or four days,” said Jain during his visit to a 400-bed Covid facility at Guruwara Rakab Ganj Sahib. There were just 274,460 doses – both Covaxin and Covishield – meant for those between the ages of 18 and 44 years purchased by the state as on May 9. There were 467,190 doses allocated by the Centre meant for those above the ages of 45 years, healthcare workers, and frontline workers till May 9. As per Centre’s directives, the states have to use 70% of these doses to give the second shot to those who have already received one.Also Read | 400-bed Covid care centre at Gurudwara Rakab Ganj to begin operations todayDelhi has been giving nearly 95,000 shots a day during the last week, according to data shared by the government. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday, stating that the government must come up with a uniform price for the vaccine doses as states and private hospitals were competing for the same supply. The companies have to provide 50% of their manufactured doses to the Centre. “A uniform price should be fixed for vaccines for supplies made to governments (Central or state) and to private hospitals. The inherent fallacy and danger in the current pricing mechanism is that there is an obvious incentive for private manufacturers to prioritise supplies to private hospitals over supplies being made to governments since under the current mechanism they will earn more from the latter,” the letter read. Meanwhile, the Centre has justified in the Supreme Court its Covid-19 vaccination policy, saying its response and strategy is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion which leaves little room for judicial interference and emphasised that citizens of all age groups will get free vaccination throughout the country.In 218-page affidavit filed late Sunday night in the top court’s suo motu case on Covid-19 management, the Centre said, this policy “conforms to mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, state government and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by this Court as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the executive does have a room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest”.

While several schools run by the Delhi government and civic bodies have been functioning as isolation centres for Covid-19 patients, this is the first time a private school has set up a Covid care facility on its premises in the national Capital. Michael Williams, dean of Mount Carmel Schools, said that last week his father and founder of these schools, VK Williams, passed away due to Covid-19. His mother is fighting the disease. “The work on setting up such a facility had begun a month ago. People from over 100 churches across Delhi decided to turn minority schools into Covid care facilities to help the city amid this pandemic. The school buildings are anyway shut these days due to the pandemic...We chose Mount Carmel as the first school for such an initiative… My father passed away while fighting Covid last week and that’s why we decided to name the facility after him. If this experiment works, we will roll it out in other minority schools in Delhi,” he said.Also Read | Fire erupts at Delhi lab conducting over 1,000 RT-PCR Covid-19 tests dailyThe facility will admit Covid patients with mild symptoms.

Our friends from South Korea have gifted us two oxygen generator plants that will be up and running by this weekend. We can then generate our own oxygen for these facilities,” Williams said.There will be 75 volunteers, including doctors, and nurses from Christian hospitals, working with the school administration. “Four full-time doctors with nursing staff will be there round the clock. Other doctors will be available for tele-consultation...The facility is meant for people with mild to moderate symptoms and hence, there will be little intervention of doctors.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Covid positive, no more: DU hostellers share recovery tales||Being in the comfort of your home when battling Covid-19 is one thing, and being alone in a hostel or rented accommodation is another. “The most scary thing was standing all alone in line in a Covid testing line in a Delhi hospital. I was trembling with fear, hearing other people say things like ‘I don’t want to die’, ‘I’m here to re-check my results’, ‘I don’t want to infect my family’ etc.” This is what most hostellers of Delhi University went through, who were away from their families when infected by coronavirus. Yet, they went on to defeat Covid! Being mentally strong, at a time when they were away from their loved ones, wasn’t easy. “Being with your family is always a blessing, it makes you stronger than any sort of medicines or medications, however we didn’t have that privilege so we had to make the best use of what was at our disposal,” says Ranjan Kumar, a PhD student who is a resident of Gwyer Hall hostel. Kumar adds, “My friends and the hostel authorities went out of their way to help me with medicines, food and everything, when I was self isolated, and that kept me upbeat! I’m grateful to the hostel administration for their support during this crisis; they converted the Teacher Court (TC) to Doctor Court (DC) — a separate ward in hostel for quarantining of students where they don’t have to use the common facilities. Starting from water to food supply, everything was nicely maintained. And most importantly, the main authority like the Provost, Warden and Section Officer of the hostel were always active and connected with me over chat and call to check on my health. This made me feel cared for, and my fellow hostellers and hostel authorities became my extended family. I recovered with their help, with good food and medicines. Talking heart to heart with others is extremely important when you’re scared and Covid positive.” For Avinash Chandra, a master’s student residing in Post Graduate Men’s Hostel, DU, it was knowledge that came as a source of comfort. “I missed my family during quarantine, but knew that ultimately I couldn’t travel in these conditions. So I spent most of my time resting or on video calls with my bhaiya, didi, and mummy. Connecting with them virtually made me feel supported in crisis. I recommend every hosteller or those who are not with their families and battling this virus, to communicate frequently and open up to their family members,” says Chandra, whose hostel authorities ensured that he gets regular access to kaadha, turmeric milk, and fresh fruits. “They even called me from time to time to ask about how I was doing... And I realised that knowledge is power, and used the time to surf online to learn more about Covid and the precautions that one must take. This knowledge comforted me. Besides, I did certain exercises and yoga in my room’s balcony, watched movies and listened to songs that kept me engaged.”For some it’s candid conversations and for others it’s knowledge, which helped them recover well. But for hosteller Shyamjeet Yadav, a PhD student staying at a hostel near DU’s North Campus, it’s yoga and reading that kept him upbeat during his recovery. “My family was in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, and I was battling Covid here in Delhi, all alone. My family was worried, but I told them that I’ll be okay. We need to understand that Covid is not serious in most cases. As my symptoms were controllable, I reassured my folks back home that I’ll be fine. Meanwhile, here, I practised a lot of yoga, including surya namaskar, and meditation. This helped me gain mental strength. I even read many books of my interest, and saw upbeat web series during my quarantine period. It’s all about what you choose to focus on! I focused on positive, upbeat news and practised yoga diligently. Now my family has asked me to come back as soon as I get a negative report,” says Yadav, further advising, “According to the reports, 97% people are recovering themselves. In my hostel, all 15 students who were Covid positive recovered well. So we need to get rid of the panic, take medicines in time, and keep friends virtually close!”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-positive-no-more-du-hostellers-share-recovery-tales-101620628405322.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||DU’s foreign students share their pandemic experiences||Within a few weeks of Delhi University opening admissions for foreign students, the seats have been reportedly filled up, even before the last date. Youngsters hailing from different homelands are ready to bite into the campus life, at a time when the world is engulfed by a pandemic. Exuding extreme mental strength and resilience, the foreign nationals who are presently studying in various colleges, share what makes the DU experience worthwhile, even though the pandemic has curtailed their campus life!Easy to make friends @DUKokoro Okamoto, who hails from Japan and is a student of Psychology (Hons) at Lady Shri Ram College For Women, says: “My experience of the pandemic can be summed up in one word ‘Online classes’, which has been bittersweet. Bitter in the sense that I’m yet to visit my college campus where I’m missing out on the college fun with my friends or eating at the cafe and canteen, meeting new people and definitely the physical essence of the societies that I have joined during the past months. In terms of sweet, being an ambivert, sometimes I love to stay at home and enjoy these online classes where I can attend them at my own comfort zone. Despite having a pandemic year, which was plagued with uncertainty and loneliness, I would recommend DU as a place to be! India is great, wherever you visit, the culture, food and the people you meet are different. This is something that is unique to India and I really want students from other countries to experience these wonderful moments. Moreover, the education here, I believe is great when one compares it in terms of the cost to study in India with countries, because it is relatively affordable. Apart from education, one can learn something valuable like connecting to animals which is rare in other countries and being around with stray dogs and cats really teaches us the importance of their presence. Lastly, this is something I have noticed in my pandemic year that making friends with Indians is very easy and they are willing to become friends with you and help you whenever you struggle, miss your family or are just having a bad day, which made me love this country more.”Stuck in homeland, eager to visit IndiaArefa Mohibe, from Afghanistan, who is pursuing Economics (Hons) at Daulat Ram College, says: “My pandemic experience has been challenging. I prefer physical classes rather than online ones because as foreign students we have many kinds of challenges such as economical issues, internet connectivity, electricity shortage and lack of course materials. These impact our studies as sometimes we miss out some of our classes. Sometimes we need to buy books online, but for many of us it’s difficult to buy them through the internet. I’m in my first year and second semester, so unfortunately I haven’t been able to even come to India yet, and haven’t experienced the physical campus. Those like me who are on a scholarship, have signed an undertaking that unless we are not in India we would not be paid the scholarship stipend, so that’s another challenge. And as a foreign student, I’m really interested to study offline and meet my classmates and teachers and have discussions on our lessons. Hopefully that time will come soon.” #FOMO Complete campus experienceYoutso Rakdo, a Tibetan national pursuing MA in English at Jesus and Mary College, says: “This is my first year at DU, and sadly, I never got to experience the real campus life. I wish things would go back to normal soon. I never got a chance to apply for a hostel since the lockdown started before my admission, but the admission process was quite a breeze. The authorities at Foreign Students’ Registry, DU, were helpful in addressing all my concerns. Most of my professors have been extremely dedicated and try to not let the pandemic jeopardize our education... Online classes for me have been very convenient, I feel like this is where my privilege comes into play. I’ve been lucky to have internet access and electronic devices at my disposal. But nothing can beat the real life experience of a physical class. Especially the environment of my college. I had so many plans for my campus debut. I miss every detail of my college – the food, class, library – all of it looked so interesting on the brochure!”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-foreign-students-share-their-pandemic-experiences-101620628040692.html
10-05-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata’s civic body takes Rapid Antigen Test to doorstep||With Kolkata registering the highest number of new Covid-19 case every day among all districts in West Bengal, the city’s civic body has planned to take Rapid Antigen Test to the doorstep of citizens. “When the first wave hit in 2020, we had seen that many housing societies and high-rise buildings became hot spots of Covid-19. Many had to be declared as containment zones,” said a senior Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) official. With a dedicated helpline, the KMC plans to reach these high-rise buildings and large housing societies. “A dedicated mobile number (9831036572) has been launched for the purpose. Residents living in high-rise buildings and large housing societies can call on this number. If the number of residents is more than 30, the KMC would send a vehicle to conduct tests there,” said a senior official of the civic body.

An example of this is the conferring of a ministerial charge to Akhil Giri, locally known for his Medinipur faction against that of turncoat strongman leader Suvendu Adhikari. Members who toed the party line are also being suitably recognised.According to TMC leaders, Subrata Mukherjee, Partha Chatterjee, Javed Khan, and Moloy Ghatak are among the senior leaders that are likely to return to the cabinet.

10-05-2021||Patna||Bihar to use tamper proof laser technology for quality control of roads||Bihar road construction department (RCD) will now use a “high precision laser-based technology” to check the quality of newly constructed roads and maintenance of old ones to save time, cost and ensure accuracy in assessment.The department till now relied on manual verification of quality control measures as stipulated under the International Roughness Index (IRI), which was not only time-consuming and costly but also prone to fudging. It has now decided to adopt the laser-based network survey vehicle (NSV) technology, recently introduced to check the quality of construction of national highways.Vehicles equipped with NSV technology come with high resolution camera and laser-beam throwing capacity to record and assess the condition of roads beneath the surface. Bihar has around 5,000 km of national highways, 4000km of state highways and around 11,000km of major district roads. Additional chief secretary, RCD, Amrit Lal Meena said the new technology will also ensure that contractors are penalized suitably for not adhering to quality control measures. “Manual inspection of road is a vigorous exercise and costs a huge sum as road maintenance was brought under the Bihar public grievances resolution rights act,” said Meena.Bihar Right to Public Grievance Redressal Act 2015 makes it incumbent on the government agencies to deliver a set of services within a stipulated time, empowering residents with the legal right for hearing of grievances, redressal and of communication on the decision taken.Meena said the department decided to adopt the NSV technology after RCD minister Nitin Navin, during a recent meeting to review various undergoing road projects, asked for speedy disposal of complaints related to poor maintenance of roads.Accordingly, the executive engineers of the department have been told to engage among 41 firms, empanelled by the Union ministry of road transportation and highways (MoRTH), for faster and digitized survey of roads for their timely maintenance.Under the RCD’s maintenance policy, contractors are obligated to maintain roads for seven years after its completion. Meena said the policy also had provisions for high-level inspection of the projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-use-tamper-proof-laser-technology-for-quality-control-of-roads-101620616458074.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Street life in the pandemic||This narrow lane in the Walled City doesn’t go past any historic monument. No beautiful doorway opens into it.And yet, the lane shows so much. Especially these days, with its scenes conveying the oppressiveness and distress of the curfew and coronavirus pandemic.Here’s an anthology of impressions collected over a handful of days.6am: An elderly beggar is sitting on the street-side, his arm resting upon a cloth bundle of what presumably gathers his possessions. The man is without mask, and his back is resting against a shuttered store named Discount Medicura, a pharmacy whose banner announces “free home delivery” and “20 percent discount.” The street is otherwise empty, save for a few cats and dogs.7am: Another beggar is sitting on another part of the street. He is in a mask. A cat settles close to him, but far enough to respect the codes of social distancing, and is staring at him attentively.9am: The aforementioned pharmacy is open. A side-shelf is mostly decked with oximeters. (Until recently, that space was dedicated exclusively to glucometers for the diabetics.) The young man behind the counter is wearing two masks. His phone is playing the film song “Didi tera dewar deewana.”11am: Two men are riding a bike. The man at the back is holding an oxygen cylinder.1pm: A figure hesitantly appears from a side-lane. His mask is falling under his nose. The man has ventured out “because our whole family lives in a one-room house, with no balcony or window. I have come for fresh air.” He is coughing as he speaks.2.30pm: A public announcement of a local resident’s death echoes through the street. It is coming from a mosque.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Working beside docs, nurses, multi-tasking staff lead fight||While the pandemic has thrown doctors and nurses to the forefront of the fight against the infection in the national capital, supporting their efforts are thousands of ward boys, attendants and sanitation staff who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes.In most hospitals across Delhi, at least two such staff, known as multi-tasking staff (MTS), work in each ward in every shift, sharing tasks ranging from serving food to patients to helping clean them or change clothes and clean the wards. Above all, they have also become a medium to connect patients with their families who are not allowed inside Covid wards.Manoj Kumar Paswan (37), a ward attendant at RML hospital, looks after at least 20 patients during his regular morning shift. “First I serve breakfast to all the patients. It’s important for them to eat first so that they take the day’s first dose of medicine. Many of the patients are either very weak or old and require assistance to eat. I also help such patients in changing their diapers, clean them and change their clothes,” he said.Also read | Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh VardhanTirath Ram (44), a helper at the civic-run Swami Dayanand Hospital, said that many patients admitted at the hospital belong to economically weaker sections, who do not own smartphones. He said that he does not hesitate in passing on his phone number to their relatives so that they can be in touch with each other or at least enquire about the well-being of the admitted patients. “Doctors and nurses are busy... Covid symptoms are treated by doctors, I can only provide some mental peace to patients and families that are already stressed,” said Ram.Abhishek Singh, an attendant at Lok Nayak Hospital, said that many a times, patients seek help to make video calls to their family members. “There is hardly any communication... They just want to see their loved ones...It feels good to help,” he said.Suresh (38), who is lovingly called ‘Suni bhaiyya’ at the Hindu Rao Hospital, said that two weeks ago, a 19-year-old patient admitted to the hospital expressed her wish to eat Parle-G biscuits. “She was nearly my sister’s age... I bought her two packets of Parle-G at my own expense. She was so happy... These are the small joys that we hold on to,” Suresh said.Some attendants said they also encountered “misbehaviour” by relatives of patients. A ward attendant in GTB hospital said, “A few days ago, a patient could not be revived as he was brought in very critical. The family members started to abuse us and the nurses. We tried to make them understand but later had to call in security.”Meanwhile, many said the fear and guilt of infecting family members is also on their minds. Shamsher Rai, an attendant at RML hospital who lives with his family of six including elderly parents, said, “Even as I wear PPE kit all the time in the Covid ward, the fear of infection is always there... If people living in big houses are getting infected, what are the chances of a family of six living in a two-room set of not getting the virus?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/working-beside-docs-nurses-multi-tasking-staff-lead-fight-101620598504846.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||Sisodia hits out at Centre for jab exports||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia attacked the Centre on Sunday for sending Covid-19 vaccines to other countries even as India was facing a vaccine shortage, calling it “image management”.“When it was time for our youth to get vaccinated, Delhi government opened centres all across the capital but (the) central government gave only 5.5 lakh vaccines for the youth. 5.5 lakh vaccine for our youth and 6.5 crore vaccine for other nations. These numbers show that our central government doesn’t value the lives of our younger generation,” said Sisodia in a press statement on Sunday.Citing a report in The Indian Express newspaper, Sisodia said the Centre sold coronavirus vaccines to 93 countries of which 60 per cent had Covid-19 under control, and also where there was no threat of loss of life due to the virus.“A report published by Indian Express claimed that (at) a time when Indians were reeling from Covid-19 and deaths, (the) central government, instead of collecting vaccines for India, sold 6.5 crore doses of vaccines to 93 other nations. Upon doing further research, I found out that 60% of these 93 nations have not reported many Covid cases. In fact, 88 of these 93 nations have not reported many deaths and therefore do not see fatality rate as a big challenge,” Sisodia said.“If other nations, countries like Canada, US gathered enough vaccines and prioritised vaccinating their own citizens first, then why did India fall behind? No other nation, except France, exported vaccines to other countries before fully vaccinating its own people. France exported 1 lakh doses after ensuring enough stock for its people,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19 management and inter-ministerial coordination.India has so far supplied over 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, mostly Covishield, to 76 countries. This includes 8.5 million doses provided as grants and commercial supplies of 34 million doses.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiLast month, other opposition parties also attacked the BJP-led Union government for exporting vaccines in the face of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. The government, however, rejected the criticism as “short-sighted”.“If you ask why are you exporting (vaccines) at all, somebody (else) will ask - why am I exporting to India. That is so short-sighted. Only non-serious, irresponsible people can make that argument,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said last month.Close to 1.8 million individuals between 18 and 44 years have received their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, shows Union government data.“Ten states account for 66.78% of the cumulative doses given so far in the country,” said Union health ministry in a statement.As per the recent government data, nearly 500,000 Covid-19 positive cases currently are in the intensive care units (ICUs), with over 170,000 persons on ventilator support at various hospitals across the country, with many more seriously ill patients in need of a hospital bed.There was no response from the Union government and the BJP on Sisodia’s remarks till the time of going to press||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-hits-out-at-centre-for-jab-exports-101620596398168.html
10-05-2021||Other||Now, Ludhiana Covid patients’ kin scramble for oxygen flow meter||While the oxygen crisis is not over yet, the shortage of flow meters has further added to the problems of Covid-19 patients and their kin, who are now left with little chance to catch a breath during their fight against the virus.An oxygen flow meter is a device that measures the flow of oxygen from an oxygen-dispensing unit to the user of the oxygen. The regulator valve usually has gauges like an oxygen flow and a pressure meter. If they are lucky enough to arrange an oxygen cylinder, chances are they may still end up struggling to arrange a flow meter. The shortage of flow meters and regulators can be gauged from the fact that the suppliers of these equipment are now reaching out to those who have successfully defeated Covid-19 so as to buy back the equipment at double the rates.Not only this, but hospitals are also being contacted to see if they have any broken flow meters or regulators that can be fixed.Lockdown hits supplyRishi Sood, a medical equipment trader, said, “It is an unprecedented situation. Like tocilizumab and remdesivir, there is now an acute shortage of oxygen flow meters and regulators, an essential product to operate the oxygen cylinder.”“The equipment was being supplied from Delhi and Kolkata but due to the lockdown in many places, many of the products are stuck in transit. Now, there is a waiting period of nearly a month for delivery of fresh stock,” said Sood.While the flow meter made in Kolkata is costlier, the ones made in Delhi are sold at affordable rates, said Sood. Hoarding, panic-buying also a problemAccording to Ludhiana district chemist association general secretary GS Grover, hoarding and black-marketing are also leading to the shortage. The equipment which was being sold for ₹1,000 a few months ago is now being sold for ₹2, 500 to ₹3,000 in wholesale markets and for nearly ₹10,000 in retail markets. Rishi Sood added that panic buying is also to be blamed. “Earlier, only those patients who were sick and required oxygen used to buy the product but now residents are indulging in panic- buying, which has also resulted in a shortage,” said Sood. ‘No luck online too’ Vikas Malhotra, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “I tried medical shops near Dayanand Medical College and Hospital but no one seemed to have a flow meter. I even tried my luck online but it was not available there either. Finally, a friend sourced it through one of his contacts.” Punjab chemist association general secretary GS Chawla said, “The government must look into the matter and take action against those indulging in hoarding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-ludhiana-covid-patients-kin-scramble-for-oxygen-flow-meter-101620592755956.html

He alleged that the even before the completion of the harvesting season, the government agencies had stopped the procurement on April 30 and several farmers from the state failed to sell their produce. “Farmers are telling us that their produce was not procured even after they had got the gate passes as the government stopped procurement without any prior intimation,” he added. He demanded the government to immediately resume the procurement so that all farmers could sell their produce on MSP.“This is another cruelty of the government on the farmers, but we warn the government of another protest if the procurement is not resumed immediately,” he added.The Haryana government had recently announced that said there would be no procurement of wheat in all mandis of the state during the lockdown and no gate passes will be issued. In a statement issued by the government on Thursday, total 83.49 lakh MT of wheat had arrived in 396 mandis of the state during this season and the government agencies had already procured 80.72 lakh MT wheat against the target of 80 lakh MT. Even an amount of ₹12,977 crore was directly deposited in the verified accounts of the farmers, the government claimed.Though the government did not mention whether the procurement will be resumed after the lockdown or not, the arhtiyas alleged that thousands of quintals of unprocured wheat was lying in the mandis since the government agencies stopped the procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bkuchief-charuni-warns-of-agitation-if-wheat-procurement-not-resumed-101620592338816.html

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Residents of Bhiwani village impose self-lockdown||Residents of Mundhal Khurd in Bhiwani have imposed a self-lockdown till May 13 after the village witnessed a surge in unreported deaths in the last two weeks. The decision was taken after prominent persons, elderly people and youths held a meeting recently and decided to ban the entry of outsiders.To break the chain, the villagers announced that all shops, except those selling medicines, will be opened from 7 am to 10 am till May 13. The medical stores will remain functional round the clock. Sarpanch Vijay Pal, who is leading the village until new panchayat forms, said more than 35 deaths were reported in the village in the last two weeks.“Entire village is suffering from fever, cough and cold. We have written to the DC to start testing in the village. Most of those who succumbed were people who had fever, but remained reluctant to get themselves tested. The health department had cremated bodies of five persons with Covid protocol at village crematorium. Many fatalities were Covid suspected deaths. We have no other option than to impose self-lockdown,” he added.The villagers have also restricted gathering of those playing cards and smoking ‘hookah’ has been banned across the village. “We have been demanding a hospital for a cluster of three villages here, but the government has not paid heeds to our demands. The village has a population of 15,000 and still there is no government hospital here. The primary health centres are at Dhanana and Talu villages, both 10km away from here,” the villagers said.Health department starts testingThe health department on Sunday collected 80 samples, reports of which are awaited. The sampling process will continue for the next couple of days, said officials.Bhiwani DC Rahul Narwal said they have also got information about the deaths at Mundhal Khurd village, but as per their record, only two persons died of Covid there. “The exact number of deaths will be ascertained after the families of the deceased register their deaths. The families will have to register the data within a month. We have started the sampling process and the true picture about the transmission of the virus will be known after the testing report comes out,” he added.Nine cremations in a single day in Rohtak villageNine pyres were burnt at Rohtak’s Madina village crematorium on Saturday. Former Congress’ Meham MLA Anand Singh Dangi, who hails from the same village, said he had visited the houses of these nine persons, who died on Saturday.“Most of them were suffering from fever. Our village has reported more than 42 deaths in the last three weeks. I have requested the administration to provide oxygen beds at the community health centre at Madina, but my pleas were turned down. Seven to eight people have died due to Covid in various private hospitals,” he added.Sarpanch Karambir Foji said villagers are reluctant to get themselves tested and people have fear of Covid. “In the history of our village, we had never witnessed more than 40 deaths in three weeks. We are urging people to appear for testing and vaccination,” he added.Senior medical officer Dr Joginder, who is in charge of the village, said there has been a rise in deaths and the sarpanch can provide actual figures.“Some people had died of Covid too. We would be able to say more about total deaths after registration only. Nine deaths were reported on Saturday. The people are suffering from fever here. More people are coming forward for vaccination than testing. The situation in this village is challengeable as compared to other villages,” he added. In Karnal, 200 MBBS students to offer tele-consultation to patients in isolation With the help of 200 MBBS final-year students, the Karnal district administration has launched a home care and tele-consultation system to provide medical assistance to Covid patients isolated at home. As per the health authorities, the initiative will help to avoid hospitalisation of non-critical patients.Karnal DC Nishant Kumar Yadav said the MBBS students of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital have been given proper training and they will dial all home-isolated patients to provide them all required information and medical assistant over phone.“Over 92% patients don’t require hospitalisation and MBBS students will talk to all home isolated patients regularly,” he said, adding that if required, they will also advise them when to seek hospital admission. He said that one student will have list of 25 patients and they will track their medical records regularly. As per the information, the district administration was facing shortage of hospital beds and now, all 500 beds with oxygen support and 220 beds in ICUs are already occupied. The district administration has set up 100-bed temporary hospitals in Panchayat Bhawan to accommodate more patients.

This arrangement has been continuing even when there is a provision of hiring lawyers for court cases and sufficient clerical staff is available with the directorate after re-structuring of posts from February onwards,” the official said.State medical education minister OP Soni said the services of the doctors posted anywhere on deputation are required in the field to fight the pandemic.“The directions have already been issued to the director of medical education and research to relieve these doctors and send them to their parent departments immediately.

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mansa admn ropes in quacks to contain virus spread in villages||Amid surge in Covid infections, the Mansa district authorities have started roping in quacks to serve as the first line of defence in the battle against the virus. Quacks are unqualified rural healthcare practitioners who are often consulted by villagers for most ailments.Mansa, predominantly a rural district, has reported 2,766 infections and 24 deaths since May 1. The district has 3,003 active cases of which, around 2,000 are from the rural belt. The authorities say the trend is alarming but the situation is more serious as villagers are not sharing their health conditions. Additional deputy commissioner (development) Amarpreet Kaur Sandhu, who is coordinating Covid management at the district level, said villages have seen a spurt in Covid-related deaths in the last 15 days. “Narinderpur and Nangal are among two villages where several deaths were reported due to suspected Covid infection in the last fortnight. People are reluctant to respond to government medical teams for testing and medication. Since Tuesday, we engaged three quacks of Narinderpur to supply Covid kits to ailing villagers and they have been asked to administer medicines as per the pandemic protocol,” said Sandhu.Mansa is a hotbed of farmer union activities and people from the rural areas of the district have a significant presence at dharna sites on the Delhi border.Sandhu said more quacks will be taken on board in other villages to contain the virus. She, however, clarified that untrained workers are not treating Covid patients.“Scores of people of these two villages are frequently attending dharnas and falling sick. As people are not going for vaccination and testing, we decided to take the assistance of quacks to handle the situation. People in the area traditionally rely upon these unqualified healthcare providers and we have started taking their help to contain infection spread,” said the ADC.Village panchayats have been roped in to provide thermometers to ailing persons and motivating sick villagers to practice home isolation, besides boosting immunity with simple home remedies. Sick patients are also being provided health supplements through quacks and it is being ensured that these untrained resources do not offer un-prescribed medication to the suspected Covid patients, he said. “Against an estimated target of 3 lakh population above 45 years in the district, only 54,000 have come forward for vaccination to date. It is a cause of concern that people are frequently attending protests and Covid guidelines are not being followed,” said Mansa civil surgeon Dr Sukhwinder Singh.He said community leaders should come out to make people understand the gravity of the medical emergency and ask them to follow instructions to break the virus chain.“Fully occupied hospitals and lack of space at cremation grounds reflect the ground reality of infection spread. But unfortunately, a sizeable section of Mansa population continue to underestimate the major threat of Covid infection,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mansa-admn-ropes-in-quacks-to-contain-virus-spread-in-villages-101620590655457.html

He is scheduled to leave for Mumbai on Monday and will serve at the facility for the next couple of weeks.A specialist in anaesthesiology and critical care, Dr Harman, who did his MBBS in Amritsar Government Medical College before moving to New York in 2011, has also imparted training to many doctors and nurses in the holy city, especially at Dukh Niwaran Hospital, at par with the modalities being used in New York hospitals. He returned to India on April 1 this year.Harman says he would continue extending his help to all those in need until the situation becomes normal in India. His father, RPS Boparai, is an orthopaedic specialist, while his mother, late Gian Kaur, was a gynaecologist. Harman said his mother, who passed away in 2011, had inculcated the value of sewa (volunteer service) in him during his childhood and young age.“As soon as I came back to India, though the cases were not so high at the time, I started talking to the doctors here on how we can build capacity in case cases surge, apart from strengthening the infrastructure to handle any kind of crisis. Soon enough, we saw a catastrophic rises in the cases in India. I have been able to build a capacity for intensive care at Dukh Niwaran Hospital, besides imparting training to the nurses and doctors regarding the Covid protocol that I learnt in New York during the first wave,” Harman said.Dukh Niwaran Hospital, which has now been given on lease, was run by Harman’s father as a charitable hospital.Sharing his views on India’s Covid situation, he said, “We have not been able to contain the spread of the virus for various reasons here, even though we had time to prepare for the bad waves as were seen across the world earlier. We could have vaccinated many more people so far. But, due to issues in the system, help couldn’t reach many in time.”He said, “Doctors in the health department, especially in Punjab, have been working so hard in order to save lives. We must continue to support them and give them our best wishes and solidarity, for this is not an easy job.”He also advocated imposing lockdown to break the chain of transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indianamerican-sikh-doctor-returns-to-roots-to-assist-in-covid-fight-101620590595656.html

Reading the HC orders on April 9, the state government spokesperson observed that as per direction, the investigation of these FIRs will be concluded expeditiously, preferably within six months from the date of the constitution of the SIT. “This court direction has been reproduced in the SIT re-constitution notification by the state government, which has been specifically barred from interfering in any manner,” added the spokesperson, further clarifying that as evident from the court directive, the period of six months is an upper limit which has been imposed by the HC, the spokesperson pointed out, adding that the SIT is free to conclude investigation before that. Reacting to criticism of the government on the six-month deadline, the spokesperson said it was clear that the notification, and the intent, of the state government had been misread and misconstrued by certain elements, motivated by vested political interests. The spokesperson further said that the SIT had already conducted its first meeting virtually on May 8, a day after it was constituted, and started the process of investigations by summoning the case file and other relevant records from the Faridkot court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-new-sit-free-to-conclude-probe-before-six-months-says-govt-101620590235470.html

It is too early to say anything. The trend has to be observed for at least 10-15 days,” said Dr Kant.According to the bulletin, 61,552 total tests were recorded on Sunday – as against an average of 73,657 tests each day over the previous two weeks.However, it must be noted that tests generally dip on the Sunday and Monday health bulletins owing to the weekend.Epidemiologist Dr PK Sharma, adviser to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said: “It is good that the number of cases and the positivity rate have come down, but we should wait for some time before drawing any conclusion.

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||30% jump in demand in May so far, Punjab on verge of oxygen crisis||With a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in the past two weeks, Punjab is on the verge of an oxygen crisis. The rising trajectory of coronavirus cases has led to a jump of more than 30% in demand of the life-saving resource, depleting its oxygen reserve to an all-time low of 10 to 12 hours during the devastating second wave of the pandemic. The oxygen allocation, which stands at 227 metric tonne (MT), has failed to keep pace with the rising demand despite repeated requests to the central government which has been flooded with similar requests from other states as the number of new infections is also at an all-time high in the country. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who has repeatedly requested the central government to increase its oxygen allocation, on Sunday again urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to increase Punjab’s total oxygen quota to 300 MT in view of the growing caseload of critically ill coronavirus patients. “The oxygen demand has risen by more than 60 MT in the past eight days whereas our allocation has only increased by 10 MT. We have been managing so far by enhancing efficiency and dipping into reserve. If the patient load does not plateau and the increase does not keep pace, we are headed for tough times,” Ajoy Sharma, in-charge of Punjab’s Covid control room, said. Of the total allocation of 227 MT, 195 MT is from other states, including 90 MT from Bokaro, 15 MT from Roorkee, 10 MT from Dehradun, 20 MT from Panipat and 60 MT from Barotiwala and there lies another problem. The state authorities have not been able to lift their entire allocated quota, particularly from Bokaro, for want of tankers of lifting and distribution of oxygen. The state government had on its own arranged 21 tankers for lifting and distribution of oxygen, excluding tankers bound by contractual obligations of the plants from adjacent states that make direct supply to some hospitals, but needed more. A request was made to the central government to supply at least 20 tankers and two were given through Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL). “Against a total requirement of 36 tankers at present, only 20 are available, leaving a shortfall of 16 tankers, particularly needed to lift liquid medical oxygen from Bokaro,” according to officials. They said the state government has also called immediate attention to the need for immediate resolution of logistical issues, tankers and IAF sorties and for lifting the allocated Bokaro stock. “We have increased the number of tankers to Bokaro from two to four, but need more as turnaround time is four days,” said Sharma. The state team, which has requested for at least two sorties daily, held a virtual meeting on Sunday morning with IAF officials to review the situation and is also trying to explore train options. Also, the Centre has been requested to make oxygen allocation to the state from nearby sources and not from far off states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/30-jump-in-demand-in-may-so-far-punjab-on-verge-of-oxygen-crisis-101620589935526.html

After killing the doctor at their residence in Chhatarpur’s Loknathpuram on April 29, she left for Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh the next morning and reported the death on May 1 after returning home.The SP said: “Dr Neeraj Pathak was found dead at his residence on May 1. His wife Mamta told the police that she had gone to Jhansi and when she came back on May 1, she found her husband dead. During investigation, police found an audio of Dr Pathak, which he had released on social media on April 28, that he was being harassed by his wife Mamta and son. When police interrogated Mamta, she confessed that she killed her husband by plotting electrocution.”The police are investigating if the couple’s 28-year-old son, Nitesh, was also involved in the murder.Sharma added: “Mamta was a professor of chemistry and she knew that the presence of sleeping pills or any poison wouldn’t be found in the postmortem report after two days of the death, so she made a plan to hide the death of her husband for two days. She gave an overdose of sleeping pills to Pathak on April 29 and later used a live electric wire to kill him inside their bedroom.”A forensic expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said it’s not necessary that traces of chemicals found in sleeping pills won’t show up in postmortem report as it could depend on several factors.The next day, the accused and her son left for Jhansi, reportedly to get tested for Covid-19. According to Mamata’s statement to the police, there was a backlog in collection of samples for Covid-19 testing in Chhatarpur.According to her statement to the police, the retired professor told Nitesh while leaving that his father was sleeping. Mamata and Nitesh returned home on May 1, when the accused reported that her husband died after being electrocuted.“Mamta suspected that her husband was in a relationship with another woman. A few months back, she lodged a complaint with police that her husband used to give sedatives to her in the night to meet a woman. Police investigated the matter and found the accusation to be false,” Sharma said.The 60-year-old woman has been booked under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).(With inputs from HT Correspondent in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/retd-chemistry-professor-kills-doctor-husband-101620589608751.html

Now it has been extended till 5am next Monday,” Kejriwal said at an online press briefing on Sunday.He added that the “enforcement of the lockdown” will be stepped up and operations of the Delhi Metro -- which had been available for people engaged in providing essential services until now -- will be “completely shut down”.“We must remember jaan hai toh jahan hai... this time the lockdown will be stricter,” he said.Later in the day, an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, said: “Delhi metro services shall not function during curfew.”The order also prohibited any wedding ceremony at hotels, banquet halls, marriage halls or public spaces. Instead, such events can only be held in courts and in private spaces with a maximum gathering of 20 people, the DDMA order -- a copy of which has been reviewed by HT -- said.Also read | No metro, 20 people in weddings: Delhi to see stricter lockdown till May 17With Sunday’s announcement, Delhi has extended its lockdown for the third consecutive time, although this is the first instance of restrictions being tightened in this wave. The new restrictions will remain in place till 5am on May 17.Under the ongoing lockdown that was first imposed on April 20, when the city was well into its fourth wave of infections, a curfew was imposed except for specific activities (such as going to buy groceries and medicines, or for going to a hospital or airports/railway stations) but all essential services like food and medicine shops were allowed to operate.Weddings were previously allowed in banquet halls and hotels, but the gatherings were limited to 50 guests. Metro services were previously open for people engaged in essential activities and were running with 50% seating capacity.Kejriwal also said on Sunday the extension of the lockdown was necessary to further augment Delhi’s public health infrastructure as the city’s latest surge in Covid-19 cases inundated medical facilities and triggered an acute shortage of life-saving supplies such as oxygen and drugs.“On April 20, we were forced to impose a lockdown because of an unprecedented increase in Covid-19 cases. We were also running out of beds, ICUs, etc. On April 26, the positivity rate increased to 35%. After April 26, because of the lockdown, the situation slowly started improving. Positivity rate has now reduced to 23%... We cannot afford to go back to a worse situation from this stage. The situation has to be further controlled,” the chief minister said.On Sunday, Delhi added 13,336 new cases (fewer than its daily average of 19,383 for the previous seven days on account of low level of testing on weekends) and 273 deaths.The test-positivity rate -- which refers to the proportion of samples tested for Covid-19 returning positive -- also dropped to 21.67%, the lowest in 23 days, data from the government’s daily health bulletin issued on Sunday showed.Also read | 'Need 83 lakh Covid doses every month': Kejriwal explains 3-month plan to CentreDespite indicators of the situation easing, there are still 86,232 active cases in the city and a majority of hospital beds occupied. Of the total 22,545 beds across the Capital, 19,912 are occupied and 2,633 vacant.“We used the lockdown period to strengthen health infrastructure. Oxygen beds were added. We need to continue doing that. We also faced a severe shortage of oxygen because of the high number of cases and high proportion of severe cases compared to the past three waves. Now the oxygen situation has slightly improved with the interference of the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court, and cooperation of the central government,” the chief minister said.Burdened by the massive caseload, hospitals across the national capital sent out several distress calls, resorting even to making appeals on social media websites, as their stocks of medical oxygen dwindled rapidly from the third week of April.Police authorities will ensure effective checking of persons and vehicles on roads by putting an adequate number of pickets, the DDMA order said. “Delhi Police will also ensure that movement of individuals and vehicles should be allowed strictly as per the guidelines/protocols prescribed in the curfew order,” it added.Traders on Sunday welcomed the Delhi government’s move to introduce more curbs, but raised concerns over enforcement.Praveen Khandelwal, national secretary-general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said: “There is huge movement of people without any checking. Not only shops but all kinds of activities, except essential commodities, should remain locked down. All the borders of Delhi should be equipped with strict checking of individuals and vehicles. Strict vigilance is required at airports, railway stations, bus terminals, etc.”Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry and an Aam Aadmi Party leader, said: “We did a survey of 480 traders across the city and 65% of them were in favour of increasing the lockdown for another week. Large number of traders have assured that they will adhere to all regulations concerning the lockdown.”Watch | India receives 3 oxygen generators, 1000 ventilators arrive from UKBanquet hall owners, however, said their businesses will take an even bigger hit. “We were told that the curfew was temporary. Both the chief minister and LG had requested people to not leave the city. Our staff that had stayed back has nowhere to go now. Our earnings have come to a halt and with so much uncertainty, we are not sure if we can continue to pay their salaries anymore,” said Ramesh Dang, president of the Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi.Greesh Bindra, vice-president, operations, The Suryaa, also said that the hotel will push for the deferment of wedding ceremonies. “We will not refund the money but give an option to the customer so that they can come back to us once the curfew is over. The advance amount paid for blocking the date is never refundable,” he said.Kejriwal spoke of the city’s vaccination drive on Sunday and again appealed the Centre to provide more doses to the Delhi government. “The vaccine drive has also been expanded now. All arrangements are in place and turnout is high. There is a shortage of stock but we have sought help from the central government in this regard and we are sure this will be resolved soon,” he said.“The situation in Delhi is not under control yet. Patients are not getting hospital beds, ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, medicines, etc. Even though the Covid-19 numbers and positivity rate are going down, as per the government’s health bulletins, it is too early to draw conclusions. Delhi needs more time to bring the situation under control. It is extremely necessary to minimise gatherings, crowds and the possibility of large number of people in any space. The lockdown is an important step in that regard,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.(With inputs from Sadia Akhtar in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-metro-shut-in-stricter-lockdown-across-delhi-101620588363310.html
10-05-2021||Other||Among unsung heroes: ward boys, attendants, cleaning staff at Covid hospitals||New Delhi While the pandemic has thrown doctors and nurses to the forefront of the fight against the infection in the national capital, supporting their efforts are thousands of ward boys, attendants and sanitation staff who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes.In most hospitals across Delhi, at least two such staff, known as multi-tasking staff (MTS), work in each ward in every shift, sharing tasks including serving food to patients, helping clean them or change clothes, clean the wards, checking oxygen saturation levels, and shifting patients from one ward to another. In many cases, they have also become a medium to connect patients with their family who are not allowed enter the Covid wards.Manoj Kumar Paswan (37), a ward attendant at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, looks after at least 20 patients during his regular morning shift. “First I serve breakfast to all the patients. It’s important for them to eat first so that they can have the first dose of medicine for the day. Many of the patients are either very weak or old and require assistance to eat. I also help such patients in changing their diapers, clean them and change their clothes. It’s difficult to work but if we won’t do it, who else will help patients at a time when their own family members cannot meet them,” he said.Paswan said as soon as he comes out of the Covid ward after his duty, the family members of patients’ waiting outside approach him to check the well-being of their loved ones. “I tell them whatever I know. Only doctors can tell the exact situation but I try to ease their pain by talking to them. It is such a helpless situation when a child cannot meet his father or mother, or a wife cannot see her husband or vise versa,” he said. Similar experiences have been shared by attendants in other Covid hospitals. Tirath Ram, a helper at the municipality-run Swami Dayanand Hospital, said that many patients admitted at the hospital belong to economically weaker sections, who do not own smartphones. He said that he does not hesitate in passing on his phone number to their family members so that they can be in touch with each other or at least enquire about the well-being of the admitted patients. “Doctors and nurses are busy and are often not very approachable. When a patient is admitted I often give my personal phone number to family members so that they can enquire about their health. It takes me only a few minutes to go check on them. Covid symptoms are treated by doctors, I can only provide some mental peace to patients and families that are already stressed,” said Ram. Abhishek Singh, an attendant at Lok Nayak Hospital, said that many times, patients seek help to make video calls to their family members. “It feels so difficult to just hold the phone when people at both sides are just weeping. There is hardly any communication between the severe patients and their family members. They just want to see their loved ones...It feels good to help them,” he said.While hospitals do not allow families to come inside Covid wards, these helpers and sanitation workers are also helping patients run small errands, such as buying snacks that they crave or passing on messages to their family members. Thirty-eight-year-old Suresh, who is lovingly called ‘Suni bhaiyya’ at the Hindu Rao Hospital, said that two weeks ago, a 19-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital and she had expressed her wish to eat Parle-G biscuits during his morning cleaning duty. “She was nearly my sister’s age and how much can one eat hospital food. I bought her two packets of Parle-G at my own expense. She was so happy to get it. The situation is so grim these days that all you hear from each ward is news of people dying. These are the small joys that we are holding on to,” Suresh said. Some attendants said they also encountered “misbehaviour” by family members of patients who succumb to the virus. A ward attendant in Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital said, “A few days ago, a patient could not be revived during resuscitation as he was brought in very critical. The family members started to abuse us and the nurses. We tried to make them understand that we did our best but they resorted to creating a ruckus. We had to call in the security.”Meanwhile, many said the fear and guilt of infecting family members is eating at them. Rai, who lives with his family of six including elderly parents, said, “Even as I wear PPE kit all the time in the Covid ward, the fear of infection is always there. So many of our colleagues and their family members have tested positive for Covid-19 since April. Some of them even have even died. If people living in big houses are getting infected, what are the chances of a family of six living in a two-room set of not getting the virus?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/among-unsung-heroes-ward-boys-attendants-cleaning-staff-at-covid-hospitals-101620588794711.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Deputy CM calls for inquiry into 23 missing Covid patients||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday called for an urgent inquiry into 23 Covid-19 patients going missing from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital.Taking cognizance of a report published in Hindustan Times on Sunday, Sisodia said in a letter, “It is very shocking that to note that such a large number (of) Covid-19 patients have gone missing from Hindu Rao Hospital in spite of separate wards... It is not only dangerous to the lives of these patients but also a setback to the efforts of the government, which has imposed curfew/lockdown to break the chain and to check the spread of this dreaded disease.”Directing health department to submit the findings by Monday evening, Sisodia said, “Responsibility [should] be fixed and action be taken against the erring officials.”Also read | 23 Covid-19 patients missing, Delhi's Hindu Rao Hospital says﻿HT reported on Sunday that between April 19 and May 6 this year, 23 Covid-19 patients admitted to HIndu Rao hospital left without informing the hospital authorities. The hospital currently does not know whether these patients have transferred into other Covid hospitals or have left for their homes.While the civic body officials said that they informed police about instances of patients leaving against medical advice (LAMA), Delhi Police officials on Saturday denied having received any complaint from either the hospital or the municipality.This is not the first time that the Hindu Rao Hospital has reported such cases. Last year, between June 27 and July 18, five Covid positive patients left the hospital without informing the authorities.Jai Prakash, mayor of the BJP-ruled civic body, said the corporation will do everything to give the details of the 23 missing patients. However, he said that the security of the Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi is managed by the Delhi’ government’s civil defence and the deputy CM should seek answers about the lapse in security from their own officials. “Why doesn’t the government first call an inquiry on the hoarding of oxygen cylinders and other equipment by their own ministers and MLAs, or regarding the shortage of oxygen supply in the city that led to the death of so many people in Delhi?” Prakash said.BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the Delhi government should question their own officials as the security of the Hindu Rao hospital and other Covid-dedicated hospitals is managed by the government’s civil defence.“Security to all Covid hospitals is being provided by Delhi government’s civil defence and it is civil defence that owes a reply for missing patients from a hospital of north corporation,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deputy-cm-calls-for-inquiry-into-23-missing-covid-patients-101620588734746.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Cops in PPE on guard outside Covid-19 wards as Delhi hospitals turn high-security prisons||Outside a room in the Covid wing at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), four police personnel wearing PPE suits stand on guard round-the-clock. Unlike other Covid-19 patients, who are lodged in wards and share space with others, underworld gangster, Chhota Rajan alias Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje,62, is lodged in a single room because of the threat to his life. Since April 24, when he was shifted from Tihar jail number 2 to AIIMS, the police’s quick reaction team (QRT) has also been posted at the AIIMS campus along with many others in plain clothes to keep an eye on suspicious movement in the facility.In East Delhi’s Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where at least 14 Covid-19 prisoners are lodged, police and hospital authorities have dedicated one of the building gates only to the entry and exit of those going to the prisoners’ ward. This is where one of Delhi’s top gangster, Gaurav Jhareda was lodged until Thursday along with at least other Covid prisoners. Jhareda died of the infection on Thursday night. The entry to the building where the prisoner-patients are lodged is sealed by police barricades. Private security guards and Delhi police personnel monitor every suspicious movement.As cases of Covid-19 continue to spread rapidly inside Delhi’s Tihar jail, prompting the jail administration to shift some prisoners to hospitals outside, many hospitals across the city have turned into high security zones with police personnel in some cases donning PPE kits to guard them inside Covid wards. Until last week, when former gangster turned politician Mohammed Shahabuddin was admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, armed police officers in PPE kits guarded his room. In north Delhi, the Burari hospital has been transformed to a mini-temporary jail with at least 21 prisoners admitted there.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiA GTB hospital security guard, who wished not to be named said, “On Thursday night, that man(Gaurav Jhareda) died at the hospital. The following day, when his body was being taken for cremation in an ambulance, many of his friends had come and wanted to take photographs. It was very scary. Those men looked tough and insisted on opening the PPE kit to see his face. There were so many people recording the video of the body being transported.”Explaining the need for tight vigil at the hospitals, an officer from the Delhi police special cell, who wished not to be named, said, “Hospital is the most misused place to escape from custody. On March 25, gangster Kuldeep Fajja, who had come to GTB hospital for a medical check,fled from outside the hospital after a shootout with police. These gangsters are desperate and will try to escape the moment they are out. Because of the killings they have been part of, they are also targeted by rival gangs at the hospitals. The fear of Covid-19 prisoners spreading infection after fleeing the hospital is not so much, in comparison to the danger they possess if they escape.”In September last year, a convicted criminal named Mehtab Ahmed, involved in over 10 cases of murder, snatching, kidnapping and robbery, who was admitted at the Lok Nayak hospital for Covid-19 escaped after breaking the window grille of the hospital’s bathroom. He was arrested again after a shoot out.Explaining, the nature of threat to prisoners such as Rajan or Shahabuddin’s outside the jail, the officer quoted above said that even inside Tihar, the two men were lodged in solitary confinement. In Rajan’s case, the Intelligence Bureau had on many occasions alerted Tihar officers to allow only his wife and no other family member to visit him. The IB had also said that Rajan’s rivals could use Delhi’s gangsters behind bars to murder him in prison.Currently, Tihar has 249 active cases of Covid-19. The spread of the infection inside Tihar has been quicker and far more compared to the last three waves in Delhi.In February, there was not a single case of Covid-19 among prisoners or jail officials. Even until April 6, the jail had only 19 cases of Covid-19 among prisoners. But in the last one month, Tihar has reported over 300 Covid-19 cases among prisoners. Six prisoners have died of Covid-19 in the last two weeks.Starting this week, the prison department will release around 5000 prisoners as one of the steps to decongest prison complex. The prison administration is preparing a list of nearly 5,000 undertrials who could be released either on interim bail for 90 days or on eight weeks’ parole following a Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee recommending that the prison be decongested in view of the “alarming” and “threatening” situation of the pandemic in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cops-in-ppe-on-guard-outside-covid-wards-as-city-hospitals-turn-high-security-prisons-101620588675331.html

However, due to lack of vaccines TMC is unable to approve the same. The city did not have any vaccination scheduled on Sunday. Around one lakh citizens are still awaiting their second dose in the city. Over three lakh citizens have been inoculated till now in the city.There are around 700 housing societies that have come forward to conduct vaccinations within their premises. Thane Citizen Foundation (TCF) has prepared an online petition for housing societies to put forth the demand for vaccination centres. “TCF gets the support of 700 housing societies to start a vaccination drive in their premises. All support will be given to the TMC. Some residential complexes like Hiranandani Meadows and Laxminarayan Residency have already started preparations and provisions to convert their clubhouses into inoculation centres. This will save the hassle for many and also help vaccinate as many people as possible systematically. We are only awaiting TMC permission now,” said Kasber Augustine, president, TCF. K Kumar, President, Progressive Thane Residents Association, said, “We have written to the civic body commissioner. There are 20 housing complexes within our vicinity with a population of over 3.5 lakh people. We would like to extend our support to the civic body by providing space at the Vasant Vihar Clubhouse which is centrally located and easily accessible. If our proposal is approved a major population of the city can get vaccinated.” Meanwhile, TMC is reeling under the shortage of vaccination; “We have provisions for 56 centres and can start jumbo centres as well. Plans to come up with Drive-in facilities are also in place. However, there is a shortage of vaccination and our current focus is to provide booster doses to all those who have taken the first dose of the vaccination. If we get ample doses, we shall initiate all of this along with special camps in slum pockets,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-societies-want-to-conduct-vax-drive-tmc-says-no-doses-available-101620588675975.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Pet boarding facilities inundated with requests from Covid-affected families||With the national capital grappling with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases amid the fourth wave, many individuals and families are turning to boarding facilities for their pets. Owners of pet boarding facilities across the city said there has been a significant increase in the number of requests for taking in pets.Kuldeep Chauhan, owner of Pet Lovers Hut - Dog Boarding Centre, said his facility is receiving requests from people who are down with Covid-19 or are unable to meet the pet’s requirement due to restrictions. “During this time of the year, people leave behind their pets while going for vacations. This time, people are not going anywhere but our facility is full due to requests from Covid-affected individuals and families. There are instances where the owners have died of Covid and their dogs are left with us,” said Chauhan. He said that the number of requests pouring in due to the pandemic is higher this time. “Last year, we did not get this many dogs. This time, there is a stark difference.”Arun Shivakumar, who runs Asha Arun’s pet home boarding, said the facility has been receiving more and more requests from Covid-affected families since last month. “We receive at least ten calls a day from people battling Covid-19. Last year, we did not have any requests from covid patients in April-May,” said Shivakumar.He said he also received requests from people who want to give up their dogs for adoption as they can’t take care of them due to Covid-19. “My wife and I have conducted counselling sessions with such pet parents to make them understand that Covid is temporary,” said Shivakumar.Also read | 13.3k more Covid-19 cases in Delhi: Fewest in 27 daysNandita Sikka, CEO, Heal Your Paws, a facility located at Sainik Farms, also echoed similar sentiments. “I have been getting a lot of requests from people who are unable to step out of their houses and take their dogs for walks due to concerns arising out of Covid-19. We are taking care of dogs whose owners are Covid positive or are busy in covid-related duties,” said Sikka.In view of the prevailing situation, board facility owners have also adopted additional precautionary measures. Sikka said the staff at the facility have been tested for Covid and are taking extra sanitization measures. Other facilities have introduced mandatory sanitisation of pets.“We have introduced some changes in the processes that we undertake while admitting a new member to the boarding facility. We have created a designated spot at the entrance of the facility where owners are asked to tie the dog. Following that, our caretaker gives the dog a bath, only after which he can enter the kennel. We are not holding any interaction with the pet parents in the current situation,” said Chauhan.He said while most people are upfront and inform the facility if Covid is the reason behind the boarding request, some people do conceal information. “At least three families did not inform us that they had Covid. To avoid such incidents, we introduced the additional layer of sanitization process at the entrance,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pet-boarding-facilities-inundated-with-requests-from-covid-affected-families-101620588674761.html

On Sunday, the state Covid task force members interacted with 700 private doctors from Mumbai to clear doubts raised by them over the Covid treatment protocol. Last week, similar interaction was held with 300 private doctors from Mumbai.“Family doctors play an important role. If they guide the patients at the initial stage, it will be helpful to curb the virus spread,” Thackeray said during the virtual meeting held on Sunday. “If the doctors keep a check on the treatment of patients in home isolation and update ward officers regularly, the civic body can make treatment management of patients in a proper way,’’ Thackeray added.He added that family doctors can give a lot of mental support to patients initially. “Family doctors can identify symptoms and check whether the patient is asymptomatic or needs hospitalisation. Family doctors should focus on patients in home isolation take a call so that they can be shifted to hospitals on time if required,” he said. Amid the shortage of doctors in the city, Thackeray also appealed to private doctors to register themselves in the Covid Care Centers and jumbo field hospitals in their vicinity and visit the places for consultation.Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), Covid task force head Dr Sanjay Oak, and task force member Dr Shashank Joshi and Dr Rahul Pandit, along with Dr TP Lahane, director-general of the directorate of medical education and research interacted with these private doctors, resolved their queries, answered their doubts on the treatment protocol for Covid patients. The doctors were also told to keep an eye out for children and infants developing symptoms such as fever, cold, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-launches-majha-doctor-initiative-to-involve-family-doctors-in-fight-against-covid-101620588614690.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh Vardhan||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and asked that the Centre regulate the supply of Covid-19 vaccines to the states while ensuring that they receive enough doses to inoculate all their residents, even as he urged that the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech — the two firms manufacturing vaccines in India — be directed to increase supplies to Delhi between May and July.“The central government should make available to the states the requisite number of vaccines to enable vaccination of all its citizens. The central government should actively monitor and supervise the manufacture of vaccines by private parties so that supplies in adequate quantity are made to all state governments and this crucial aspect is not left to the discretion of the private manufacturers,” read Kejriwal’s letter, a copy of which HT has seen.The letter comes a day after Kejriwal, in a digital press briefing, said Delhi only had enough Covid-19 vaccine stocks to last five to six days, and urged the Centre and manufacturers to expedite supplies, so that “every adult in the national capital can be inoculated within three months.”Spokespersons of the Union health ministry did not respond to requests for a comment.In his letter, Kejriwal also said the Delhi government has approached Dr Reddy’s Labs for the Russian-made Sputnik V, the third vaccine approved for use in India.Dr Reddy’s Labs, which is conducting clinical trials in India on behalf of the makers of Sputnik V, received the national regulator’s emergency use approval for the jab last month. The company will import the vaccine for use in India.In his letter, Kejriwal also appealed that vaccines be priced uniformly, saying that the current model incentivises private manufacturers to “prioritise supplies” to private hospitals over state governments. He also flagged glitches in the CoWIN portal, leading to problems booking slots and urged the Centre to allow states to develop their own registration systems.Covishield, manufactured by SII, and Covaxin, produced by Bharat Biotech, are available to the Centre at ₹150 a dose. However, Covishield is sold to states for ₹300 a dose, while Covaxin is sold at ₹600.Spokespersons of neither SII nor Bharat Biotech responded to requests seeking comments.Also read | Sisodia hits out at Centre for jab exportsTo private hospitals, Covishield is available at ₹600 per dose, and Covaxin for ₹1,200.On May 2, the Supreme Court asked the central government about differential Covid-19 vaccine pricing. The current vaccination policy would “result in a detriment to the right to public health,” said the apex court, and maintained that the policy be “revisited”. The top court asked the Union government to consider procuring vaccines for all the states at the same price, which will then be liable to lift the allocated quantities, and respond by May 10.The Centre in an affidavit on Sunday night turned down the Supreme Court’s suggestion.Kejriwal’s letter to Vardhan further said: “We are procuring the required number of vaccines and providing them free of cost at the government centres. We have already placed supply orders with Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute (SII) and have approached Reddy’s labs for Sputnik vaccines.”The first consignment carrying 150,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine landed in Hyderabad, Dr Reddy’s labs announced on May 1.“Delhi has a population of around 20 million, out of which 15 million are aged above 18 years (eligible for vaccines). Vaccinating all of them would need 30 million doses. We have received roughly five million doses so far. Therefore, we need about 25 million additional doses. But we are not able to receive supplies as per our requirement and even get firm delivery schedules. As the third wave is also anticipated soon, we want to complete vaccination of all people living in Delhi within three months,” the CM’s letter to Vardhan said.Till May 8, Delhi administered around 3.90 million doses of vaccines to people aged over 45 years and around 299,000 doses to people aged between 18-44 years, for whom the drive opened on May 1, the letter said.The letter also read, “To complete it (vaccination of all adults) in three months, we would need 2.3 million doses per month from government of India channel during the three months of May to July 2021 (for the 45+ beneficiaries). Delhi has around 9.2 million people in 18-45 age group I urge you to direct Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to increase their monthly supplies to Delhi to 6 million doses per month during May to July 2021.”“Convergence of sincere efforts of the government of India, states and private sector is essential to ensure faster vaccination. But such convergence is getting constrained by the continued glitches in the CoWin app. These glitches are leading to most people spending valuable time for getting registered or for booking vaccine appointments. Also, a large number of people are not tech savvy to be able to register themselves. As we plan to expand vaccination for the 18-45 age group, such glitches should not be allowed to deprive people of vaccination. Hence, I request you to allow states to develop their separate apps or develop mechanisms other than apps to manage vaccination in their sites,” said the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/regulate-supply-of-covid-vaccine-shots-cm-kejriwal-writes-to-health-min-harsh-vardhan-101620588554733.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s case positivity rate down to 7.34%, says BMC||With the decline in Covid-19 cases, the city has also witnessed a drop in the number of citizens under home quarantined. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data shows that there is a 16% drop from 627,000 persons who were home quarantined on April 10 to 525,000, as of May 07. The city’s daily positivity rate was as low as 7% on Sunday as compared to around 25% in the first week of April.According to BMC officials, one of the reasons for patients under home quarantine going down is owing to the drop in the number of cases from high-rises, where maximum patients were home quarantined. As per the BMC data, 789 buildings and 9,785 floors were sealed on April 6, while 617 buildings and 8,658 floors, were reported to be sealed as of May 6. According to civic body officials, this is one indicator of the cases going down in the city. The high-rises in the city have been contributing over 85% of the daily cases in the second wave that started in the city from around February 10.A closer look at the data of home quarantine citizens reveals the number of citizens under home isolation had gone as low as around one lakh in February, however, with the second wave the number drastically went up. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the city reported 2,395 cases followed by 68 deaths, taking the tally to 675,630 and toll to 13,781. The city’s recovery rate is 90.11% with 608,866 recoveries. The city’s mortality rate is 2.03% with 51,165 active cases. The city reported 32,590 tests on Sunday wherein 7.34% were positive. The city’s former hot spot Dharavi reported 13 cases on Sunday, taking the total to 6,623. There are 755 active cases in Dharavi and 5,540 discharges.Reacting to the fall of patients under home isolation, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, “The number of patients under home isolation does not reveal the number of active Covid-19 cases, but yes, it is an indicator of the intensity of spread. Currently, we have over 525,000 citizens under home isolation whereas our active cases are less than 100,000. Hence, these also include high-risk contacts, those under isolation post-recovery etc.”‘Allegations about under-reporting baseless’BMC denies Fadnavis allegations on under-reporting Covid casualtiesThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday issued a statement, claiming that allegations of the civic body under-reporting Covid-19 deaths were false. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday had alleged that the Mumbai civic body was manipulating data on infection rate and the number of deaths. Fadnavis had said that BMC has put the Covid deaths in the non-Covid deaths category to reduce the number of deaths due to Covid. However, the BMC said, “There have been allegations in the media and social media that a virtual picture is being painted by the BMC regarding the control of Covid infection in the BMC area. The allegations are completely baseless and the municipal administration has categorically denied it.”The BMC in the statement added, “The BMC is recording Covid tests and Covid deaths as per the criteria laid down by the World Health Organization and Indian Institute of Medical Research (ICMR). The administration’s relentless efforts to prevent infection are showing positive results in the Mumbai statistics. The administration aims to achieve ‘Mission Zero’ by gradually controlling the Covid situation. Mumbaikars are also cooperating in this along with all the people’s representatives and as a result, the infection is coming under control. The Supreme Court also praised the Mumbai model.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-case-positivity-rate-down-to-7-34-says-bmc-101620588495780.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Financial planning for the pandemic||Many of us have had to face a sudden financial jolt due to unemployment or mounting medical bills on account of the pandemic. It may sound counter-intuitive, but there’s no better time than now to take a hard look at our finances and plan for a more secure future in the face of an uncertain present. Every problem is an opportunity in disguise. This means that notwithstanding the insecurity that this pandemic may have caused in terms of your long-term financial planning, certain necessary steps taken today can still help build financial security. The pandemic and its effect are expected to be prolonged, so it makes sense to implement the following strategies for your financial well-being in both the near and distant future. Build an emergency fund: We may have had to dip into our savings to manage our expenses the past year. However, not many people have an emergency fund in place. Typically, an emergency fund should help you coast through a year. It’s not necessary for this to be in cash. Keep the money in a savings account or in small fixed deposits that can be easily liquidated. Go for a budget makeover: There are many unessential items and services that we spend on. Identify them and curtail them immediately. This will leave you with enough money that you can save. Go through your monthly budget to identify where you can save cash. For example, you can forego travelling in your vehicle every day and carpool to cut down on how much you spend on fuel and parking. Get rid of your debts: Mounting credit card debt is never advisable, especially, because of the high interest rates associated with it. The recent fall in loan interest rates due to the economic fallout can relieve you of credit card debt. You can opt for refinancing your debt by securing a low-interest personal loan to repay your high-interest credit card debt. You can also opt for a credit card balance transfer to lower your credit card debt. Continue with investments: Many people panic after seeing stocks tumble. This has led many people to sell off their investments hurriedly as they see the value of their portfolio decreasing. With the stock market estimated to show an undulating movement due to continued volatility, it has become more important to consider all investments and review them in the light of renewed future goals and retirement plans. Depending on whether you are an aggressive investor or prefer moderate investments, you can continue to set aside your earnings in equity or debt. Refinance your loans: Banks have lowered interest rates on loans more than ever before, thus, allowing you to get rid of your current mortgage. If you had sought loans at floating interest rates, this is the right time to avail the benefit of low-interest loans. Alternatively, you may also consider getting your loans refinanced by taking a loan at a lower interest rate to repay your earlier loan. Atul Monga, CEO and Co-Founder, BASIC Home Loan, an automated platform for home loans in India says, “People should refinance home loan if they had same in the pre-Covid era at an interest rate of 8 or 8.5% or higher. Since they have been repaying the loan over a term of more than two to three years, they would have improved their credit score and should be eligible for a lower interest rate. Presently, banks offer interest rate at an average of around 7% per annum. In this case, refinancing will help reduce the monthly EMI to a larger extent. However, to keep the interest rate low, you should opt for a shorter loan tenure as longer tenure will imply high-interest burden.” Buy insurance: If you already have a health cover, it makes sense to renew with a higher health cover to meet sudden contingencies. You could consider a super top-up insurance plans if hospitalisation bills exceed the sum insured under your base medical insurance policy. Either way, buying a life insurance policy is not a choice anymore, but an imperative. Irrespective of the times that await us, it is important to take control of our finances and have a stronger financial plan in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-financial-planning-for-the-pandemic-101620588495219.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||2.6 million Covid patients provided free treatment, Maharashtra govt tells HC||In an affidavit, the Maharashtra government informed the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently that 2,648,827 patients were provided free of cost treatment in Covid Care Centres across the state so far, while 406,749 patients of the 4,49,485 patients who were admitted in private hospitals have been covered by group private health insurance. The state also informed the court that it had 20 packages under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) through which free treatment was being offered to citizens from the economically weaker section.The information was provided in public interest litigation (PIL) which claimed that eligible persons were not getting benefits of the schemes, declared by the state through various Government Resolutions (GRs), issued in May 2020. The affidavit has also assured the HC of action being initiated against errant officials who have charged exorbitant amounts from patients eligible for the schemes.A division bench of justice Sanjay Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing a PIL filed by Omprakash Shete through advocate AB Girase, was informed by the state that following the April 27 direction of the bench the state had filed the affidavit. The bench had directed the state that Covid-19 patients from weaker sections of society should get all medical facilities to their optimum level and that it was high time the state strictly implemented the MJPJAY.The court had stressed that the authorities should take all possible steps to provide treatment to all patients from weaker sections of society and they should not be deprived of healthcare facilities on financial grounds.On May 7, advocate Girase informed the bench that around 20 to 25 Covid-19 patients living below the poverty line and possessing all necessary documents had been charged around ₹1.34 lakh for treatment and such persons were also denied admission in Covid-19 dedicated hospitals.Additional government pleader SG Karlekar for the state referred to the affidavit and clarified that apart from patients on ventilators, 20 packages have been identified under MJPJAY wherein Covid-19 patients with moderate and severe symptoms could avail treatment. He added that grievances of patients who were charged with exorbitant rates have been registered and show-cause notices were issued to the concerned hospitals.After hearing submissions, the bench observed, “The only problem is about the implementation of the said scheme. In this exceptional time, a greater responsibility would be upon the government and its authorities to implement the benevolent scheme more fruitfully. We would be more concerned with the immediate treatment of such patients.” The bench further observed that eligible persons should not be asked to run from pillar to post and from one hospital to another for getting admitted only because of lack of funds. The court also directed the state government to inform it about the outcome of show-cause notices issued to errant hospitals and posted further hearing to June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/26-million-covid-patients-provided-free-treatment-maharashtra-govt-tells-hc-101620588436167.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Discrimination: An unspoken chapter on most campuses||Priyanka Sahoo priyanka.sahoo@htlive.com Mumbai: In 2012, when Riya was pursuing her Masters at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, she had an assignment to write about her experience with caste discrimination. She scored four out of 10. “I don’t understand how I could get my own experience wrong. So I applied for revaluation and my score changed to 4.5,” said Riya, who now works as a research and advocacy officer at Dalit Women Fight, a group led by Dalit women for supporting survivors of caste atrocities. “The forms of caste discrimination we see now are more subtle and largely of everyday nature. It is a part of the classroom. Caste practices or behaviours, which are discriminatory in nature, are in the form of humour or subtle insults,” said Riya on Saturday during a webinar titled “Get out of the class”: Caste and casteism in our top institutions. The webinar was held after a series of videos of a professor verbally abusing students from marginalised communities went viral. On April 25, video recordings of Seema Singh, an associate professor from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) emerged on social media. In the videos, which are now under review of the institute, Seema can be heard verbally abusing students purportedly belonging to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes (ST) communities and those with physical disabilities during a preparatory class. The institute has now set up a fact-finding committee with senior faculty members on it. “The committee has submitted its report and we are in the process of acting on the recommendations of the committee,” said Tamal Nath, registrar, IIT Kharagpur. While the videos have led to an uproar among the student community, alumni networks as well as academia, students and experts interviewed by HT said caste discrimination was rampant in college campuses in more subtle forms. In 2013, Mahesh, then 17 years old, reached his dream destination-- the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, to pursue an integrated Master’s course in the Electrical Engineering department. Happy to have been admitted to one of the oldest IITs, he looked forward to meeting like-minded students from all over the country, where his identity as a Scheduled Caste wouldn’t matter. His actual experience, however, was very different. In the first couple of years, Mahesh scored poor marks in some subjects. “I blamed it on myself and even considered that I was not as sharp as others here. Although, by third year I realised that many others with as many marks as I got were clearing subjects and getting promoted, but I was being held back.,” said Mahesh, who was subsequently categorised as an ‘academically weak’ student—a tag that cost him two years of his academic career. “I felt more disappointed in myself. The ‘weak category’ tag appears on all academic information and soon you realise that a majority of the students in these categories belong to SC/ST/OBC/PD. There are no special classes/ tutorials/ help arranged to guide or teach these students. They are just marked out,” said Mahesh. The institute limits the number of credits per course that students, who are academically weak, can go for, unless authorised by the administration. Mahesh’s plea for extra credits, required for his course completion, was turned down six times, despite his parents making a plea with the institute. Without those extra credits, Mahesh couldn’t register for all required courses that he had to complete to get his degree. Due for graduation in 2018, Mahesh eventually graduated in 2020. “Students with equal or lower grade points were allowed to take extra credits. Most of the students disallowed from extra credits were from marginalised communities,” said Mahesh. Many students from SC, ST and Other backward classes (OBC) communities find themselves in the academically weak category and struggle to clear exams. Unable to handle the pressure, many drop out before they can complete their course. According to data revealed by the ministry of education in 2019, almost 48% of students dropping out of IITs in 2017 and 2018 were from reserved categories. Merit debate “What was your rank in the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)?” is a question that is an essential part of introduction among students. “The first question that fellow students or seniors ask during introduction is what’s your JEE rank. As students admitted to reserved category seats have relatively lower ranks, it is very easy to deduce that we are from marginalised communities,” said an alumnus of IIT Bombay, who managed to complete his dual degree a year later than the due date. “I would often get into debates with my peers, who told me they respected me less because I had been admitted through the quota. They would tell me that I had taken up the seat of a meritorious student instead,” said the alumnus, who now works as a software engineer. “In most leading academic institutions, language becomes a prominent marker for merit. Merit is determined on your fluency in English,” said Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson - Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies, at TISS. It is the subtle and systemic discrimination that is worse, according to Varun Singh, an alumnus of IIT Guwahati. “It took me five attempts to pass a subject. The colleagues that I helped prepare were able to clear the paper, but I wasn’t. On my fourth attempt, I asked the institute for my answersheet and I was denied the same. My professor, unprompted, told me that I shouldn’t worry about fudging of marks because of my caste. It hadn’t even occurred to me until then that my caste was a factor,” he said. “The current education system permeates discrimination in the name of merit. The idea of merit doesn’t take into account the social, emotional, academic, cultural and intellectual gap in students coming from diverse backgrounds,” said Govardhan Wankhede, former professor and dean, School of Education, TISS. Social anxiety For the first two years of her five-year integrated Master’s programme at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, the student from Kozhikode, did her best to remain invisible on campus. She became the first college goer in the family when she secured an admission to IIT Madras in 2012. “It was an intimidating experience. The campus is huge. Even as I was recovering from culture shock, one of the early learnings for me was people made fun of the way I talked. My peers made fun of my accent when I spoke in English,” said she said. Soon, she started to avoid social events altogether. “The casual remarks and the pressure to fit in started to become too much. I felt alienated. My anxiety started to peak and I was unable to hold conversation with people,” she said, adding she had to seek professional help to manage her anxiety. “In my experience while navigating or pursuing cases of caste discrimination, the war we fight is largely about endlessly explaining what just happened qualifies to be casteist, and why. What we get in return is denial,” said Riya. Students and alumni members that HT interviewed said they were often mocked for their language, clothes and eating habits. They emphasised on an urgent need for sensitising students of all castes and classes towards what constitutes discrimination. “Those who are born in higher caste and class are inherently in a position of social power. This power is used to discriminate. It is therefore necessary to teach students what is discrimination, how it happens, what happens when one makes a discriminatory remark. Students must be made aware of the social and legal consequences of discrimination for both the victim and victimised,” said Wankhede, who served as the liaisons officer for SC/ ST students for two decades. “Students, who raise their voices against discriminatory jokes or remarks, also accused of being ‘too sensitive’. Unsurprisingly, we end up making friends who are from SC and ST categories,” said the student from Kozhikode. “Systemic discrimination at the hands of teachers and friends affects the mental health of students coming from marginalised backgrounds, most of whom are first generation learners. We have seen how students are driven to suicide,” said Ramaiah. In 2016, the death of Rohith Vemula, a student at University of Hyderabad, allegedly by suicide, led to nationwide protests at campuses. In his suicide note, he accused the university’s administration of discrimination. At IIT Bombay, Aniket Ambhore, an SC student, died by suicide in 2014. While Ambhore’s parents have alleged that he was stressed owing to discrimination, a committee at the institute ruled out caste-based discrimination. More recently, Payal Tadvi, a second-year medical student at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai, died by suicide allegedly following discrimination at the hands of three colleagues. Students at IITs in their first year take a course in social sciences, but caste is not necessarily a part of these courses. “In the first year, it is necessary to teach students about caste privilege through a compulsory course,” said Ramaiah. DATA SPEAK*In 2019, data released by Ramesh Pokriyal Nishank, in a written reply to the Parliament, showed that of the 2,461 students, who dropped out of IITs in 2017 and 2018:- 371 were from the Scheduled Caste category- 199 from the Scheduled Tribe category- 601 from the Other Backward Classes category,*The government of India’s (GoI) norms require 10% of all seats to be reserved for students from economically weaker sections; 27% for OBC students; 15% for SC students; 7.5% for ST students; and 5% for students with physical disabilities. Quote:“Teachers are required to be upholders of the value system in our society. Through the teachers we prepare tomorrow’s citizens. When a teacher fails miserably, as it was in the recent case, it really hurts the system in the worst possible way and it takes a very long time to heal the wounds of hatred. As a teacher, I am ashamed of this incident at my alma mater,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director IIT Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/discrimination-an-unspoken-chapter-on-most-campuses-101620588374733.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||HC reprieve till June 14 for jewellers who have not hallmarked gold ornaments||In a temporary reprieve for jewellers, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and the Public Distribution to consider the representation by a group of jewellers from Pune by May 15, who have challenged the January 15 order of the Centre which made hallmarking mandatory and prohibited selling and hallmark stamping of gold ornaments of higher purity (more than 22 carat). Meanwhile, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court hearing a similar petition directed the Centre not to take coercive action against any jeweller till June 14 for not hallmarking their jewellery by June 1 as stipulated in the January order. The order reduced the hallmark grades to three and henceforth gold jewellery will be available in grades of 14 carat, 18 carat and 22 carat only. On April 29, a division bench of justice K K Tated and justice Nitin Borkar while hearing the petition filed by Pune Saraf Association through senior advocate Anil Anturkar and advocate Shubham Misar was informed that the January 15 order of the Centre was against Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to practice any profession, trade or business. In light of this, the petition sought quashing of the January 15 order or stay on the order pending hearing of the petition. According to the order, jewellers will be able to sell only hallmarked jewellery and artifacts made of 14, 18 and 22 carat gold from June 2021, violations will attract penalty and imprisonment of one year. While arguing against the order, the association submitted that jewellers would suffer losses as they are prohibited from selling gold with high purity. It was argued that gold rings having purity between 23.5 and 24 carat was a source of acquisition of gold for people belonging to all economic classes and the prohibition on sale of 24-carat traditional jewellery would wipe out the cultural heritage of the state. After the court was informed that a representation seeking provision of facilities of assaying and hallmarking centres for all the districts in Maharashtra was pending, the Court asked the centre to decide the same on or before May 15 and also permitted the association to approach the vacation court in the event the decision on their representation was adverse. Meanwhile, a division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote at Nagpur directed the Centre not to take any coercive action against jewellers under BIS Act after All India Gems & Jewellery Domestic Council filed a petition through senior advocate Rohan Shah. The petition contended that the new regulation, which is to come into force from June 1, would affect nearly 5 lakh of jewellers in India. The Council argued that 488 districts in India did not have hallmarking centres and as inter district travel was restricted due to Covid it would not be possible for jewellers to get the six thousand crores pieces of jewellery hallmarked by June 1 and would end up being liable for punishment under BIS Act. The bench then directed the centre not to take any coercive steps against jewellers till next date of hearing on June 14. The petition at the Mumbai bench will also be heard on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-reprieve-till-june-14-for-jewellers-who-have-not-hallmarked-gold-ornaments-101620588255810.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Locks on doors, barricades on Covid coaches to stop patients from stepping out in Palghar||The Western Railway (WR) on Saturday evening locked four doors of an isolation coach and put up barricades near few coaches after the government railway police (GRP) complained of Covid patients roaming on platform-3 of the 23 coach Covid Express. The patients were even spotted purchasing eatables from food stalls but were prevented by the GRP, on patrolling duty.A letter by the Dahanu Vaitarna Pravasi Sevabhavi Sanstha(DVPSS) on May 7, highlighted the lacunae in the way arrangements have been made for the patients. At present, there are three patients admitted inside the Covid coach. Around five coaches are made available which will house 90 patients.Senior inspector Yogesh Devre, Palghar GRP, said we found that the patients just open the door and take a stroll and even purchase food items from the food stalls. There are around 10-15 police personnel on patrolling duty, who stop them from stepping out. I have complained to the nodal officer Keshav Tarange and the station master,” said Devre. A few relatives were also seen interacting with the patients and offering them home-cooked snacks, even as the Palghar Municipal Corporation are providing food and drinking water free of charge, said Devre. “I have posted a few policemen on permanent duty before the Covid coaches to prevent patients stepping out,” said Devre.On May 1, the WR parked a 23-car Covid care isolation train at platform 3 at Palghar station, which has a capacity to admit 415 patients.Prathamesh Prabhutondulkar, a member of DVPSS, said, “The platform number 2 and 3 form an island with tracks on either side. While on one side the Covid coaches are parked on platform 3, on the other, local and express long-distance trains make a halt on platform 2, which is used by passengers on essential duties. Also, the patients admitted to isolation coaches share the same foot overbridge that is used by common non-infected people on essential duties. Hence it is a health risk for all, he added, in his letter to the WR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/locks-on-doors-barricades-on-covid-coaches-to-stop-patients-from-stepping-out-in-palghar-101620588255240.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Citizens go outside city for Covid jabs||Even as private hospitals are still struggling with the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines for those above 18 years, the shortage of vials is forcing city-dwellers to book slots for jabs on the outskirts. While it is not illegal, public health officers have requested citizens to refrain from doing so. On May 6, a 28-year-old Kandivli resident travelled 32km to Thane with his 22-year-old sister to get the first shot of Covishield. After trying to book a slot for a jab in the city for five days, he decided to book an appointment in Thane. “My sister is on dialysis for the past two years after she got detected with a chronic kidney disease. Every alternative day, she has to undergo dialysis. So, it was essential that she got the jab at the earliest,” he said. In another instance, a 30-year-old Vasai resident booked appointments at a sub-district hospital in Jawhar, Palghar on May 7. But on May 8, when he along with his 26-year-old wife, went to the centre, the hospital asked outsiders to wait until they inoculated the locals. After immunising the locals, the others were asked to leave. When they resisted, the hospital staffers allegedly misbehaved with them. “Later, when the tehsildar appeared at the vaccination centre, he asked everyone to leave saying vaccines would not be given to outsiders. When one person asked the reason, he threatened to be arrested,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “It’s injustice to rural people who are being deprived of the opportunity to get inoculated. People from the city should not do this. There is no need to panic over the limited supply of vaccine doses.” But citizens reasoned saying that it is not illegal to book appointments in other districts or outskirts if slots are available. “Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra and we pay taxes to the government. So, if needy people can find a slot, then they have the right to book it. Within seconds, the slots are getting over. This is so frustrating,” said the Kandivali resident. Pvt hospitals still in the dark From May 1, the Central government allowed private hospitals to inoculate those above 18 years. Of the hundreds of private hospitals in Mumbai, only two — HL Reliance (Girgaum) and Nanavati (Vile Parle) Hospitals – have got vials to inoculate the public above 18 years. Even after nine days of starting the fourth phase of the mass immunization programme, private hospitals in the city are still struggling to procure the vials. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer (CEO), LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said, “We have not been able to get the vaccine from the BMC. We also do not know whom to contact. Nobody seems to have any answers.” He also held a conference call with the Serum Institute of India (SII) where he was informed that it would take them two-three months to supply the vials directly to the private hospitals. “They informed us that they are ramping up the production. Almost 50% of the vials would be given to the Government of India (GOI) and the other 50% vaccines would be provided to the Government of Maharashtra (GOM). If GOM doesn’t give the vaccines, we would have to procure it directly from the manufacturer which would take till the end June/July,” he said. Every day, major hospitals like Lilavati, Bombay and Jaslok Hospitals are getting over 35 queries from young adults about vaccination. “We have kept the infrastructure ready but if we don’t get the vials, we are helpless. Private hospitals can play an integral part in the mass immunisation programme, if we are given the vials,” said Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati hospital. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country and Mumbai is often considered the epicentre of the pandemic. At a time, when public health officers have already declared a possibility of a third wave in the next four-five months, local politicians have come down heavily on the Central government for their lack of preparedness. “As reported, the Central government has sent 6.6 crore doses of vaccines to 93 countries as a goodwill gesture, but other countries’ Covid-19 load has been far lower than India. The vials were enough to vaccinate all people in Mumbai and Delhi. We wouldn’t have faced any shortage,” said Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party (SP) legislator and corporator from Nagpada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-citizens-go-outside-city-for-covid-jabs-101620588254735.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Labourers’ exodus sets back GMADA’s water project by two more months||Labourers migrating back home in anticipation of longer lockdown has yet again put off Greater Mohali Area Development Authority’s project to bring additional water supply of 5 million gallons daily (MGD) from Phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks. Already delayed by 18 months due to the pandemic, the workers’ exodus is expected to set the project back by another two months. The project was initially slated to finish by December 2020, but the deadline was pushed to July 31, 2021, and now again to September this year.This, when Mohali is already facing a daily shortage of 10 MGD water, while the demand-supply difference shoots up to 12 MGD in peak summer. Presently, the city gets 10 MGD water from Kajauli waterworks and an equal volume from 75 tubewells.“Around 50% of our workers have gone back to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh fearing a longer lockdown. We don’t expect them to return soon. Earlier, we had 150 labourers to complete the construction of the water treatment plant at Singhpur, but the number has come down to 70,” said Davinder Singh, chief engineer of GMADA.The plant, which is being set up by a Vadodara-based company at a cost of ₹100 crore, was initially also delayed over whether to ready one for 5 MGD or 20 MGD supply, until GMADA decided to go for the second option..Chandigarh, meanwhile, is already getting its share of additional 35 MGD water under Phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks, which is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district, and caters to the water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir.MC councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had filed a case in the Punjab and Haryana high court regarding the water shortage in Mohali, said, “The project for additional supply is being repeatedly delayed due to lackadaisical attitude of the officials concerned, while the public continues to suffer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/labourers-exodus-sets-back-gmada-s-water-project-by-two-more-months-101620588196974.html

Patients can apply for the facility through the portal http://oxygenhry.in. Applicants will have to upload a photograph of their oximeter so as to ascertain their oxygen levels and their Aadhaar Card and provide details such as age and address. Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said demands will be verified by a team of officials, who will telephonically contact the patient and simultaneously seek feedback from the doctor to whom a particular sector has been assigned. Thereafter, volunteers of the Red Cross Society and other non governmental organisations (NGOs) will provide an oxygen cylinder to the patient.The DC has also constituted a team of officials, to be monitored by Magistrate Simranjeet Kaur, to assist the Red Cross secretary in refilling the oxygen cylinders. Rate of O2 cylinder fixedAhuja said the rate for refilling oxygen cylinders has been fixed. “A Type B cylinder will cost ₹185 and Type D cylinder ₹325 and an additional 12% goods and service tax will be levied. Liquid oxygen will be provided for ₹17.5 per cubic metre and 12% goods and service tax will be levied. Another ₹50 will be charged as transportation charges.” The DC said, “The introduction of door-to-door oxygen cylinder refill facility will immensely benefit patients in home isolation as their family members need not wait in queue to get the cylinders refilled. Besides, this will also help us keep tabs on those involved in the black marketeering of oxygen cylinders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/get-doorstep-refill-of-oxygen-in-panchkula-101620588195814.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Attending to all calls for help for a year||A 35-year-old man worried about being unable to see his wife and child for months due to lockdown restrictions; a 28-year-old woman locked in with her abusive father in her hometown where she is stuck after she lost her job during the pandemic; an 18-year-old student worried about the status of his exams in a crucial year. These and many other concerned callers have been flooding the helpline numbers for the past one year, in search of much needed help, and this is where free and public helpline numbers like iCall came to the rescue. “Ours is a unique helpline run by professionals and is free of cost. While iCall regularly addresses around 55-57 calls a day, post Covid and lockdown it’s almost double than usual. Soon, we realised that the existing helpline was not able to handle all calls as most were Covid-specific and needed immediate resource mobilisation,” said Dr Aparna Joshi, assistant professor and director, iCall. Initiated in 2012 as part of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Field Action Project, iCall was put in place to fill up the vast vacuum that exists in the field of mental healthcare in the country. “Normally, 40-50% of our callers are repeat callers because we provide long-term support apart from initial support. But with Covid, most callers were those facing psychosocial concerns related to the pandemic and we realised the need for a separate helpline number catering solely to Covid affected people,” added Joshi. Towards the end of March 2020, two new helpline numbers were introduced by iCall—one for general public wanting to share their Covid-related fears and concerns emanating from the lockdown, and the second catering to health and mental health professionals. The first dedicated COVID helpline was supported by the Mariwala Health Foundation that supports iCall’s regular helpline too. Introduced in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the idea behind the second helpline, SWASTHI, for health and mental health professionals was to address concerns of people who were “providing services to others, but were getting completely burnt out as they were also affected by the same trauma that the clients were talking about”. On an average, iCall would address anywhere between 5,000-8,000 calls a year, but between March 2020 and March 2021, the original helpline number addressed over 20,000 calls from across 29 states and union territories. The Covid-specific helpline number received 3,892 calls between April 17 and December 31, 2020. And apart from these, the helpline was also catering to people via emails and responded to nearly 1,500 emails every month last year. “The Covid-specific helpline received maximum calls from the northern and western states and showed that a majority of calls came from the 21-30 age group. The nature of the calls ranged from practical concerns such as access to medicines, health facilities, food, etc to livelihood-related and mental health concerns,” said Joshi, adding the general helpline also received maximum calls with Covid-related anxiety, emotional distress calls, relationship concerns, academic and job-related concerns as well as suicidal ideations. A report on the numbers recently appeared in the Journal of Social and Economic Development highlighted how in the first wave of the pandemic, most calls received by the helpline number were related to the fear of the pandemic, fuelled by low levels of awareness. What made matters worse were constant exposure to media reports of rising number of cases and deaths, leaving individuals worried about their health and safety. Many callers also addressed the problem of a flailing health system which could not support those in need, whereas others highlighted the plight of job losses and the economic slowdown on the livelihoods of individuals which directly affected their mental well-being. “One of the significant themes for which callers sought help from iCall regularly pertained to relationship conflicts, reported by individuals from different age groups including parent-child, intimate, married, long distance and peer relationships. Families, forced to stay together for extended periods, found it difficult to navigate through this enforced togetherness,” highlighted the report. Stranded in the same household with parents, spouses and children led to newer triggers for conflicts. “There has been an increase in cases of family members complaining of lack of personal space as all members are home-bound, leading to higher stress and anxiety disorders among all age groups,” said clinical psychologist, Dr Seema Hingorrany. “In the past one year, more young couples are worried that they are headed towards divorce, whereas youngsters are witnessing domestic violence instances between their parents and this has left many scarred,” she said, adding that more therapists are now resorting to family therapy sessions for such cases. Recently, iCall was recognised and listed as a mental health innovation by the Global Mental Health Innovation Network, giving the helpline workers the much-deserved recognition and accolades. “iCall fills the huge treatment gap that exists in mental health services in the country, especially in covid times. Designed as a free, confidential, multilingual, telephone-based service by trained counsellors, it aligns with the core principle of the UN Sustainable Development Goals—‘leave no one behind’,” said professor Shalini Bharat, director, TISS. She added that as a community connected institute of higher learning, TISS remains committed to innovating services and programs for improving health and wellbeing of people. “The Global Mental Health Innovation Network Award to iCall is a huge reaffirmation of our conviction that educational institutes must remain socially relevant and use knowledge to find solutions to people’s problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/attending-to-all-calls-for-help-for-a-year-101620588194692.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||Senior Air India pilot loses battle to Covid-19||A senior Air India pilot who operated flights under the government’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and cargo flights, lost battle to Covid-19 on Sunday. The 54-year-old, Capt. Amitesh Prasad who operated Boeing 777, was a resident of Kandivli and had last landed in Bangalore on April 15. He, however, complained of symptoms after reaching Mumbai and tested positive on April 20, after which, he was immediately admitted to the hospital. An Air India official said, “His last flight was AI 176, San Francisco, to Bangalore. He landed in India on April 15 and tested positive on April 20 and was moved to the hospital shortly after.” A pilot’s friend said that Capt. Prasad was involved in several cargo flights in the initial stage of the pandemic, flying emergency supplies from China. “He also operated several Vande Bharat flights throughout the pandemic. He breathed his last at 1.30am on Sunday in KJ Somaiya Hospital, Sion,” the pilot said. A statement issued by Indian Pilot’s Guild (IPG) read, “Amitesh was loved by all for his gentle nature. We are blessed to have been able to call him our colleague and friend. Amitesh has faithfully served Air India since December 1995 where he joined Flight Despatch. Over the years he worked hard and made his way to the rank of Commander on the Boeing777 fleet. He was actively involved in flying cargo missions to Shanghai and Guangzhou when the pandemic struck last year. And has been flying Vande Bharat flights to the US and back until he recently fell ill with Covid-19.”Capt. Prasad is succeeded by his wife, who is also undergoing treatment for Covid at the hospital, and his two teenaged children. Air India officials said that the wife is currently stable. Close pilot friends said that Capt. Prasad’s daughter is studying in Canada and his 15-year-old son studying in the city and is currently residing with his relatives. Air India pilots said that the frontliners are not given priority for vaccination, which has been communicated to the management by both the pilots’ unions. While IPG, union of Boeing pilots, wrote to the Air India management on April 28, the Indian Commercial Pilot’s Association, an Airbus pilots union warned to stop work, if the management does not start a vaccination drive and if pilots are not given priority. “He is the second pilot to lose his battle to Covid, in Air India. The previous pilot, however, was not flying while he contracted Covid,” said an Air India official. “We have been risking our lives to fly for the nation. Despite the pandemic claiming lives and difficulty in even getting treatment due to lack of medical infrastructure, the management has not begun vaccination drives. We have been assured that they will conduct the vaccination drive from May 15, however, this should have been done at least a month earlier,” said a senior Air India pilot.“However, in due fairness, after the pilot was admitted, the airline’s medical staff did everything they could, to help Capt. Prasad,” he added. This is not it. Air India also lost its maintenance engineer on Sunday. 41-year-old Johnson Turkey, a Kolkata based engineer also succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senior-air-india-pilot-loses-battle-to-covid19-101620588135212.html
10-05-2021||Other||1K mangrove trees likely to be cut for six-lane bridge at Navi Mumbai||An estimated 1,000 mangrove trees are proposed to be cut by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) for constructing a six-lane elevated bridge between Airoli and Ghansoli. The trees will be cut to make way for 25 load-bearing pillars. In total, an estimated 5,500 mangrove trees, spread over a 4-hectare area, will be affected by the project, officials familiar with the development confirmed. The proposed bridge will connect Sector 14 in Ghansoli to the Airoli Katai Naka Freeway via Airoli-Mulund Bridge, and will help decongest the Thane Belapur Road. The matter has, for the time being, been deferred by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for want additional details by the project proponent – NMMC. “The project involves construction of a bridge in the mangrove area along the east bank of Thane creek over a length of 1.05km. As per the approved CZMP (coastal zone management plan), the project falls under CRZ (coastal regulation zone)-I (A) and II areas,” MCZMA observed in its last meeting on April 15, when the matter was considered for CRZ clearance. Part of the project will also cut through 50 metres of the reserve forest buffer zone in Dive village. In a report submitted by NMMC to MCZMA in February, about 810 mangroves trees were slated to be cut for the project, with another 2,640 trees being temporarily affected during the construction phase. However, a subsequent site visit conducted by the forest department’s mangrove cell in March estimated that about 1,000 trees would need to be cut. “As per the report of the mangrove cell, a total number of mangroves affected [will be] about 5,500-6,000 which fall in the alignment of the proposed bridge,” MCZMA observed in its minutes of the meeting. Virender Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, said, “We have conducted the site visit and a more detailed survey is yet to be done. Given the damage to the mangroves, NMMC will have to seek clearance from the Bombay high court (HC) and also apply for diversion of forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The CRZ clearance will be contingent on these compliances.” In light of a September 2018 HC order which barred construction in mangrove areas other than for projects of public interest, MCZMA “decided that NMMC need to submit the explicit note on the public interest involved in the project... accordingly, the matter was deferred for want of said information.” HT reached about to Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar for a comment on the issue but did not receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1k-mangrove-trees-likely-to-be-cut-for-six-lane-bridge-at-navi-mumbai-101620588014615.html

Also, a meeting was held on Sunday, regarding this issue at the university.The UT education department has already directed all educational institutions and public libraries in Chandigarh to stay closed till May 31. Last month, in a meeting chaired by the UT education secretary, it was decided that the students who are staying at hostels of PU and colleges be advised to return to their homes.Facilitation committee set upThe varsity has also set up a facilitation committee to help students to return to their homes.

10-05-2021||Other||Where will Congress be in 2024 after poor performance in WB: Sanjay Raut||In a remark that could draw a wedge between state’s two ruling partners, Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut has raised questions on where the Congress will be on a national stage in 2024, following its poor poll performance in West Bengal. While analysing the West Bengal election results in his weekly column RokhThok in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be defeated, but there is no leader to challenge him in Delhi. While batting for a strong leadership, Raut added that key leaders will soon take a decision on forming formidable opposition front. After a brief pause, Raut has reignited the issue of creating a front of opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) juggernaut head-on in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. While refraining from naming a leader who could lead the opposition’s front, Raut said that the decision will have to be taken collectively. Earlier, Raut had faced criticism from Congress leaders for backing Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to become the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, which is now headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “In all the state elections, Congress has been left behind. Congress’s Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the defeat in Bengal is a “humiliating loss”. In the 290-member Assembly, the Congress and Left parties did not win a single seat. We are happy with [West Bengal chief minister] Mamata’s [Banerjee] victory, but the pain of Congress’s decline is equally strong. Where will Congress be on the national stage in 2024? Has Mamata’s victory given a new direction for the general election in 2024? If the opposition decides to come together, then who would lead it? This must be decided with consensus and Congress will have to give its nod,” Raut wrote in his column. Later in the day, Raut clarified that he did not seek a new leadership and added that Congress party would remain the “soul” of the Opposition front. “Everybody wants to create a front that would challenge the government. The soul of this Opposition front will definitely be Congress. No front can be created without Congress. They got seats in Assam but unfortunately couldn’t come to power. They have had some success in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. But Congress needs to lunge forward.... Congress, which is the largest party in the Opposition, has not won any seat in the West Bengal Assembly election. This is really sad for us. If UPA is strengthened, then Congress will remain the soul of it because it is a national party. I spoke to Pawar saheb about it and soon the leaders will arrive at a decision,” Raut said. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he said that “whenever Congress fails, they get worried”. When asked who does he propose to lead the Opposition front, Raut retorted, “I have not said anything about new leadership. We all have to sit together and decide a leader; everybody thinks he is the leader, but it not so. And aghadis (coalitions) are not created in this manner. The three parties in Maharashtra decided that their leader is Uddhav Thackeray and it is a model front where three ideologically opposite parties have come together. All parties will have to come together to create such a front on a national level.” According to Raut, BJP is not undefeatable but the challenge is a strong leadership against Narendra Modi. He batted for a strong leadership against Modi and BJP. He said that despite back-to-back losses in the Vidhan Sabha elections, Modi and not BJP, is winning the Lok Sabha election. “This is Modi’s victory, because there is no such leader in Delhi that would challenge him. Until such a leader is made, there will be no contest. Results in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have shown then Modi and Shah can be defeated no matter how much might they put into an election. This means that the idea that Modi is a popular leader to win election is not flawless. The weak leadership and lack of machinery with the Opposition is the political strength of Modi-[home minister Amit] Shah,” he added. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said that they do not pay attention to Raut’s statements about their party. “We do not pay attention to what Raut says; whatever we wanted to tell him [about strengthening UPA], we have done it in the past. We have stopped reading Saamana as well. It is better to ignore things where our leaders or our organisation is being criticised. If somebody thinks that their party can get prominence by pointing finger at another party, they must see that four fingers point back at them,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye advised former ally Shiv Sena to look at who they are following. “Congress will respond Sena’s latest criticism. But if they think Congress is doing poorly, then they should see who their ally is,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/where-will-congress-be-in-2024-after-poor-performance-in-wb-sanjay-raut-101620587956494.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||World’s largest cargo plane, carrying Covid aid from UK, lands at IGI airport||The world’s largest cargo plane touched down at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport on Sunday morning, carrying three oxygen generators and 1,000 ventilators from the UK. Experts said the aircraft, Antonov AN 124-100, had flown into the country even in the past to deliver Delhi Metro wagons, specialist construction equipment and military cargo.The 24-wheeler Russian-made aircraft departed from Belfast airport late on Saturday night and landed at the Delhi airport at 8.30 am on Sunday.On Sunday morning, Delhi customs said in a statement that the medical aid onboard the aircraft was cleared within 25 minutes of its landing.On Sunday afternoon, the British high commission in New Delhi also tweeted: “The UK sends life-saving support for India in the world’s largest cargo plane. Three oxygen generation units arrived in India today. Each capable of producing 500 litres of oxygen per minute. It will help save lives and support India’s healthcare system.”Also read | Variant deepening India’s crisis, says top WHO scientistEach of the three oxygen generation units – the size of 40ft freight containers - produces 500 litres of oxygen per minute, enough for 50 people to use at a time, it said.“Taking forward our comprehensive strategic partnership, consignment of 3 oxygen generators and 1,000 ventilators arrives from the UK... Deeply value the contribution from our close friend,” tweeted MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Sunday.The Antonov AN 124-100 - the world’s largest air cargo carrier - is 70 metres long and nearly 75 metres wide. The plane, which weighs around 1.8 lakh kilograms, usually has six crew members and two load masters.Aviation experts say the aircraft has flown several times to India in the past, mostly to Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta, and has shipped a wide range of cargo, including Delhi Metro wagons, election promotion material, specialist construction equipment and military cargo.Aviation safety expert Mark D Martin said the aircraft’s maximun take of weight (MTOW) comes in close to the Lockheed C5A Galaxy Freighter, which was the largest aircraft till the AN 225 Mriya entered service in 1990.“India has welcomed even more larger aircraft in the past, the Lockheed C5A Galaxy operated by the US Air Force has in the past made several flights to India, transporting critical aid and support equipment needed for the visits of U.S Presidents,” he said.Commenting on Indian airports’ capacity to handle an Antonov 124, Martin said, most airports in India have the ground handling capability to support the AN124 as high loaders are not required and the cargo can be rolled down from the rear clamshell doors. “When the AN 124 came to Ahmedabad, tractors could easily ride in to drop off the cargo. Now in India, fork lifts do that function more efficiently,” Martin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/worlds-largest-cargo-plane-carrying-covid-aid-from-uk-lands-at-igi-airport-101620587955736.html

While some left around Holi, many went to cast their vote during the state and panchayat elections. But a large number of workers have left since the lockdown was announced on April 19.On Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the extension of the lockdown—this is the fourth extension — till May 17 and promised to tighten its enforcement.In the past 10 days, Inamul Haq, a private labour contractor, has helped over 100 construction workers associated with him return home. “The workers wanted to go as they feared a repeat of what happened to them last year during the nationwide lockdown. Given the present situation in Delhi, things are unlikely to normalise anytime soon,” he said.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiHaq, too, doesn’t want them to stay back: “Last year, close to 150 of my workers were stuck in Delhi. I took care of their food and stay. But now I can’t do it. I’ll call them back once the situation normalises here.”The slow and gradual reverse migration has slowed down infrastructure projects, once again, in the city. Though construction work is allowed on sites where in-situ arrangement is made for workers, various government agencies say that the work has got affected due to insufficient labour.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which is undertaking work on Phase-4 project, said that the number of workers at their sites has come down from about 4,100 (as on April 18) to around 2,900 in the last week of April.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “There has been a decrease in the number of workers since the lockdown. Many who left for Holi holidays also haven’t returned. We are hopeful that they will return back with the gradual improvement in the overall Covid scenario. Workers who are currently here are being adequately taken care of with necessary medical care as well.”At the Pragati Maidan redevelopment site, the work is moving at a snail’s pace, as the number of workers has trickled down from 2,500 in March to around 600 now.LC Goyal, chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), said that the workers left in batches this time. “While close to 1,000 workers left during Holi and have not returned, some left the city during the recent state elections. Many workers left after the lockdown was announced in April. Today, we are left with 600 workers at the site. As the lockdown in Delhi has been gradually extended, there is uncertainty among workers,” said Goyal.The deadline for the ₹2,700-crore Pragati Maidan redevelopment project was revised last year to March 2022. “We will have to rework the deadlines depending on how fast we can mobilise the workers and resume the full pace of work,” he added.A major part of ITPO or Pragati Maidan redevelopment project is the ₹777-crore traffic regulation project, which is being carried out by the Delhi government’s Public Works Department (Delhi PWD).The construction of a 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road (near Pragati Maidan Mathura Road) and the Ring Road (near Pragati Power Station), and six underground U-turns on Mathura Road and Bhairon Marg are in various stages of completion.However, the spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi and the lockdown has scared workers, said a senior PWD official. “We had around 500 workers before the lockdown. But now we have 200-odd people. Workers are scared that they will contract the infection, as they work in proximity. Though arrangements have been made for isolation and treatment by contractors, workers are scared. Almost every day we find some workers missing. This has adversely impacted the pace of work,” said the official, requesting anonymity.A PWD official said that the tunnel is almost 95% complete though shortage of labour has affected remaining work.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is the nodal agency for the construction of the new Parliament building and the redevelopment of Central Vista, is also facing a shortage of workers. Though the contractors for the ambitious projects have made arrangements for the stay of labourers, CPWD officials said the pace of work has been affected. The CPWD is also redeveloping four of the seven government residential colonies in south Delhi to provide accommodation for central government employees.A senior CPWD official said, “Labour is not available at sites in enough numbers and this has impacted the pace of work.”Also read | Pet boarding facilities inundated with requests from Covid-affected familiesThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is constructing the Dwarka expressway project, said that close to 10-15% of workers have left after the lockdown. “The gradual increase in lockdown period has led to fear among the workers. The biggest problem right now is that there is no inflow of new workers, especially skilled labourers. We are trying to build confidence among workers so that they don’t leave. We have made adequate arrangements for them and are making efforts to get those aged 45+ vaccinated. But the fear among workers is palpable,” said an NHAI official.The National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), which is carrying out several infrastructure projects in the city, is also facing problems due to labour shortage at its sites. A senior NBCC India official said, “The fear of the disease is forcing people to return to their home states as they want to be close to their families. So while the work is going on at our sites, the pace of work has definitley slowed down.”NBCC is working on projects such as development of East Kidwai Nagar, Sarojini Nagar and Nauroji Nagar; redevelopment of Pragati Maidan and several government office complexes; and development of Bharat Vandana Park in Dwarka, among other.Meanwhile, construction workers in the unorganised sectors are the worst hit.Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, said, “Due to the lockdown, they are unable to find work as construction work is allowed only if labourers live on-site. A large number of workers are daily wagers who work as carpenters, masons, plumbers etc. Due to the spike in cases, there is not much work available. People are finding it difficult to make ends meet. While the government has announced financial assistance, there are many who are still not registered with the board (Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board).”Hari Prasad, who has a team of carpenters, plumbers, masons, etc, said that there are no work orders since the lockdown was announced. “A lot of my workers have left, as they were finding it difficult to pay rent and sustain their families. Most of them are daily wagers,” said Prasad.Given the situation at hospitals, Haq said that workers feel that they are safe in their home towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/infra-projects-in-delhi-stare-at-delays-amid-labour-shortage-101620587895801.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||GTB hospital doc dies within hours of testing positive for Covid||A 26-year-old doctor at Guru Tegh Bahadur (GBT) Hospital, which has been converted into a designated Covid-19 hospital, died within hours of testing positive for the infection on Sunday, confirmed officials from the hospital administration.Dr Anas Mujahid, a resident of north-east Delhi’s Bhagirathi Vihar who completed his internship after MBBS in January, was working at the hospital’s gynaecology ward as a junior resident since last month.Mujahid was known to be hardworking, the most humble and helpful person among his colleagues and juniors at the University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) at GTB hospital. He was reporting to duty till Saturday, officials said.According to his colleagues and family members, the discharge slip issued by the hospital mentioned that Mujahid was Covid positive and suffered from “intracranial hemorrhage” (bleeding within the skull, including the brain).His batchmate and colleague Amir Sohail said both of them visited Mujahid’s home for iftar (meal to break the day-long fast during Ramzan) on Saturday evening. “Since last month, we have been staying at a hotel provided by the hospital to all doctors who are currently on Covid duty. While returning back to the hotel from Mujahid’s home, he complained of feeling feverish. He decided to take a rapid antigen test at the fever clinic of the GTB hospital before going to the hotel. He tested positive for Covid-19,” said Sohail.“We were sitting in the clinic only when he suddenly collapsed. I, along with other staff members, rushed him to the casualty ward. He was not responding well. The doctors there sent him for a CT-scan. The report revealed a massive bleeding spot in the brain. He was immediately transferred to the neurological department, where he died around 2:30am,” he added.Sohail said he has been finding it difficult to process his friend’s sudden death. “He worked in the Covid ward last year also and was alright throughout. I was the one who contracted the virus while on duty. He was absolutely fine till Saturday evening. I still cannot believe he left us like that,” he said adding Mujahid had not taken the vaccine shots.Mauz Mujahid, younger brother of the deceased, said the family received a call from the hospital around 10pm on Saturday. “We could not believe what Anas’ friend was saying as he was with us till a few hours ago. My parents and my elder brother immediately rushed to the hospital. Within hours, he left us. Our family is in shock. My parents still can’t accept it even after cremating him,” he said. Mujahid’s father is an Unani doctor. He is survived by his parents, two brothers, and a younger sister.Dr. Mohammad Anas, Mujahid’s junior at the college and hospital and his namesake, said, “He was just one year senior to me. I was in the 2016 batch and he was in 2015. We immediately connected because we shared the same name. He was the most humble person I know. Always so polite and helpful...the entire fraternity is in shock. We cannot believe that a person as young as him could die this way without having any severe symptoms.”A K Jain, dean of UCMS at GTB Hospital, confirmed Mujahid’s death. “I am yet to go through his medical reports. It’s really unfortunate that he is not with us anymore.”Dr. Satendra Singh, a faculty at UCMS at GTB Hospital, said that he got to know about Mujahid’s death on Sunday morning. “It’s a rare case of sudden progression (of Covid-19) and it’s alarming. Generally, we have seen cases of blood clots and internal bleeding in patients with severe Covid symptoms. However, according to his friends, he was fine till Saturday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gtb-hospital-doc-dies-within-hours-of-testing-positive-for-covid-101620587894636.html

Thane resident Jigar Jayesh Pandya, 27, and Abu Tahir Afzal Hussain Choudhary, 31, a Mankhurd local, are in police custody till May 12 for the alleged possession of the highly radioactive substance. An NIA team had visited the ATS office to verify the facts. “Now the documents related to the case will be handed over to them for further inquiry. As per the procedure, NIA will approach the court to take custody of both the accused as they are in ATS custody till 12 May,” said an ATS officer. The incident came to light after police inspector Santosh Bhalekar of the Nagpada unit got information about a person planning to sell pieces of uranium illegally. Bhalekar and his team then laid a trap and nabbed Pandya. During interrogation, Pandya revealed that he had got the uranium from Choudhary. Bhalekar then arrested Choudhary on May 5 after questioning several scrap dealers in Mumbai. In the meanwhile, ATS had sent the recovered substance to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Trombay, for chemical analysis. The BARC report confirmed that the seized substance was natural uranium and dangerous to human life. Based on the report, the ATS Kalachowki police station registered a first information report (FIR). “We’ve been interrogating the accused to find out where they had procured the uranium from. It appears that there are many others involved in the case. The uranium is around ₹3 crore per kg in the market,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nia-to-probe-7-kg-uranium-seizure-case-in-mumbai-101620587895185.html
10-05-2021||Other||Maratha quota: Outfits not satisfied with committee of retired judges||Maratha organisations are not satisfied with the Maharashtra government’s decision to form a committee under two retired judges of the Bombay high court (HC) to review the Supreme Court’s (SC) decision and suggest the best alternatives to move forward on the issue.The organisations pointed out that they had also recommended names of legal luminaries who have studied the subject in detail, but the government overlooked their suggestions.Virendra Pawar, one of the convenors from Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), said, “This step was expected when the legal battle for reservation was going on in the Apex court. We had suggested names of Dr Sadanand More (scholar), [retired HC judge] BG Kolse Patil and [retired SC judge] PB Sawant’s names to the government, requesting them to use their expertise by appointing them as advisers, but our recommendations were overlooked.”“If the state government is really serious about granting reservation to the Maratha community, they should then consider incorporating us in the OBC (other backward class) quota,” he added.Sanjiv Bhor Patil, president, Shiv Prahar Sangathana, said the state is just passing time.“We have lost our reservation, so now whatever is required to get it back, should be done at the earliest. We would have hit the streets by now but are not doing so because of the pandemic. We want the government to not waste time anymore,” said Patil.Many organisations are planning to hold state-wide virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders of the political parties.However, Mansing Pawar, one of the convenors of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, termed the state’s move as a positive development. “It’s definitely a positive development as only two authorities in the country — the Supreme Court and President — can provide us reservation. Individual petitioners are also preparing grounds to go for a review but the petition by the state government will make a difference. Thus I would say that it is a much needed step,” Pawar said.Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.The Apex court on Wednesday quashed the reservation to the Marathas, stating that people from the community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment – that set a 50% cap on reservation – to a larger bench for reconsideration.Following this, the state on Saturday decided to constitute a committee under two retired high court (HC) judges to review the SC verdict and suggest the next course of action. The committee, comprising five-six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government.The government also said that they are tapping the option of requesting the Central government to intervene, as the judgment stated that the right to accord the reservation is with the Centre after the 102nd Constitutional amendment.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to the President and Prime Minister, requesting them to take the steps required for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” state public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-outfits-not-satisfied-with-committee-of-retired-judges-101620587834641.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Probe marked as SAD claims top posts in MC Kharar amid deferred polls||After the Mohali administration failed to convene elections for president, senior vice-president and vice-president of the Kharar municipal council on May 3 amid Covid curbs, the Shiromani Akali Dal claimed that it had elected its councillors to all three posts the same evening, prompting the sub-divisional magistrate to mark an inquiry into the matter. SAD has elected Jaspreet Kaur as president, Harinder Pal Singh Jolly as senior vice-president and Jasbir Singh Jonny as vice-president. On February 17, the MC elections had resulted in a hung house as Congress bagged 10 of 27 seats, SAD won eight, Aam Aadmi Party one and Independents clinched eight seats. On April 19, violence had broken out during elections for the top posts of the MC after Congress councillors alleged that SAD was luring Independents with money. Some councillors tried to attack the SDM, compelling authorities to postpone the polls to May 3. Kharar constituency SAD in-charge Ranjit Singh Gill said, “We knew that they (the administration) are not going to convene a meeting. Thus, on May 3, we elected our councillors to all three posts around 4.15pm as we had the support of 15 councillors.” “The elections were conducted as per the Punjab Municipal Act. We have sent copies of the election to authorities concerned for notification and should they refuse, we will move court,” he said. As per act, we can conduct elections by appointing one of our councillors as convener. A recording of the meeting has been submitted to the Kharar SDM, Gill added. However, SDM Himanshu Jain said, “Elections on May 3 were postponed in the wake of Covid restrictions. Now, I have received an email regarding the conduct of elections, but I do not know when these elections were held . I have already marked an inquiry and have asked the executive officer of MC to submit a report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/probe-marked-as-sad-claims-top-posts-in-mc-kharar-amid-deferred-polls-101620587715418.html

Instead of watching TV or social media, that are full of news related to Covid disease and deaths, many have revived their interests in forgotten hobbies like gardening, reading books, listening to music and learning to play musical instruments. Some are flying kites while many others are playing carom online. Retired government employee, Syed Mohd Zaki, 72, a resident of old city area in Rani Mandi, for instance, had been a national level carrom player. As he got busy with job and family, carom took a backseat. Recently his sons downloaded carrom game app in his smartphone. Ever since, Zaki has been busy. “Carrom was my passion once and these days, I play the game online. It helps me beat stress and negative thoughts,” he said. Similarly, Savitri Verma, 75, resident of Gangotri Nagar in Naini area, revived her interest in gardening. These days, she spends her time attending to the plants in her garden. “My garden is greener than before,” she said. “I had a passion for gardening since long but was not able to give attention to it due to responsibilities at home. Now, with not much to do, gardening helps me stay engaged,” she added. Khursheed Akhari, 80, a retired lecturer of Persian and Arabic, now spends most of her time reading religious books while Deepak Srivastava, 50, a resident of Katra area, has begun writing a book. “These days the social media is full of negative news. It was having negative impact on me. I used to feel ill myself. I am a writer so now I quit social media and have started writing a book. Moreover, I have collected about a hundred plants on my terrace and am also pursuing my passion for gardening,” Srivastava said. There are many others like them who have either started learning how to cook new dishes or begun flying kites. Some others have started watching old movies or listening to olden melodies on their smartphones. Senior psychiatrist Dr Rakesh Paswan said diverting attention from negative news is the best way to beat stress and depression. “Engaging in other activities will distract people from social media and other news platforms which are full of news about deaths due to Covid which is leaving negative impact on people’s mind and is affecting their immunity,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reviving-forgotten-passions-to-beat-covid-stress-101620586754670.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||Speed bumps ahead for Maharashtra’s vaccination drive||Amid a shortage of Covaxin doses, Maharashtra has received 36,000 doses of the vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech, expected to be used for the second dose. The state on Sunday received 703,000 doses of Covishield for inoculation of people over 45 years, which would help the state continue its drive, albeit at a slow pace. Maharashtra also received the 350,000 doses of Covishield it purchased from the Serum Institute of India for vaccination of the 18-44 age group category.On Saturday, the state health department had written a letter to the Centre, urgently seeking Covaxin doses, as over 500,000 people from the age group of above 45 years were due for their second dose. State immunisation officer DN Patil said the state has received “only 36,000 doses of Covaxin” and the state is expecting more in the coming week. “On Sunday, we received 703,000 doses of Covishield and only 36,000 doses of Covaxin for the vaccination of people over age 45. Besides that, we received 350,000 Covishield vaccines, which the state government has purchased for vaccination of people in the 18-44 category. All the doses have been shipped out to various districts and the drive will continue,” Patil said.Over the past three days, the state’s daily vaccination numbers have seen a dip for want of doses. On Thursday, state inoculated 455,109 beneficiaries, followed by 363,765 on Friday. On Saturday, the state inoculated 236,960 beneficiaries. On Sunday, figures on the CoWin portal showed that the state inoculated 109,276 beneficiaries. So far, the state has fully vaccinated 3,350,633 beneficiaries, while 14,710,907 have taken their first shot. Tope on Sunday said the vaccination drive in the state is going on at a “slow pace” due to unavailability of adequate number of doses. He said the state’s priority is to vaccinate the 57.1 million population in the 18-44 category, but wants the Centre to clear the hurdles of permissions to procure foreign vaccines.“Currently, our vaccination drive is going on in a slow pace because vaccines are not being made available. Chief minister has clearly said that Maharashtra has to potential to purchase 120 million doses in one go, but availability is the main issue. The Centre must intervene in this matter and make vaccine doses available for Maharashtra. The vaccination of 18-44 category is crucial as the age group steps out of their homes. If the government gives permission, we can procure Sputnik or other foreign vaccines for the citizens of our state. There are several approvals needed from the Centre,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/speed-bumps-ahead-for-maharashtra-s-vaccination-drive-101620585854466.html

So far, only Fortis Hospital and Max Hospital in Mohali have been vaccinating those above the age of 18, as the drive was deferred in government centres amid non-availability of vaccines. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “We will start the vaccination drive at government centres once we get the list of registered construction workers. So far, we have not received the list from any company.” Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said it was likely that the inoculation drive for the 18 to 44 age bracket will start in a couple of days, while its registration is on.

10-05-2021||Pune||Free food, books home delivered: mandals in Pune make life easier||PUNE Life in lockdown is anything, but easy. To give a helping hand to students in Pune city, the Seva Mitra Mandal is giving out meals, twice a day, to 150 students. Several Ganpati mandals in Pune are contributing in various ways to help the needy. The Seva Mitra Mandal is located in Shukrwar peth. “Since the lockdown started we began getting calls from students living in our area. There are hundreds of students living here who have come from other districts for studying. Most are dependent on food messes, but now they cannot afford it. So we decided to start daily meals for students, for lunch and dinner. 150 students are registered with us, who takeaway food parcels from our Ganpati temple,” said Shirish Mohite, Seva Mitra Mandal president. Tushar Katkar, one of the students who food from the mandal, said, “I am from Latur and preparing for competitive exams. I came back to Pune in February with a hope that all things are normalised. I am stuck here and do not have enough money. Seva Mitra Mandal helped me and many other students by giving us food.”Similarly, another Ganpati mandal has come up with a unique idea to help children who are now bored at home watching TV and playing mobile games. Sainath Mitra Mandal on Shivaji road has started an unique concept of “Lockdown library” for children. Books are being delivered to children to to discourage them from screen time.Piyush Shah, president of the mandal, said, “It is summer time. Schools and their online lectures or tests are over and children are at home. Due to lockdown no one goes out unless it is an emergency, and most of the children only watch TV or play mobile games. To distract them and encourage their reading habit we started this initiative of through our Ganpati mandal. There are around 16 Ganpati mandals across Pune city who are working under this initiative. Volunteers give the books at home and children read them. Right from the peth areas, Sinhagad road, Ahmednagar road, Vishrantwadi, Hadapsar, Dhankawadi and Katraj, in all thse areas mandals are working.”“We got 5,000 books from some wholesalers and then we classified books as per the age of the child. Then through the social media platforms we spread the word and started getting a good response. We give the book to a child and then request their parents to give that book to another child after reading the book,” added Shah. Welcoming this initiative, Anshul Anil Mohite, a 12-year-old who got books to read from the library said, “I am so happy to get these books to read. All are story books and in different languages. In the last one year I hardly read any other book apart from my study books. We also get bored at home and only watching TV, now I am looking forward to get more books from the library.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/free-food-library-books-home-delivered-ganpati-mandals-pitch-in-to-make-life-under-lockdown-easier-for-youth-101620569413573.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Sirens, crematoria running non-stop leave Pune residents with “stress fatigue”||PUNE Constant ambulance sirens around hospitals have impacted the lives of residents living in these areas; as has the non-stop running of crematoria in the city. Most residents in these areas keep their balcony doors shut for the whole day and take different routes to go out, if at all. April saw Pune district suffer its highest number of Covid fatalities, 2,938, which subsequently saw an increase in ambulance movement. “On normal days we never used to bother. What has happened now is whenever we switch on the TV, we see ambulances on screen. Also, when you stand on the balcony, we see more than one ambulance. All this annoys us,” said Anil Jagtap who stays near KEM hospital. On Saturday, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) also issued an order for ambulance drivers which read: “In accordance with the complaint of the citizens, ambulance drivers have been instructed to avoid the unnecessary use of horns and sirens to reduce noise pollution. It is affecting the health of the citizens. Sirens should not be used in residential areas, especially at night. Action will be taken against the owner and driver of the ambulance under the Motor Vehicle Act if the rule is violated.” The situation is not different with the residents staying near the crematoria. “Here it is not about the ambulance siren, but the chimney’s emitting continuous smoke from the crematorium. Whenever you look out of the window, the scene repeats itself, every day. My father then keeps repeating, ‘how many people are succumbing every day’,” said Virendra Thorat who stays near Vainkuth crematorium, Navi peth. Ambulance driver Mahesh Surve from Thergaon adds, “We generally consider it our duty. The problem only arises if we discuss it more.” Banking professional Mehul Chavare said,” I have started avoiding passing the Vaikunth crematorium since April. It does not give good start to your day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ambulance-sirens-crematoria-running-non-stop-leave-residents-in-these-areas-with-stress-fatigue-101620568873490.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Hospitals in Pune city ramp up preparation, stock-up on medicines in anticipation of Covid’s paediatric 3rd wave||Pune has already begun preparations for the much-anticipated Covid-19 third wave, where children are likely to be the worst affected due. Experts have said that the third wave would affect children the most, as they have not been vaccinated. In addition, children are also vulnerable to Post-Covid Inflammatory Syndrome also known as Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS), post recovery. City hospitals, including those under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), have begun preparations focused on the paediatric Covid-19 testing and treatment. Dr Aarti Kinikar, senior paediatrician and head of department of the paediatric ward at Sassoon General Hospital said, “We have started preparing for the third wave, where it is anticipated that children would be the most affected. We have identified wards which could be taken over in if the numbers rise, including ICU beds. We have also hired consultants to recruit manpower and stocked medicines and surgicals as required. We hope that the wave doesn’t come.”“Right now we have about 35-40 beds, including ICU beds, scattered across the hospital for paediatrics and OBGYN which would go up to 100 as per our plans. We have identified one floor which is right now being used for paediatric-plus- healthcare workers, but then, if need be, we will dedicate it for paediatrics without compromising on the adult Covid-19 facilities. We are hoping that the adult cases reduce,” Dr Kinikar added.Dr Kinikar also said that Sassoon has a dedicated medical gas pipeline system project which would ensure smooth oxygen supply in case of the third wave. “We are also seeing a rise in the PIMS cases which have started coming in from the past one month. This may suddenly increase in the third wave, like we are seeing in European countries and in America too. If the pattern is the same then we may require separate medicines in addition to the ones we require to treat adult Covid-19 patients.”In April alone, the district saw the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, which included six fatalities among those aged below 20 years, of the total 2,938 deaths. The PMC is also working on a dedicated Covid hospital for children at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital facility. Sunil Tingre, MLA from Yerawada, who has funded the project through his MLA funds, said, “Considering the third wave many doctors predicting that it could affect young children as well, a Covid hospital for children is being set up at Bharat Ratna Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada. It will be the first children’s hospital in the state. The hospital will have a total capacity of 200 beds. There will be 150 oxygen beds and 50 ICU beds. Rs1 crore has been provided from my MLA fund and also a large amount of funds has been made available under CSR. On Friday, May 7, I inspected the hospital along with additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal. Instructions have been given to complete the work as soon as possible with necessary facilities.”Dr Jitendra Oswal, paediatrician and deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, said, “We are ready with a dedicated paediatric Covid unit which would be manned by a paediatrician, and also a Covid-positive mother delivery facility. We have also started newborn-to 18-year old RT PCR and antigen testing facilities. In addition we have a dedicated six-bed Covid PICU and NICU, with a facility of mechanical ventilation.” “We anticipate that the third wave would also see a shocking number of children suffering from post- Covid inflammation, a rare but serious condition which typically surfaces after four-six weeks of the Covid peak. The Pune peak was April 8, with above 7,000 cases and around seven-eight per cent of positive cases were children. Many of these children may have antibody positivity. More children may die of inflammatory syndrome and less from active Covid infection,” Dr Oswal added.Dr Oswal also said that of the 4.893 million Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, 10 per cent have been reported in those aged less than 20 years and so ,4,89,300 children have tested positive for Covid. He said, “Even if we consider 0.1% will have inflammatory syndrome then we will have 489 children in Maharashtra alone, and if not recognized early then they are likely to die. Many paediatricians may not be aware of the diagnosis and treatment of this condition and so we need expert manpower and also special drugs like IV immunoglobulin, plus Methylprednisolone in most, and Tocilizumab in a few cases which have to be stocked.” Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, a paediatrician in the city, said, “At Sahyadri hospital we have had about 11 newborns who tested positive in the second wave and we also had two rare and interesting cases of newborn Covid cases, One case with convulsions and one case with heart failure.Both responded to steroids. We have put forward our study for publication in international journals. We have also had 67 Covid-19 positive kids suffer from PIMS and the common symptoms included fever, rash, breathing problems, hypotension and loose motions. Unfortunately, we had one death in these 67 cases.” Dos and don’ts to protect children from Covid-191. Don’t go outside - garden/ play area2. Less screen time3. Involve kids in logical thinking/indoor games4. Any fever – take Antigen/RTPCR test5. Immediate separation from family6. Healthy members of the family should take care of Covid positive children7.
