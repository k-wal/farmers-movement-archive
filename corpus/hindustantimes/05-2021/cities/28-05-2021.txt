28-05-2021||Lucknow||UP aims to administer 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in June, says Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the state aimed to administer one crore (10 million) doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in June.In nearly four-and-a-half months since the launch of the vaccination drive across the country on January 16, UP has administered a total of 1.73 crore (17.3 million) doses, including over 34 lakh (3.4 million) second doses,. The number also includes 16.69 lakh (1.67 million) doses to people in the 18-45 age group, the data shows.Last week, the chief minister had said the state aimed to vaccinate all people (in all the eligible age groups) in the next six months.“From June 1, all the districts in the state will begin vaccinating persons in the 18-44 (18-45) age group. It is important to vaccinate as many people as possible for preventing infection in the future and minimising the effect of the pandemic. So, begin the June vaccination drive with the aim to administer one crore doses in the month,” the chief minister said in a high-level Covid review meeting. Vaccination for the 18-45 group is on in 23 of UP’s 75 districts currently. Those above 45 years of age are getting the jabs in all the districts.He also said it was important to focus on zero wastage of vaccines.All the vaccination centres must have a waiting area and an observation area, he added. There should not be any unnecessary crowding at the centres, he said.He also said, “Covid recovery rate has now reached 95.7% (in UP). In the last 24 hours, the positivity rate was a mere 0.7%. A total of 2,402 fresh cases of Covid were recorded in the state in the last 24 hours while 8,145 people recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the same time period. On April 30, the state had a total of 3.10 lakh active cases which had now come down to 52,244.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-aims-to-administer-10-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-june-says-yogi-101622226505193.html

But the former was recently transferred after being promoted as senior medical officer (SMO) and the latter is on a three-year sabbatical to pursue fellowship in Kolkata.Two other ENT doctors – Dr Ramesh Bhagat, is operating as the district epidemiologist, and Dr Pardeep Kumar, is deputed as Jagraon SMO.Nodal officer of the Covid unit at the civil hospital, Dr Hitinder Kaur confirmed they had no ENT doctor at present. “We have informed the higher authorities in the health department about the staff requirement in the wake of rising black fungus cases,” said Dr Kaur.So far, the district has logged six deaths due to mucormycosis, of which five are from other districts. A total of 64 patients are undergoing treatment in different city hospitals. These include 26 from Ludhiana and 38 from other districts.Sources said in the absence of the specialist, patients were being referred to other hospitals.Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Field Gunj, complained that he brought his father, who had symptoms of black fungus, to the civil hospital as he had limited means. But, in the absence of an ENT doctor, he fears his father’s treatment will be lacking.Besides the fear of consequences of the fungal infection, the cost of treatment at private hospitals is another cause of worry for many.Tilak Raj, 68, a resident of Old City, said he had already spent extensively on his Covid treatment, and wished to get treated at the civil hospital after developing symptoms of black fungus. “But, there is no nasal specialist. So, my son took me to DMCH, which is resulting in more financial burden,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-solitary-civil-hospital-has-no-ent-specialist-for-black-fungus-cases-101622226265157.html
28-05-2021||Chandigarh||New mom reunited with infant son after 14-day battle with contagion||Surrounded by grim scenes for over a year now, especially amid the rising deaths during the pandemic’s second wave, doctors at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) got a reason to smile on Friday when a mother was reunited with her newborn after her two-week battle with Covid-19.A doctor herself, Monika, 41, was 32 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital with serious Covid symptoms on May 13, warranting the need for ventilator support. With her oxygen saturation level down to 80%, doctors were faced with a major challenge to save both the mother and the child, said Dr Rajesh Mahajan, professor of medicine at DMCH.“Complications meant a weeklong ICU stay. But, treating a pregnant woman with serious Covid symptoms is rife with challenges, as strong medicines cannot be administered at such a critical stage,” said Dr Kamakshi, anaesthetist at DMCH, who led the team of young doctors, comprising Dr Ujjwal, Dr Mehak, Dr Shubham, Dr Aman and Dr Karanjot, that treated the patient.A day after her hospital admission, doctors successfully performed a C-Section to save the child, said Dr Ashima Taneja, a gynaecologist. The team of doctors then strived hard to save the mother in the following days and heaved a sigh of relief on the 13th day when she mother finally recovered and was handed her newborn son. “I couldn’t have wanted anything else in life,” Monika gleamed. Equally elated were her family members who spent two weeks in grave tension. “On the one hand was this extreme joy of a new arrival in our family, on the other hand we were constantly praying for his mother’s recovery,” said a family member.Experts have observed an increase in pregnant women contracting the virus as the second wave raged on in the state. In the recent weeks, hundreds of women in their late 20s and 30s across Punjab have tested positive, and over a dozen have succumbed to the virus.Dr Bishav Mohan, a member of the panel of doctors of the Dr KK Talwar committee to manage Covid-19 in Punjab, said pregnant women should not ignore symptoms like cough, fever and body aches, as early diagnosis can save almost every life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-mom-reunited-with-infant-son-after-14-day-battle-with-contagion-101622225964629.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||SC seeks AG’s help over plea on cancellation of Class 12 CBSE exams||The Supreme Court on Friday sought the assistance of the Attorney General to decide on a plea to scrap Class 12 Board examinations and told the petitioner Mamta Sharma to be optimistic as the Centre, which is expected to decide on this issue by Tuesday, could pass a resolution in her favour.The bench posted the matter for Monday and directed a copy of the petition to be given to the central government, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE). It also directed the petition to be supplied to office of Attorney General for India.The bench asked the petitioner why an advance copy was not served to Centre or CBSE. On Friday, as the bench took up the matter for the first time, it found only CISCE being represented in Court by senior advocate JK Das.Initially, one of the judges was of the view that the matter could be heard on Tuesday, coinciding with the Centre’s decision on holding the Class 12 examinations in the wake of the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the bench decided to keep the matter on Monday.The petitioner sought a notice to be issued on her petition as several high courts were also being approached on the same issue. The bench told Sharma, “Be optimistic. May be there is a resolution in your favour.”Sharma appealed to cancel the Class 12 board examinations, saying students should not be made to suffer amidst an unprecedented public health crisis arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic. On April 14, CBSE issued notification cancelling Class 10 examinations and postponing public examination for Class 12. Similar notifications were issued by CISCE on April 16 and 19.Challenging the decision of both the Boards, the petition said, “In view of the unprecedented health emergency and rising number of COVID-19 cases, conduct of examinations either online/offline/blended in coming weeks is not possible and delay in examination will cause irreparable loss to students as time is essence in taking admission in higher education courses in foreign universities. ” Sharma wanted the CBSE, CISCE and Centre to devise an objective methodology to declare the result within a specific time frame.IN this petition, an application has also been moved by a teacher requesting the Court not to scrap the Class 12 exams. This application by a Kerala-based teacher Tony Joseph has been filed by advocate Jose Abraham. The application stated that Class 12 examination is a “career defining” examination in the life of a student and plays a crucial role in determining admissions to higher education institutions.Last year, the top court faced a similar predicament when a demand was made to scrap Class 12 Board examinations. The petition came up at a stage when some subject papers remained. After Court’s intervention, the CBSE decided to scrap Class 10 examinations. It devised an Assessment Scheme for Class 12 students based on papers already given and their overall performance during the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-seeks-ag-s-help-over-plea-on-cancellation-of-class-12-cbse-exams-101622225844036.html

28-05-2021||Delhi||Common entrance test or board exam results? DU prepares for all outcomes||Even as a decision on the conduct of a common entrance test for all central universities remains pending, Delhi University’s computer centre (DUCC) officials said their team would require two to three months to develop a new admissions portal, in case the entrance test is introduced this year.With the second wave of the pandemic causing a delay in class 12 exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as well as other state boards, DU is awaiting a final decision from the ministry on the common entrance test, which will also be dependent on how class 12 students are being evaluated this year.“We cannot develop a portal or test it as we have no idea what kind of function would be required of it,” said Sanjeev Singh, joint director at DUCC. Apart from the uncertainty over the exam situation, two of the five core developers in Singh’s team are recovering from Covid-19. “Once all our team members are back to work, it should take about eight to 12 weeks to create the admissions portal,” he said.Last December, the Union ministry of education had formed a committee to look into the modalities of a common entrance test for undergraduate courses at all central universities, in accordance with the National Education Policy 2020. The committee has submitted its report and universities are currently waiting for the ministry’s response on it.Acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi, who is a member of the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) committee, said such a test will become necessary if class 12 board exams are not conducted this year. “Delhi University admissions are always dependent upon the board exam results. If class 12 board exams are not conducted, we will have to conduct the CUCET to ensure that admissions are made without compromising on quality and merit,” he said.Delhi University, which has been conducting merit-based admissions for a majority of its undergraduate courses, has held multiple deliberations on how the university would adopt the entrance test.“We have discussed things at our level and the admissions committee has prepared itself for possible scenarios. We will also hold sessions to counsel students on the new admission process so that they don’t face any inconvenience or stress,” Joshi said.Since CUCET would be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which currently conducts the entrance tests for nine undergraduate courses at DU, the university will have to tie up with the testing agency to facilitate the admission process.“We have been doing whiteboarding because we will be creating an entirely new portal for admissions this time. So we need to have some ideas ready so that as soon as we have a decision on the policy, we can go ahead with the project,” said Singh.Last year, the DU had developed a website for online open-book examination (OBE) in three months. “There is a difference between designing a portal for exams and admissions. For exams, we know we have a set number of students using the portal. That is not the case with admissions -- we don’t have an idea on how many students will register. We have to keep all those factors in mind while developing a portal,” he said.Former dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said DU will have to look into the modalities of the common entrance test. “Various matters have to be decided apart from the weightage to be awarded for the entrance test and board exam results. For instance, what if students were opting for a stream change, then what kind of test would they opt for? If CUCET is to be implemented, university officials would also need to think about all possible scenarios and make policy decisions on them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/common-entrance-test-or-board-exam-results-du-prepares-for-all-outcomes-101622225785959.html

28-05-2021||Delhi||Centre creating ‘artificial scarcity’ of vaccines to favour pvt sector: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokespersons Raghav Chadha and Atishi on Friday accused the central government of creating an “artificial scarcity” of vaccines in India by favouring supplies to private sector facilities over state governments, including Delhi. Alleging that the state was choking state governments of vaccine supplies and diverting stocks to private facilities — which charge for doses, unlike public centres, forcing people to pay for vaccines. “The Delhi government has run out of vaccines, forcing centres for the 18-45 age group to be suspended. These centres offered vaccines for free. But the private centres, which charge between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 for a dose, have adequate stocks. How are they getting the supplies? It’s because the central government is favouring the private sector over the state governments when it comes to ensuring supply of vaccines. It also looks like doses meant for the state governments are being diverted to the private sector,” said AAP spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called these allegations “unfounded.”Union health ministry spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.India’s coronavirus vaccination drive follows two tracks: the Union government offers free doses meant for those 45 years of age and above; then there is the acquisition by state governments and private hospitals to give doses for any group they choose to cater to. The Union government has made it mandatory for vaccine makers in India – at present, the two shots being used widely are both made in India – to keep 50% of their doses for the central supply, while the remaining will be evenly split between private procurers and state governments. Out of the 50% quota allotted to each state, the division is made evenly. In other words, from out of the 50% allotted to the state, half will go to the state’s public channel [calculated on pro-rata basis based upon the population of age group of 18-44 years] and the balance will go to the private sector based upon the contracts between private sector and vaccine manufacturers, according to a formula the Centre shared with the Supreme Court affidavit in the second week of May. “This is a big scam... Also, there are so many vaccines now that are approved across several states. Why is the Indian government refraining from giving emergency authorisation to other Covid-19 vaccine varieties?” said Atishi, who is the AAP’s MLA from Kalkaji. Chadha said, “It is all about profits and looting the public in the garb of vaccinations. Now that more government sites are closing down, people are being forced to book slots in the private centres. Going by the rates in private hospitals, a family of five ends up paying at least ₹10,000 to get completely vaccinated. This could be done for free if the government sites were open. This is happening across several states now.” “We ask the central government — how many doses have been allotted to private sectors, why are they not ensuring more vaccine supplies to state governments?,” Chadha added. Atishi said, “The Union government is creating an artificial scarcity to favour the two manufacturers based in India, even after it is evident that these two companies have failed to scale up manufacturing capacity. A lot of lives could have been saved by expanding the vaccination drive at the right time.” Spokespersons from Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India, the two vaccine manufacturers in India, did not respond to requests for comment.The BJP hit back at the AAP’s allegations. “The Centre has not caused any scarcity of vaccines,” said BJP spokesperson Kapoor.“AAP leaders should know that creating scarcity and putting people at discomfort is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s speciality,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-creating-artificial-scarcity-of-vaccines-to-favour-pvt-sector-aap-101622225723955.html

The worker were seen entering the sewer without a body suit, exposing them to infections, health and safety hazards.Vijay Danav, chairman of the Municipal Karamchari Dal, said, “Sadly, manual scavenging is being carried out on the same road where DC Varinder Sharma lives. We condemn the practice and It should be stopped immediately.”Ashwani Sahota, president of Karamchari Dal, demanded that the workers should not be allowed to enter the sewer without wearing a bodysuit. “The sub-divisional officer (SDO) concerned should ensure that safai workers are wearing protective gear before entering the sewage,” he said.SDO of Zone D, Anshul Garcha, said he had asked the workers to clear the silt in the sewage ahead of the monsoons. He added that no employee was told to enter the manhole and he will look into the matter.One of the sanitation workers, pleading anonymity, said, “We are working on contract and on very low wages. If we raise our voice, we will be sacked and there is no one to address our grievances. We want to live our lives with dignity. We do not want to beg and that is the reason why we enter the sewer and risk our lives.”Another safai sewak said that the work is giving them problems in spending time with their families and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manual-scavenging-underway-a-stone-s-throw-from-ludhiana-dc-s-house-101622225605748.html

The initiative is part of the district administration’s vaccination drive aimed at breaking the Covid 19 infection chain.The move comes as the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to launch an aggressive strategy to expand Covid vaccination coverage from June.As part of the strategy, the state health and family welfare department has decided to launch workplace Covid vaccination centres (WCVC), guardian special booths and drive through vaccination facilities.District magistrate Abhishek Prakash, along with health department officials, on Friday carried out an inspection and reviewed the preparations for the mega camps.“We are setting up three mega Covid 19 vaccination centres— Chhota Imambada, KD Singh Babu Stadium and Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium — to cater to the people residing within the city limits,” said Prakash.The district administration is yet to announce the dates when the camps would become operational.Prakash said the administration had also made arrangements for buses that would ferry women, senior citizens and specially abled people free of cost to and from the camps.The mega camps, he said, would have all kinds of amenities, including drinking water facility and seating arrangements.The DM also said that the city vaccination drive would be followed by another vaccination drive of similar nature where mega vaccination centres would be established in the days to come. Prior to this, Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad had suggested the transformation of the Imambadas into Covid-19 hospitals. The senior cleric had said that in Islam nothing was bigger than saving life and hence he felt that the transformation should take place in the national interest.He had also said that Imambadas could easily accommodate around 1,000 beds. His idea, however, failed to find favour with historians, who had said that there were non-heritage structures other than the more than 200-year-old Bada Imambada and other imambadas that could be used for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-centres-to-be-set-up-at-chhota-imambada-two-lucknow-stadiums-101622225484001.html

Since the pandemic broke out in March last year, at least 504 police personnel, including commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma, have already beaten coronavirus.But, three cops lost the battle to the contagion – assistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Anil Kumar Kohli, 52, ASI Jaspal Singh, 49, and ASI Sanjiv Kumar, 57. A homeguard jawan, Gurnam Singh, 55, who was deputed at the Meharban police station, also lost his life due to the pandemic.While the healthcare staff have been fighting to heal the sick, police personnel have been struggling to safeguard citizens against the deadly infection.From implementing the lockdown restrictions by appealing to residents to stay indoors to penalising the violators to deter the spread of infection, police personnel have been giving it their all, while even staying away from family members for their safety.Going the extra mile, they are also providing food to the needy patients in home isolation and even celebrated birthdays of people locked indoors due to the lockdown last year.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said police were working round the clock to ensure Covid norms were being followed, besides maintaining law and order, which had increased their workload and also exposed them to infection time and again.Vaccine hesitancy continuesCovered under the frontline workers category, police personnel have been eligible for vaccination since the drive was rolled out nationwide on January 16.But, the department has yet to achieve 100% vaccination. While 93.5% cops (4,303) of the 4,600-strong police force have received the first dose, only 52% (2,392) have come forward for the second jab.Agrawal said the department was holding special vaccination camps for the force and will achieve 100% coverage soon.

28-05-2021||Mumbai||Row over faulty ventilators: Are you not concerned about lives of Covid patients, HC asks Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday questioned the Central government as to whether it was not concerned about the lives of Covid patients, after the Centre in its affidavit defended the company which supplied faulty ventilators, but said nothing about the remedial measures it was going to take to address the issue of defective and dysfunctional ventilators received by the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad from the Centre.The court observed that the Centre’s affidavit also raised a doubt on the efficiency of the doctors and technicians at GMCH, Aurangabad, by claiming that around 3,000 ventilators provided to other states were functioning properly. The vacation bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Bhalchandra Debadwar was hearing a suo motu criminal public interest litigation (PIL) initiated by the HC after news reports pointed to a shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen, improper facilities and plight of patients who could not afford treatment of Covid and black fungus infection, improper bed management in hospitals, profiteering by ambulance service providers, among others. The bench had also taken note of news reports which stated that 113 of the 150 ventilators received by the GMCH, Aurangabad under the PM Cares Fund had malfunctioned, and hospitals and doctors refused to use them as it posed a threat to the lives of patients being treated for Covid-19. Earlier in the week on May 25 the bench had asked the Centre to respond. On Friday, the Centre submitted its response wherein it stated that the ventilators were purchased by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and categorically denied that they were purchased through the PM Cares Fund. Assistant solicitor general Ajay Talhar for the Centre said that there was no fault in the ventilators manufactured by the Rajkot-based company as there were no complaints about the 3,000 ventilators supplied by the company to other states. Talhar said the 113 ventilators had malfunctioned as the doctors and technicians had not followed instructions while making the ventilators operational. The court expressed shock at the submissions and asked, “Are you holding the brief for the company? Are you not concerned about the lives of the citizens?”“We expected you to say that you will take immediate steps and ask the company to address the issue and ensure that proper installation of the ventilators was done along with imparting training to the hospitals on using them. But you seem to be more interested in defending the company,” the bench added.The exasperated bench further questioned as to whether the Centre and the company had carried out a study to know if GMCH had the proper infrastructure in place to receive and install the ventilators, as it had read a report which stated that the dean of GMCH had refused to take delivery of the ventilators and it was only after the intervention of the collector that the same was accepted. On its part, the state submitted a report of a committee of eight doctors involved in ICU’s and was conversant with the use of ventilators which they had handed over to the dean of GMCH. The report stated that they had tested the ventilators and they found that the machines were not fit to use to treat Covid-19 patients. The report also stated that ventilators manufactured by other companies were being successfully used for more than six months to one year and only the ventilators manufactured by Jyoti CNC, Rajkot were malfunctioning. After the rap from the bench, ASG Talhar submitted that MoHFW would take all remedial steps and ensure that the ventilators operate normally and all defects, if any, would be rectified.The HC then asked Talhar to take instructions and respond to the eight-member committee report. “We would also appreciate if MOHFW refrains from questioning reports of medical experts and instead respects such reports in the larger interest of the society for rectifying the said machines,” said the bench. It has now posted the suo motu PIL for further hearing on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/row-over-faulty-ventilators-are-you-not-concerned-about-lives-of-covid-patients-hc-asks-centre-101622225063877.html

The first phase of the two lines will commence from October this year, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) announced on Friday. Trial runs on both lines will start from Monday, said MMRDA chief RA Rajeev. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will inaugurate the trial run on Monday.Metro-2A connects Dahisar to DN Nagar with 16 stations in between, while Metro-7 will connect Dahisar (East) with Andheri (East) and will have 13 stations. The two lines will provide considerable relief to the people travelling in the western suburbs. “Both the lines will become fully operational in January next year. It will reduce the load of local trains by about 10-12% and will also reduce travel time significantly,” Rajeev said. The metros will run at a speed of 80 kilometres per hour. “We will start the trial run from Monday and this will be completed by October. After that, the first phase will become operational from October onwards,” he added.The total cost for the two metro lines is approximately ₹12,800 crore, of which around ₹6,000 crore have been spent till date. It is estimated that 0.92 million people will be travelling in both these lines once operational.Both the lines were expected to be operational by December last year, but the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown led in delays.

28-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks share in cess, surcharges levied on diesel, petrol||The Maharashtra government has demanded for share in the cess and surcharges levied on petrol and diesel, collected exclusively by the Central government, to help the state governments in their fights against the Covid-19 pandemic. The state, in the 43rd Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting held on Friday, also demanded extension of the protection and compensation period by five more years.State finance minister Ajit Pawar raised various demands related to GST regime, including share in one of the highest tax collections by the Centre. He said states should get share from various cess and surcharges levied on petrol, diesel and petroleum products. The collection of such heads was a whopping ₹3.30 lakh crore in 2020-21. “The revenue earned out of these taxes, duties may be suitably shared with the states at this critical juncture to strengthen our fight against the current pandemic,” he said.He also demanded the five-year period of protection and compensation given to the states against revenue losses be extended by five more years. The Centre had said it would compensate states against their losses due to the new regime for five years, since the rollout of the GST regime in July 2017. “Economic impact of the pandemic cannot be nullified in one or two years, and hence it needs to be extended till 2027,” Pawar said.The cash-strapped state government has also demanded immediate release of ₹24,000 crore pending with the Centre towards GST compensation from the previous financial year. The state also said the compensation set for the current financial year is based on the over-optimistic estimates of revenue generation and needs to be re-examined and corrected. “It will help states in getting more compensation if the estimates are revised taking the losses to the second wave of Covid-19 into consideration,” said an official from the finance department.The state has also demanded easing out taxes on medical items used in the fight against Covid-19 and vaccines. “The tax rate on medical grade oxygen, oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeter, testing kits and material needed for vaccination should be reduced. The quarterly payment and quarterly return system meant for small taxpayers should also by simplified, as they are the driving force of the system,” Maharashtra government stated in the meeting. The government has also demanded to continue 18% taxation on undenatured alcohol under GST and to not put it under Value Added Tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-share-in-cess-surcharges-levied-on-diesel-petrol-101622224823847.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Rise and fall of second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra||Maharashtra has seen a 55.2% drop in the number of active Covid-19 cases over the past one month, with its weekly positivity rate down to 10.46%. A look at the numbers – on March 27, Maharashtra’s active Covid-19 cases were 303,475, which rose to 672,434 on April 27. After 30 days, on May 27, the number of active Covid-19 cases is 301,041. Also, the state’s weekly positivity rate, which was 24.26% in the week from April 28 to May 4, came down to 11.06% between May 19 and 25. A look at how the state did it. GROUND REALITY Public health officers claimed 22 of the 36 districts have witnessed a fall in the weekly positivity rate. According to the Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) report, districts such as Satara, Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri that were reporting high positivity rate have seen a plunge. For instance, the weekly positivity rate in Satara district fell to 21.93% in the week from May 19 to 25, from 34.37% between April 28 and May 4. The analysis of the data indicates a gradual drop in the pandemic curve, especially after the lockdown was imposed in April. However, public health officers claim essential decisions such as ramping up of daily testing, timely detection of mutated strains of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and isolation of close contacts among others, too, helped in the fight against the second wave, which was more infectious than the first one. TEST, DETECT AND ISOLATE When the second wave started in the middle of February, some districts such as Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola were recording the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases. For instance, on February 1, Amravati had 92 Covid-19 patients. By February 5, the figure increased to 233; on February 10, it was 369 and on February 20, the patient count reached 1,058. The positivity rate jumped to around 50%, which also raised the eyebrows of the Centre. The public health department then ramped up the daily testing. On an average, they started to conduct 2,600 tests in Amravati daily and also increased contact-tracing to 45 people per infected patient. Suspecting a mutation of the virus, samples from the three districts were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing. Of the 275 samples sent, the ‘preliminary examination’ showed that four samples from Amravati had a mutation (E484Q). Another four samples from Yavatmal showed a second mutation (N440K). Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor to Covid-19 treatment, said the mutated virus was more infectious and more people from the same family were contracting the infection. “There was a change in the pattern of the virus. It wasn’t as deadly as the first wave, but was spreading faster like the mutated viruses found in Europe. So, after the confirmation of the mutation, we designed a containment plan,” he added. Lockdown-like restrictions were imposed in Amravati from February 22, which helped bring down the positivity rate from 48% to 9%. “We were the first ones to declare localised restrictions, which helped break the chain. Before the lockdown, there were around 800-900 cases, which dropped to 300,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, district health officer (DHO). Soon, districts like Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur and Palghar started reporting the highest number of cases. The positivity rate in Mumbai rose to over 22% in April, which is now down to 4.7%. Similarly, Nagpur recorded a positivity rate of 31.28% in the third week of April. The public health department ordered ramping up of daily testing, and boosted RT-PCR testing. Government laboratories were run in three shifts around-the-clock. The state also deployed three mobile labs at Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad. Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer, said, “In the first wave, we never crossed one lakh tests in a day, but in the second wave, we ramped it up to around three lakh. This helped in early detection and increased contact tracing. At present, the testing has been reduced as the number of high-risk contacts and close contacts is low, with the decline in positivity rate.” VACCINATION A PROTECTIVE SHIELD Maharashtra started the mass immunisation programme from January 16. Since then, 21,352,332 vaccinations have been recorded; 4,431,707 beneficiaries have even got their second dose. “Healthcare and frontline workers who work in close proximity with infected patients got vaccinated, which helped control the infection rate. In the third phase, people above 60 years, considered the most vulnerable group, got inoculated. This helped control the spread among the elderly,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the state Covid-19 task force. The state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) now plan to ramp up vaccination even for the population below 45 years. “If we are heading towards a third wave, we want to vaccinate as many people as possible. Due to unavailability of vials, we put restrictions on immunization programmes for younger population. But as we have seen in the second wave, young adults and children are more vulnerable. We will try to prioritise immunising them as soon as we get more vials,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. However, the success doesn’t mean the guard should be down, say doctors. “Until we are able to vaccinate all people, the pandemic isn’t over. Until we get the vials, social vaccination is the only shield we have to save ourselves from contracting the infection. People need to follow safety rules such as maintaining social distance, wearing masks and avoiding crowded places. They have to decide if they want a third wave or not,” said Dr Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-and-fall-of-second-covid-19-wave-in-maharashtra-101622224583770.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Class 10 evaluation criteria announced; optional CET for junior college admissions||After declaring cancellations of state board examinations for Class 10, the state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday announced the evaluation formula for promoting the students and making them eligible to get admissions in the junior colleges. Each student will be promoted based on their performance in Class 9 and 10 through internal assessment. It also will conduct a common entrance test (CET) for admissions in junior college, which would be optional. Those who clear it will get priority in admissions in junior colleges. The rest of the seats will be used for the students who were cleared by the state board in the evaluation process. The decision was taken in a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Gaikwad and state officials on Thursday.The Class 10 board exams scheduled in March were cancelled owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. The state still has close to 300,000 active cases. Around 10 to 15 districts are also facing rapid growth in cases.The state government decided not to change its decision of cancelling Class 10 board examinations despite the Bombay high court objecting to it, saying that the government was making a mockery of the education system.“All students eligible to appear for Class 10 board examinations will be promoted. Their marks will be determined based on an internal assessment of their performance in Class 9 and 10 both. Of the total 100 marks, 50% marks will be based on performance in final year examinations of Class 9 and the rest of the marks have been divided into two categories: 30 marks will be given based on the performance in written examinations for the entire year in Class 10 and the rest 20 marks will be given based on their performance in the oral examination, practicals and homework,” Gaikwad said.There are around 1.6 million SSC students across the state.“The state will also conduct CET for junior college admissions, which will be completely optional but it has its advantage. Those who clear the CET will get priority in junior college admissions. The rest of the seats will be used for the students who were cleared by the state board based on the evaluation process,” Gaikwad told reporters.The CET will be a two-hour long examination that will be based on the Class 10 syllabus. It will also be optical mark recognition (OMR) based on having multiple choices and the students will have to select the correct answer, she said.Students from other boards will also be allowed to appear for CET, she added.This evaluation process will be applicable for repeaters as well but there is a slight difference in their evaluation formula. Of the total 100 marks, 80% marks will be based on their performance in the Class passed by them and the rest 20 marks will be given based on their performance in the oral examination, practicals and homework in Class 10, according to a government resolution issued by the school education department on May 28.Gaikwad also said they will conduct examinations for all Class 10 students who are not satisfied with the evaluation process but the examination will be conducted only after the Covid situation comes to normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-evaluation-criteria-announced-optional-cet-for-junior-college-admissions-101622224523854.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parel society vaccinates residents, domestic workers, security staff||For the past two days, the management committee of the four-wing housing complex in Parel is busy organising vaccination camps in its premises, for residents, staff members, domestic workers, security staff, cleaners, drivers and all vendors visiting frequently.The BMC had on May 7 officially allowed housing societies and complexes to tie up with private hospitals in the city and organise vaccination camps. It had also made mandatory for societies to have doctor and medical staff along with an ambulance present in the premises while conducting the vaccination drive.The housing complex Ashoka Towers, comprising 650 families, has decided to not only vaccinate its residents but also contribute, to get their staff and family members vaccinated.According to society members, they had registered around 1,500 citizens for vaccination. But they only received 1,000 doses for the vaccination drive.Sarika Poddar, a resident of Ashoka Towers said, “We are vaccinating around 296 residents and around 104 extended family members of these residents, followed by 463 staff members, 104 who are family members of the staff and around 11 vendors who regularly visit our society.”Poddar added, “We are doing it to spread the message that it is our responsibility to help as many as citizens get vaccinated. Our domestic workers, cleaners and drivers need assistance, and we should help them in every way possible to get vaccinated. In our case, every member is self-financing staff members working in their house.”Sanjay Rathod, another resident, said, “We will also ensure that those who are being given their first dose in our society premises, will also get their second dose. If another drive after 84 days is not possible in our complex premises, we will ensure our staff members get their second dose from outside.”The society was also in the news last year for announcing to set up a quarantine facility inside its premises to become self-reliant.The BMC additionally is also planning to have mobile vaccination centres in the coming days after procuring vaccine doses in bulk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-parel-society-vaccinates-residents-domestic-workers-security-staff-101622224103770.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Give Mumbai access to vax, BMC urges its six sister cities across the world||To meet the demand of procuring 18 million vaccine doses for the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has written letters to the mayors of six sister cities of Mumbai seeking their help in procuring Covid-19 vaccine doses, to avoid the severity of the third Covid-19 wave. These six cities include New York and Los Angeles in the USA, Stuttgart in Germany, St Petersburg in Russia, Yokohama in Japan and Busan in South Korea.The Sister-City International (SCI) concept is a non-profit citizen diplomacy network that creates partnerships between communities through the establishment of ‘sister cities’. The objective of signing the sister-city agreement is to advance exchange between the two cities with whom the agreement is signed.According to BMC officials, these letters were written under the sister cities agreement with the above-mentioned cities. All six letters have been addressed to the mayors of the cities mentioned above.In one such letter written by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, he states, “As a sister city of Mumbai, I want to congratulate you for effective measures taken by the city of Yokohama, to combat Covid pandemic and your success in achieving good results.”The letter further reads, “Being a sister city of Mumbai, may I humbly request your good self to help and provide access to vaccine for Mumbai city. We are ready to pay the necessary charges well in advance. Please let us know the availability of the vaccine along with its cost and bank details for depositing requisite amount of money, Mumbai as a sister city will surely acknowledge your favour for the same.”The letter with similar text was written by Chahal to the remaining five sister cities including New York, Los Angeles, Busan, St Petersburg and Stuttgart.In the letter, Chahal has noted that Mumbai city’s population is 16 million and its eligible population above 18 years of age is nine million. Thus, Mumbai needs approximately 18 million doses to vaccinate its eligible population.The letter also mentions that vaccination in the city started on January 16, 2021, and since then over three million people have been vaccinated. The letter notes that a third wave is expected to hit the city between July and August, and to avoid the severity of Covid-19, vaccination is very important.Additionally, the BMC has also floated a global expression of interest (EoI) to procure 10 million vaccine doses. The EoI was floated on May 12, post which, two extensions were given until May 25. The last date for submission of proposals now is June 1.The BMC, as of May 25, had received eight proposals of which seven were for supplying the Russian vaccine Sputnik and one was for supplying Pfizer and AstraZeneca. However, after this announcement on May 25, Pfizer issued a statement saying it has not issued authorisation to anyone for marketing or distribution of its Covid vaccine.Further, in the backdrop of this, the Czech Republic-based firm withdrew its proposal on May 27 without giving any reason, civic officials said. On further scrutiny, BMC officials said they will wait till June 1 for now. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, told HT on Thursday, “We will process the papers first. We have time till June 1. We will decide the future course of action later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/give-mumbai-access-to-vax-bmc-urges-its-six-sister-cities-across-the-world-101622224043797.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls support for kids who lost kin to Covid-19||The Maharashtra government is likely to support the children who have lost their parents to the Covid-19 pandemic. The women and child development department has proposed to deposit a sum of ₹500,000 into the children’s account who have lost both their parents to Covid-19. It has also proposed to broaden the scope of the existing scheme for children called ‘Bal Sangopan Yojana’ and provide ₹2,500 a month to the children who have lost one parent and that too earning one. State women and child development Yashomati Thakur said on Friday.Started in 2008, the scheme — ‘Bal Sangopan Yojana’ — helps students with financial assistance to continue their education in case of a single parent; family in distress, death of parents, students with divorced parents and in case parents are hospitalized etc. Children eligible under the schemes get monetary assistance of ₹1,125 a month.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the state women and child development department to formulate a detailed policy for the upbringing of these kids so that a decision can be taken, the officials said.The directives were issued in a meeting chaired by the chief minister to review the progress of women and child development.“CM had called an important meeting with women and child development, and we had a detailed discussion mostly about the orphans who are losing their parents due to Covid. The second wave has affected a lot of families and the state government is looking to assist them through monetary means by introducing a scheme. We have proposed to deposit ₹500,000 in the account of a child who has lost both of his parents. In case of children losing one parent and the other one is a non-earning member of the family then to register them under Bal Sangopan Yojana,” Thakur said.“We have also proposed to broaden the scope of the scheme and increase the monthly grant to be provided to these children to ₹2,500 from the current ₹1,125. We have further discussed if these children can be given free education. All these proposals will be placed before the cabinet for approval,” she added.“The department should prepare a policy for upbringing and education of children who have either lost their single parent or both the parents due to Covid-19. The additional expenses apart from annual expenditure on the existing schemes should be presented so that a decision of its effective implementation can be taken,” said the chief minister in the meeting attended by the women and child development minister and senior officials.Over 93,000 people have died in Maharashtra after being infected with Covid-19.After the Supreme Court (SC) directives taking cognisance of the reports in the social media that children orphaned after losing their parents due to the virus were being illegally adopted, the women and child welfare department had formed task forces in every (36) district to identify such children at the beginning of this month. Headed by collectors, the task forces have found at least 195 such children in the state have lost their parents, of them, 108 have been orphaned after losing both their parents. 42 children have been brought to the childcare institutes (CCIs) run by the state government.It aims to ensure that the orphaned children are in safe custody and are given their financial and property rights. The step also assures that the children are safeguarded from illegal custody and trafficking.The school education department also has submitted a proposal to the chief minister for bearing education expenses of orphans, who have lost both their parents, till Class 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-support-for-kids-who-lost-kin-to-covid19-101622223983732.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra may get 6 million vaccine doses in June||The state government is expected to get over six million doses of Covaxin and Covishield in June, according to the communication from the Centre. Out of it, the state government will have to procure 2,070,530 doses of both the vaccines by paying for them, for the vaccination of the age group of 18-44 years.After vaccinating over 9.2 million citizens above 45 years and healthcare, frontline workers with the vaccines supplied by the Centre in April, the vaccination rate of the state dropped to merely 5.4 million in May till Friday evening. The drop in the inoculation is because of the short supply of the vaccines by Centre and two domestic manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin. The pace of the vaccination is expected to increase a bit as the state has been assured of a supply of over six million doses of two vaccines in June.“According to the latest communication by the Centre, we are expecting more than six million doses in June. Of it, 1,496,500 doses of Covishield and 451,050 of Covaxin will be given from June 1 to 15 under the free quota, supplied by the Centre for the above 45 age group. The Centre has also allocated us 1,595,900 doses of Covishield and 4,74,630 doses of Covaxin, which are to be purchased by the State for 18-44 years during the entire month of June. We expect about two million doses to be supplied by the Centre from its free quota to state in the second half of the month,” said an official from the health department.The inoculation drive for the age group of 18-44 years has been suspended by the state for the last two weeks amid the shortage of vaccines. There is no decision on its resumption anytime soon. The state government had planned to vaccinate 20 million people above 18 years per month to complete the vaccination of 60 million people in three months. However, the shortage of the vaccine has slowed down the drive.Making it worse, the global bids floated by the state government did not see any response directly from the manufacturers from other countries. It received a response from eight intermediaries, whose credentials are being verified by the government.The state is planning to write to the Centre seeking the clarity and guidelines for engaging the bidders. “We are asking the Centre to clarify if the firm that has participated in the bidding are authorised by the manufacturers. We want the legal standing to be clarified by the Centre if we engage them for the supply. We are also seeking Centre’s opinion on the prices they have quoted and also the import-related permissions required from it for procurement,” said an official.Though the state has received bids from the firms claiming to have tie-ups with the manufacturers for the vaccines which have been approved by World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration. However, some of the manufacturers have denied having appointed any facilitator to deal with the state governments. Few of them also have said that they will deal only with the Centre.Meanwhile, 265,725 people were inoculated in Maharashtra on Friday taking the tally of administered doses to 21,920,198 to 17,433,173 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-get-6-million-vaccine-doses-in-june-101622223923763.html
28-05-2021||Kolkata||Centre stuns Mamata Banerjee, transfers top Bengal official to Delhi after row||The central government on Friday transferred West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay to the Centre’s department of personnel and training, ordering the top civil servant to report in New Delhi on May 31. The decision by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was conveyed to Bengal hours after a row broke out over Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee skipping a meeting convened by the prime minister during his visit to the state.“I am directed to inform that the appointments committee of the Cabinet has approved the placement of the services of Sri Alapan Bandopadhyay, IAS, (WB:1987) with the Government of India as provisions of Rule 6(1) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, with immediate effect,” the letter signed by an official at the Centre’s ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions said.Also Read: ‘Took his permission’: Mamata on skipping PM's review meet“Accordingly, the state government is requested to relieve the officer with immediate effect and direct him to report to the department of personnel and training, North Block, New Delhi, by 10 am on May 31, 2021.”Bandopadhyay was touring the cyclone-affected areas with chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday evening when the government received the order from the Centre. Bandopadhyay was also present at the chief minister’s brief interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kalaikunda on Friday afternoon when the prime minister came to Bengal to review the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas. Mamata Banerjee did not attend the review meeting chaired by PM Modi, saying she had other appointments triggering a fresh political row.Bandopadhyay was due to retire on May 31. But Mamata Banerjee had announced this week that the central government had cleared her request to let the officer continue for three more months since he had the experience of working during last year's Amphan and had handled the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Trinamool Congress (TMC) spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “This is a vindictive action by the BJP which cannot get over its humiliating loss in the recent polls. This will go down in the history of dirty politics. A bureaucrat is being recalled before his retirement when he is touring cyclone-hit areas. This proves how anti-Bengal and anti-Bengali BJP’s central leaders are.”TMC Rajya Sabha member, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, said, "Has this ever happened since Independence? Forced central deputation of a chief secretary of a State. How much lower will Modi-Shah’s BJP stoop. All because people of Bengal humiliated the duo and chose Mamata Banerjee with an overwhelming mandate."Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “IAS officers are employed by the Indian Government. These are administrative decisions. This is not a political issue to comment on.”Alapan Bandopadhyay's transfer to New Delhi is unusual, especially because the 1987 IAS officer, according to his record on the DoPT website, has never served in the central government and would not have been empanelled to serve at senior positions in the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-stuns-mamata-banerjee-transfers-top-bengal-official-to-delhi-after-row-101622223536326.html

We are prepared for three-hour exam and those under isolation due to Covid-19 will be given another chance.”Pal spoke on “control of social media apps” through new IT Rules and said that there should be a command on these platforms as “absolute freedom of expression is not good for the society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-to-distribute-8-6-lakh-free-tablets-for-online-education-101622219663923.html

Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said, “One of the patients from Jhajjar had hypertension and the other was overweight. We are trying to ascertain the cause of these deaths.” Dr Jagdish Dureja, director of KCGMCH, said 11 Covid patients who tested positive for black fungus have died in the hospital so far.Bahadurgarh private hospital authorities refused to share information about how many vials were required per day to the patients and how many they received.‘BLACK FUNGUS BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN COVID’PGIMS, Rohtak and Maharaja Agrasen Medical College, Agroha (MAMC) have witnessed a sharp rise in black fungus cases and decrease in Covid patients. PGIMS has total 153 Covid patients and 123 black fungus patients undergoing treatment, while MAMC has 104 Covid patients and 84 black fungus patients.Dr Geetika Duggal, director of MAMC, said black fungus patients are increasing gradually. They have been waiting for liposomal amphotericin-B injection.“We have not received a single dose of liposomal amphotericin-B injection today and the treatment is being affected. Doctors have performed surgeries today. Due to dedicated efforts of medical staff and availability of oxygen cylinders and medicines, we managed to save lives of Covid patients but black fungus is a bigger challenge now,” she said. “A black fungus patient, with an average weight of 70kg, needs 6-7 vials of amphotericin-B per day. I have sent the prescription before the expert committee and am hoping that we will get the vials by late evening so that our work won’t suffer,” she added.PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya said Covid patients are decreasing while black fungus cases are soaring.“Patients from across state are coming in and we cannot refuse them treatment. We performed successful surgeries of five black fungus patients today. Still, there is a shortage of drugs and patients are receiving less vials than prescribed,” she added.One of the state expert committee members, Dr RS Chauhan, head of ophthalmology at PGIMS, said there is shortage of drugs across country and Agroha Medical College will get its share of vials by Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-more-deaths-of-black-fungus-in-haryana-101622219544201.html

28-05-2021||Pune||Shridhar Dixit appointed chairman of Marathi encyclopedia committee||Shridhar (Raja) Dixit took charge as the seventh chairman of the Maharashtra Rajya Marathi Vishwakhosh (Encyclopedia) committee which many believe is a positive step to gain momentum and move forward.Dixit brings in a dearth of experience and is currently serving as an emeritus professor of the department of History, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). “I have been associated with the Vishwakosh for some years now and 20 volumes are completed so far as per the plan when it was launched by the former chief minister Yashwantrao Chavan. The work began under stalwart Tarktirth Lakshmanshastri Joshi followed by MP Rege and RG Jadhav for whom I have great respect, now it presents me with a great responsibility to develop and nurture the Vishwakosh,” said Dixit. “This work on the Vishwakosh might have reached its volumes but there is no full stop, it is a continuous process, for we are presently living in a world of knowledge explosion, globalisation and communication explosion,” added Dixit. According to Dixit, in the present-day context, there are many socially deprived groups and hence it is necessary to have democratization of knowledge, and encyclopedia or Vishwakosh is one of the means. “This acceleration of the process is socially relevant and strong academic work which needs to be highlighted,” he added. He also stressed upon the importance of language and the unity in diversity of the many languages spoken in the country, which leads to enhancement of any language, by strengthening the power of language and adding to the vocabulary and terminology using English language and coining new terms in Marathi. Dixit believes in using technology for making the encyclopedia easily accessible and that is a major challenge that he has accepted as the chairman. Hemant Rajopadhye, member of the Marathi Vishwakosh committee said, “His academic background when he revived editor, Navbharat (intellectual journal), PrajnaPathashala, and his skills, experience and networking will certainly help the project and take it further.” Besides Dixit as the chairman for the Vishwakosh, he has 31 members to help him in his project. Sadanand More, was also appointed as the chairman of the state board of literature and culture which will help in the proposal to restructure the Maharashtra state board of literature and culture and also help in clearing the backlog of new works which was stuck due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shridhar-dixit-appointed-chairman-of-marathi-encyclopedia-committee-101622218883212.html
28-05-2021||Pune||State water resource department agrees to lease canal land to PMC||The Maharashtra water resource department has given a green signal to lease the land of the Khadakwasla left canal to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to ease the traffic problem of the proposed village of Kondhawe-Dhawade, Shivane, Uttamnagar. At present, the PMC is using 20 kilometres of canal land and paying rent to the Khadakwasla irrigation division. Now, the PMC will get another 7 kilometres of canal land for developing roads to connect nearby villages. On Wednesday, Maharashtra state water resource Minister Jayant Patil gave instructions to the Khadakwasla irrigation division to hand over land to the PMC on rent. After that, the PMC land and estate management department has written a letter to the Khadakwasla division to make an agreement of rent and start a procedure to hand over the land to PMC. Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner of land and estate management said, “We have written a letter to the Khadakwasla irrigation division as per the demand of Member of Parliament (MP) Supriya Sule to hand over the land for roads. After getting the official order of decision, we will start the procedure of agreement.” The left-bank canal passes through Kondwe-Dhavade, Shivane NDA gate road, Paud, Karve road, Kothrud, Shivajinagar and goes up to Agricultural College. It is a 27 kilometre long canal. However, this canal is not functioning at all and there is no water in this canal. Area under this canal has been developed as a road and it is found that this road provided access in the adjoining lands. Of the total 27 kilometres of road, the PMC is paying rent of 20 kilometres of road (canal) to the irrigation division. The canal road under the existing PMC limit has been developed and used to connect main roads such as Paud road, Karve road. Road will help proposed merger Now, the state government has proposed to merge 23 new villages in the PMC limit and Kondwe-Dhavade, Shivane are one of the villages. The left canal is passing through these villages. Therefore, Sule was pursuing the issue of the canal land to be handed over to the PMC to develop roads which will help develop alternate roads to connect these villages as population has increased and existing roads are not enough to cater traffic flow in this area. Sachin Dodke, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator said, “At present, there is only one road to connect PMC old limits to Kondwe-dhawade, Shivane area. It is part of the old PMC limit and PMC is giving rent to Khadakwasla irrigation division for using the canal road for movement. The population has increased in Kondwe-Dhawade, Shivane and Uttamnagar area. Therefore, there is a lot of pressure on existing roads which are under the jurisdiction of the old PMC limit. Now, the PMC limit will extend after the merger of villages, so we demanded to give the canal road which is not part of the PMC limit. The PMC has allocated ₹3 crore to develop the road. I explained the importance of the roads to MP Supriya Sule. After that, she pursued the issue and we got permission from water resource minister Jayant Patil.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-water-resource-department-agrees-to-lease-canal-land-to-pmc-101622218583168.html

Earlier, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) had started this service within the state to generate revenue during the last year’s lockdown and it is continuing. Currently, due to the state-wide lockdown, very few PMPML buses are running and that too only for the emergency services people. The daily income which had reached up to almost ₹1 crore has now come down to hardly ₹1 lakh. “We are having a huge loss of revenue from last 1.5 years and it has impacted our daily operations. So last year in the month of August we started to work out on a plan to convert some of our buses into courier service buses which we are starting soon now. We are going to collaborate with a private courier company for the same and the entire necessary infrastructure is going to be provided by the company and we will be handling driver’s salary, maintenance of buses and fuel expenses. At 13 of our depots the storage of goods will be done and at some of the bus stations too. From here the company workers will pick up the parcels and deliver it to the final destination,” said PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD) Rajendra Jagtap. Prior to the lockdown the daily average income of PMPML was around ₹1.5 crore which has drastically come down to ₹1 to 1.5 to lakh per day. The earlier ridership was around 11 lakh passengers daily with a fleet of more than 2,000 buses on road. Currently, only around 100 buses are running for essential services people in both the cities. “We have already converted some of our buses into this courier service bus for trials, in which the seats are being removed and at the back side shutter are installed. And we are also looking at the legal technicalities before starting this cargo service. These buses are being passed by the RTO as passenger service buses and now we will be doing courier service out of it. So, what legal things need to be fulfilled for it and what all changes are required which our officials are working on. We are never into luggage carrying or courier service till now and it will be the first time PMPML will be starting such service in the city. If all things go well, we will start the service for the city soon.” added Jagtap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-start-courier-services-in-pune-101622218523232.html

The state government is working with commitment to make Jharkhand healthy, prosperous and advanced. The pace of vaccination is being increased with availability of vaccines,” Gupta said. The drive was piloted in Ranchi, and all deputy commissioners (DC) in the state have been asked to begin the service for all kinds of beneficiaries. However, people who are differently abled, and above the age of 45 years will be given priority. Initially, the service will be available for urban residents, and will gradually be extended to rural areas. MobiVax will be available on demand, but with a condition of at least 20 beneficiaries at a time, officials said. Currently, two vans have been provided for Ranchi. Officer on special duty (health) for IEC (information, education and communication), Siddhartha Tripathy said, “Idea behind the service is to provide vaccination facility at doorstep for people who cannot come to vaccination centres, such as differently abled and elderly people. However, the service will be available for all.” The Government of India recently allowed mobile vaccination service for those in the age group of 18-45, while it already permitted the service for those above 45 years of age. “The service will be an additional facility apart from the static centres in the state,” Tripathy said. However, people above 45 years of age will be a priority, as the state was facing acute shortage of vaccines for the younger age group. As per data available with the health department, the state has merely 80,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for the 18-45 group, which will last for two-three days, officials said. Tripathy said, “We have adequate vaccines for 45-plus people, around 7.14 lakh doses. We also have to speed up vaccination for this group, as state’s vaccination average is 28% against the national average of 34%.” As per the state vaccination bulletin, around 4.63 lakh people above 18 years of age have been vaccinated with the first dose. Besides, 23.66 lakh people above 45 have been given the first jab, while 3.57 lakh have been administrated the second dose till Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/doorstep-vaccine-service-mobivax-rolled-out-in-ranchi-101622217443107.html

The heavy rain caused by cyclone Yaas in the catchment areas of the river, originating from Nepal, led to excess flow of water and subsequently damaged a portion of embankment which was recently strengthened near the village. Rajesh Kumar, engineer-in-chief (flood control) at the WRD, said, “Gunny bags fortified by wires and iron ropes are being placed at the damaged site and cracks are being filled up.” “All embankments are safe and anti-erosion work is going on in full swing. It will be complete in the next few weeks,” said the engineer in-chief. A senior official of WRD said special attention was being paid to strengthen the embankments of all troublesome rivers like Gandak, Kosi, Mahananda, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Lak Bakeya, etc, which wreak havoc with life and property of people in north Bihar. “Embankments on Gandak, which was breached at three places last year, have been fortified and heightened as per the required design to stop flooding,” he said. He said the WRD engineers got cooperation from their counterparts in Nepal to strengthen the embankments in bordering areas on different rivers. “Following correspondences and talks with officials of the neighbouring country, we did not face any issue to carry out the strengthening work this year. Last year, the work suffered after Nepal objected to fortification of embankments near the border,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kosi-threatens-embankment-in-saharsa-restoration-on-101622217323085.html

The court had earlier stayed the recruitment till further orders and the matter came for early hearing on Friday after a special mention by advocate genera (AG) Lalit Kishore on the request of education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary that the government would guarantee adherence to the reservation roster in letter and spirit. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar heard both the AG as well as the counsel for the petitioners, the National Federation of the Blind (Bihar branch).The AG said the panel for recruitment was ready and the court nod was awaited to publish it. “The government is ready to earmark 4% quota for the physically challenged, including the visually impaired. The government will also accept the second option of keeping 4% seats vacant till the final disposal of the case and it be allowed to carry on with the remaining 96% recruitment, if the court permits,” he said.However, the counsel for the petitioners countered it, saying many applicants had not been able to apply and so they be given fresh opportunity to apply. Besides, the counsel wanted details of the number of vacancies, steps taken to fill up the backlog and reason for non-implementation of reservation provisions for them.The petitioners have also been contending, citing an apex court order, that the state has not taken any action for identifying the vacancies from the year 1996 onwards or towards filling up the backlog thereof, as is mandated by provisions of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 as also the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.In 2019, the HC had sought personal affidavit from the chief secretary, indicating the extent of the vacancies, the backlog thereof, as a result of inaction on the part of the authorities, as also the steps taken for filling up the same and, more so, specific in terms of 1995 Act as also the 2016 Act and the reasons for inaction on the part of the state.Bihar has to appoint around 1.25 lakh primary and secondary school teachers, but the court stay has come in the way. The education minister had earlier said that the government was ready to go ahead with the new recruitment process for teachers fully enforcing the reservation roster formula if the court so allowed.With the tenure of the Panchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) ending mid-June and some interim measures likely to be put in place till fresh elections are held, the legal wrangle could further delay the recruitment process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-recruitment-no-headway-on-govt-plea-to-lift-stay-next-hearing-on-may-31-101622217263632.html

The matter came to light on Friday after alleged photos of their injuries surfaced. Patna senior SP Upendra Kumar Sharma said he was looking into the allegations and would seek a report from the officer concerned. In Purnia, an assistant sub-inspector was recently suspended by SP Dayashankar after a video went viral purportedly showing him thrashing a vehicle driver. To be sure, police too had been at the receiving end of people’s anger while enforcing the lockdown.

28-05-2021||Other||Covid deaths: IMA finds political support for aid to private docs||PATNADoctors working with political parties as office bearers have backed the demand of the Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to extend the insurance cover of ₹50 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to private doctors dying of Covid-19. Dr Sunil Kumar Singh, an ophthalmologist and state president of the ruling Janata Dal (United)’s medical cell, and gastroenterologist Dr Manoj Kumar, state convener of Bihar BJP medical cell, have written separately to their respective leaders, chief minister Nitish Kumar and health minister Mangal Pandey, in support of the demand. Dr Singh, in his letter to the chief minister, said the notification on compensation under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana was not averse to paying compensation to the families of doctors who worked in their clinics and helped in screening or treatment of Covid patients as per directions of the government. He urged the CM direct the health department to treat all Covid martyrs, including those from the private sector, “as drafted for work” by the government and to recommend compensation for their families under the insurance scheme. As per the Centre’s letter of April 26, a copy of which is with the Hindustan Times, the insurance scheme launched on March 30, 2020, was to provide comprehensive personal accident cover of ₹50 lakh to 22.12 lakh healthcare providers, including community health workers and private health workers drafted by the government for Covid-19 related responsibilities, “who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this”. The insurance policy has been revived for 180 days, effective April 24, and will now extend up to October 20. The IMA hopes to garner more political support. “We will tap doctors, who are MPs or former MPs, present and past legislators across the political spectrum to push our demand for compensation to private doctors,” said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president, IMA-Bihar, currently officiating as its president. Till Thursday, Bihar had lost 144 doctors to the pandemic. As many as 104 doctors from Bihar are among over 520 medical practitioners in India who have succumbed to the virus during the second wave of the pandemic. Forty doctors from Bihar died last year, Dr Kumar said. Delhi (103), Bihar (96) and Uttar Pradesh (41) were among states with high Covid-related fatalities among doctors, as per figures released by the IMA on May 25. “Of the deceased, 101 doctors are from the private sector, which includes those who resigned or superannuated from government service, while the remaining 43 were in active government service,” said Dr Kumar. Meanwhile, the IMA-Bihar also sought the CM’s intervention to lift curbs on supply of medical oxygen among non-Covid hospitals. It regretted that oxygen supply was restricted only among 90-odd private health facilities, allowed by the government to treat Covid-19 patients in Patna. It also requested the CM to allow more health facilities, having the requisite infrastructure, to treat Covid-19 patients. This, it said, would ease the burden on existing facilities and help patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-deaths-ima-finds-political-support-for-aid-to-private-docs-101622217203017.html
28-05-2021||Other||Two Covid patients end life in 24 hours||BETTIAH/PATNASuicide by two Covid patients in the state in last 24 hours, one at Raxaul and other at AIIMS-Patna, has brought the spotlight on the impact of virus on the mental health of patients. So far, five Covid patients have committed suicide, four of them at AIIMS-Patna, over the last one year. On Thursday, a Covid patient jumped off the third floor of a hospital at Raxaul in West Champaran district. According to officials, the incident occurred at Dunkan hospital at Raxaul around 8 pm on Thursday.The deceased was identified as Ram Sharan Sah (36). “He had been insisting for discharge from the hospital for the past few days. He took the extreme step immediately after his family members, who had come to deliver meal for him, returned home,” said Chandeshwar Singh, administrator, Dunkan hospital, Raxaul.The deceased had been under treatment at Dunkan hospital since May 20. “Autopsy on the body could not be done since he was a Covid patient,” said Sagar Jha, Raxaul’s subdivisional police officer. On Wednesday, a 57-year-old man under treatment for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna jumped off the fifth floor bathroom of the hospital. He was admitted to the hospital on May 18. This is fourth case of suicide by a patient at AIIMS-Patna since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. In October 2020, a 68-year-old Covid-19 patient had committed suicide at the hospital. Earlier, a 38-year-old locomotive driver of the Indian Railways, posted in Delhi, and hailing from Khagaul in Patna, died on June 22. A month later, a 21-year-old youth from Bihta jumped to death on July 25 from the ward on the third floor of the institute where he was undergoing treatment.Psychiatrists attribute aloofness and hopelessness among patients as major reason behind taking extreme steps. “The fear of death is quite common among the Covid patients. In some cases, the amount of time spent in an episode of depression, aloofness and hopelessness become so high that they could well be forced to end their life,” said Dr Subhash Soren, director of Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry & Allied Sciences (RINPAS), Ranchi. “Proper counselling by the experts is the most effective way to handle such patients,” said Dr Doren.Advendra Prasad, a medicine shop owner who spent 25 days at a private hospital after being infected with Covid-19, recalled his ordeal. “All sorts of negative feelings affected me. This was compounded by the fact that as a patient I was on bed surrounded not only by Covid patients but among the bodies as they were not removed for hours. You are cut off from your family, near and dear ones and doctors are impolite at times,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-covid-patients-end-life-in-24-hours-101622217143052.html

The IMA state secretary said Ramdev can pick the time; the IMA will decide the venue.This discussion will end the deadlock and the confusion created by the yoga guru in recent weeks, he said, a reference to a widely-circulated video in which Ramdev is accused of spreading misinformation about allopathic treatment, calling allopathic medicine a “stupid science” and questioning the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccine. The IMA, which has alleged that the yoga guru was trying to promote Patanjali products, has filed police complaints against Ramdev, written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek action against him and sent a ₹1,000 crore defamation notice over the last few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ramdev-fired-25-questions-at-ima-on-allopathy-he-gets-a-response-101622213191027.html

One plant has started operations while another is scheduled to begin generating oxygen from June 1, said officials on Thursday. Located 60 kilometres to the south of Gurugram, Nuh has reported 4,811 positive cases, with 132 patients in home isolation and 143 undergoing treatment in hospitals currently . Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata said that oxygen plants of 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) and 500 LPM capacities are being set up in Nalhar Medical College and Mandikheda Hospital in collaboration with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). While another oxygen plant has already been started by in Mandikheda, two others will be set up in community health centres (CHCs) in Tauru and Nuh. Two more plants will be set up in Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College in Nalhar with the help of Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT) Kanpur, using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds under Mission Bharat O2 which aims to develop indigenous solutions for solving India’s oxygen crisis amid the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. A senior official said that setting up a medical oxygen plant designed for a flow rate of 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) costs nearly ₹2 crore and a 500 LPM cost ₹1 crore. “The two plants coming up in CHCs in Tauru and Nuh, which will be readied through CSR, will have capacities of 500 LPM,” said Khadgata, adding that preparations to deal with the challenges ahead are underway so that they can reduce the dependence on oxygen from outside in the future. Khadgata said the seven plants, once operational, will cater to over 1,100 patients requiring oxygen beds. “We are now well prepared for a probable third wave. With these upcoming oxygen plants, we will be able to generate 3,650 LPM of oxygen in the district and will not be dependent on other sources,” he said.While the oxygen plants will be able to fill over than 500 cylinders per day, officials said these will be set up within the hospital premises to reduce the dependence on oxygen cylinders, as the plants will supply oxygen directly through pipeline to the beds. It will also help in reducing the time and cost involved in arranging the logistics of bringing oxygen from Palwal and Faridabad, said officials.Khadgata said the demand for medical oxygen went up by five times due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “Installation of the in-house infrastructure by Covid facilities will go a long way in reducing the dependence on outside sources for medical oxygen, if a similar situation arises the in future,” he said. The central oxygen gas pipelines in Nalhar and Mandikhera are being laid by NHAI and the work is likely to get over by the end of this month, said officials. Khadgata said currently they have 279 oxygen beds in the district which will be increased to 1,300 by July end.”We have 196 oxygen beds in Nalhar medical college which will be increased to 450 with 80 ICU beds. Similarly, we have 35 oxygen beds in Mandekhera which will be increased to 100 with six ICUs. 100 oxygen beds will be ready in CHC Nuh and CHCTauru with 10 ICU beds,” he said. With 250 oxygen concentrators, portable beds are also available in the district, said officials. Presently 60% of patients admitted in Nuh are from Palwal and Alwar in Rajasthan due to lack of facilities in their areas. “Currently, Nuh’s positivity rate is 1.6%. In the past week, the cumulative rate was 1.74% , the lowest in the 22 districts of Haryana,” said Khadgata, adding that the district’s recovery rate (95.07%) and contact tracing (20%) is highest in the 22 districts. The fatality is also the lowest with only 95 deaths reported so far. Meanwhile, all suspected Covid cases are sent to village isolation centres for observation and further testing. Around 74,424 people above the age of 45 have been vaccinated so far. Khadgata said until Thursday, 261,804 samples have been collected out of which 253,691 people have tested negative. Results of 2,364 samples are awaited.Suresh Kumar, NHAI project director, said the two plants will be functional next month and together they will generate 1.5 ton of oxygen which will cater to 50 Covid patients. “With this the beds will be increased and nearby districts will benefit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/7-oxygen-plants-in-the-works-nuh-readies-for-next-covid-wave-101622211742536.html

Here’s what will be allowed||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday that the national capital will start lifting lockdown measures gradually from Monday, May 31. Delhi went under lockdown on April 19, which was further extended a few times. Kejriwal cited the decreasing number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital as the reason for initiating the unlocking process, adding that the government has to ensure people don’t die of poverty after surviving the second wave of the pandemic.“Currently, there is no shortage of hospital beds, ICU and oxygen. So, we have to start the un-lockdown process. We should ensure that we don’t land in a position in which people survive Covid-19 but die of poverty,” Kejriwal said in a press briefing on Friday.The chief minister urged people not to step out unless absolutely necessary, cautioning that even though the government is not in favour of a lockdown but if Covid-19 cases start to rise again such measures will have to be re-implemented.The following activities have been allowed to commence from May 31.1. The Delhi government has prioritised the weakest economic section in its un-lock mandate. The process will be starting with the opening up of the construction sector.2. Factories will also start opening up from May 31, earlier only factories producing Covid-19 essentials like face masks, sanitisers, PPE kits were allowed to remain operational.3. Kejriwal said the lockdown process is aimed at helping migrant labourers and daily wage workers thus the two sectors where they constitute the majority of the workforce have been allowed to open first.4. HT reported last week that the government has not maintained any data on the number of migrant workers who had left Delhi by train but some 8,00,000 had left for their villages on inter-state buses. According to news agency ANI on Friday, the migrant workforce has started to come back to the Capital and buses arriving at Anand Vihar and Kashmere Gate terminals were occupied by those returning from their villages for work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-begin-unlocking-from-may-31-here-s-what-will-be-allowed-101622206827797.html

I fainted but my security guard saved us. We have no enemy who wants to kill me,” the 41-year-old lawmaker said after the attack that provoked her party to amp up its criticism of the Ashok Gehlot government.Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje said the attack on the MP reflected the deteriorating law and order situation and contradicted the Congress government’s claims that women in the state are safe. “In reality, anarchy has only grown under the shield of political patronage,” she said, demanding that the police should track down down the culprits and take stringent action against themRanjeeta Koli said the car was intercepted and attacked near Dharsoni village on Hantara-Weir road at about 11.30pm when she was returning after visiting the Raj Bahadur Memorial hospital.A personal security officer, her brother, and two others were in the car when the incident took place.The first-time MP was taken to the district hospital for a check up and first-aid.

28-05-2021||Lucknow||BJP and Cong in political tug of war over Covid-19 relief in Amethi, Rae Bareli||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are engaged in an outreach campaign Amethi and Rae Bareli, two politically important constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, with the two parties appearing keen to be seen as the primary caretakers and providers of help amid the pandemic.While the BJP is aiming to build on its relatively recent electoral gains, the Congress is desperate to reclaim lost ground.The Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are due early next year and experts believe these polls could have an impact on the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The Congress’ first family, the Gandhis, have been representing the two constituencies for decades. Despite its surprise loss from Amethi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the party retains Rae Bareli, which the BJP has now set its sights on. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi lost the Amethi Lok Sabha seat to Union minister Smriti Irani in 2019. It was only the third time when the party lost its citadel.The Congress has now targeted Irani, claiming she had been missing throughout the pandemic when Amethi needed her the most.The BJP hit back, saying Irani was active as well as connected with the people, helping them through Covid helplines, ration kits and hospitalisation.The Yogi Adityanath government in the state has already sanctioned a Covid testing laboratory in Amethi, which officials said would also help people of the adjoining regions of Rae Bareli, Sultanpur and Pratapgarh – territories once dominated by the Congress.Also read: Rajasthan CM rubbishes BJP claims of vaccine wastage in stateEarly in May, Smriti rushed to Amethi after BJP MLA Dal Bahadur Kori from Salon died of post-Covid complications. Salon is an assembly segment under Amethi Lok Sabha, parts of which are also spread into Rae Bareli, the only surviving Congress bastion in the state.“She reviews the Covid situation in her constituency almost daily. A Covid response WhatsApp group has been set up with Irani, her representative Vijay Gupta, the district BJP chief and two members from each Vidhan Sabha (constituency), also in there,” a BJP leader said.Assembly-constituency wise helpline numbers, too, were issued, party leaders said.“With just about nine months to go for 2022 UP assembly polls, the exercise is significant for both the BJP and the Congress. The Congress, having lost eight of the 10 assembly seats that make up Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies, - and since then has seen remaining two MLAs veer towards BJP - is now desperate to reclaim lost political space in territories that were regarded as its family bastions, but the BJP wouldn’t want to give in so easily either,” said professor Manuka Khanna, Lucknow University.Despite the BJP capturing political space, Congress has been active too with party leaders distributing ration kits, running ambulance services and arranging for sanitisation.Congress leaders said the Gandhis had a familial bond with these constituencies, one that was above victory or defeat.“There are specific instructions from Rahul Gandhiji to ensure help for all of Amethi. He has been regularly sending oxygen concentrators and cylinders for Amethi and now efforts are underway to ensure sanitisation of all houses for which 10,000 litres of hypochlorite solution would soon be made available,” Congress district unit chief Pradeep Singhal said. The party has also sent face covers to be distributed among people in Amethi.Both parties are putting in a similar effort in Rae Bareli, where the BJP had fielded Congress MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh against party chief Sonia Gandhi in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Sonia Gandhi had convincingly defeated her former party man, but the win in Amethi has made BJP ambitious, party leaders admit.Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who visited Rae Bareli earlier this week, had said oxygen plants would be functional soon in the district.“We are taking complete care of people, from oxygen to availability of hospital beds, medicines, ration kits,” Sharma said. Congress claims the party leadership has been silently helping the people.“On being told that poor people were burying their dead by the riverside rather than cremating them, Soniaji sent three truckloads of wood for all three cremation grounds of Rae Bareli. She also provided ₹1.17 crore from the MLPAD fund to help better health infrastructure,” a Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-cong-in-political-tug-of-war-over-covid-19-relief-in-amethi-rae-bareli-101622204459203.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Across The Universe||Even before Kabir Bedi had shoe-horned his way into The Beatles’ Delhi hotel suite as a 20-year-old rookie reporter for an interview, it was obvious that he was destined to lead an extraordinary life, almost like the protagonist of one of Salman Rushdie’s magic realism novels, or Zelig, Woody Allen’s hero, who has an uncanny knack of turning up at history’s most pivotal moments.Consider his background — born a year before Independence as one of the off-springs of the extraordinary marriage of two Oxford undergrads, both deeply involved in India’s freedom struggle; Kabir‘s mother Freda was an English rose who had fallen in love with Baba Pyare Lal Bedi (BPL), a dashing left-leaning descendant of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. His parents’ ideological commitment saw Kabir grow up amid some of the founding fathers of new India. From Nehru and Gandhi who co-opted Freda into satyagraha, to Sheikh Abdullah who invited BPL to reside in Srinagar and draft the first constitution of independent Kashmir, to the likes of Teji Bachchan, Inder and Satish Gujral and Khuswant Singh, Kabir’s exposure to the leading minds of his time was remarkable. And if this was not enough to set him apart, there was his parent’s astonishing spiritual transformations during his teens — first his mother who became the highest-ordained nun in Tibetan Buddhism and a key figure in its introduction to the West, and then his father whose sudden mystical awakening led him to healing, auto-writing and speaking in tongues. *********************************************************************************But as he writes in the very first chapter of Stories I Must Tell: The Emotional Life of An Actor, even with all this as a background, Kabir’s life might have not spun into the stuff of legend had it not been for that fanboy Beatles moment and its subsequent fall-out. Because, shortly after his triumph, came the tragedy — with legendary inefficiency, All India Radio had recorded over his interview, deleting it for posterity. For the Stephen College history major and childhood friend of Rajiv and Sanjay Gandhi, with his debating acumen honed among the likes of Kapil Sibal and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, it had been proven to be the last straw. With ₹700 in his pocket, he’d caught the first train out of Delhi to seek his fortunes in Mumbai. To begin with, landing a stint at Lintas as an ad filmmaker while attracting acclaim as a model and voice over artist in the Bombay of the Seventies, was not a long stretch for the 6’2” Delhi hunk, said to have the looks of a Greek god. Neither was his subsequent break as the lead in Alyque Padamsee’s production of Girish Karnad’s Tughlaq and subsequent debut in Bollywood, or his marriage to the vivacious Protima Gupta. To be sure, his Bollywood avatar and his life as a member of the famous Juhu Gang, his affair with the industry’s top actress Parveen Babi and his mind boggling, unimaginable stardom following his role as the pirate Sandokan on Italian TV (which saw him land a role in the Bond franchise, and later in iconic TV series such as the Bold and the Beautiful), and his four marriages on three continents have been the stuff of tabloid headlines. *********************************************************************************Kabir says he always knew he had a great story to tell and that he had thought about writing his autobiography for decades. But all his attempts had landed in the bin. The pandemic had afforded him time to think afresh. “My book was bursting to come out of me, an unborn baby pushing with its legs,” he says. One morning, he had an epiphany on how to approach it and cocooned and encouraged by his devoted wife, Parveen Dusanj, he had worked like a maniac, all day, every day, for six months until he had the first draft of a manuscript. And what a labour of love it’s been, page after page bristling with sparkling stories from the vastness and scope of an extraordinary life. From his experiences as a child monk in Burma, to encounters with Gina Lollobrigida and Fellini, Krishnamurthy, Audrey Hepburn and Lady Diana, Kabir has written with a rare honesty, courage and sensitivity, not usually associated with those in showbiz. *********************************************************************************But for all the jaw-dropping glamour of his tryst with the Bond franchise, beautiful women, and Bollywood’s jet set, what is most captivating in the book, surprisingly, is the chapter in which Kabir ruminates about the deeper questions of his life. Titled Ramblings On A Beach, it begins with a short story he’d penned as an idealistic 29-year-old. “There are seekers like me. The ones who question everything, who look for deeper answers, who want to know ‘the Truth’,” he writes, before dwelling on the many streams of spirituality that have run through his life — Sikhism, Buddhism, Christianity, West coast movements like EST and new-age philosophers like Osho and Deepak Chopra. It is here that Kabir shares a hard-earned wisdom: “The honey of material achievement — money, fame, success and beautiful women — didn’t give me the answers,” says the man whose life could be the fantasy of many a young boy. Because for all his outward material successes of being Knighted, lionised, mobbed and adored by a slew of impossibly glamorous women, Kabir is unafraid to share his downsides. He doesn’t shrink away from writing about his brilliant techie son Siddharth’s suicide, nor the unravelling of his marriages nor his financial tribulations. And yet, from the chiaroscuro of Kabir’s deeply introspective book, hidden patterns emerge which one hopes will give rise to more of his writing. Such as the poignant coincidence of two of the famous women he had once loved (wife Protima and paramour Persis Khambatta) dying suddenly and inexplicably, on exactly the same day. Such as how two of his most cherished, his son and Parveen Babi, ended up tragically suffering from the same debilitating affliction of schizophrenia. Such as how in spite of all his wild spiritual and personal ramblings across the globe, this descendant of Guru Nanak has finally found happiness and fulfilment in marriage to a fellow Sikh, and what’s more, has set up home with her in his beloved Juhu, not far from where he’d once lived. And last but not the least, such as how a rookie fan boy, out to score an interview with the legendary Beatles, ended up receiving the same traffic-stopping, unbridled, out-of-control adulation from fans on the streets of Europe, one day, himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-across-the-universe-101622203582428.html
28-05-2021||Jaipur||HC directs Rajasthan govt to submit report on vaccination of Pak migrants||The Rajasthan High Court on Friday directed the state government to submit a detailed report on June 3, complying with the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Central government to vaccinate the migrants group from Pakistan.The court also said the state should ensure that ration material and food packets are made available to all needy Pakistani minority migrants residing in various districts in Rajasthan either through the food supplies department, local bodies or the NGOs.In the division bench of Justice Vijay Bishnoi and Justice Rameshwar Vyas, Assistant Solicitor General Mukesh Rajpurohit filed an affidavit wherein it is stated that the Central government issued a detailed SOP on Covid-19 vaccination of those without prescribed identity cards through the CoWIN app on May 6 and that after receiving the requisite information from the state and district administration regarding the groups included in the SOP, the vaccines will be provided to them.The SOP states that the district task force may identify such groups of persons in respective districts without any of the prescribed individual photo ID cards with assistance from the concerned government departments/organisations, such as the department of minority affairs, social justice, social welfare, etc.Information regarding the identified groups and the number of beneficiaries must be covered, collated at the state level and the state government must issue clear instructions for the implementation of these SOPs along with the district-wise estimated maximum number of doses to be administered using this special dispensation.However, during the hearing, Additional Advocate General (AAG) Karan Singh Rajpurohit told the court that around 25,000 Pakistani minority migrants are residing in Rajasthan across various districts at present.“Every Pakistani minority migrant does not need free ration and food because many of the families are self-sufficient. It is further submitted that the district administrations are taking note of the situation and will ensure that no such person will be deprived of ration or food during the period of lockdown,” he said.He added, “So far, as the Covid-19 vaccination of the Pakistani minority migrants is concerned, SOP issued by the Central government is silent regarding the Pakistani minority migrants and, therefore, clarifications are being sought from the Central government regarding the vaccination of Pakistani minority migrants who have not been granted citizenship till date.”“We are of the opinion that the SOP on Covid-19 vaccination of persons without prescribed identity cards through CoWIN issued by the Central government is elaborate and in no way excluding the Pakistani minority migrants who are eligible for Covid-19 vaccination. We have also noticed that several directions regarding the identification of groups of people including in the SOP have been given but the state has not submitted any details regarding the identification of such groups,” the bench said.AAG Rajpurohit sought some time to furnish details regarding the steps taken by the state across districts as per the procedure given in Clause 5 of the SOP.Welcoming the court’s order, Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangathan, which is fighting for the rights of Pakistani migrants, said, “we had been demanding this for a long time. Now we have hope”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/hc-directs-rajasthan-govt-to-submit-report-on-vaccination-of-pak-migrants-101622203102014.html

Her husband had refused to cut a tree||Bhopal/Sagar: A pregnant woman, her two children and mother-in-law were abducted, thrashed and tortured for four days in Madhya Pradesh after her husband, also a Dalit, refused to cut a tree at the farm of the accused, police said.The Dalit family in Chhatarpur district , 350 km from state capital Bhopal. was rescued on Wednesday after a local journalist tipped off the police. The prime suspect, described as a village muscleman, was arrested on Thursday. His two accomplices are on the run.On Thursday, the woman told reporters that she was also raped by the village muscleman but the police had skipped mentioning this crime in the First Information Report. The three accused, named in the FIR, have been accused of causing hurt, kidnapping, obscenity and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act.Sachin Sharma, superintendent of police Chhatarpur, said they will add relevant sections relating to rape in the FIR in view of the woman’s disclosure before the media.“The woman has injury marks on her body and in her complaint, she informed police about physical torture only. She didn’t inform us about any sexual assault but if she is saying, we will add the section of rape in the FIR,” Sachin Sharma, superintendent of police, Chhatarpur district, said.Rajnagar police station in-charge Pankaj Sharma said the prime suspect had summoned a 32-year-old labourer, a Dalit, to his farm to cut some trees. But he refused, reportedly on the grounds that he was not feeling well. The labourer was beaten up to punish him but he eventually managed to run away.“Later, the accused reached the labourer’s house and beat his pregnant wife, two kids and mother. The accused abducted them and tortured them for four days,” Sharma said.The police officer said a local journalist heard about the incident and informed the police.“Police rescued them on Wednesday and admitted them to a local hospital from where they have been discharged,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/raped-in-front-of-kids-says-dalit-woman-her-husband-had-refused-to-cut-a-tree-101622202072799.html
28-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM rubbishes BJP claims of vaccine wastage in state||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday rubbished the allegations from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that the state had wasted 1.15 million Covid vaccine doses. “By levelling such allegations, the BJP is working to break the morale of our Corona warriors, who have been working for 14 months now. I will appeal to the leaders of the Opposition not to do such negative politics during the time of pandemic,” he tweeted. Senior BJP leaders, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, have alleged that Rajasthan has wasted 1.15 million [11.5 lakh] vaccine doses.He said according to the data recorded on the CoWIN app, 16,367,230 people have been vaccinated in the state till May 26. Of these, 338,000 doses were wasted, which is just 2%. This is much lower than the national average of 6% and the 10% of wastage permitted by the Government of India. Also Read | Ensure more Covid-19 vaccines are available to states: Rajasthan CM GehlotThe chief minister attributed this incorrect figure to technical glitches in eVIN, the software for tracking vaccination. For this reason, the total number of vaccines on eVIN was stated to be 17,001,220, which is not correct, he said. Similarly, he pointed out, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand were also reported to have recorded vaccine wastage of 30.2% and 37.3%, respectively. However, he said, the chief ministers and health ministers of both the states reported 0.95% and 4.65% wastage respectively. “It seems that in the time of the epidemic, the Central government is deliberately trying to mislead the public,” he said. He pointed out that in the May 21 video conference, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had admitted to technical glitches in CoWIN, leading to inflated percentages. Gehlot said Harsh Vardhan had then assured the states that the Centre would discuss the issue with individual states to get the correct figures before releasing the data. He said that the BJP-led Centre failed to provide the vaccine and was trying to shift the blame on the states. “I will appeal to the Opposition leaders in Rajasthan to pressure the Centre in the interest of the state, so that we get more doses of the vaccine. The Centre should also ensure free universal vaccination. Rajasthan tops the country in vaccination and will continue to do its best work even further,” said the CM. However, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek insisted that the CM should accept that a large quantity of vaccine doses were wasted in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-cm-rubbishes-bjp-claims-of-vaccine-wastage-in-state-101622201652435.html

Of these 338,000 doses were wasted which is 2%, he said adding that this is much lower than the national average of 6% and the Centre’s limit of 10%.“At the beginning of the vaccination drive in Rajasthan, there were technical errors reported in the eVIN software -created for tracking inoculations- due to which there was double-entry of 295,000 doses at several vaccination centres. And hence, the total doses administered showed as 17,001,220 on the software, which is incorrect. Only 338,000 doses have been wasted,” the Rajasthan chief minister said in the statement.प्रदेश में कोविड वैक्सीन की 11.5 लाख डोज़ बर्बाद होने की खबर झूठी है। BJP ऐसे झूठे आरोप लगाकर 14 महीने से मेहनत कर रहे हमारे कोरोना वॉरियर्स का मनोबल तोड़ने का काम कर रही है जो निंदनीय है। मैं विपक्ष के नेताओं से अपील करूंगा कि महामारी के समय ऐसी नकारात्मक राजनीति ना करें। pic.twitter.com/q4sEvnDzR8Gehlot also reminded that during the review meeting of states with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on May 21, he accepted that there were technical issues with the Centre’s vaccine portal due to which the vaccine wastage figures were showing inflated. “Dr Vardhan himself assured that the Centre will speak to states and then only it will present the figures of vaccine wastage,” Gehlot said.Also Read| Over 224.6 million Covid vaccine doses provided to states, UTs so far: CentreGehlot pointed out that by presenting forged figures, deliberate attempts are being made by the BJP to mislead the public during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic. “We all are working together to manage Covid-19, but the BJP is trying to bring down the morale of corona warriors who have been working hard to combat the virus for the last 14 months.”He accused the Centre of failing to make vaccines available due to its wrong policies and appealed to all opposition leaders in Rajasthan to pressurise the Centre to provide more doses to the state rather than creating disputes.Rajasthan has so far inoculated 16,426,346 people of which 13,361,360 have received the first dose and the remaining 3,064,986 with both doses.

AAP’s spokesperson Atishi said at a press briefing that due to the “artificial scarcity” of vaccines, states have been left with no option but to rely on these two domestic manufacturers."The Centre created such an artificial scarcity that states have to buy from them only. The Centre should respond to this," she said.Atishi said the World Health Organization (WHO) and many countries in the world approved the vaccines produced by Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson and Johnson by December 2020 but the Centre dragged its feet in issuing emergency authorisation to them. “Why were these three vaccines not given emergency authorisation? If WHO can approve them, why can't India? This clearly shows that the Centre has created this artificial scarcity to favour Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech," she said."Many vaccines are being approved across the world. Pfizer vaccine has been approved in 85 countries, Moderna vaccine has been approved in 46 countries and J&J is approved in 41 countries,” she stated.The AAP spokesperson also claimed that neither Bharat Biotech nor SII possesses the capacity to mass manufacture the required number of vaccine doses to inoculate the entire population of the country. “The central government has to answer why in the midst of a pandemic they are indulging in a vaccination scam,” she said before concluding the press briefing.The BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor reacted against the AAP’s claims. Kapoor told news agency PTI that neither Bharat Biotech nor SII has anything to gain from a scarcity of vaccines since a scarcity would entail the entry of foreign manufacturers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-creating-artificial-scarcity-to-favour-sii-bharat-biotech-says-aap-101622200879021.html

Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) said they conducted an independent survey to evaluate the distribution of Take Home Ration (THR) through Anganwadis under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). “As per the latest round of survey result, 91% of the beneficiaries reported that they are receiving nutritional supplements. This is a remarkable improvement from May 2020 when only 23% of the beneficiaries surveyed had received the ration,” the commission said in a statement. Also Read | Government’s helplines for us found wanting, say migrant workersThe scheme was announced last year by the Women and Child Development department under which lactating mothers and children below six years of age received nutritional supplements from Anganwadi centres. Under the scheme, children were given 1300gm of dalia, 260gm of black channa (raw), 130gm of jaggery and 130gm roasted black gram. Pregnant women received 1690gm of dalia, 260gm of black channa (raw), 130gm of jaggery and 130gm roasted black gram. During a surprise inspection last year, women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam found several irregularities in the implementation of the scheme. “After a series of inspections in June 2020, the minister ordered immediate action and suspension of two Anganwadi workers and a supervisor. The minister had also ordered an audit of all ration distribution centres,” the commission said in a statement, adding that the subsequent monitoring of the scheme helped in plugging the gaps. “Since last year, DCPCR has been conducting several rounds of surveys to assess the distribution of ‘Take Home Ration’ for lactating mothers and children under the age of 6 years. Through the recent survey, it was found that there has been a consistent yet significant improvement in ration distribution,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/68-jump-in-take-home-ration-scheme-beneficiaries-since-last-year-dcpcr-101622200272521.html

The Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI) said Bachchan saved more than ₹90 lakh from the deal. “Any sale boosts the whole cycle of real estate like the payment to banks, contractors and also fetches government revenue in the form of stamp duty and registration amount. Hence, the government needs to bring back the stamp duty cut,” said Deepak Goradia, President, MCHI-CREDAI.Bachchan has brought the property from Crystal Pride Developers in Atlantis Building at Andheri (W). The property is reported to be on the 27 and 28 floors of the under-construction 34-storeyed building. It also includes six mechanised parking slots.Bachchan purchased the apartment on December 31, 2020, and registered the same on April 12, 2021.The actor paid ₹62 lakh as stamp duty by taking advantage of a stamp duty scheme of the Maharashtra government under which buyers have to pay just 2% of the stamp duty instead of the normal 5%. The scheme was launched to improve revenue which has fallen significantly amid the Covid-19 pandemic.According to Zapkey.com, which accessed the registration documents, “the pandemic has given a boost to the sale of luxury apartments and many celebrities, businessmen, professional CXO’s have bought houses to take advantage of the pandemic-led price correction and stamp duty correction,” said Sandeep Reddy, co-founder, Zapkey.com.Atlantis Building in Andheri also has two other Bollywood buyers, Sunny Leone and Anand L Rai, the director of Bollywood blockbuster ‘Tanu weds Manu’. While Leone paid ₹16 crore for her 4365 square feet apartment, Rai had to shell out ₹25.30 crore for his 5917 square feet apartment.A response from Bachchan on the matter is awaited.The real estate sector has been facing a slowdown for several years and the pandemic has only made matters worse.The government in August last year announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 till December 31, 2020, and then hike it to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move played a significant role in boosting sales of both primary and secondary market. The state however refused to extend it despite several requests.Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank, a real estate consultancy firm, said, “buyers took advantage of twin factors of price cuts and schemes offered by the builders. Builders are ready to negotiate and cut prices as they want to sell their properties. The stamp duty cut was a huge savings and many took advantage of this,” said Zia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amitabh-bachchan-buys-apartment-worth-rs-31-cr-pays-rs-62-lakh-as-stamp-duty-101622200213638.html

He said the Centre will deploy an inter-ministerial team to visit Odisha and West Bengal to assess the extent of damage, based on which further assistance will be granted.Odisha did not demand any immediate package from the Centre for undertaking relief and restoration works in the aftermath of cyclonic storm Yaas. The state, however, demanded assistance for a disaster resilience power system and protection from coastal storm surge.Ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s aerial survey of cyclone Yaas-affected districts of Balasore, Bhadrak and Kendrapara in Odisha, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, in a meeting with the PM at Bhubaneswar airport, said Odisha does not seek any immediate financial assistance from the Central government as the country is at the peak of the pandemic.“We would like to manage it through our own resources to tide over the crisis. However, we sought assistance for long term measures to make Odisha disaster resilient as we are frequented by such climate hazards every year. Odisha demands a disaster-resilient power infrastructure and resilient coastal protection with storm surge resilient embankments,” Patnaik said.PM Modi, who landed at Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar at 10.50 am, was received by Governor Ganeshi Lal and CM Patnaik, among others. Later, he held a review meeting at the airport with the Governor, Patnaik, DGP Abhay, chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra, Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Jena, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Union minister of state for fisheries and MSME, Pratap Sarangi. After the meeting, the PM proceeded on the aerial survey of the worst-hit Balasore and Bhadrak districts.In June last year, the state government, during a visit of the inter-ministerial central team for damage assessment of cyclone Amphan, asked for a ₹20,000-crore package from the Centre for the creation of a disaster-resilient infrastructure in the state instead of spending a huge amount each year towards restoration and rehabilitation following disasters brought about by cyclones, among others.The state government wanted the Centre’s assistance for laying of underground cable in urban areas, resilient power transmission and distribution infrastructure in rural areas, building remote control GIS grid, raising the height of saline embankments to at least 6.5 metres above sea level and converting 1.66 lakh kaccha houses to cyclone resilient pucca houses.When cyclone Fani struck Odisha coast, it caused huge damage to the power infrastructures that left over 1 lakh km of 11-KV and low tension lines damaged while 2.18 lakh electric poles were damaged. Electricity could not be restored in Puri district for over a month. Fani caused damage worth at least ₹1,160 crore to Odisha’s power sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-yaas-odisha-seeks-long-term-assistance-for-disaster-resilient-power-system-101622199372296.html
28-05-2021||Pune||Covid-19 impact: Survival pandemic infects working class||The pandemic and Covid-related restrictions have been hard on everyone. Many have lost their jobs, while others have to face challenges every day to make ends meet. The daily wage workers, small roadside vendors, workers at non-essential shops among others have been hit hard as the non-essential shops have been closed for more than one month. On Thursday, HT spoke to a few people about their struggle for survival.“We have to skip meals...give me a job”Laxman Dahibhate, a 48-year-old contract worker, who resides near Dandekar bridge used to work at a clothing shop, but is jobless for the last two months. His daily routine includes a visit to the ‘Kamgar adda chowk’ or labour pick-up point near Dandekar bridge in a hope that he will get some work and he can earn bread and butter for his family.“Every day, I come here in search of some work, but at the end of the day, I am disappointed. Back at home, my wife and son wait for me to return home, and hope I get groceries and vegetables so that food is cooked. Sometimes we can have our two-time meals, but most of the days we have to skip our dinner as there is nothing to eat in the house,” said Laxman.He stays along with his family in the slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) scheme buildings near the Dandekar bridge.“Just like me, there are hundreds of other labourers and some of my friends who come daily in search of work and go away without anything. This pandemic has made our lives hell and I hope that the lockdown ends soon and I get some work so that I can earn for my family,” he said.“Business has suffered, every day we have to look for an alternate source of income”Sindhu Tukaram Belsare (65), involved in the business of making clay pots and Ganpati idols in Navi peth, said, “There is hardly any business left to do, we are a family of five people. My son, his wife and two children. He (her son) lost his job due to the lockdown and in search of a new job for the last three months”“Amid the restrictions, the business has suffered and we have to face challenges daily,” said Belsare, whose husband passed away a few years back.Recalling her last 1.5 years of experience, Belsare said, “Last year we bought a large number of Ganpati idols in big size, but suddenly government ordered to have small idols and to immerse them at home. So our idol stock is lying unused and we had to face a major loss. There is no income source left and day after day we have to look for alternate sources to earn money.”“I am not able to pay school fees of my children”Prakash Karangle (45), who sells and repairs footwear near Shanipar Chowk, is a father of three daughters and his wife is a patient with brain disease. “It has become extremely difficult for me and my family to survive because of the lockdown. There were days when we don’t have anything to cook and eat in the house.”“Our savings have been used up in this period of lockdown. I was not able to pay the school fees of my two daughters and the school administration has told me to pay it immediately or else her name will be removed from the school,” he said.“Last week, I borrowed ₹2,000 from a friend and then bought groceries, vegetables and other necessary things for my family. Today (on Thursday) since morning I earned only ₹30. How should we survive?” he said.“I am struggling to pay house rent, bills”Aslam Shaikh (41), who originally hails from Uttar Pradesh, works at a saloon in Shukrwar peth for the last ten years. “Our shop is closed since the lockdown started but our regular customers call us for service. If possible we go to their home and provide service. We are waiting for the lockdown the end and the business to resume.”“As I was not able to pay the fees of my son, we decided to remove his name from the school. Also, we shifted from our earlier home which rent was high and now into a one-room kitchen. We have not paid the house rent for two months, even the shop rent and electricity bill payment is pending,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid19-impact-survival-pandemic-infects-working-class-101622199322585.html
28-05-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: Why data matters... and why it does not... even when it should||I love data. And how can one not? There’s so much of it around and more being generated every second. With so much information available and more on its way, one would think decision making and action-taking would be so easy, so precise, and so always-right for everyone everywhere. That’s not how the world is working at the moment. Data is defined as factual information that can be used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. Even when we have tonnes of data and analysis, and even when it is all very compelling, it does not seem to spur governments, societies, and people to act on the basis of it. Take Covid-19 data for instance. When I look at statistics available, I am thinking stay indoors for another two-three months, maybe the whole of 2021, and definitely not sending my children to school. Many of my friends are looking at the statistics and saying, “Just another week or two and we will finally be able to get out of the house!” Governments seem to be looking at stats and weighing when they want to ease restrictions. The USA, I believe, has looked at all the stats and already eased restrictions, to the extent that people don’t have to wear masks. The UK had a concert I believe. From where I am sitting, third, fourth, fifth waves are inevitable, because we are not learning how we are perpetuating the pandemic.Why the different interpretations? Because we are looking at different parts of the data. Some are looking at number of cases, or positivity or new cases or related rates, et al. I am looking only at number of deaths. Why? Because I have written more obituaries this last year than I have done in my entire 30-year career. That’s called “proximity” in design terms, a concept that was explained to me 17 years ago by a former colleague and design wizard, Reena Roy. You see, sometimes we act differently or don’t act on data, because the data has no immediate relevance to our daily actions. The classic example that comes to mind is what we see on TV news. I can’t remember the last time I saw something on TV news that was relevant to my daily life here in Pune. You know which media has proximity to me and my needs? The local newspaper and the local edition of this national newspaper. In English, and in Marathi. They have people who are from the location and have lived here half their lives, if not all of it.Then there is familiarity. The more we see information and terminology, the more comfortable we get with it and start believing we understand what it means. Familiarity brings comfort, which in turn facilitates a contempt for urgency. Eventually, it influences only our words and communication without us ever having analysed or understood what the information was conveying, or how it affects the world, because we conclude that it is important to others, but not us.The example I think of in this context is jobs data. Jobs data and emerging trends make sense only when one doesn’t have a job, or has been laid off, or is in danger of being laid off. Another key reason why data may not lead to action is the source. The first thing I do when I see a graph or data chart, is to look at who’s produced the report. Then I know who they represent, can guess what the purpose of the information is and make an educated guess on whether I need to look deeper or beyond the data. Data does not really change our underlying behaviour which comes from deep conditioning. We use information to make conversation, analyse, and socialise. But our default decisions and therefore, behaviour, does not change. Data is simply fodder to strengthen our convictions.When we do act upon data? What kind of data do we act upon? At the moment, I am in Dhayari, Sinhagad road. Which means I understand what water woes mean. One moment you have water, the next moment you don’t… for three days. When you have water, you may not have electricity. You know who has the correct level of proximity and data relevance in such situations? The society secretary, gram panchayat, and water supplier.People in Dhayari, especially the under-privileged and the old are struggling for vaccines. And the struggle is a little different in areas like this that are on the outskirts: you have to try for slots online half the day and stand in long lines with no social distancing in the scorching heat, just to be told there is no vaccine and to come back another day. Who has the right level proximity? Your family members and friends who take turns to try for online slots; the Mayor’s list of vaccination centres for the next day; the village sarpanch and grassroots-level politician who genuinely make an attempt to get actionable information; but above all, our maid who called at 6.30 am when she learned that her local village school was a centre - she couldn’t get her first dose, but she stood in the line so that our 70+ elders could get a token for their second dose.That’s data proximity, relevance, and support at its very best.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-why-data-matters-and-why-it-does-not-even-when-it-should-101622198832606.html

28-05-2021||Bhopal||In MP, families that lose members to Covid-19 face challenges in getting death certificate||Sarla Vyas, a resident of Damoh in Madhya Pradesh, died of Covid-19 at a private hospital on April 14. When his son Rajesh Vyas approached the hospital for the death certificate, the hospital administration refused to have any entry of his mother’s death due to Covid-19. Even after one and half month, the hospital administration didn’t release her death certificate with the exact cause of death, HT has learnt. Vyas is not the only one with such an experience, in many districts, people are facing hardships in getting death certificates of their loved ones who succumbed to Covid-19. Many hospital administrations refuse to have any record of the deaths. Aman Jadhav, who hails from Bhopal, has been running pillar to post to get the death certificate of his mother Shashi Jadhav, 40, who died of Covid-19 at JP Hospital in Bhopal on April 18. “I visit the hospital daily but the hospital administration didn’t have any record of my mother’s death. Now, how will I get a death certificate from a municipal corporation?” said Jadhav. Not only this, it is learnt that some hospitals are releasing misleading death certificates by mentioning the cause of death as some illness, cardiac arrest or some other, family members allege. “My 46-year-old brother died of Covid-19 on April 17. The hospital issued a death certificate without mentioning the cause of death. My brother has four kids and we are not financially stable to take care of them. The state government announced compensation against the death of Covid-19 patients but how will we prove that my brother died of Covid-19?” said Manish Pardesia, who hails from Khandwa. A resident of Bhopal, Shawar Jama said, “I lost my father due to Covid-19 but the hospital handed over the death certificate stating that he died of cardiac arrest. I requested them to correct it but the hospital administration said they can’t change their record.” Experts say these are some of the examples proving that Covid-19 deaths data is being fudged. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan member SR Azaad said, “People are facing trauma and trouble due to missing or misleading records of the hospitals. Now, hospitals are also taking advantage of the state government’s lack of transparency in maintaining the records. As the state government was mainly dependent upon private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, they can’t take action against them.” Amulya Nidhi, another health activist, who is constantly fighting for health rights, said, “According to the MP health department, as many as 7,758 people died of Covid-19 since April last year but the records of crematorium and graveyards registered 10 times more death in the state.”“Most of the Covid-19 patients, including the VIPs, ministers and officers, are going to private hospitals for their treatment as the state government relies more on private health facilities than the public ones. Now, private hospitals and the state government are partners in the crime of fudging data,” Nidhi said. Medical colleges’ association president JN Chauksey said, “A panel of doctor decides the cause of death in every hospital. But this is a bitter fact that 50% of Covid-19 patients died of cardiac arrest due to fear of the disease. Death due to fear and cardiac arrest can’t be written as death due to complications of Covid 19.” Department of medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We have not received any such complaints of missing records and wrong entry of cause of death. If we receive any complaint, we will act accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/in-mp-families-that-lose-members-to-covid-19-face-challenges-in-getting-death-certificate-101622196912001.html

We had requested them to call off the protest and vacate the toll plaza but they were reluctant to recede,” SHO, Jewar police station, Umesh Singh, told PTI.The protestors went back from the police station after some time and carried on with their demonstration that continued on Friday morning also with them occupying two lanes of the Yamuna Expressway, according to officials.“The Jewar toll plaza is open for vehicular movement. Only two lanes are blocked because of the farmers' protest,” a Traffic Police official said.After observing 'Black Day' on May 26, the BKU, which has been demanding the repeal of the three new central farm laws since November 2020, has intensified its protest in parts of Uttar Pradesh since Thursday.“Members of the farmers union are staging protest at five toll plazas in western Uttar Pradesh. These toll plazas are located in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Amroha, Moradabad and Muzaffarnagar,” BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said.Supporters of the BKU, led by Rakesh Tikait, have been camping at Ghazipur on the Delhi-UP border since November 2020 with a demand that the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws brought in last year. The farmers claim that these laws would hurt their livelihood and leave them at the mercy of corporations.The government, which has held multiple rounds of official dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-protest-at-jewar-toll-plaza-on-yamuna-expressway-101622195066523.html

28-05-2021||Delhi||Amaltas, a sight to behold in Delhi: #MeAndMyAmaltas||Looking out of the window, during this lockdown in Delhi, has turned therapeutic due to amaltas that has cast a dreamy spell on Delhi’s landscape. One could call this tree Cassia or Golden bells or Indian Laburnum, but its bright yellow sheen and captivating beauty will enrapture you so much that it would be difficult to debate on its name. The amaltas trees lining the Delhi’s roads have captured the fancy of many denizens who have been posting their photographs on social media, since these are visible from the balconies, windows and main doors of many a households, and don’t need any Covid protocol to be followed to get clicked! It’s sunny bloom can lift anyone’s mood and provide a much need positive vibe, especially in the present times of the pandemic. And that’s what some of the popular residents of the city advocate about them.Grateful to the bounteous Nature Author Manju Kapur looks at an amaltas in her backyard, and expresses how these trees are everything that an individual must be grateful for. The writer in her takes over as she goes on to explain how significant a part this tree has plays in her garden. “It has long golden strings, lending the air a yellow light, covering the ground with petals with every gust of wind... To see an amaltas tree, to marvel at its beauty is to feel grateful that Nature keeps on giving!”A golden shower that welcomes April-May Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan recalls the her fond memories of the amaltas in her vicinity. “These trees are more than 32 years old. And it’s wonderful to see the brilliant golden shower just blooming all over. It is just so beautiful! The sidewalks are yellowed with these beautiful flowers as if the tress are shielding and welcoming you with flowers. I remember when my father was posted here in the early 60s, we had a lot of amaltas trees. That time, summer meant blooming amaltas, especially in the months of April and May. What an artistic picture it made! It always reminds me of a poem ‘Os ki boond chalak hi gayi akhir kar, ishq saans lene laga umr ke baad. Amaltas tale’. There are so many poems that talk about the beauty of amaltas, and the amaltas of Delhi are the ones that I have grown up with.” From one generation to anotherFor photographer Aditya Arya, the subtle yellow of the laburnum signifies warmth, sunshine, happiness, rejuvenation and creativity. But the bond that he shares with the amaltas near his house is as beautiful as the flowers of this tree. “This tree sapling was given to my daughter, by my mother, almost 15 years back! Today, it’s a big tree... invigorating and stimulating,” he reminisces, adding, “The story of the subtle and delicate formation of the amaltas flowers doesn’t end on the tree, but gets enhanced when it forms a carpet on the roadside to usher in summer.” Flowers that fall and adorn the sky’s reflectionArtist Sanjay Bhattacharyya gets filled with the thoughts of many amaltas trees that he crossed on his path from his residence to his studio. “Sometimes I look up to appreciate the beauty of those, and sometimes look down at the road that becomes a bright yellow canvas when the flowers fall from the tree.This year, I’ve experienced a very unusual beauty of those flowers. And after the recent sudden rainfall due to that cyclone Tauktae, there was stagnant water on the road and the reflection of sky was visible in it, and there amaltas decorating this view,” describes Bhattacharyya. Amaltas spelt summer vacations The bloom reminds singer Sajeeta Bhattacharya of her summer vacations. She says, “Carpets of yellow along the wide tree-lined streets of Delhi are quintessential to the onset of summer in the Capital. As a kid, it spelt summer vacations for me. And until today, I marvel at these chandeliers that adorn the streets!” Of romantic walks under yellow canopies Reminiscing a memory from back in the days when he was a student at the National School of Drama, actor Rajesh Tailang says, “Our hostel was in the central part of Delhi; and I feel that the most beautiful amaltas blooming happens on the roads of Lutyens’ Delhi. In those times, the traffic on the roads was much less and walking on the side path beneath those yellow canopies was a very romantic experience. Sometimes, while walking, I used to recite poems and practice dialogues.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amaltas-a-sight-to-behold-in-delhi-meandmyamaltas-101622192870920.html

IGMC senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj said on Friday that a 49-year-old diabetic man from Kasauli, who was admitted to the hospital on May 22, died of mucormycosis late on Thursday. Also read: Amid Covid-19 vaccine crunch, India Inc steps in to inoculate employeesThe second patient, a 38-year-old man from Nadaun in Hamirpur district, was brought to IGMC on Thursday.

Himachal Pradesh had recorded its first case of mucormycosis on May 22 when a 52-year-old woman from Hamirpur was found infected. At present, she is undergoing treatment at IGMC. The state has recorded seven cases of mucormycosis so far. Three patients are undergoing treatment at IGMC and two at Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Tanda. Mucormycosis or called black fungus is caused by a mould found in soil and in decaying organic matter such as rotting leaves. People get mucormycosis, of which there are several types, by breathing in the fungal spores. Intense headache, pain in the sinus area and the right eye, blurred vision and swollen cheeks are some symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-deaths-due-to-black-fungus-at-igmc-shimla-101622192531745.html

28-05-2021||Delhi||Lockdown norms to be relaxed partially in Delhi from Monday||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced that the construction sector in the city and factories can resume operations from Monday.This announcement marks the beginning of the scaling down process of the ongoing lockdown imposed on April 19 to curb an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. It has been extended at least five times so far.“In one month, we have controlled this wave to a large extent. In the last 24 hours, around 1,100 new cases were recorded and the positivity rate was around 1.5%. Currently, there is no shortage of hospital beds, ICU beds and oxygen. So, we have to start the un-lockdown process. We should ensure that we don’t land in a position in which people survive Covid-19 but die of poverty,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing streamed live on Friday.At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20 and a positivity rate of more than 36% on April 22. A full lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19.Also Read | 1,072 more Covid-19 cases, caseload drops to 54-day lowKejriwal further said, “The ongoing lockdown will apply till 5am Monday. And then the un-lockdown process will start. The decision was taken today in the meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).”DDMA is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal; Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson .“In the un-lockdown process, our priority will be the weakest economic sections. So, we will start with labourers, especially migrant labourers. Most of them are engaged either in the construction sector or in factories. So, we will open these two sectors from this Monday. But we have to remember that the fight against Covid-19 is still not over. We have to make sure that things do not go bad again. So, the relaxations have to happen in a phased way,” said Kejriwal.Under the ongoing lockdown regulations, there is a complete ban on all economic activities, with exceptions for people, institutes and enterprises engaged in delivery of essential goods and services. Under the currently applicable norms, factories across the city, except those engaged in the manufacture of face masks, hand sanitisers, and other Covid-19 protection-related goods, are prohibited from functioning. Similarly, there is a ban on construction activities too, with an exemption for those which have provision for accommodating labourers on site in adherence to social distancing and other hygiene standards necessary for protection against Covid-19.Kejriwal also said, “Now, week after week we will widen the phased relaxation process on the basis of public opinion and experts’ opinion. But if Covid-19 cases start increasing, we will have to stop all economic activities again. So, I urge people to adhere to all regulations and strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. That is the only way to control Covid-19. Don’t step out unless it is necessary. We are not in favour of a lockdown. We are aware of its negative implications. So, we don’t want that to happen again.”Construction sector and factory workers’ unions in the city welcomed the move as a “relief” but said that Delhi is likely to face a labour shortage in the coming days because a large number of migrant labourers who left the city during the lockdown are unlikely to return anytime soon.“The un-lockdown initiative will bring big relief to lakhs of workers engaged in Delhi’s factories. But a large number of people has already left and they are not likely to come back any time soon. The disease has affected them and their families back in villages. Most of them have run out of money too. They are unlikely to return to Delhi without a guaranteed job,” said Rajesh Kumar, general secretary (Delhi) of Indian Federation of Trade Unions.Thaneshwar Adigaur, convener of Nirmal Majdoor Adhikar Abhiyan, a joint forum of 40 construction sector labour unions in Delhi, said: “Then there is fear of another potential wave of Covid-19. Also, children of migrant labourers no longer have to attend physical classes in the public schools any time soon. So, those who have left for villages are likely to be there for a few more months. However, for the construction workers who stayed back and those who plan to return, the announced relaxation will be a big relief.”Also Read | Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: GovtTwo separate reports published in HT last week said more than 800,000 migrant labourers left Delhi for their home states in buses from the three interstate bus terminals in the first four weeks of the lockdown and the government kept no record of those who left in trains during the same period. Also, a large number of them are affected by the virus which is spreading in villages across states. Many of them either cannot immediately leave family members who are recovering, or are out of money, and lack a security net in the absence of a job guarantee and fear another potential wave of Covid-19 in the coming days. So, a large number of them is unlikely to return any time soon even if the lockdown is lifted.Neeraj Sehgal, a factory owner and general secretary of the industrial area welfare body in Delhi’s Mayapuri, said: “Factory owners too are in bad shape and, hence, they are unlikely to expand their workforce beyond a point. In the next three months, production capacity is likely to remain under 50% because of the financial losses caused by the pandemic. It would be great if the government considers relaxations for the industry sector too in terms of rent relaxation, tax relief and waiver on at least fixed charges on power and water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-norms-to-be-relaxed-in-delhi-from-monday-101622190672134.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid 24X7 helpline family: A call of compassion||When the intentions are good, even a small effort in the right direction goes a long way in bringing a significant change. That’s exactly what happened when more than 4,000 volunteers from across India came together this April, to start a helpline that has become a family of sorts. As part of Delhi’s Covid 24X7 Helpline Family, these volunteers have been helping people find and source oxygen cylinders and concentrators, arrange hospital beds, source medication and even provide food and other essential services to those facing the challenges posed by Covid, in the second wave. Leading the way to set-up this platform was a core group of volunteers namely Karan Sikka, Dr Shirin Khanna, Tarpan Sehgal, Naveen Bagri, Upasana Bora, Damanjeet Singh, Manish Bagga and Gaurav Dhaundiyal. Their set-up involved formation of a separate WhatsApp group, specifically for users, to post leads from any social media platform and even the internet. And from a single group, they have multiplied to a total of 16 groups comprising 13 helplines — one leads group, one verification group and one group for their core team. Karan Sikka, one of the core volunteers, says, “It started with one WhatsApp group, which later multiplied and grew. We started on April 19, just when cases began skyrocketing. We tried to organise everything, and personally verified all information. Sometimes the information we got would be old, or nobody would answer the number that we got. So a special team would call on these numbers, day and night, to verify them all. This way we were also able to help set-up Covid care centres in Delhi-NCR by procuring oxygen cylinders and concentrators.”Another Delhi-based volunteer, Tarpan Sehgal, an advocate by profession, has helped arrange more than 150 beds, about 500 oxygen cylinders, arrange more than 20 Remdisiver alongside helping people get vital drugs and medicines. He says, “You don’t need a cape to be a hero. We initiated the chain of connecting people with each other via social media specifically Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms. Like our chain of volunteers, who are gathering information from various leads on different platforms, I’ve also been working day and night. I’ve lost a few close one during this time, but I want to help others as much as I can.” “We were able to provide help to thousands of people in need and by God’s grace many lives were saved,” says Upasana Bora, a social media influencer, who has been able to arrange leads using her social media presence. She adds, “By using my social media influence and reach, we have been able to spread the word just at the right time.”Helping the patients get access to professional advice on self medication is Dr Shirin Khanna. The Delhi-based medical practitioner came forward to be part of this initiative, to ensure that people are disseminated the right information, and says: “Sometimes people cannot reach out to doctors in time, and they ask their peers questions like ‘What should I do?’ ‘Saturation is falling, what should I do’. People were calling me saying they are out of breath. It was really haphazard. Twice I had to tell people about ventilator, whether they need it or not. It’s very important to know when one needs a ventilator or oxygen. And then I thought, why not help those who are putting out their queries in the groups!” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-covid-24x7-helpline-family-a-call-of-compassion-101622190015655.html

28-05-2021||Patna||‘Only 58.8% of women in Bihar use hygienic methods of protection during menstruation’: Survey||As per the National Family and Health Survey, only 58.8% of women in Bihar, in the age group of menstruation, use hygienic methods of protection during their menstrual cycle. The survey states that out of 58.8% of women, only 56% of rural women use hygienic methods while 74.7% of such women are in urban areas. This has been the situation of menstrual hygiene in the state despite women having a considerable percentage of reservations in panchayat and government jobs. Experts say menstruation is still taboo, especially in rural areas and small towns. There’s still little awareness about menstrual hygiene management among women and adolescent girls, they said. Considering the need for awareness about menstrual hygiene management and of the facilities and materials required to maintain hygiene during the Covid-19 pandemic, UNICEF, Bihar, has appealed to the people to post their pictures with a red dot on their palm, along with a slogan on menstrual hygiene management, on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) Day on May 28. “Menstrual hygiene day (MH Day) is a global advocacy platform that brings together the voices and actions of non-profits, government agencies and individuals to promote good menstrual hygiene management for all women and girls. It’s observed on May 28 as the average duration of a menstrual cycle is 28 days,” Nipurnh Gupta, media coordinator, UNICEF, Bihar, said. A dedicated day for menstrual hygiene came into effect in 2014 in a bid to create awareness among people to stop considering menstruation a taboo and discuss the challenges of its management, she added. “Challenges related to its management must be far more severe during the Covid pandemic. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), 70% of workers in the health and social sector are women. They are the front-line health workers, like nurses, midwives and community health workers,” she said. “As there is a lack of awareness about menstrual hygiene management in our society, there’s every possibility that the facility managers at any centre may miss out on arranging these materials for women frontline workers. Also, those women employees who have been using PPE kits must be in double trouble. Putting on these kits while working at the Covid care centre and removing it when there’s the need to change menstrual hygiene materials must be a big challenge for female health care workers,” she added. Besides, female patients at Covid-19 quarantine centres may not have access to menstrual hygiene management materials. In many cases, piped water supply or hand wash materials may not be available at many places, she added. “In rural areas, girls used to get sanitary pads at their schools. But the schools have remained closed for the last several months. Even if it will open, the materials may not be available in the stock,” she said. These are some basic issues regarding menstrual hygiene management and women and adolescents must be having a tough time these days, she stated. Prabhakar Sinha, the WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) specialist, said the impacts of poor knowledge about menstruation hygiene management must be severe during the Covid pandemic and lockdown. “Though the government has been doing a lot to raise awareness among females, there’s the need to involve common people in this campaign as well. For better results, it should be turned into a social movement,” he said. “This is why many sections of people, including youth, teachers and social activists, have been involved in the virtual sessions. Social media platforms too have been used as a tool to disseminate information about menstrual hygiene management,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/only-58-8-of-women-in-bihar-use-hygienic-methods-of-protection-during-menstruation-survey-101622189831389.html

In a statement filed before the Bombay High Court at Goa, which had asked the Goa government to explain its stand on Covid-19, the government referred to reports which said that the advice of the World Health Organization to not experiment with Ivermectin, as its efficacy is yet to be proved, is “flawed”. “Various studies conducted in different countries have shown that the medicine has a positive effect on prevention and treatment/cure of patients. I say that the studies and reports are available on the website ivmmeta.com... There are some reports which have found that the analysis by WHO on this medicine is flawed and that the mortality rate is actually much lower if the said medicine is used for early treatment as well as prophylaxis,” Goa joint secretary, health, Vikas Gaunekar said in a statement before the Court. Gaunekar said that the Goa government decided to hand out Ivermectin tablets as prophylaxis on the advice of its expert committee. “This aspect was discussed by the State Expert Committee for Covid in the meeting held on May 13 under the chairmanship of the health minister [and] also comprising different expert doctors from government and private institutions. I say that after deliberations, it was recommended to use the said medicine once daily for five days to the population over 18 years. However, pregnant/lactating women, as well as those persons with allergy and those having liver/kidney are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medicine,” he added. The Goa government has decided to administer Ivermectin to all those above the age of 18 with the advice that it should be taken every day for five days as a preventive measure and to prevent severe symptoms in case one contracts the disease. The decision, however, has been met with bemusement. “Patients will be treated with Ivermectin 12mg for a period of 5 days. Expert panels from the UK, Italy, Spain and Japan, found a large, statistically significant reduction in mortality, time to recovery and viral clearance in Covid-19 patients treated with Ivermectin,” Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane said when announcing his decision earlier this month.The World Health Organization (WHO), however, has advised against the use of Ivermectin among the general population.“Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. @WHO recommends against the use of Ivermectin for #COVID19 except within clinical trials,” chief scientist, WHO, Soumya Swaminathan said in a tweet on Tuesday.Merck, a company that manufacturers Ivermectin have also advised against its use in Covid-19 situations.“Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of Ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against Covid-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with Covid-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies,” the company said in a statement earlier this year.Goa’s opposition political parties have now questioned the government calling for “evidence” that the drug works.“The World Health Organisation has advised that Ivermectin only be used to treat Covid-19 within clinical trials. This information is available on the official website of WHO. Now, the question comes who authorised the health minister to decide on this prophylaxis treatment? The BJP government must explain to the people of Goa,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lower-mortality-goa-govt-defends-ivermectin-s-efficacy-against-covid19-101622188817860.html

He was supposed to get married on May 25 but Covid took him away from us,” said a relative of the deceased groom.Jibardhan Bhoi, in his twenties, was supposed to get married on May 25. Hailing from Attabira in Bargarh district, Bhoi worked in a child care institution in Sambalpur district as a manager.However, on May 17, a day before he was supposed to come home for marriage, he tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be admitted to a Covid hospital in Sambalpur town.

28-05-2021||Other||As cyclone Yaas raged, pregnant woman in Odisha carried on charpoy to hospital||As cyclone Yaas lashed Odisha coast with a wind speed of 130-140 km per hour on Wednesday morning, a 25-year-old pregnant woman of Balasore district had to be carried on a charpoy to a hospital by her family members, officials said.Sonali Nath, 25, was at her parent’s house in Balabhadrapur village of Soro block of Balasore district for her childbirth scheduled on June 17. Little did she anticipate that she would go into labour moments before the cyclone hit the Balasore coast with all its ferocity.Minutes after cyclone Yaas touched down on the coast near Bahanaga, less than 10 km from her village, Sonali went into labour and delivered a baby boy, her first child. But instead of breaking into celebration, her 68-year-old father Sambhu, became worried as the placenta did not drop from the womb.The troubles were about to begin for the family.“My daughter was howling in pain and I could do nothing. So we kept on calling an ambulance to carry her to the nearest public health centre (PHC) at Anantpur, but no ambulance came. Feeling helpless, we went to the local ASHA worker but she also refused to help as her name was registered with the ASHA of her in-law’s place. As it was getting critical, I went to the local PHC for help. When I asked for some medicines, I was told that if anything happened the PHC people would not be responsible,” said Sambhu, a Nath yogi.Finding no other way, Sambhu then decided to put her daughter and her newborn on a charpoy and carry them on shoulders after wrapping in a plastic sheet. “it was raining hard and the wind made it very difficult even to go out but we had no other option,” said Sambhu.But the walk from Balabhadrapur to the PHC was anything but easy. The 3 km stretch from Balabhadrapur and the nearest concrete road at Chakapada has been mud slicked for years. What made things worse was breaches on road by locals to drain out floodwaters from the village.“While praying to Lord Jagannath, my family and I tiptoed through the muddy roads that had already become slippery due to heavy rain. On normal days, it is difficult to walk on that road, forget walking with a pregnant woman. A wrong foot in that muddy road could have resulted in a disaster. After walking for about 10 km to the pucca road, we saw an autorickshaw. I begged him to take us to the community health centre at Soro, another 2 km away,” he said.Villagers said the Balabhadrapur-Chakapada road is yet to be made concrete despite several requests to the local administration. “The road has been like that from the days of my grandfather. No ambulance can come to our village because of the kutcha road,” said Lipshita Panda, a resident of Balabhadrapur.After reaching the Community Health Centre (CHC) at Soro, the doctor there helped in getting the placenta out and severed the umbilical cord. The baby and the mother came back home on Thursday and are doing well.Odisha health department officials said more than 750 babies were born in the state before and during the landfall of cyclone Yaas on Wednesday. Several of these children were born on Tuesday night when the cyclonic storm was approaching the country’s eastern coast, while others saw the light of the world around the time when ‘Yaas’ made its landfall near Bahanaga, 50 km south of Balasore district.Many of the kids were named Yaas by their parents after the cyclone.The state government had earlier said that as many as 4,555 pregnant women had been evacuated to various hospitals ahead of the cyclone.In the worst-affected Balasore district, 165 births - 79 male and 86 females - were registered in different health institutions amid the cyclone while 60 children were born in Bhadrak district. Mayurbhanj, which also experienced high-speed wind and extremely heavy rainfall, recorded 66 births.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-cyclone-yaas-raged-pregnant-woman-in-odisha-carried-on-charpoy-to-hospital-101622176691129.html

28-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the mango man||Chicken curry, tawa rotis, a big juicy-looking mango, and a wide smile on his face.Wait, there’s more to this paradise—the shade of the tree, and the empty lockdown-era road that appears as if it had been built for him alone.And also the chirping of birds, hidden somewhere in the tree above.It is afternoon and Birender is enjoying his home-made lunch. A fruit seller, his cart is parked on the roadside near IIT-Delhi. “Just taking a break.... after which I’ll go around the area.”In his 50s, Birender lives in a one-room house in Sarojini Nagar, with wife, Kamla. “She’s the one who makes my lunch,” he says, scooping a piece of chicken with his mango-stained finger. The season’s fruit is lying partially peeled over his rotis. It’s Sundri, he says, referring to the mango’s specie. “The mango isn’t made by my wife,” he chuckles.With so much grief and anxiety raging across the city these days, due to the coronavirus pandemic, one wonders at Birender’s cheeriness—he might as well be living in some alternative reality. The fruit man shrugs, suddenly looking sombre. “I don’t show my worries,” he says, lifting up the mango to pick up a roti under it. But he has his share of troubles too. His anxiety primarily comprises of the loans he took two years ago to arrange his daughter’s wedding in home town, Gaya, in Bihar. “I had to spent about ₹20 lakh... I am not done with the lenders yet.” And with the second surge in the pandemic, his daily earnings have plunged “even though people always need fruits.”He owns some agricultural land in the village but it doesn’t yield much income. It’s tilled by people whom Birender calls bandhak—the daily wage labourers, he explains.And then there’s an even bigger worry—the future of his son, who is pursuing graduation in Gaya. “What will become of him? Will he get any job, times are so bad... will he have to come to Delhi and be a fruit-seller like me?”The question hangs in the air.By now rotis are done with. The curry bowl is licked clean. Birender earnestly sets about eating his mango. As he realises that the camera lens is again focusing on him, he grins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-mango-man-101622151891513.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Clip appears to show Sushil Kumar attacking wrestler||A video that appeared to show wrestler Sushil Kumar allegedly thrashing athlete Sagar Dhankad, who later died, and which is being investigated by the Delhi Police for its authenticity, was being widely shared on social media on Thursday, showing several men attacking at least two individuals with sticks.Sushil Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankad and two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar at the Chhatrasal Stadium in the national capital over a property dispute. The 38-year-old wrestler, a prime suspect in the murder case, and his associate Ajay Bakkarwala were arrested by a team of the Special Cell of Delhi Police on Sunday from Delhi’s Mundka.In the video, which could not be independently verified by HT, Kumar’s associates can be seen armed with pistols, sticks and rods. While the police did not issue an official statement on the clip, two investigators with knowledge of the matter said Kumar had the video recorded to ensure that his rival groups were felt threatened.Kumar’s legal counsel BS Jalhar was not immediately available for a response.The incident, which took place on May 4, left Dhankad dead and his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar injured.In the video, Kumar, a two-time Olympic medallist, is purportedly seen holding a stick and thrashing Dhankad, who is lying injured on the ground. Kumar is seen wearing a white T-shirt, which matches with the one in which he was seen in at toll booth on the Meerut expressway, a day after the crime, people aware of the matter said.At least 15-20 other men are also seen in the video armed with pistols and sticks. Three cars can also seen, in which Kumar and his men are believed to have brought Dhankad and two others to the stadium, they said.The police had seized these vehicles from the stadium the night the incident was reported.Dhankad and friends were assaulted following an ongoing dispute over Dhankad occupying a flat in Model Town, owned by Kumar’s wife. A cash reward of ₹1 lakh was announced before Kumar’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clip-appears-to-show-sushil-kumar-attacking-wrestler-101622150034128.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Pace of vaccine drive gives city hope of combating next wave of Covid-19||Over the last two months, Delhi battled a crushing fourth wave of Covid-19 cases that overwhelmed hospitals, exhausted doctors, and pushed the Capital’s medical infrastructure to the brink. For six weeks, the city has also been shut down with shops, restaurants and most offices closed, public transport at a bare minimum, and nothing but essential services functioning.But throughout these challenges, the state government continued the immunisation drive at an even clip, coordinated with the Centre and private entities, fought vaccine hesitancy and steadily increased inoculation sites.The result: Nearly one in every four eligible residents in the Capital has received at least one shot till May 26, the highest universal coverage for at least one jab among India’s 20 most populous regions. “The government left no stone unturned in increasing vaccine sites, from health facilities to schools, despite a wide range of difficulties during an unprecedented surge in cases,” said revenue minister Kailash Gahlot.The relatively high coverage has been hobbled in recent weeks by a supply shortage but will be crucial in reducing the impact of a third wave, say experts. “A high vaccine coverage will absolutely help Delhi in attaining a herd immunity-like situation with which the population can be protected against potential outbreaks in the coming days. That way, Delhi is headed in the right direction,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology department at Christian Medical College.Data from the Union health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard till May 26 showed Delhi gave 5,226,664 doses to fully vaccinate 1.18 million people, and partly vaccinated 2.87 million more. This means that out of the nearly 20.6 million residents in the city-state, 5.7% residents are completely vaccinated and 14% are partially vaccinated. This translates to 19.7% of the population having received at least one shot. In contrast, the national average is 14.6% -- comprising 11.5% people with one dose and 3.1% fully immunised.Only two regions come close to Delhi – Kerala at 19.1% and Jammu and Kashmir at 19%.According to Delhi’s 2020-21 economic survey , around five million people are below 18. The government said it did not have data on people from other states who got jabs in Delhi.A break-up by age showed the Capital is far ahead of its peers in vaccinating its younger population. Around 14.5% of Delhi’s 18-45 age group has received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, significantly above the national average of 5%. In the older people category, Delhi has administered at least one dose to a little over half of its population (50.4%). Four regions – Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and Gujarat – have given shots to a larger proportion of their population.PLANNED VACCINE SITESOn April 1, Delhi had 450 government vaccination sites for inoculating the city’s health care workers, frontline workers, and people aged 45 and above. The number has now increased to 720. These sites were set up primarily in hospitals and dispensaries.When the vaccine drive was opened for the 18-45 age group on May 3, the state government added another 368 sites. But these new centres were set up in public schools. “It was a challenging job because it had to be done at a time when the city was struggling for oxygen, ICUs, hospital beds, medicines. Making dedicated teams helped in this regard,” said a senior revenue department official, who did not wish to be identified.The decision to pick government schools to set up new centres was carefully thought out, and aimed to fight vaccine hesitancy, said officials.“In the first week of May, Delhi was in the middle of a severe surge of Covid-19 cases. People feared visiting hospitals. And the fear was natural because most hospitals had Covid-19 patients, which means a high chance of getting infected. So, for the 18-45 group, arrangements were made in schools. And that turned out to be a gamechanger,” said a senior health department official on condition of anonymity.Key to this success was the smooth experience of people in government centres.Arijit Sen, executive with an international audit firm based in Delhi, said: “Several of my friends went for their vaccination to the Delhi government centres and posted their pictures on social media. So, I went to a Delhi government centre to get my shot. The centres were neat and tidy. There was proper space to maintain distancing. They were organised. There was no fear at all.”Gahlot said over the last few weeks, the government’s efforts in allaying vaccine hesitancy have borne fruit.“We ensured that the service was impeccable. That is one reason why a large number of people across all social classes chose government sites for vaccination,” he said.But over the past two weeks, Delhi suffered an acute shortage of vaccines, forcing the city government to suspend 368 vaccine sites for the 18-45 group.Though 720 sites for the 45-plus group continue to function, they are out of Covaxin doses. The centres for the 45-plus have Covishield for 12 days, the government’s vaccine bulletin said on Thursday.“We have the resources and capacity to scale up vaccination, but we are out of vaccines, which forced us to shut down hundreds of vaccine sites. We hope the central government will intervene in this regard and resolve the problem by ensuring a stable supply of vaccines to Delhi. If there is no shortage of vaccines then we can ensure that the entire population of the city is vaccinated in 3 months,” said Gahlot.The Centre has repeatedly said it is doing everything possible to increase vaccine supply. “The central government is doing all the heavy-lifting, from funding vaccine manufacturers to giving them quick approvals to ramping up production to bringing foreign vaccines to India. Vaccines procured by the Centre are supplied wholly to the states... The government of India has merely enabled states to try procuring vaccines on their own, on their explicit requests,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, in a statement on Thursday.Despite the challenges, experts say that Delhi is headed in the right direction on vaccination. “Demand for vaccines has increased and that has translated into good turnout and high coverage at a time when the pandemic was raging. There are multiple factors. Vaccine hesitancy has reduced and the government has taken numerous initiatives in this regard. Then there is the fear factor. By early-March, a large number of people were convinced that Covid-19 had been left shattered. Delhi is headed in the right direction. It is still commendable that Delhi has been able to increase the vaccine coverage amid such a severe surge in cases,” said Dr Puneet Misra, professor at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi. “Around 70%-80% fully vaccinated people can lead to herd immunity,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pace-of-vaccine-drive-gives-city-hope-of-combating-next-wave-of-covid19-101622149127400.html

Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu alleged that the MC’s joint commissioner planning Ghulam Hassan Mir, who is also the head of the task force against illegal constructions and deals with building permissions, was involved in corruption. “The indefinite hunger strike by 61 elected representatives of Srinagar should serve as an eye-opener. An inefficient and corrupt joint commissioner planning is patronising illegal constructions and is defaming the MC,” Mattu said.Mattu, who is also an Apni Party leader, had written to the government on Saturday seeking removal of Mir and his repatriation to his parent department housing and urban development department (HUDD).“Ordinary citizens are being harassed as they are not getting permissions. This has been going on for over a year,” Mattu said.“Many illegal constructions are mushrooming in Srinagar because people are not getting permissions. leaving people with no other option,” he said. Mir threatens law suit Denying the allegations, Mir said he will file a defamation suit against Mattu after speaking to his lawyers. “I will file a ₹5 crore defamation suit against Mattu. He can stage a protest seeking a person’s transfer but he cannot resort to character assassination,” Mir said. “There are no political interventions in service guarantee issues such as building permissions, death and birth registrations. These are usual municipal services, which follow a defined process. The files move from level-to- level before being approved by the commissioner. We issue permissions once a person submits the fee,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alleging-corruption-srinagar-mayor-corporators-demand-removal-of-officer-101622147347381.html

The hospitals were checked for compliance of various safety norms, such as availability of proper ventilation, fire exit, fire-fighting equipment etc.While six hospitals --Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital, SPS Hospital and Pancham hospital -- were found to be complying with the norms, the rest were found with certain shortcomings following which the fire department issued compliance notices to these.Fire station officer Jaswinder Singh said, “Many of these hospitals had put in place some fire safety arrangements but those were not in keeping with the norms listed in the national building code. After inspections, the fire department issued notices to erring hospitals. The managements of these hospitals, in their reply, have assured us that the required fire-safety arrangements will be made in a week or so.”A fire official, requesting anonymity, said the civil hospital and other government hospitals in the city also have glaring anomalies with regards to fire safety but authorities are turning a blind eye to the issue.MC joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh said that after serving notices, a reminder was also sent to the hospitals on May 22 to comply with the fire safety norms. The report regarding the fire audit has also been forwarded to the DC office. Further action will be initiated as per the directions from DC office.As per officials, the state government had ordered the audit after fire incidents were reported in Covid hospitals of Gujarat, Maharashtra and other states recently. Several patients had also lost their lives in these tragedies. Principal secretary of local bodies department AK Sinha also reviewed the ongoing process on Tuesday. Hospitals take corrective stepsAfter the civic body issued notices, the managements of different hospitals jumped into action for taking corrective steps. Shree Raghunath Hospital society secretary Rajneesh Jain said the fire officials highlighted some issues related to installation of fire-fighting pipes in the hospital. A new vendor has been appointed by the hospital management for repairs and installation of pipes and work has already started, he said.Similarly, Dr Baldeep Singh of Deep Hospital said, “Proper arrangements have been done in the hospital.

At 84.27 per litre, diesel also reached the highest-ever price as prices were hiked for the 14th time since the beginning of May after remaining constant in March and April. Before 2021, the highest that the petrol price had gone was ₹81 per litre. When May began, petrol was priced ₹87 per litre. Fuel rates also spiked in neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula. Prices are highest in Mohali, at ₹95.86 for petrol and ₹87.52 for diesel. In Panchkula, these are higher than Chandigarh, at ₹91.33 per litre for petrol and ₹85 per litre for diesel.The price hike is hitting the petrol pump dealers hard. Proprietor of Kapoor Service Station in Sector 21, Colonel HS Kapoor (retd) said the commission earned by petrol pump dealers was still the same, while the rising price was going to the government as tax. “Worse, due to the lockdown, our sales this month are unlikely to reach even 50% of what we made in February,” he complained.Even as fuel continues to become more expensive, the price of fruits and vegetables in the city continues to remain on the lower side. Explaining this, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, BL Sharma said, “As the lockdown was enforced, we barely got any work. Drivers are happy completing deliveries at previous fuel rates even if we don’t end up earning as much as we should. A sharp increase in prices can be expected once the lockdown is lifted and the industry resumes at normal pace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/for-the-first-time-petrol-crosses-90-per-litre-mark-in-chandigarh-101622145664079.html

On the other hand, the deaths’ graph has been fluctuating without any major downturn.The decreasing cases are coupled with the positivity rate also winding downwards, even though the number of tests has come down from over 3,600 at the beginning of the week to around 2,600 now.Positivity rate – the proportion of samples that test positive – is a true indicator of the spread of an infection, be it growth or decline.“Though the demand for testing is decreasing, the receding positivity rate is encouraging. It reached 7.5% on Thursday after a long interval, as it was hovering around 28% in early May. But, maintaining the testing level is our priority,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta.The city’s cumulative cases have reached 59,416. With more people getting cured, the active cases went down to 3,129 and recoveries rose to 55,558.Covid wards at GMCH to be cut downWith decreasing pandemic numbers, the pressure on hospitals is also easing out as reflected in Government Medical College and Hospital’s decision to close some Covid wards in a gradual manner.“No new Covid patient will be sent to the hospital in Sector 48 unless all beds in the Covid wards and ICUs at the GMCH-32 campus are full. The Sector-32 campus will also keep 10 beds on standby for emergencies,” said Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for Covid-19 management at GMCH-32. He added that this way, initially one wing in the next few days and then the whole hospital at Sector 48 may be closed down in the next two weeks.“The facility will remain ready if needed on a short notice. The period of lesser occupancy will be utilised to prepare for the possible third wave of Covid,” he added.Slight rise in cases in Mohali, PanchkulaWhile Chandigarh recorded a dip in cases, Mohali and Panchkula’s numbers saw slight uptick on Thursday.Against 268 a day ago, Mohali’s cases rose to 278 on Thursday, while Panchkula saw the cases increasing from 103 to 114.However, these were still much lower than their respective peaks of 1,382 and 654 on May 10 and May 5.In some respite, Mohali’s daily deaths dropped from seven the day before to four, the lowest since April 19, when an equal number of fatalities was recorded.

The SIT had summoned 42 persons, who had given their statements to previous SIT in the case. However, only 25 of them appeared before the new SIT. Officials said even some persons, who were not summoned by the SIT, also gave their statements. The SIT headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav, along with other two members --- Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and Faridkot range DIG Surjit Singh --- reviewed the status of the probe so far.The Punjab and Haryana high court had on April 9 quashed all reports filed by the previous SIT headed by the inspector general of police (now retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in the case. The state government constituted the new three-member SIT that has been directed to complete the investigation within six months. On May 13, the Yadav-led SIT started the probe by recording the statements of cops injured in the incident, besides taking case records in possession from the local police station. The Yadav-led SIT is recording fresh statements of the witnesses because the high court observed in its order that Kunwar Vijay “manipulated” the statements. The SIT also made an appeal to people that any person who wants to give information or evidence related to the case can meet the probe team in person at the Faridkot circuit house on Friday, or contact on WhatsApp number (9875983237) and email id “newsit2021kotkapuracase@gmail.com”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-case-new-sit-camps-in-faridkot-records-witnesses-statements-101622144943119.html

A hoarding conveying the diktat has also been installed near the cremation ground here.The matter came to light when Karnail Singh, 58, a resident of Sahni village, had taken his wife’s body to the common cremation ground in Sahnewal Khurd on May 13 for her last rites. The village panchayat denied him permission to go ahead with the cremation following which the body was taken to Sahnewal in a tractor trailer.The panchayat, meanwhile, justified the diktat, stating that the decision was taken with a view to deter crime incidents. They claimed that allowing cremations without a check will encourage anti-social elements, who may try to cremate the bodies of their kin, friends or victims after murder incidents here.They also said that in some cases it was observed that proper procedure was not followed in cremation rituals carried out by tenants.Rajinder Singh, husband of Sarpanch Jasbir Kaur, said the panchayat has taken the decision as they found that some don’t follow the rituals. The tenants can cremate the bodies of their dead family members after their landlord takes the responsibility, he said.When contacted, Sahnewal station house officer sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said the panchayat has taken the decision unanimously and asked people to cremate the bodies only after informing the panchayat. “Some villagers have opposed the decision but we are trying to resolve the matter,” the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-village-deters-tenants-from-cremating-bodies-in-village-sans-permission-101622144822920.html

Now, the owners will be able to use the entire building of SCF/SCO as a commercial unit on payment of regularisation charges, which have been fixed at ₹5,500 per sq yard. Certain conditions, such as ensuring availability of parking space, have also been laid out for those seeking regularisation.The policy, dated May 26, has been floated for the entire state and applications can be submitted till September 30.A large number of SCFs have been illegally converted into SCOs and commercial units in different parts of the city, including Sarabha Nagar main market, Bhadaur house, BRS Nagar and Kitchlu Nagar among other areas. In the past, several complaints have been received by authorities against such violations, with many cases even reaching the court. The fresh policy is expected to bring relief to such violators.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said a state-level meeting was held in April under the chairmanship of local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra wherein the government decided to provide relief to SCF owners. In Punjab four local bodies -- Ludhiana, Amritsar, SAS Nagar and Jalandhar—are being seen as high potential zones while the rest have been categorised a low-potential zones. The regularisation fee in high potential zones has been fixed at ₹5,500 per sq yard, while it is ₹4,000 in low potential zones.The owners, however, cannot make any changes to the architectural design of the building.

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mattewara Industrial Park: Punjab chief secy told to take steps to protect Sutlej floodplains||A five-judge bench of the National Green Tribunal has ordered the Punjab chief secretary to take remedial actions for protection of the floodplains of Sutlej river in Ludhiana, in coordination with the River Rejuvenation Committee. Four social activists from the city- Kapil Arora, Kuldeep Khaira, Mohit Jain and Gagnish Singh Khurana, had moved NGT against the proposed amendment to the master plan of Ludhiana for developing a modern industrial park in the forest area and floodplains of Sutlej river in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.The state government had proposed to establish an industrial park over around 960 acres of government and panchayat land at villages including Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan. The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) has already acquired the land.The activists rued that the proposed industrial park site is surrounded by protected forests from two sides and deemed forests as well as Satluj river towards the third i.e. rear side. Apart from damaging the forest and disturbing the wildlife, an industrial park will also damage the river.“Since most of the land which is to be developed as an industrial park comes under floodplains of Sutluj, we have submitted references of the district survey report prepared by the Ludhiana district mining officer with the NGT. The tribunal further stated that River Rejuvenation Committees has already been formed in the states and Sutlej is among the 351 polluted rivers for which an action plans have been made,” said Arora.What is a flood plain?A floodplain is an area of land adjacent to a river which stretches from the banks of its channel to the base of the enclosing valley walls and experiences flooding during periods of high discharge.Khaira stated that the Punjab government had marked active flood plains as no manufacturing zones within an area of one kilometre from Dhusi Bandh along the entire stretch of Satluj passing through Ludhiana. He added that in the last two decades, there have been frequent incidents of major breaches in embankments (Dhusi Bandh) at Mattewara village, Garhi Fazal and its surrounding areas.Khaira added that the gazette notification for amendment has not come till date, but the land has already been transferred in the name of GLADA. Accordingly, GLADA has fixed the rates of land per acre and invited expression of interests from industrialists.Kapil stated that the NGT had observed that protection of forests is covered by the statutory mandate of the Forest (conservation) Act, 1980 and no non-forest activity is allowed in forest areas without statutory clearances. There is no reason to presume that the said mandate will be ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mattewara-industrial-park-punjab-chief-secy-told-to-take-steps-to-protect-sutlej-floodplains-101622144462753.html

All three were returning after paying obeisance at a peer dargah (saint’s tomb) when the assailants opened fire at them at Nadohar roundabout in Patti town at 6.45am, the police said. Fauji and Pooran died on the spot while Shera was rushed to a private hospital in Amritsar where his condition is stated to be stable, police said.Hours after the incident, a Facebook post from the account on one Ravi Dhaliwal, tagging 12 other users, including gangster Goli Kazikot, claimed that the killings were the handiwork of the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang. Bhagwanpuria is lodged in a jail. The victims were the supporters of the Bhagwan Kazikot gang, rival of the Goli Kazikot gang. Later, another FB post from Goli Kazikot’s account read that they don’t have anything to do with the killings. Another post from Preet Sekhon Amritsaria account read that Fauji was executed by their men, threatening that those against them will meet the same fate. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said they were analysing the Facebook posts claiming responsibilities for the killings. “Preet Sekhon is not linked to any gang but he is accused of killing a bouncer in Amritsar. Our teams are working to trace him,” the SSP said. He said Fauji was a gangster and had been facing five criminal cases, including two of attempt to murder. “As per our information, Fauji was also involved in drug smuggling. Similarly, Shera was facing a case under the NDPS Act, while Prabjit had no criminal background,” he said.The SSP said that a case was registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides Sections 25-54-59 of the Arms Act against unidentified persons at the Patti city police station.BoxFauji was party worker: SAD Later in the day, Shiromani Akali Dal leaders and workers along with the victims’ family members staged a protest in Patti city by keeping the bodies on the road. Former minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon’s political adviser Gurmukh Singh Ghulla said: “Fauji was our staunch worker. He was never convicted in any case. All the cases against him were politically motivated.” He alleged that Congress leader Harman Sekhon had been holding a grudge against Fauji. “He should be arrested and investigated. We doubt that the crime was executed at Harman’s behest,” alleged Gurmukh.Sekhon, who is the district president of the Youth Congress, was booked by Amritsar (rural) police for allegedly running liquor smuggling nexus in the Majha region of Punjab.The SSP said: “We will also probe Harman Sekhon’s role in the case. But, so far, we don’t have any evidence against him. Even the family members of the victims had not given their statements to the police despite our repeated requests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-accomplice-shot-dead-in-patti-101622144222623.html

Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (CCF) and in-charge of state forest research wing said they had been tracking the presence of these snakes in various parts of the state as part of this project.“Over a week ago, our research fellow Jyoti Prakash Joshi and another researcher Jigyasu Dolia spotted and captured the mating of King Cobras pair in forests of Nainital district on video. Though King Cobras have been sighted many times in the state, especially in Kumaon and their nests have also been found, this is for the first time that the state forest department has captured their mating on camera”, Sanjiv Chaturvedi said.In June 2018, the research advisory committee (RAC) of the forest department had approved the proposal on a five-year research project on King Cobras in the state. The research fellows named for the project work with the forest department’s field staff were mandated to study the King Cobra’s habitat, estimate their numbers, threats to their existence and conservation initiatives needed to save them.Even as King Cobras are mostly found in hot rain forests of South India and North East, researchers and scientists have recorded King Cobra nests and their sightings in Uttarakhand since the 1920s.Chaturvedi said in October 2012, a King nest was sighted at 2303 m elevation at Mukteshwar, which is the highest recorded elevation for the King Cobra in its worldwide range.“Over 132 sightings of King Cobra have been confirmed in Uttarakhand between 2015 to July 2020. In the last 5 years, they have been seen in 5 districts of the state, including Nainital (83), Dehradun (32 records), (12 records), Uttarkashi (3) and Haridwar (2)”, he said.Chaturvedi said the study will help them to form a conservation plan for this magnificent snake species in the Himalayan state, where it is facing similar threats faced by the wildlife.“For conservation of King Cobras, it is necessary to monitor their movement and involve local people in conservation initiatives by effective awareness-building efforts. This would develop an understanding of locals towards their conservation”, he said.Vipul Mourya, wildlife expert from Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) said given its reputation, King Cobras mainly face threat from people who consider it very dangerous.“Apart from that fragmentation of forests and increasing human presence in forests can also affect it in varied ways. Till now I haven’t come across any video of its mating in the state”, he said.AG Ansari, wildlife expert from Nainital, who has rescued many King Cobras said they were first reported in the state in 1920s and are mainly found in pine and oak forests of Nainital where they find humid conditions for their temperature-sensitive hatching of eggs.“Till now, I have not come across any video of its mating. This is likely the first such video and that makes it very interesting”, he said.Ansari said King Cobra is also on the target list of the poachers. “Till now it has been found in areas like Nainital, Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Rajaji National Park (RNP), Ramnagar and other forest divisions of the state”, he said.In India, King Cobra (Ophiophagus Hannah) is found in the Western Ghats, the Shivalik and Terai regions of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and the Andaman Islands. It is known to feed primarily on snakes including their own species. King Cobra is the national reptile of India and the only snake known to build nests. It is listed under Schedule II of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and as Vulnerable in IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The venom of the King Cobra consists primarily of neurotoxins, known as the Haditoxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/forest-research-team-captures-rare-video-of-king-cobra-mating-in-himalayas-101622143802730.html

The decision to lift the ban – imposed by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 2015 – was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Thursday.The government said that the decision was taken after the Amarnath Jha committee’s report, submitted on March 9, found that the ban had failed owing to the illicit sale of country-made and duplicate liquor in the district, which are dangerous to health. “The committee also found that the crime rate had increased in the district to 40,381 between 2015 and 2019 from the 16,132 cases recorded between 2010 and 2014,” stated a press release issued by the chief minister office.The committee was formed after the issue of illicit sale of liquor was raised in the state Assembly in July 2018. The then excise minister had assured to constitute a committee to give recommendations to the state government on the issue. Vijay Wadettiwar, state relief and rehabilitation minister and guardian minister of Chandrapur district, said, “The cabinet has decided to lift the ban considering its [the ban’s] adverse effects. The decision was taken after talking to all the stakeholders and following the recommendations of the committee.”Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and BJP legislator from Ballarpur Assembly constituency in Chandrapur, said that the state government has accepted its failure to curb illegal activities. “The government has cited the rise in the crime rate as its reason. If the state cannot stop the sale of illicit liquor and the related crimes, then how come they stop illegal dance bars, sand mafia, Maoists and terror activities,” said Mungantiwar.The demand for banning liquor in Chandrapur was made in late 2010. Of the 847 gram panchayats in Chandrapur, 588 had demanded prohibition. Around 5,000 working women went on a 130km-long march from Chimur to Nagpur during the winter session in 2010 demanding the ban on alcohol. Following this, a committee was set up, which recommended the ban in the interest of health of the residents of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-lifts-ban-on-liquor-sale-in-chandrapur-district-101622142901381.html

Of these, 5,264 patients were diagnosed with TB, and 96% of them were put on treatment.During the same period, 58,554 TB patients were tested for Covid-19, of which 571 (1%) of were diagnosed with Covid-19. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), TB and Covid-19 are both infectious diseases that primarily attack the lungs and have similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty in breathing.Last October, the central health department issued guidelines on ‘Bi-directional TB-Covid-19 screening and screening of TB among ILI and SARI cases’. Following this, all hospitals were instructed to test symptomatic patients with ILI, SARI and Covid-19 for TB. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of TB cases has gone down. In order to overrule any possibility of misdiagnosis or underreporting of TB cases, the Central government gave the instruction. If any patient goes unreported, they can spread the bacteria to many others,” said Dr Shilpa Jichkar, TB officer, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).According to the guidelines issued by the Centre, Covid-19 patients are instructed to be tested for TB if they have some specific symptoms — cough and persistent fever for more than two weeks, significant weight loss and night sweats. Other than running sputum tests, hospitals can conduct X-rays and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT).“Most of these co-infection cases have been identified in new TB patients. They approached hospitals considering they have Covid-19. But when their CT scan report showed different forms of clouding in lungs, their sputum culture confirmed that they were also carrying the bacteria of TB,” said Dr Lalit Anande, a TB specialist. Both these infections affect people with lower immunity,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/467k-patients-with-covid-19-respiratory-infections-screened-for-tb-in-maharashtra-101622142781279.html
28-05-2021||Other||41% fewer TB cases reported in April in Maharashtra amid second Covid-19 wave||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has once again hit tuberculosis (TB) treatment in the state. Data from the state health department shows that TB cases plunged by 41% in April as compared to those recorded in January. Health activists said that amid the pandemic, many cases remain undiagnosed or are not treated or appropriately notified on diagnosis.TB is an infection caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and spreads through air to another person when an infected person coughs, sneezes or laughs. In January, with the flattening of the pandemic curve, the number of TB notifications stood at 16,969. But with the start of the second wave in mid-February, the cases started to dive gradually. The total notification decreased to 15,610 in February, which further dropped to 15,436 in March. In April, when the state was clocking a daily surge in Covid-19 cases, individuals diagnosed with TB dropped to 10,036.“We are aware of the sizeable drop in the notification of TB cases. We have tied up with Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers who are reaching out to patients in rural parts of the state. We have also engaged with private set ups to follow-up on patients. This has helped reduce the dropout rate of patients compared to last year,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, Directorate of Health Services. The decline in cases is seen at the out-patient department (OPD) of civic and government-run hospitals. “TB patients with compromised lungs are the most susceptible to Covid-19 infection. In April, as the city started recording over 8,000 cases daily, many decided to stay indoors and delayed their follow-ups. A similar trend was observed last year,” Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean, JJ Hospital said, adding, “In fact, many preferred going to nearby private hospitals for diagnosis or check-ups.”However, data shows that registration of TB cases at private health establishments has also declined between January and April. In January, 9,797 cases were recorded at private hospitals, which dropped to 9,110 in February, and then to 8,596 in March and 5,346 in April. “As compared to last year, we are witnessing a fall in the number of TB cases. I believe that the second wave of the pandemic has overshadowed the diagnosis this year,” said Dr Behram Pardiwala, head of medicine department and director of academics, Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central.Many health activists fear that this trend would have a ripple effect on diagnosis in Maharashtra, which constitutes almost 9% of the total drug-sensitive TB patients in the country. In fact, as per data shared by the state health department, Maharashtra recorded 19% of the total MDR-TB cases in India in 2020.“TB is the biggest killer in the state, especially in Mumbai which has over 20 million population. While the situation was worst between May and July during the national lockdown last year, the numbers increased after easing of restrictions. But the second wave has slowed down the diagnosis once again,” said TB activist Ganesh Acharya. Before the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, the state used to record around 20,000 cases on an average every month. But thereafter in April, the notification dropped from 15,759 to 8,915 in the state. In May, it increased to 9,164, and then to 10,914 in the following month. In July, it dropped to 10,583, which plunged further to 9,531 the next month. However, since September 2020, with the relaxation of the lockdown, the number of notifications of TB patients started increasing gradually. In September, 11,538 cases were recorded, which rose to 13,095 in October, 13,322 in November and 20,212 in December.Despite the gradual surge in the registration of cases, the overall registration of TB cases has fallen by 29.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019, when a total of 227,000 cases were recorded. In 2020, 160,000 cases were recorded, which is the lowest in the past four years. (See box). In 2021, till April, only 59,000 cases have been recorded. “The most major side-effect of the pandemic was that people avoided visiting hospitals even when they needed to. We are seeing several patients with advanced diseases because they refrained from the necessary diagnostic evaluation,” said Dr Harshad Limaye, senior consultant, Internal Medicine at Nanavati Hospital.However, state TB officer Dr Adkekar said that Maharashtra would soon be able to revive the anti-TB programme to pre-Covid-19 levels and achieve the goal of a TB-free Maharashtra by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/41-fewer-tb-cases-reported-in-april-in-maharashtra-amid-second-covid-19-wave-101622142661342.html

The navy was quick to respond to the distress call and launched INS Kochi, a Kolkata-class guided missile destroyer, to conduct search and rescue (SAR) operations at Bombay High.But it was not long before the Navy received another distress call from another barge, Gal Constructor, which too saw its moorings break, leaving it adrift in the sea. The Navy moved INS Kolkata to respond to the situation.By the time INS Kochi reached the vicinity of P305, it was clear that the barge was taken by the water. The barge, which was being tossed and turned by the strong currents in the Arabian Sea, had hit a close-by rig which that punctured its hull. With the wind speed exceeding 110 kilometres per hour and the drift of the ocean moving towards the north, the barge was being carried further away from the oil fields, with INS Kochi monitoring the situation closely. By sunset, the barge was beginning to sink, and as the night had set in, the barge sank at 7pm. But INS Kochi had moved in close enough to carry out the SAR operation.“The warship’s speed is usually from 25-30 nautical miles per hour, but due to the stormy conditions, she was sailing at around 5-10 nautical miles per hour and for some distance, the speed went up to 15-18 nautical miles. We took more than five hours to reach near the site. We saw many survivors floating in the water in life jackets, but the wind was around 150km per hour and the height of the waves was around 10m. In this situation, controlling the ship at one place, sending divers, using scramble nets to pull out people from waves in zero visibility were very difficult or impossible,” said lieutenant commander Siddharth Chauhan, who was a part of the SAR team on INS Kochi.“So, the situation was assessed looking at the water current and wind direction, and teams were prepared accordingly with senior and junior officers and divers. The operation started at 8pm on May 17. We were using high-intensity searchlight, flares and LRAD speaker for announcement – which has a range of 1km – to find the survivors as they were drifting around 6 nautical miles per hour due to high waves and wind towards north, from the site where they jumped from the barge,” added lieutenant commander Chauhan.Accordingly, the ship captain, with the proper coordination with bridge crew members and saving teams on the deck, moved towards survivors and started rescuing them after maintaining the ship at a place. Within two-three hours, 36 people who were drifting around 10-12 nautical miles were first rescued. The scramble net was thrown into the sea and survivors were asked to hold the net. There was a group of 10 to 12 crew members standing on deck holding net ropes. Once one group of five to 10 people held the net, they pulled it up to the deck.Another group of 10-12 survivors were found about 30 nautical miles away from the barge at 2am on May 18. “After rescuing them, we increased our operation area and observed the wave and a third group of 40-43 people were found around 40 nautical miles away. They were picked up on the net in small groups and few were rescued by divers. We managed to rescue a total 124 people on INS Kochi till noon,” said lieutenant commander Akhilesh Sharma who was also on INS Kochi.The sea status was observed and checks and balances were made at every location where ships were operating and divers were rescuing people. “During SAR, first we have to ensure that there is no damage from our side. A team noted down the details of the survivors so that messages could be delivered to the people concerned. After rescuing them, we got a satisfaction that kept motivating us during the SAR operation, and none of us realised about the sea sickness developed due to the continuous work,” said lieutenant commander Sharma. The rescued people were in trauma, some of them suffered from moderate hypothermia and few had minor injuries. “Few also started to cry after reaching on the deck but were counselled by the other teams who were working with us with medical equipment, stretcher, clothes and food,” added lieutenant commander Chauhan. Master chief petty officer (MCPO) Mahavir Prasad, who was a seamanship instructor on INS Kolkata, said, “The waves were landing on the deck and due to high wind we could not dare to stand on it. There was zero visibility. First, our ship went to save the members of barge Gal Constructor which was carrying 137 people on board and was around about 48 nautical miles north of Colaba point. But there were an emergency towing vessel Water Lily, two support vessels and CGS Samrat in the vicinity for assistance and evacuation of the crew. So our ship was diverted for SAR P305. While we were on the way, we saw two people on a life raft. We picked them up a little before sunset and they informed us that they were on a tug boat named Varaprada. We reached late at night to the site where P305 had sunk but could not start the rescue operation due to darkness and the rough sea. The next day on May 18, we found five survivors till noon.” The survivors said that they did not have the strength even to hold a net as they were in the water for more than 12 hours. Six divers were inside the water who recovered nine dead bodies. “Sometimes, the bodies drift away with waves and we again put efforts to catch them and tie them with a rope so that another team could pull them up on deck,” said Anil Singh, a marine commando who was on INS Kolkata.There were around 60 divers working on both the ships INS Kolkata and INS Kochi. “This is the first time that we had rescued people and recovered bodies in such extreme weather conditions. It was horrific. People were lying on the sea in life jackets. We swam towards life jackets hoping that they might be alive but weren’t raising hands as they would have been tired. But after reaching there, we found them dead,” said another diver, Amit. HelicoptersSeaking 42 Bravo helicopter left from INS Shikra for the SAR operation early on May 18. Soon after, another helicopter – Seaking 42 Charlie – also flew to rescue the 137 members on board Gal Constructor. “Two pilots and two divers were in the team when we flew for Gal Constructor. The wind was more than 100km per hour. I held my helicopter at around 50 feet in air over the Gal Constructor site. It was a very dangerous and tough situation amid the high wind speed of around 150km per hour. Several wires of the crane on the barge were broken and hanging. The divers landed on the barge holding a rescue strap which used to tie crew members. Later, they were pulled up to the helicopter,” said lieutenant commander Raghvendra Kumar Dixit, who was on Seaking 42 Charlie.“We have never seen such a situation in the past. We rescued 25 people in one round and brought them to INS Shikra. Another helicopter rescued 14 more people while the rest were lifted by Coast Guard’s helicopters, lieutenant commander Dixit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barge-p305-sar-op-on-mumbai-high-was-toughest-in-recent-times-say-navy-teams-101622142601258.html

Hany was admitted following an order of the court on May 19 for treatment, after he had developed a severe infection in his left eye.The court, while restraining the hospital from discharging Babu till June 1, has also asked it to furnish a medical report on the status of the infection and the treatment administered to the professor. The vacation bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NR Borkar was hearing a petition seeking interim bail for Babu on medical grounds. Advocate Yug Choudhary, the counsel for the professor, informed the court that an urgent hearing was sought in the petition filed by Babu’s wife Jenny Rowena to ensure that Breach Candy hospital did not discharge her husband and send him back to Taloja jail on the grounds that he did not require critical care anymore. In the earlier hearing on May 19, Choudhary had submitted that Babu had contracted the eye infection, and though he had complained about it to the prison authorities from May 3- 12, it was not heeded. It was only after Babu tested positive for Covid-19 and shifted to GT Hospital did Rowena approach HC, as the hospital had said that it did not have the wherewithal to treat the professor’s eye infection. While the state had proposed to shift Babu to Sir JJ Hospital for treatment, Choudhary had submitted that due to the severity of the infection, there was an apprehension that he could lose vision in the left eye, and hence sought permission to shift him to a private hospital for treatment. The court had permitted shifting Babu to Breach Candy Hospital on an undertaking by his family that they would foot the expense for the treatment. On Wednesday when the court sought to know whether Babu’s eye infection was a case of mucormycosis, Choudhary submitted that the hospital had not informed the family about it. Observing that mucormycosis was dangerous and that there was a need to know whether Babu was getting proper treatment, the bench directed the hospital to submit a report on the treatment administered to him since his admission as well as on his current health condition. “The hospital shall submit an interim report on the medical treatment been given to Hany Babu by June 1. Till then, the hospital is requested not to discharge him. If they do then, this court should be informed and permission should be taken.” The bench also sought to know that if the private hospital had received the injections to treat mucormycosis, as they were being provided only at civic and state-run hospitalsThe petition will be heard next on June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-extends-prof-hany-babu-s-stay-in-private-hospital-till-june-1-101622142361916.html
28-05-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka tweaks Electric Vehicle policy to attract investment||Two key amendments to the Karnataka Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage Policy were approved by the state cabinet on Thursday to attract more investments, home minister Basavraj Bommai said.The cabinet decided to give 15% capital subsidy to investors in the electric vehicle (EV) sector on value of fixed assets over five equal annual payments, with maximum land covered under this incentive being 50 acres.“In 2017 itself there was a policy, but it needed some amendments. Since there is a lot of competition, some companies have gone to other states...to give more concessions,” Bommai said on Thursday, in an apparent reference to cab aggregators Ola, which decided to set up ₹2,400 crore EV manufacturing facility near Hosur in Tamil Nadu, despite being a Bengaluru-headquartered company.Bommai said Karnataka will offer incentives “at par with Tamil Nadu”.The second incentive is a production linked subsidy of 1% on turnover, which will be provided for a period of five years starting from the first year of commercial operations for large, mega, ultra, super mega EV assembly and manufacturing units, according to the cabinet decision.“A technical committee will be constituted to define/certify EV components including EV lithium-ion battery suppliers to EV manufacturing enterprises etc. claiming incentives and concessions under the new policy,” the government said.The amendments also include a clause to encourage in-plant training provided by the EV manufacturers in the state by offering a stipend up to 50% of the cost of training subject to a limit of ₹10,000 per month per trainee.Karnataka has also set aside around 400 acres to set up an EV park near Bidadi, near Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-tweaks-ev-policy-to-attract-investment-101622142001614.html
28-05-2021||Other||Replacing BSY may change political discourse: Experts||Bengaluru As the clamour against Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa grows louder, it remains to be seen if it does actually materialise in a leadership change in the state before the 2023 assembly elections. According to analysts and experts, if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre does manage to replace 78-year-old Yediyurappa, it will bring about a major shift in Karnataka’s political discourse, which thrives on caste equations, coalition building and other local factors that have allowed the likes of Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah, HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy prevail with their signature style of politics for the last two decades, if not longer. The BJP at the Centre is trying to achieve a smooth shift in power, which, analysts and experts believe, would not be easy. An expert said Yediyurappa in 2013 assembly elections had shown that he could sabotage the saffron outfit’s chances. After Yediyurappa’s departure, the BJP’s tally in the state had reduced to 40 in 2013 from 110 in 2008 assembly elections for 224-seat House, when Yediyurappa led the party. According to experts, Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and Kumaraswamy have effectively curbed the cropping up of any new faces as possible ‘heirs’ or ‘replacements’ in their respective parties. They firmly held the reins of their parties while creating a dearth of alternatives, experts said. Interestingly, unlike neighbouring Tamil Nadu, where the two late chief ministers and stalwarts – J Jayalalithaa and MK Karunanidhi – shared strong animosities, the top leaders in Karnataka – Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and Kumaraswamy – seem to get along fine irrespective of the parties they represent. CP Yogeshwara, Karnataka’s minister for tourism, ecology and environment, on Thursday said, “The day I became an MLC (member of legislative council) I also said it does not appear as a pure BJP government. It appears to be a three-party government that is taking shape.” His statement points at how the three leaders from three different parties continue to enjoy a good rapport, irrespective of who is in power – an allegation made by several other legislators and leaders within the BJP. BJP legislators, especially those who identify dearly with the party’s ideology, have made similar allegations that opposition MLAs have it much easier in the current dispensation, including getting funds released and work for their respective constituencies. “We would have been better off if we were not from the ruling party,” a first-time MLA told HT in a recent interaction. In 2013, many believed that Yediyurappa helped in fulfilling Siddaramaiah’s aspirations to become the chief minister by orchestrating the defeat of G Parameshwara of the Congress, a political analyst, who did not wish to be named, said. Unlike the current central dispensation led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Karnataka’s political culture has largely relied on local equations. “In Karnataka, it has become politics of extreme decentralisation,” said a Bengaluru-based political analyst, demonstrating how every legislator wields influence over their respective constituencies, irrespective of the party symbol they fight under. The analyst, requesting not to be named, did not rule out the possibility that the current dissent could well be an effort to deflect the attention away from the management – or the lack of it – of the Covid-19 pandemic in Karnataka. The 17 turncoats who helped Yediyurappa to power in 2019 are not known to have any strong connection with the BJP’s ideology, party insiders said, adding that there was enough room for them to return to their parent outfits with the confidence of retaining their constituencies. Karnataka over the years has shuffled between Lingayats and Vokkaligas, the two most dominant caste groups in the state, for the top post. Projecting Pralhad Joshi, a Brahmin, as a possible alternative, analysts said, was indicative that the BJP was trying to consolidate its vote bank using the Hindutva card and not pandering to any particular community. “The BJP is known to spring surprises,” said a north Karnataka-based political analyst, requesting anonymity. He referred to the high command’s apparent ignoring of Yediyurappa’s recommendations for the nominations to Rajya Sabha and the state legislative council. “When the leadership is dominant, political parties tend to forget their relationship with others,” the analyst said, referring to the central leadership of the BJP. The BJP is known to have strong ties with the Janata Dal (Secular) in Old Mysuru region where the former helps the latter to keep the Congress, which the two sides believe to be the common enemy, at bay. The JD(S), led by Gowda and former CM Kumaraswamy, has allied with both the Congress and the BJP in the past and is the only major player in the state with the ability to reign over the other despite not measuring up in terms of numbers. A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University, said it all depends on who the BJP chooses next. “If they (BJP central leadership) choose a Lingayat leader, the kind of coalition that Yediyurappa has had so far, it is possible for the new leader to build as well depending on how the new person communicates with this constituency (Lingayats). It is not an impossible task, but it depends on whom they choose,” he said. Meanwhile, Yogeshwara flanked by another BJP legislator Arvind Bellad visited New Delhi on Tuesday, fuelling speculations that the two had tried to meet central leaders to complain against the chief minister’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders might not have the stature to prompt a change in leadership but, according to analysts, their act to reach out to Delhi is being interpreted as a sign of growing dissent within the BJP in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/replacing-bsy-may-change-political-discourse-experts-101622141881087.html
28-05-2021||Other||HC seeks govt reply on oxygen supply issues||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Thursday asked the state government to file an affidavit by Monday on the difficulties in securing oxygen from outside the state. The bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar gave the direction while hearing the petition on the state’s preparedness to battle Covid-19. The HC also asked the government to make its stand clear on whether it is willing to pass an order restraining private hospitals from administering the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. While hearing the matter on oxygen supply, the bench asked the state how it plans to procure the 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen allotted by the government. “Out of 1200 metric tonnes allocation, 370 metric tonnes are allocated from places outside state. From the figures given it is apparent that except for May 27, the state has not received the entire quota allotted,” said the bench. We, therefore, direct the state to file an affidavit by Monday, setting out the difficulty if any for securing the quota of oxygen from outside the state. If the state is facing any difficulty it should approach the Centre immediately,” the bench added. It added that the state should answer three pertinent questions - whether you are able to procure oxygen from other states, in the wake of the third wave has the state fixed the buffer capacity for oxygen and whether the storage capacity for oxygen has been fixed. The high court asked the state government to make its stand clear on whether it is willing to pass an order restraining private hospitals from administering the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Continuing the hearing on the vaccine supply, the bench passed an order saying 50% of vaccines will be provided by the Centre to state for free, while out of the remaining 50%, the state can place orders for 25% directly and they can be supplied free of cost. The remaining 25% is for private players to book directly from suppliers or manufacturers, said the bench. “Considering the requirement on the second dose, the quantity which state will have on June 1 will be barely sufficient to meet the requirement of the second dose,” said the bench. Hearing the matter on Wednesday, the bench had asked the advocate-general to look into the matter after the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (Phana) informed the court that they are giving the vaccine to all those who are registering on their portal. The court was also informed the central government that 16,66,000 doses have been given to private hospitals in Karnataka. The court wondered how private hospitals can be allowed to procure more vaccines than the state government, which has placed orders for 15,98,000 doses. The bench said both the state and central governments have to take a policy decision on diverting people to private hospitals for getting the first dose. Phana said the state government can regulate the situation by passing an order against administering the first dose, instead of issuing an advisory, as has been done now. The high court had said it is an obligation of governments to ensure the second dose is provided and failure to do so will be a violation of fundamental rights. The court was told that there is a huge demand for vaccines in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-oxygen-supply-issues-101622141821079.html
28-05-2021||Other||Petrol prices cross ₹100-mark in Thane and Navi Mumbai||The price of petrol crossed the ₹100-mark in Thane and Navi Mumbai on Thursday, even as it is on the brink of touching the three-digit figure in Mumbai. At Thane, one litre of petrol was available for ₹100.06, while in Navi Mumbai, it was priced at ₹100.03. The cost of one litre of diesel was ₹91.99 and ₹92.07 in Thane and Navi Mumbai. In Mumbai, petrol price had reached an all-time high of ₹99.94, while one litre of diesel was available at ₹91.87. This was a surge by 23 paise and 30 paise, respectively, as petrol and diesel were priced at ₹99.71 and ₹91.57, respectively, in the city on Wednesday. Expressing financial constraints, citizens have urged the government to lower taxes on petroleum products. “I travel on my two-wheeler almost everyday. The fuel prices have been increasing constantly throughout this month. It looks as if the government just does not care about the citizens. Train services are also suspended for the general public. Due to lockdown people are already burdened financially. What does one do?” said Byculla resident Aadi Jain. Ghatkopar resident Aarti Singh said, “There is a risk of contracting Covid-19 if I travel by bus as local trains are suspended. So I use my car frequently to commute. The constant increase in fuel prices is stretching people to the extreme. The government should immediately decrease the taxes on petrol and diesel.” Mobile cab aggregator drivers stated that with the increase in fuel prices, it is getting difficult to operate. “Fuel is becoming very expensive and it is getting difficult to survive in the market. We receive ₹5.40 for fuel per km, which is very less as compared to the constant hike in fuel prices,” said Vijay N, who works as a driver for app-based cabs. Transporters’ body said that the hike in fuel prices will lead to unemployment in the transport industry. “We have been regularly requesting the Centre and the state government to reduce the excise duty and value-added tax (VAT) on petroleum products. However, there has been no impact. This is open loot going by the government. The constant increase will lead to unemployment in the transport industry as people are already suffering due to the pandemic,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra’s minority affairs minister Nawab Malik on Thursday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the hike in petrol and diesel prices. “In 2015, Pradhan Sevak said that ‘It’ll be good if with my luck, the prices of petrol decrease. In 2021, petrol has crossed ₹100. whose luck is it now?

28-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to extend lockdown, but with some relaxations||Maharashtra recorded 21,273 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday, even as the state government decided to extend the current lockdown, in view of the rapid rise in infections in more than a dozen districts. The state, however, will provide a few relaxations — it may extend the restricted time limit of four hours for buying essential commodities and may also allow opening of shops that will become essential during the monsoon. The decision is likely to be taken in the next two days, officials said. The current state-wide lockdown, which was imposed on April 22, is ending on June 1 at 7am. The issue of extending the lockdown was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Thursday. Currently, citizens of the sate can’t step out unless they need medical attention, or are working in an essential sector, or want to buy essential commodities. That too within restricted timings — between 7am and 11am. State health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no chance of lifting the lockdown as there are many districts where cases are on the rise. The state government can provide some relaxation in the restrictions, which will be decided by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after having deliberations with the state task force, he added. A statement issued by the chief minister office (CMO) stated, “Though the positivity rate of the state is coming down, 10 to15 districts are reporting rapid growth in Covid-19 cases. There is also a rise in cases of mucormycosis. Active cases of the state have dropped to the tally of highest cases recorded during the first wave. But we still need to be careful. Instead of completely lifting the lockdown, we will have to extend it from June 1 and also provide relaxations in the restrictions wherever necessary. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the state administration to take steps accordingly after discussing the same in the state cabinet meeting held on Thursday.” “The positivity rate of 21 districts is higher than the average positivity rate of the state. It means they have more patients, which also means their beds occupancy is higher than others and both are part of the two major norms being considered before imposing lockdown. This means lockdown cannot be lifted completely. It has to be continued but with some relaxation. We may provide more time for buying essentials and allowing a few types of shops to function in the same limited period along with the establishments related to essential commodities,”Tope said. “The detailed discussion on relaxation could not be held today. The chief minister will also have deliberations with the state task force and take a decision in the next two days,” he added. The weekly average positivity rate of Maharashtra is 0.47 percent. The districts with high weekly average positivity rate include Sindhudurga, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Buldhana, Satara, Sangli, Osmanabad, Amravati and Beed. “Going by today’s situation, it is very difficult for the state to significantly ease down restrictions. The Chief minister is also not very comfortable with the idea. Thus, ‘Mission Begin Again’ is likely to start from June 1, but to a very limited extent. We may extend restricted timings of four to six or seven hours for the people to step out for buying essentials and may also allow shops that become essential during the rainy season,” said a senior official privy to the development. Dr Amin Kaba, who is associated with various top hospitals in Mumbai, said the Government is the best decider in these matters. “This the decision best left to the Government as they are very well aware of the ground realities. At the same time, the vaccination drive should be sped up as this will have a big impact in lowering the cases as well as the death rate,” said Dr Kaba. There were 21,273 new cases on Thursday with the total number of cases reaching to 5,672,180 since the outbreak of the virus last year. There were 2,61,151 tests conducted on Thursday. There are currently 301,041 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 43,869 patients, followed by Mumbai with 28,683 active patients. The death toll has now reached 92,225 with Mumbai leading with 14,720 deaths, followed by Pune with 12,112.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-extend-lockdown-but-with-some-relaxations-101622141222422.html

After committing the gruesome crime on Tuesday, the accused, identified as Pappu, 34, had fled to neighbouring Laksar town of Uttarakhand from where police arrested him. Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Yadav said during interrogation Pappu said he committed the crime for he suspected his wife, Dolly, 29, of having illicit relations and for refusing to have physical relations with him. “He said he shot his wife on the head as she denied physical relations with him which led him to believe that the woman was having illicit relations,” SSP said. The divers have fished out the body of one child so far, said superintendent of police (SP) Muzaffarnagar, Vijayvargiya. “PAC divers found body of one child in the deep waters of canal and search was underway to recover two more children,” the SP said. Police said the three kids included a five-year-old, another 3 years old and an 18-month-old child. During interrogation, the accused told officials that he threw kids as he knew there was none to take care of them. “He said he was worried as to who would take care of them after he is arrested,” police said. A case of murder has been registered against Pappu in Purkaji police station on the complaint of a family member. Dolly was Pappu’s elder brother’s wife whom he had married after the death of his elder brother 10 years ago. The couple had two daughters and a son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-arrested-for-killing-wife-throwing-3-kids-in-canal-101622140921512.html

Singh expressed these views at a webinar organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “The state government is making an all-out effort to check the spread of the pandemic. In March last year, the Covid testing capacity of the state was only 70 cases a day. It has now increased to over 3.59 lakh a day,” the minister added.“The virus is mutating into new variants and affecting several parts of the body.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mayank Somani, MD and CEO, Apollomedics Super Speciality Hospital, gave suggestions on how we can prepare for the third wave of the pandemic. “We require adequate medicine and oxygen, adequate equipment and infrastructure, surplus isolation centres, pandemic support centres and a robust primary healthcare system,” he said. “We need to augment testing and diagnostic facilities beforehand, training of paramedics, robust supply chain, skilled manpower. These must be more research and development in medical field and focus of vaccination and treatment in situations like the current pandemic,” Dr Somani said. Dr Rakesh Kapoor, director, Medanta Hospital, Lucknow, said: “Imparting training to people is very crucial as it will train general people to handle emergencies like putting oxygen cylinders and operating oxygen Concentrators among other medical equipment.” Lalit Khaitan, chairman, UP chapter of PHD Chamber, suggested that primary health care system must be recognised as a vital contributor to all aspects of emergencies.

Presently, Prayagraj has two electric crematoriums at Daraganj and at Teliyarganj.Of the seven new crematoriums, the one at Shringverpur, for which land too has been identified, is especially important as it is from here that images of dead bodies being buried along the banks of the Ganga had stoked controversy.The district administration had claimed that this was due to an old tradition practiced by locals living in the vicinity while opposition parties claimed it was due to locals, hit by the pandemic, being unable to afford cost of wood cremations.Officials said the practice of burying dead bodies is against the norms laid down by National Green Tribunal (NGT) and said the district administration has now decided to make the locals aware of the ill-effects of the practice. They said an electric crematorium at Shringverpur would help check the practice of burying bodies. A revenue department team has identified 4 biswa (around 500 square meters) of land at Shringverpur. A proposal is being prepared and the same would be sent to the District Magistrate on behalf of the Panchayati Raj department, officials said.The paperwork is being through SDM Soraon Anil Chaturvedi, officials aware of the move said. “We are preparing proposal for constructing an electric crematorium at Shringverpur and the same would be submitted in couple of days. Once the approval is granted, we would move ahead with the construction work,” said district panchayati raj officer (DPRO), Renu Srivastava. Decision at virtual meetingPRAYAGRAJ: The Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) held a virtual meeting last week in which it was initially decided to have four electric crematoriums within municipal limits. Later, two additional crematoriums, one at Phaphamau and another at Chatnag (Jhunsi), were included. Thus, six new electric crematoriums have been sanctioned for Prayagraj municipal limits.PNN officials have identified land for electric crematorium at Chatnag and land for electric crematorium near Kanhaipur cremation Ghat is also being located. PNN had earlier proposed crematoriums at Kanahiipur, Kerala Bagh, Arail and Mahewa. PNN PRO and chief tax officer, PK Mishra said, “PNN is working on the mission to get six additional electric crematoriums set up within the municipal limits and the land for one at Chatnag is nearly finalised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/electric-crematorium-at-shringverpur-6-other-places-at-prayagraj-101622140800838.html

28-05-2021||Mumbai||New Maharashtra policy gives push to electric vehicles||In a fillip to electric transportation in the state, the Maharashtra government on Thursday revealed its Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy 2021, as part of which electric vehicles are aimed to comprise 10% of all new vehicle registrations by 2025. The draft policy is currently awaiting a final nod from the state cabinet. The policy also aims substitute all government vehicles in major cities with EVs, starting April 2022, officials privy to the developments said.The details were revealed during a webinar organised by the state environment department’s Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan along with Climate Voices — a consortium of three advocacy groups working pan-India, on Thursday.Ashish Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (transport), Maharashtra, and head of the committee responsible for drafting the policy, said, “Today Maharashtra’s share of the country’s (electric) vehicle registrations is around 12% (32,000) but the size is still not large enough to excite manufacturers. We are keen on taking advantage of the schemes by the Government of India. Maharashtra is the leading manufacturer of internal combustion engines, and our EV Policy aims to make it a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles as well.”As per officials, the new policy has distinct goals for five major urban agglomerations in the state, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Aurangabad, Pune, Nagpur, and Nashik. One of the major goals is to convert around 25% of the existing public transport infrastructure (and last-mile delivery vehicles) in these cities to fully electric mode by 2025. Another ambitious objective that the draft policy has proposed is conversion of 15% of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s existing bus fleet (of 18,000 vehicles) to electric mode during the same time. “We also intend on providing full-scale EV infrastructure on four major arterial highways by 2025, namely Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, Mumbai-Pune Express Highway, Mumbai-Nashik, and Nashik-Pune,” said Dr Avinash Dhakne, transport commissioner, Maharashtra. Additionally 1,500 EV charging stations in MMR, 500 in Pune, 150 in Nagpur, 100 in Nashik and 75 in Aurangabad have been proposed, he added.Incidentally, this is not the first EV transportation policy of the state. Maharashtra had earlier adopted an EV policy in February 2018 which was drafted by the state department of industries. “However, that policy had focused largely on attracting investment and providing incentives, which was not enough. We are aiming to rely on infrastructure creation which is the main catalyst for companies to enter the market,” Dhakne explained.In order to offset the ecological footprint of electric mobility — which requires large scale manufacture and use of lithium ion batteries — the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), under the aegis of the environment department, is also developing a parallel policy of its own. “We are drafting rules on recycling lithium ion batteries and other electronic waste that is likely to be generated due to boom in EV infrastructure,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.Ashwin Mahesh, a city planning expert and founder of Project Lithium — hailed as India’s first zero emissions transport service which is headquatered in Bangalore, at Thursday’s webinar said, “At this early stage of development of EV sector, it is important for companies, that innovate early and correctly, to not only pursue their own success but also accept broader responsibility for the development of the ecosystem around them. Only this will ensure accelerated development of various possibilities within e-mobility.” Madhav Pai, director, WRI India Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities, who hosted Thursday’s expert panel, emphasised that Maharashtra needs to capitalise on this rare opportunity mostly through creation of domestic demand, and not just developing industrial capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-maharashtra-policy-gives-push-to-electric-vehicles-101622140742129.html
28-05-2021||Noida||21-year-old sanitation worker dies while cleaning sewer in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: A 21-year old working as a sanitation employee, working under a private contractor of the Greater Noida authority, was killed Thursday after stepping into a sewer to clean it.According to officials, the victim, Krishna (identified by a single name), who lived in Gharbara village of Greater Noida, was sent inside a sewage line in Surajpur area allegedly without any gear or safety equipment.When Krishna didn’t respond for some time, a fire brigade was called to rescue him. A firefighter went down the sewer wearing breathing apparatus to retrieve the victim tied to a rope in a 40 minute-long operation. The victim was soon rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead, the police said.“The sewer was very narrow and about 30 to 40 feet deep and it took around 40 minutes for our personnel to rescue the unconscious man, who seemed to have some life in him at that time. The victim was wearing no gear or safety equipment; he was wearing only shorts and a vest. He was rushed to the nearest hospital. There are poisonous gases in the sewer that make it very unsafe to work without any gear; even our personnel had to wear breathing apparatus before going in,” said Jitendra Kumar, fire station officer, Greater Noida.The police later registered an FIR under Section 304 of the IPC against Neeraj Bhati, the authority’s contractor and Jai Prakash, the site incharge.“The victim was soon rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. He must have suffocated as they are poisonous gases, especially in summers, down the gutter. He was sent down to clean their line manually to reinstate the flow without any safety equipment. We have registered an FIR against the private contractor and the site in charge, and are waiting for the post-mortem report,” said Ajay Kumar, SHO, Surajpur.Manual scavenging - that accounts for manually cleaning sewers, septic tanks and others - is banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. Officials at the authority, meanwhile, said that they have ordered an enquiry into the matter.“We had earlier made it very clear that no worker would be sent down the pit without safety gear. We had also provided all protective gear and oxygen masks however, in this case, it seems the directions were violated. We have ordered an enquiry and it seems that a private contractor with the Greater Noida authority is responsible. The concerned official has filed an FIR. However, the act does not amount to manual scavenging,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO, Greater Noida authority. However, activists differed. “This is a clear case of manual scavenging. An act that accounts to anyone manually cleaning sewer or septic tank that has human excreta in it accounts for manual scavenging and is prohibited, but unfortunately there is very less awareness on it and it continues across India, including in the national capital,” said Bezwada Wilson, the national convener of Safai Karamchari Aandolan — a human rights organisation campaigning for eradication of manual scavenging. A total of 340 people had died due to cleaning sewers in the past five years till December 31, 2020 of which Uttar Pradesh, at 52, accounts for the highest number of deaths, Ramdas Athawale, the minister of state for social justice and empowerment, had informed the parliament in February 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/21yearold-sanitation-worker-dies-while-cleaning-sewer-in-greater-noida-101622140740790.html

But the CFR has now gone up to 0.69% in nearly two months, with 343 deaths and 36,018 new cases till Thursday, according to data from the state health department.However, with 59,373 recoveries out of total 62,118 Covid-19 cases till Thursday, the recovery rate in the district has now gone to 95.44%, the data showed. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that it was really a tough time after March as the number of deaths and new cases suddenly went up. “There was an ultimate crunch of oxygen and remdesivir for a day or two. We were also worried about ICU beds in the hospitals. But, we streamlined the entire thing soon. Now, the new cases are continuously going down. We want to reduce the number of deaths to a negligible level,” he said. On Thursday, GB Nagar reported 133 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of active cases to 2,310 in the district. It also recorded six deaths due to the viral infection, according to the state’s daily health bulletin.Claiming that the second wave of Covid-19 infection is coming under control, the DM also said that the district’s health infrastructure is being ramped up, with focus on children in order to deal with a possible third wave of the pandemic. “At present, our main focus is on rural areas. We’ve been carrying out a house-to-house survey of all villages and urban areas in the district. So far, we’ve tested 11,45,726 samples in the district, which is almost half of its population,” he said. Dr Deepak Ohri, GB Nagar chief medical officer, said that apart from conducting massive testing in different villages, the vaccination drive is also going in full swing in the district. “Till date, over 5.35 lakh people from different age groups have received their jabs in the district. Nearly one lakh of them have taken their second shot also,” he said. The CMO also said that 13 new vaccination centres, for the age group of 18 to 45 years, will start from Friday. “To get the vaccine, a beneficiary will have to be registered on Co-WIN app. After that, the slots will be allotted. The vaccination will take place from 10am to 5pm,” he said.On Thursday, the district had a total of 81 vaccination centres, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-fatality-rate-doubled-in-second-wave-in-gb-nagar-101622140681506.html
28-05-2021||Noida||Non-Covid patients in Noida suffer from delayed treatments||Kaushambi resident Vijay Prakash Mathur, 77, was scheduled for a brain tumour removal surgery in April this year. But when three members of his family contracted Covid-19, it was postponed.It took a month for the family to recover from the viral disease, but by then, the tumour had grown.On May 21, Mathur became unresponsive and had to be admitted to an ICU with a ventilator.“Doctors now say the surgery is no longer an option. Had he been operated on in April itself, this wouldn’t have happened. Now, his survival chances are slim,” said Abhimanyu, his son.The pandemic, especially its second wave from April, has forced many non-Covid patients to postpone their treatment owing to the fear of catching the disease. CancerSome of these treatments include chemotherapy for cancer.“Patients do not want to step into a hospital. Yes, there are some cases where Covid cases in the family have also led to delaying of medical procedures. In such a situation, diseases such as cancer can progress after which the treatment and procedures become complicated,” said Dr Shubham Garg, senior consultant, surgical oncology at Fortis Hospital, Noida. The doctor consults 30-35 cancer patients every week. Dr. Arun Goel, senior director of oncology, Max Super Speciality Hospital in Vaishali, said that he advisedhis patients not to be afraid of coming to the hospital as the Covid wards were separate from the cancer wards. “I tell them that the risk of delaying procedure like a chemotherapy will be harmful. However for some patients, there was no other option as their caregivers got Covid-19 so they could come for their scheduled session,” he said. DialysisPatients who require a dialysis two to three times a week have also cut down on their visits. “Many of our patients are from other districts as well. But the lockdown has been a deterrent. If patients do not take dialysis on time, it can lead to several complications like heavy breathing, nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite,” said Dr Puneet Gupta, head of nephrology at Sharda Hospital, Greater Noida. He added that currently the hospital conducts dialysis for 200 patients a month and also has 50-60 Covid patients requiring dialysis.The curfew in Uttar Pradesh, in force from April 30, excludes patients who require critical care but the overarching fear of contracting the disease has overridden some of them. At Max Hospital, Dr Manoj K. Singhal, senior director of nephrology and kidney transplantation, recalls the case of one such patient. “He was 60 years old and required dialysis thrice a week as his kidneys had failed. He reduced it to one to two sessions a week against our advice. Within three weeks, his condition worsened, and he suddenly developed shortness of breath. As it was a peak Covid surge time, we could not arrange a bed for him in the emergency and he eventually passed away,” he said.The unprecedented rise in the number of Covid patients has overburdened city hospitals. Most government and private hospitals in GB Nagar have been converted to Covid facilities.“We are going ahead with the emergency surgeries but have asked patients seeking elective surgeries to delay. For some like dialysis, we are advising home-based setups, but a delay in critical cases like kidney ailment or cancer cases may lead to steady worsening of the condition or even death,” said Dr. Deepak Verma, Internal Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad.Among babiesDr Dheeraj Sharma, associate professor (paediatric cardiac surgery at SSPHPGTI) said congenital heart disease require surgery within six months to a year of birth. “This golden period too has been missed,” he said. “Last year we were supposed to operate on 105 babies. But the pandemic and the lockdown got in the way of many. By November, when we contacted these families, it turned out that some of these children had passed away.”Even regular vaccinations have been affected.“Hepatitis B1, Hepatitis B2, Haemophilus Influenzae Type B vaccinations that are required to be given within a year of birth. Not giving these will expose the child to these diseases and severely affect them and shorten their lives,” said Dr DK Gupta, CMD, Felix Hospital, Noida .Blood donationsBlood banks ran dry during the period cutting off supply to hospitals that required them for emergency surgeries or for those patients who required routine blood transfusions.“Usually, blood banks have enough stock as people donate every now and then and we keep holding blood donation camps as well. Blood is required often for surgeries, for pregnant women and new-borns as well. Thalassemia, leukaemia and aplastic anaemia patients also require regular blood transfusions. We tried to help, but many times we had to ask the patients to arrange a blood donor from their family,” said Dr Satyam Arora, associate professor (transfusion medicine) at Superspeciality Paediatric Hospital & Postgraduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), Noida. He added that the hospital had over 100 thalassemia patients a month.HIVHIV patients have to get a monthly anti-retroviral therapy (ART) kit from their registered centres to keep their immunity up. Since the pandemic, these centres have been providing three months’ kits to their patients.“This is so that HIV patients do not have to come to the centre every month. As their immune system is compromised, they are more susceptible to the coronavirus,” said Dr Sheel Varma, medical officer at one such centre at MMG District Hospital, Ghaziabad.Home health care The fear has pushed people suffering from various ailments to opt for home health care services instead of going to hospitals for treatment.“We have seen a rise of 70% for homecare facilities such as tele-medicine, tele-consultation, X-ray, sample collection and physiotherapy. We have also seen an increasing trend of 40% enhanced demand of our home critical care services as many non-Covid patients wanted an ICU set up at home and treated there,” said Dr Shabnam Mir, Consultant Physician and Head of Clinical Services at Antara, a Max Group company specializing in senior care.District authorities, meanwhile, said patients need not worry. “Non-covid patients should not delay treatment over Covid worries. At hospitals that treat both Covid and non-Covid patients, separate arrangements like designated floors, entries and exits are made, so chances of contracting the virus are minimised,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, GB Nagar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noncovid-patients-in-noida-suffer-from-delayed-treatments-101622140680867.html

Kaul is one of the 13 patients who are admitted at the temporary 50-bed facility launched by the Noida authority on May 8.From starting their day with Yoga to ending it with games and TV, patients at this facility say they don’t miss home. The facility is run by 80 health care staff, including 23 doctors from Delhi-based NGO Doctors For You, who also hold motivational talks and counselling sessions for the patients.“I start my day here with Yoga and after resting through the day, I play indoor games like carrom, chess or ludo with the other patients, who have now become my friends. Not just the patients, but the staff also do not let us miss our home as they feel like family,” said Kaul, who used to work in the hospitality industry before retiring. He was admitted to the facility on May 11.He added that counselling and motivational talks have helped him keep a positive outlook towards life. “The doctors keep all patients mentally strong and keep telling us of cases where patients recovered; that makes us feel that we can fight this virus too,” said Kaul.The youngest patient at the facility is five-year-old Yashraj Mukherjee, who has become a favourite among all health care staff there.“Everyone here loves Yashraj and spends time playing with him whenever they are on their routine rounds. Yashraj is busy throughout the day playing carom, ludo or darts. He tested negative a few days back but since I and my husband are still recovering, all of us have to stay here longer as I do not have any one else back home to take care of him,” said his mother Sanchari Joydeep Mukherjee, a resident of Sector 46 who was admitted on May 11 with her husband and son.The 43-year-old was earlier admitted to the Noida Covid Hospital in Sector 39 on May 7 in the emergency wing and later her husband and son were admitted there as well. Once their condition stabilised, they were admitted to the facility on May 11.“When we came here, we were not in the right state of mind but the staff here has helped us keep our morale high. I was worried about my son but he stays entertained throughout the day playing games with other patients and staff. The kindness and empathy shown to all patients has made us realise that we can fight any battle with positive thinking,” she added.Since it was opened, the L1 facility has had 64 admissions of Covid patients. Currently the centre has 13 patients.“Twelve patients were discharged after recovering fully and testing negative while 17 others left on their own as their condition stabilised. We had to refer about 13 to other hospitals,” said Dr Rohini Wadhawan, in-charge of the facility.Unlike other illnesses, having Covid can make a patient feel lonely as they have to be insolation, and this can have an adverse effect on their mental well being, says Dr Wadhawan. “To ensure that this doesn’t happen, we offer video calling for patients so they can speak to their families. Though all of them have their phones with them, often older patients do not know how to video call so we arrange that for them. Seeing the faces of their family members after a long time brings them joy,” she said.The doctors also regularly update the family members of the patients admitted here on their condition and vitals, they added.All 50 beds at the facility are equipped with oxygen. However, only patients with oxygen levels above 75-80 are admitted here as it’s a L1 facility.“We try to keep a homely environment at the facility as patients panic when they find out they are positive. We hold motivational talks, physiotherapy sessions, yoga and indoor games for the patients so that they stay engaged. We tell them that they can defeat the virus by not just being physically strong but mentally as well,” said Dr Rajat Jain, president of Doctors For You.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yoga-indoor-games-keep-patients-morale-high-at-covid-centre-in-noida-stadium-101622140621490.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha reservation: BJP calls for protests; Congress warns of superspreaders||The Maratha reservation issue is likely to heat up the political atmosphere in the state again. In the middle of Covid pandemic, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil on Thursday urged Marathas to take to the streets for reservation, as a Maratha outfit led by a BJP ally, is starting a march demanding reservation from June 5. On the other hand, the Congress said the Opposition party will be responsible, if the latter’s agitation becomes a Covid super-spreader event. The Congress also alleged there was BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) connection with an outfit that had filed petition against the reservation. Also, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of King Shivaji and BJP MP, has taken an apolitical stand to galvanise support for Maratha reservation across party lines. He met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday and is expected to meet other leaders over the next two days. In response to a bunch of petitions, the Supreme Court on May 5 delivered a judgment scrapping the quota given to Maratha community in government jobs and education by the Maharashtra government. While the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has said the ball is in the Centre’s court now, the BJP has blamed the three-party coalition, saying the latter failed to convince the apex court that Marathas needed reservation. Community outfits have warned of agitations if the quota is not restored by the government. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said in Kolhapur on Thursday: “If Maratha community fails to get on the streets and stage agitations for reservation now, it will be late [to safeguard their rights]. Life has not stopped because of Covid. The state has got time till June 4 to file a review petition against the Supreme Court verdict. This deadline will not be extended due to the pandemic.” “If Covid cases spike in Maharashtra after the June 5 agitation, the super-spreader BJP will be held responsible for it,” said state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant replied. The Congress also alleged links of BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) with Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN), an outfit which had opposed the Maratha reservation in court and on other platforms. The Congress has said that the officer-bearers of SMSN are directly connected with the BJP. “Dr Anup Marar, the founder of the outfit, is the head of the medical cell for east Nagpur cell of the BJP. He was appointed by Devendra Fadnavis and Chandrakant Patil. Other office-bearers Roy Thomas and Anil Ladhad, too, are closely related to the BJP and RSS. They have shared the platform which had supported the Citizenship Amendment Act. The outfit was formed only after Bombay High Court upheld the reservation in 2019. It had sent four petitioners to oppose the reservation and this has been stated on its official website. The outfit’s website was designed by a company which had handled Fadnavis government’s pet projects like Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan. The BJP should clarify,” alleged Sawant in a virtual press conference on Thursday. BJP’s chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “The Congress and NCP leaders financed the petitioners who opposed Maratha reservation.” The BJP has announced support to agitations by Maratha outfits and has chalked out an outreach programme to keep the issue in focus. At least six Maratha leaders, including leader of opposition Pravin Darekar, Narayan Rane, Prasad Lad, Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, Harshavardhan Patil, Ashish Shelar and Narendra Patil, are touring various districts and meeting community leaders and members. “We are targeting 17 districts across the state with the dominance of the community. Leaders will meet the prominent leaders of Sakal Maratha Samaj and Maratha Kranti Morcha and discuss the reservation,” said Shrikant Bhartiya, general secretary of the party. Meanwhile, the BJP is also disturbed over the stand taken by its Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, who met Pawar and MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday and will be meeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and others in next two days. “I have requested Pawarsaheb to take the lead and guide the community,” said Chhatrapati. Earlier, he had urged the community to maintain restraint. He had also said that he was ready to resign as an MP if required. Patil said on Thursday the former should remember the respect given by the BJP to him. “He was made head of the Raigad development body and was given ample funding for development works. Respecting his position, we ensured that he was not made to come to the party office. He is not talking about 40 other meetings with the PM, while blaming him for denial of appointment after sending four letters,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-bjp-calls-for-protests-congress-warns-of-superspreaders-101622140620817.html
28-05-2021||Noida||In Ghaziabad, 102 villages have no active Covid-19 case||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration on Thursday said that 102 of 161 villages in the district do not have any active Covid-19 case and the rest are likely to become Covid-free in the next 10 days. The officials have attributed the development to the “voluntary community containment programme”, which was initiated on May 22. According to a survey by the district administration, 22 in Razapur block, 26 in Loni, 39 in Muradnagar and 15 in Bhojpur are Covid-free now. “The 102 villages surveyed by our teams have no active case at present. Our ‘voluntary community containment programme’ has helped us control the infection in villages. Under the programme, villagers are observing restrictions like opening of shops for a brief time period, community policing and restricting outsiders’ entry to villages,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “The programme will continue to ensure that no more cases surface further in villages which are Covid-free. The distribution of free medical kits and active participation by ‘gram nigrani samitis’ have also helped check the spread of infection,” he added. On Thursday, Ghaziabad had 54,752 total cases that included 429 deaths, 52,279 patients discharged and 2,044 active cases, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. According to the official figures, about 17,500 tests were conducted across the rural segments during the last five days under the programme which resulted in 252 positive cases. “After the panchayat elections ended on April 15, we stopped entry of outsiders and street vendors. Under the programme initiated by the administration, we asked our shop owners to open shops for limited period of time and villagers also helped in ensuring that Covid protocols were followed. In April, there were about 25 cases. But now, we have no active cases,” said Ashok Kumar, pradhan of Matiyala village. According to the figures, the rural segments of Loni, Modi Nagar and Muradnagar witnessed 644, 451 and 445 Covid cases in April, respectively. During the first 23 days of May, the cases witnessed a spike and stood at 941 and 759 in Modi Nagar and Muradnagar, respectively. However, in Loni, the cases dipped to 317 during the same period. The scenario led the district administration to shift focus to rural areas.The district magistrate also directed the municipal corporation for a survey to find out Covid-free residential wards under the municipal area. Municipal officials said that the survey is on and the figures will be received in a couple of days. “Our teams are conducting surveys in all 100 residential wards and likely to complete it in a day or two. We are also taking help of other sources to determine Covid-free wards,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-ghaziabad-102-villages-have-no-active-covid-19-case-101622140561439.html

28-05-2021||Mumbai||33% quota in promotion for SC, ST: Congress, NCP not on same page||The differences between the three ruling parties over the issue of the reservation in promotion is expected to widen further as the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) seem to be firm on their stands. The Congress has been insisting to revoke the order that scrapped 33% reservation in promotions to employees from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) and Special Backward Classes (SBC), while the NCP is reportedly in favour of scrapping the reservation.On May 7, the state government issued an order scrapping reservation to these categories, citing an August 2017 Bombay high court (HC) order wherein the court had scrapped the state government’s decision taken in 2004 giving reservation in promotion. The state had, on April 20, issued an order to promote the employees by keeping the 33% quota intact. But the U-turn in just two weeks came in the backdrop of a Supreme Court order of quashing Maratha quota on May 5. The move irked the Congress which took an aggressive stand and demanded revocation of the order. The state leadership of the party had also threatened to take aggressive stand if the reservation in promotion was not restored.Congress leaders raised the issue in the state cabinet meeting on Thursday, demanding revocation of the May 7 order. However, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar intervened and told Congress leaders that the meeting of cabinet sub-committee on the subject has been scheduled for Tuesday and there was no need to discuss it in the cabinet. The sub-committee is headed by Pawar with other ministers being its members. Upset over not being allowed to speak in the cabinet, energy minister Nitin Raut met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and demanded immediate decision. Earlier in the day, senior Congress leaders and ministers Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat and Raut held a meeting to decide on the strategy.However, Raut on Thursday said there was no question of dissent and the issue is expected to be resolved through discussion. “I met chief minister Thackeray at Varsha. He has assured us to take a decision over the reservation in the cabinet sub-committee meeting on Tuesday. We are firm on our stand,” he said. Though Congress leaders are hell-bent over cancellation of the order, Pawar is reportedly against it. “The petition challenging 2017 HC ruling is pending in the Supreme Court. It has not asked to continue with the quota. Even the law and judiciary opinion on the subject is against reservation. In such a backdrop, it was not possible to implement the quota. Pawar is firm on implementation of the May 7 order,” said an NCP leader requesting anonymity.Congress insiders said party leaders are not on the same page over the subject and that a few senior ministers disapproved of the aggressive stand taken by Raut and Patole.The Congress had, on Tuesday, held a meeting of more than 500 people from SC, ST and VJNT communities and outfits to discuss the issue. In the meeting attended by Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole and Raut, party leaders announced to take extreme steps if the demand was not met. Patole had said, “We have conveyed our strong sentiments over the issue to the CM during our meeting with him and have warned him with drastic step. We may even think of outside support to the government protesting the decision,” he had said.Raut and other Congress leaders have been seeking implementation of reservation as per the subsequent Supreme Court orders and an order of department of personnel and training of the union government. They claimed that some states and even the Centre have been implementing the quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/33-quota-in-promotion-for-sc-st-congress-ncp-not-on-same-page-101622140502593.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||ED questions builder Yusuf Lakdawala in Khandala land grab case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday questioned builder Yusuf Lakdawala in connection with alleged money laundering linked to usurping a Khandala-based land belonging to erstwhile Hyderabad Nawab Himayat Nawaz Jung Bahadur. The land is said to be worth ₹50 crore, and it is suspected that Lakdawala spent around ₹11.5 crore to bribe government officials and estate agents and other accused to grab the land. ED is probing some of the suspicious transactions of the builder linked to the Khandala land, sources said.Officers from ED (zone 2) on Thursday questioned Lakdawala, 76, and recorded his statement. The builder had previously avoided visiting ED office, despite multiple summons served to him. The money laundering case filed by ED is based on the April 2019 first information report (FIR) registered by Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) against the builder regarding usurping of the Khandala land, marked in official records as survey number 104 (CTS no. 11, 11A, 11B), and measures 4 acres and 38 gunthas.Jitendra Badgujar, sub-registrar of Maval taluka, had then lodged a complaint, following which the case was filed for cheating, forgery, conspiracy under sections 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 420, 120-B and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 82 of the Indian Registration Act against Lakdawala and others.Following the complaint, a lookout circular was issued against Lakdawala and he was subsequently arrested in the case on April 12, 2019 from Ahmedabad airport while trying to escape the country. ED officers said Lakdawala got bail in February this year and was summoned for questioning over alleged money laundering linked to the land grabbing case. As per EOW’s case, Lakdawala allegedly forged agreement papers, dating back to 1949, signed between his late father, Mohammad Ahmed Lakdawala, and the late Nawab. Lakdawala allegedly obtained an affidavit and a deed of confirmation on the basis of fake documents. The builder used the registration number of the original document, recorded with the Mumbai registrar’s office. The builder had also allegedly tried to destroy the original records of the land at the Lonavala revenue office, an ED officer said.EOW had then found that many dockets pertaining to the land are missing including original copies of some land dealings linked to the disputed land. The 21 legal heirs of the late Nawab had given power of attorney of the disputed land to one Mohan R Nair in 2014. The police later discovered that the documents pertaining to the power of attorney were forged to usurp the land. EOW investigators believed that Nair was paid ₹4 crore by Lakdawala for helping him usurp the land. Besides Lakdawala, EOW had then arrested a real estate agent and an officer from the land record department of Lonavala. Previosly, Lakdawala was in news in 2010 after a Bollywood actor, late Sadhana, had filed a case against him and his wife, alleging that the duo had threatened to kill her as she refused to vacate a bungalow in Khar, where she was living. Sadhana had died after deposing before the magistrate’s court, which had later acquitted Lakdawala in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-questions-builder-yusuf-lakdawala-in-khandala-land-grab-case-101622140500872.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||ED case: Amnesty moves HC against accounts freeze||Amnesty International India Private Limited (AIIPL) approached the Delhi high court on Thursday against continuation of the freezing of its bank accounts by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with an alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).The plea, which was urgently mentioned on Thursday, is listed to be heard on Friday.The money laundering case is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR filed against AIIPL, Indians for Amnesty International Trust (IAIT), Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT) ,and Amnesty International South Asia Foundation (AISAF), under various sections of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and section 120-B of IPC (criminal conspiracy).In its petition, the human rights organisation has said that 180 days of the provisional attachment order (PAO) that commenced from November 26, has expired and hence the proceedings cannot continue before the adjudicating authority.The plea has said that despite the matter being concluded on May 25 after detailed arguments by the adjudicating authority, they received an email the same day from the adjudicating authority containing notice/ direction fixing a fresh date of hearing on May 28, in the original complaint before the authority.“In view of the above, continuation of proceedings before the Respondent No. 3 Authority in the impugned OC, is illegal, without jurisdiction and contrary to the clear statutory mandate under the PMLA. Furthermore, it is settled law that an interim order passed by a superior court staying the operation/implementation or execution of a judgment does not in any manner diminish its value as a precedent,” the plea said.Attaching over ₹17 crore deposits in February this year, the Enforcement Directorate stated, that both AIIPL and IAIT acquired he proceeds of crime and layered the same in the form of various movable properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amnesty-india-moves-delhi-hc-against-continuation-of-freeze-on-accounts-101622140140709.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Black fungus now an epidemic, govt to be informed of all cases||The Delhi government on Thursday declared mucormycosis an epidemic and made it mandatory for all health care institutions in the city to report suspected and confirmed cases of the infection to them, amid a sharp spike in incidences of the fungal infection over the past few weeks as a complication among patients with Covid-19.The move comes a week after the Centre urged all states to categorise the infection as a notifiable disease after an increase in cases following the second wave of Covid-19 in April.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said over 620 patients are being treated for mucormycosis, known commonly as black fungus, in city hospitals, and flagged a severe shortage of Amphotericin-B, the only last-line drug used to treat the fungal infection.Instances of black fungus are extremely rare, and major hospitals in the Capital like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital see between six and 15 cases of the infection in an entire year, usually.The Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations 2021, which will remain in force for a year, forbid any organisation from “spreading information or material” or using “print or electronic or any other form of media for mucormycosis” without prior permission from the health department.This means that hospitals will not be allowed to share, without approval, details about infections and the number of cases with the press. However, it is unclear whether rule this will cover requests for medicines and other information put out on the social media.As of Tuesday, the city received 3,850 vials of Amphotericin-B, against a requirement of over 30,000 doses a week, said senior officials in Delhi’s health department.The Delhi government estimates that the city will need around 100,000 doses of the medicine over the next two months.To help address these shortages, the Delhi high court on Thursday allowed the duty free import of Amphotericin-B, on furnishing a bond by the importers till the Centre takes a decision on the tax waiver.The regulations, Dr Nutan Mundeja, Delhi’s director general of health services, said all health care facilities in the Capital must follow guidelines issued by the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on screening, diagnosis, and management of mucormycosis.The order also mandates that a committee be constituted under every chief district medical officer (CDMO) comprising doctors specialising in internal medicine, ophthalmology, ENT, as well as epidemiologists to review instances of individuals or organisations disobeying the order.In the event the regulations are flouted, the district magistrate concerned will issue a notice and ask for a response within a fixed period. If a reply is not received or found to be unsatisfactory, action can be taken under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code that allows for imprisonment up to six months or a fine of ₹1,000 fine or both for disobeying a public servant’s order.Mucormycosis mainly affects those who are severely immunocompromised, have uncontrolled diabetes, have had Covid-19, and were treated using steroids. It mainly affects the mouth, nose, eye and later spreads to the brain. It can kill almost half the people it infects if left untreated.“The high number of cases could be because there was no glucose control in patients during the pandemic. Also, steroids were used in high quantities when there was a shortage of oxygen. And, we are yet to study the immune dysregulation caused by the new variants of Sars-CoV-2 and whether it is different from the old ones,” said Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-declares-black-fungus-an-epidemic-restricts-hospitals-from-making-details-of-cases-public-101622139661076.html

It also demanded compensation for the families of the victims, and an order to authorities to seize the CCTV footage from the hospital.The Delhi government on April 28 constituted a committee to ascertain the number of deaths due to shortage of oxygen in the hospitals across the city, following a direction by the high court on April 27.In its report, the committee said the patients at Jaipur Golden hospital in Rohini died of comorbidities, and that there was no mention of oxygen shortage in any of the case records.The committee said that many of the patients had one or multiple co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypertension.“All these patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy and/or ventilator support during the hospital stay,” the report said.Quoting a report in HT on May 4, the petitioners said that they got to know about the findings of the panel from the news story.The petition alleged that the report prepared by the committee was “erroneous”, and that the authorities have rendered themselves not only liable to pay compensation to the families of the victims but also for criminal prosecution.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter. The petition is likely to be listed next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jaipur-golden-hospital-deaths-families-of-deceased-patients-demand-cbi-probe-101622139540392.html

Initially, you fail to reconcile that such a tragedy has happened but then gradually the reality sets in. The series of such deaths of our friends is leading to stress and impacting our mental health,” said a senior pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-india-loses-fourth-pilot-to-covid19-101622138520135.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: 12-year-old moves court, seeks jabs for those below 18||The Delhi high court on Friday will hear a plea by a 12-year-old seeking direction to the Centre and the Delhi government to immediately vaccinate children between the ages of 12-17 in the city.The plea, filed by Tia Gupta through advocate Abhinav Mukherjee, has also demanded that vaccination be prioritised for parents having children up to 17 years of age.The petition, listed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, said that data from across the country, including Delhi, has shown that between April 2021 to May 2021, the number of youngsters being infected from Covid 19 has “risen tremendously”.“There are also reports of many children left orphaned due to deaths of their parents,” the plea said, contending that the vaccine policy of India against Covid-19 has failed to factor in children or parents of children who are a vulnerable section of society for vaccination against the deadly virus.Meanwhile, the high court sought responses from the Centre and Delhi government on a plea seeking directions to them to ensure adequate supply of Covid-19 vaccine for the residents, especially in 18-44 age groups, of the national capital.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the ministry of home affairs and the Delhi government seeking their stand on the plea by a lawyer who has argued that the residents of the national capital should not suffer as result of the “blame game” between the two governments.The lawyer, Vivek Gaur, 43, argued while the Delhi government claims it has placed an order of over 13.4 million doses of the vaccines with the Centre, the Centre has claimed no such order has been placed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12yearold-moves-hc-demands-vaccination-for-those-below-18-101622138460201.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Six-member panel to look into deaths due to oxygen shortage||The state government on Thursday set up a six-member panel to look into deaths caused due to oxygen shortages at the peak of the fourth wave of Covid-19. The panel will also ascertain the criteria for compensation to be given to families.The state government will give families of the deceased between ₹50,000 and ₹5 lakh compensation.To be sure, the family of any Delhi resident who dies of Covid-19 is given ₹50,000 compensation. This panel will decide on any compensation over and above this amount.“The committee will check whether oxygen was being used properly in the hospitals as per the norms. The committee will check the steps taken by the hospital to maintain sufficient oxygen stock with respect to patients admitted therein,” the order read.The committee includes a doctor from the department of medicine and another from anaesthesia at Lok Nayak hospital, an anaesthetist from Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital, an official from the directorate general of health services, and two heads of private hospitalsThe complaints will be received online and offline by the nursing home cell, and will be assessed at least twice a week. The committee will be empowered to ask the hospitals in question for any documents needed, according to the order by special secretary (health) SM Ali.At least 32 people across two city hospitals died ostensibly due to oxygen shortage in Delhi.Twenty patients, mostly admitted to the intensive care unit, in Jaipur Golden hospital died around midnight on April 23 after the pressure in the oxygen system ran low, when the hospital switched from liquid medical oxygen to manifold with oxygen cylinders.Another 12 people, including the head of the department of gastroenterology, died in Batra hospital on May 2 when the hospital was forced to switch to oxygen cylinders after it was left without liquid oxygen for 80 minutes.Sir Ganga Ram hospital said 25 of their sickest patients died and also said there was oxygen crisis in the hospital, without claiming there were any direct connection between the two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sets-up-panel-to-look-into-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-fix-compensation-101622138100109.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi to draw up graded response action plan to tackle Covid-19 third wave||Building on the lessons it learnt from the brutal fourth wave of infections in the national capital, the Delhi government on Thursday said that it will create a “graded response action plan (Grap)” for the timely management of the pandemic through pre-planned and systematic interventions.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal will chair a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday to discuss these measures, officials said.The health department on Thursday ordered the constitution of two committees for the purpose. The first will be a “state level expert committee”, comprising senior doctors and bureaucrats, and will be tasked with preparing the Grap measures depending on the positivity rate in Delhi at any point.The panel will devise a plan to mitigate the impact of a possible third wave and will also chalk out the preparations necessary to handle the specialised needs of children, in case more of them fall ill, as predicted by certain experts.“Devise clear guidelines on when to announce lockdown and to what degree or extent. Prepare a plan of action for increasing and activating hospital infrastructure (isolation beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds, ventilators), essential drugs, oxygen supply, and other crucial items based on the positivity rate indicator,” said the order on the state level expert committee.The second committee will act more like a third wave task force in Delhi, a senior health official said. This panel comprises 13 members -- all bureaucrats and the state director general of health services.The committee has been tasked with the preparation of a detailed plan of action to estimate the number of beds (isolation, oxygen, ICU, etc) and additional equipment required, where these equipment and materials will be sourced from.The government is also giving priority to ensuring adequate oxygen supply, officials said.The order asked the panel to ensure that all the large hospital facilities, wherever possible, get their own oxygen generation plants which can serve their oxygen needs.It also directed that all Delhi government hospitals must have provisions for supply of piped oxygen and enough oxygen cylinders.“An assessment of the requirement of transportation vehicles in order to procure cryogenic tankers, and other vehicles required for the smooth transportation of oxygen from other states should also be done,” the order further stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-creates-graded-response-action-plan-to-tackle-a-third-wave-101622138040132.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||19-year-old St Stephen’s student died of Covid||A 19-year-old first-year student of history at Delhi University (DU)’s St Stephen’s College succumbed to Covid-19 on Wednesday.

28-05-2021||Pune||Passengers arriving on private buses in Pune to undergo thermal screening||PUNE Passengers arriving on private buses in the city will undergo a thermal screening, as per a decision taken by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Vikram Kumar on Thursday. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on these passengers and since no e-pass is required to travel on these buses, the rush for tickets has increased in the last one month. Given that Covid numbers are plateauing in the city now, the PMC does not want to take a risk, hence the thermal screening.“Passengers coming from outside the state need to submit an RT-PCR negative report, but for passengers within the state there is no such compulsion. A large number of passengers travel by these private tourist buses within the state, and there is no checking done. When these passengers come to Pune they directly get involved in their day-to-day work, and if there is anyone Covid positive with no symptoms, it will lead to a spread of the infection. It has been decided that thermal screening of all such passengers on private tourist buses will be dne,” said Kumar. In Pune, at the four main exit roads of the city, viz Ahmednagar road, Hadapsar, Solapur road and Katraj, there has been rush of passengers to board these private buses. Welcoming this decision of the PMC, Shantaram Kenjale, a regular inter-district traveller, said, “It is risky to travel by private buses and during lockdown an as e-pass is not required. When thermal checking is done, at least there will be some monitoring of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. It will certainly reduce the spread of the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/passengers-arriving-on-private-buses-to-undergo-thermal-screening-101622127659211.html
28-05-2021||Pune||As price of petrol nears Rs100/litre, middle-class Punekars bear burden of budgets going awry||PUNE Hiked by 0.27 paise on Thursday, the price of a litre of petrol inched closer to the ₹100-mark, hitting ₹99.62 in Pune, according to the price notifications of state-owned fuel retailers. Diesel crossed the ₹90 mark and was at ₹90.15 per litre in the city on Thursday. This is the 14th time fuel prices have risen this month. Fuel prices started to rise from May 4, when petrol was at ₹96.62 per litre and diesel was at ₹86.32 per litre. The petrol price crossed ₹100/litre in Mumbai on Thursday. Currently, due to Covid curbs, daily traffic is comparatively much less, but those who do not have the option to work from home and need to step out for their livelihoods are facing soaring fuel prices. Chetan Kharote, who used to drive for Ola and Uber in the city, has stopped running his car. Kharote said that with soaring fuel prices and reducing profit margins, it is more affordable for him to not drive in the current situation. “I have been in this business since 2014 and bought my own diesel car in 2018. At that time, the diesel price was in the range of ₹60 per litre. Now I have stopped business. Because of curbs there are fewer passengers and the diesel price has been soaring, so the profit margin has reduced. It is better to keep the car standing rather than put in my own money to operate. It’s a tricky situation,” said Kharote. “I bought my car for ₹6.5 lakh on a loan. I still need to pay that money back. I am working part-time driving other people’s vehicles if they need to go somewhere, charging only for driving. Currently it is not viable for me to take my own car. We cannot even increase the fares,” he added. Vivek Kondhalkar, a civil engineer with a private construction firm in the city, has to visit construction sites. “I have to travel 30-40 km per day to visit the sites. Even if we are not working we have to use the vehicle for personal work. A substantial amount of my salary is going to fill fuel. From ₹60 per litre, petrol now has reached ₹100. If fuel prices increase, it impacts everything, from the price of vegetables and milk to groceries. It is an increasing burden,” said Kondhalkar, who lives in Ambegaon Budruk. Husaina Sheikh, who works as a helper in a private hospital in Hadapsar, is finding it difficult to manage her monthly expenses. “I am the sole earning member in my family. Because of the lockdown my husband and sons are unemployed right now. The hospital I work in is five 5 kilometers away from my home. My son drops me on his bike. I earn Rs7,000 per month. How should we manage expenses when the cost of petrol is increasing. If I fill ₹100 worth of petrol, it lasts hardly for two days,” said Sheikh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-price-of-petrol-nears-rs100-litre-middle-class-folk-bear-burden-of-budgets-going-awry-101622125258969.html
28-05-2021||Delhi||Cops’ charge sheet says R-Day violence at Red Fort a ‘well-planned conspiracy’||Protesters armed with swords, rods, pharsi (saintie), wooden legs of a cot and spears stormed the historical Red Fort in Delhi as part of a “well-planned conspiracy” to “cause mayhem”, the Delhi Police have said in a charge sheet in the violence at the monument on Republic Day during a tractor rally taken out by farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The crime branch of the Delhi police, which is investigating the case, has named 16 suspects in the charge sheet that was filed on May 17 in a Delhi court. The police have termed the alleged storming of the fort by the protesters a “well-planned conspiracy.” According to the charge sheet, the accused came well equipped to “cause mayhem” and use the Red Fort premises as their new protest site.Scanning footage from over 100 video clips that were shot by drones, hired photographers, those posted on social media and footage from CCTV cameras, police have attached clips in the charge sheet to show how the protesters indulged in violence carrying the “weapons” cited above. As evidence, the police have also attached a copy of the cell phone location of all 16 accused to establish their presence at the Mughal-era fort when the protesters clashed with the police and vandalised property at the monument.The charge sheet running into 3,224 pages was submitted before a duty metropolitan magistrate in Tis Hazari court which is expected to hear the matter on Friday. A charge sheet is a legal document submitted to court by the investigating officer, which lists the charges and evidence against those who are charged in the case. It is on the basis of a charge sheet that the court holds trial.Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu is among the 16 people named in the charge sheet. All 16 were arrested in connection with the case filed by the police. While Sidhu and 12 others have been released on bail, three accused, 23-year-old Dutch national of Indian origin, Maninderjit Singh, Khempreet Singh and Jabrajang Singh, are still in judicial custody. Police have attached a video of Sidhu allegedly showing him throwing away the national flag. “At the very same time (after rioters climbed the ramparts) another member from the unlawfully assembled riotous mob handed him (Sidhu) over the national flag to hoist it alongside the Nishan Sahib, but the individual (Sidhu) over the pole threw away the national flag,” the police said.Two separate cases were registered in connection with the violence at the Red Fort. While one case involving serious charges such as rioting, attempt to murder, and criminal conspiracy was registered on the police’s complaint, the second case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which is the custodian of the Mughal-era fort. Sidhu was arrested in both the cases.The police are yet to file a charge sheet in the second case.No senior police officer on Friday commented on the charge sheet, saying the matter is in court now.The police suspect some pro-Khalistan terror groups based outside India could be involved. They have mentioned a telephone call that one of the accused, Iqbal Singh,45, received when he was at the Red Fort complex. Police said the call originated in Canada.Iqbal has also been mentioned in the charge sheet as one of the people who instigated the mob at the fort. Iqbal, a Ludhiana resident, was held on February 10.According to the charge sheet, a video shows Iqbal instigating the mob to attack security guards and police personnel, who were deployed to secure the ASI-protected monument on January 26.“Hamare pass dande bhi hai... dande tayyar rakh lo,” the police quoted him as saying in the video clip.Quoting an alleged confession by Iqbal Singh, the police said he was promised a cash reward by the Sikhs For Justice group, a banned pro-Khalistan organisation, if he hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag at the Red Fort.To be sure, Singh’s “confession” to the police cannot be considered admissible evidence by the court.“During police custody remand accused (Iqbal) has also disclosed that during his stay/visit to Canada in 2009, the accused worked at a gurdwara in Toronto, which is known/popular for its support to Khalistani movement in Punjab. Even on the date of incident i.e., 26th January 2021, while he was present at Red Fort, he received a call from Canada. ….Furthermore there is one audio conversation on record, where in the daughter of the accused Iqbal Singh is conversing with one of his relative mentioning that they will be getting an amount of ₹50 lakh,” the police said in the charge sheet.At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured during Republic Day’s tractor rally when protesting farmers deviated from the pre-approved route and clashed with police personnel.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, rejected the “conspiracy angle” given by the police to the protest. Sirsa’s team is providing legal help to some of those who participated in the rally and are now facing court proceedings. He said his team has sought bail for 156 farmers, who were accused in the January 26 violence case but in none of the hearings the police said it was a conspiracy.Sirsa said, “Last month, when Deep Sidhu was granted bail by the court, even then the police did not allege conspiracy.“First, the police should define what they mean by ‘association with Khalistan terror group’? For the last three months, the investigators are probing the angles of terror links and foreign funding of farmer protests, but they are yet to establish or prove anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-fort-violence-was-well-planned-conspiracy-charge-sheet-101622106197508.html
28-05-2021||Pune||21-year-old sarpanch keeps his Solapur village Covid free||It was a difficult task for Ruturaj Deshmukh and his team to overcome the recent increasing number of Covid cases in their village, but through their tireless efforts, Ghatane village is now Covid free. 21-year-old Deshmukh is sarpanch of Ghatane village in Mohol taluka, Solapur.“Since the Covid pandemic started last year, there was not a single case in our village. This year, in March, the first case of Covid was found in our village and suddenly the entire picture changed,” Deshmukh said.The village of 5,000 residents had 100 confirmed Covid cases in April. “People started fearing going out and most of them shifted to other villages. We decided to run a drive called, “Be positive and keep our village Covid negative”, to which we got a good response from villagers,” said Deshmukh .Deshmukh completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) last year. “The five major things which we did to reduce Covid cases in the village were rapid antigen tests of all coming to the village from cities engaged in various types of trade. We encouraged people above the age of 45 to get vaccinated. Our Grampanchayat workers and volunteers went to each house to check oxygen levels and body temperature. Each family was given a Covid safety kit with a sanitiser, face masks, vitamin capsules and soaps. Also people coming from outside were strictly told to be in quarantine for at least three day. Our village became Covid free within a month,” says Deshmukh .Appreciating the work of Deshmukh as a young sarpanch, villager Devika Parvati Mali said, “As the cases were increasing in the village, Ruturaj and other members of the Grampanchayat really took efforts to stop the spread of infection. This pattern is appreciated and other villages can also learn from it.”Villager Mangal Deshmukh said, “There was a mental support for our family, when volunteers and the sarpanch would come to our house and do checking. Earlier, we used to feel unsafe as Covid cases were increasing, but now as our village is Covid free, it is a safer place to live.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/21yearold-sarpanch-former-sppu-student-keeps-his-village-covid-free-101622040913482.html
28-05-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Writing a will is essential to financial planning||We are often so engrossed in providing for our loved ones and choosing the right investments to secure their future that we forget to write a will that would detail how we intend to allocate our various investments. Many people interpret a will as merely a legal document to distribute properties and take care of minor dependents, but the document, at its core, offers clarity of succession.“A will can contain details stating apportioning of personal financial investments. An estate of the testator is all the property a person owns or controls. The property in one’s estate may consist of financial assets (e.g., bank accounts, stocks, bonds, or business interests), tangible personal assets (e.g., artwork, collectables, or vehicles), immovable property (e.g., residential real estate, tea/timber rights), and intellectual property (e.g., royalties). Accordingly, it is always beneficial that the testator should apportion all his or her movable and immovable assets at the time of preparation of the will so that shares/assets allotted to beneficiaries or legal heirs can be retained by them,” Neha Gupta, Principal Associate, Athena Legal said.Nominee vs beneficiary vs legal heir Ever tried filling a bank application form or a consent form before making your investments? Apart from your details, you are required to choose a nominee for your deposits and investments that may include your parents, spouse, siblings, and children. While opening bank accounts or investing money in bank deposits, you can either choose one nominee or multiple nominees for your various investments from members within your family and not outside your family.As opposed to the widely held belief that the nominees are people who get the money and keep it with themselves, a nominee is a person who has a right to hold the assets/property on behalf of the deceased in trust, to be distributed to the actual persons having beneficial ownership under the succession laws.“A beneficiary is a person having actual beneficial interest in the asset/property as per the succession laws, whether under a will or otherwise. In certain cases, such as transmission of shares, ‘nominee’ also indicates beneficial ownership of the shares, as specifically provided in the Companies Act,” Amit Jajoo, partner, IndusLaw explained.A nominee may or may not be the legal heir to the will. If the nominee is from someone outside the family, he or she is responsible for the disbursement of the proceeds among beneficiaries mentioned in the will. The beneficiary (one or more) has a financial interest and can either be from the family or outside. Beneficiaries can also include financial institutions that may have provided loan(s) to the person writing the will. In most cases, legal heirs are the beneficiaries mentioned in the will.However, the beneficiaries may be different from legal heir(s), which is why you must name designated beneficiaries in your will. “According to the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, any person capable of holding property (including an outsider) can be nominated as a beneficiary under a will. If a minor has been named as a beneficiary, then a guardian should be appointed by the testator to manage the bequeathed property,” Petrushka Dasgupta, Partner, Induslaw said.Passing away without naming beneficiaries irrespective of whether they are the same or different from the nominee(s) may result in unnecessary legal hassles between the designated beneficiaries and legal heirs of the assets getting divided.We all may not have the benefit of having a family or being in the company of immediate family members. This has forced many people to rely on relatives, extended family members or chosen family to take care of their money. However, a nominee must be reliable and worthy enough to carry out the dictates of the will. A friend or live-in partner can be a nominee, and it must be explicitly mentioned in the will for the assets to be handed over to him or her for proper distribution and allocation as mentioned in the will.Why must you write a will? Many people do not understand why a will must be made, especially, with the nominee(s) being mentioned for all investments. As Gupta explained, a will supersedes the nomination for most assets. “A will is the supreme document that specifies the exact intentions of the testator to the succession of properties.” So, for example, if a bank account has a nominee, and the will has the name of another beneficiary, it is the latter that will receive the money in the account. “It is important to note that a will that has been proven valid wields the power to override any arrangements or nominations made during an individual’s lifetime.”(Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-writing-a-will-is-essential-to-financial-planning-101621795564354.html
