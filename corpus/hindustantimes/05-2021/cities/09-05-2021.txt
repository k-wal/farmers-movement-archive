09-05-2021||Gurugram||Private hospitals face staff crunch amid spike in cases||Private hospitals in the city are facing a staff crunch in Covid-19 wards as many are quitting their jobs fearing for their lives or due to better offers due to increased demand, officials of hospitals said.Hospital representatives said that with the sharp increase in the number of cases and subsequently, the number of beds, their staff are facing heavy pressure. Many workers also tested positive in the last 20 days and although their symptoms are mild to moderate, the managements are also offering existing staff higher salaries to prevent a crisis.Dr Subhash Khanna, of Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14, said that they are facing a challenge to hire staff for the Covid-19 ward. “We have 30 Covid beds and the existing staff is working hard round-the-clock, but the agencies providing nursing staff has given up as the staff are demanding high salaries for the job. People are taking advantage of the situation and demanding a multifold hike in salary,” he said.Hospitals managements said that besides increasing salaries, they are also offering incentives to retain the staff.Anil Khatana, head of operations, W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said that they are running short of nursing staff for the last two months. “The nursing staff is the backbone of the hospitals and without sufficient staff, they cannot increase the number of beds. All the agencies and job portals are unable to provide any as the demand has increased and they are demanding exorbitant salaries, which is not feasible. On average, we used to interview two people a day, but nowadays, we are hardly getting one new member in a month,” he said.Representatives of few other hospitals said that the staff is demanding at least a 40% hike in salaries to continue their work and are presenting offer letters from other hospitals, where they are being offered double their current pay.JP Singh, a representative of Samvit hospital on Sohna Road, said that retaining the nursing staff at this time is one of the biggest challenges. “All the staff is working round the clock and risking their lives. They are in demand now and hospitals are forced to accept their demands as there is no other option left. Otherwise, patients admitted to Covid-19 wards will have to be either shifted or will be left unattended,” he said.The hospitals’ recruitment teams are also working more than 12 hours a day to hire nursing staff. They said that even freshers are getting paid more than experienced workers due to the increased demand.Appeals from the administration for volunteers has also largely gone unanswered and the number of beds and Covid care centres has increased across the city, but unable to get nursing staff as per the number of patients.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The district administration has already provided staff to a few big private hospitals of the city in April when Covid-19 cases were gradually increasing. It included students from nursing colleges. In the government set-ups, we have sufficient staff, but for the new facility being set up at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, the department has asked for doctors, nurses and other people required to handle Covid-19 patients. The district administration has appealed medical students, nurses and retired doctors to come forward as volunteers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/private-hospitals-face-staff-crunch-amid-spike-in-cases-101620582254246.html
09-05-2021||Gurugram||Health dept increases focus on rural pockets||With cases increasing in rural areas, the district administration has deployed 138 health teams to focus on testing, contact tracing and treatment. The district administration started intensive monitoring of rural areas from Saturday, said officials. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, said, “As cases are increasing in rural areas also, we are monitoring the situation closely. A total of 138 teams have been constituted for monitoring rural areas in the district. These teams will be focusing on areas falling under seven primary health centres. The teams would visit all the houses and conduct rapid antigen tests of symptomatic patients and also focus on contact tracing.” The rural areas covered by the teams include; Bhondsi, Badashahpur, Palra, Kasan, Bhangrola, Bhora Kalan and Farrukhnagar. The Haryana government on Saturday announced that around 8,000 multidisciplinary teams would be deputed to launch a door-to-door Covid-19 screening drive in rural areas, amid reports of low testing and underreporting of the infections. The teams, led by trainee doctors and health department officials, will have ASHA and anganwadi workers and each team will cover approximately 500 households. In the past two days, the district health department conducted over 1,660 tests with over 25 people testing positive. “We were already conducting tests in rural areas, but with cases rapidly increasing in urban areas, cases are increasing in rural areas also due to movement of locals. Now, even if a person tests negative in a rapid test, the teams will constantly monitor their health, and take samples for RT-PCR testing after a gap of three to four days,” said Sharma. Last week, health department officials had said that Covid-19 cases are controlled in rural areas when compared to urban areas of the district because of lower population density. Residents, however, said that cases are increasing in rural areas, with almost no facilities available. “Locals in villages do not even have access to basic medicines like paracetamol, at times. They are relying on immunity boosting drinks (kadha). It is also not possible to practice home isolation in rural areas as large families live together, due to which most family members end up testing positive,” said a resident of Sohna, requesting anonymity. Gurugram on Sunday reported 2,842 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of active cases to 37,423. On Sunday, deaths of 10 positive patients were also reported from the district. With this, a total of 587 Covid-19 positive patients have died in the district so far. The recovery rate in the district stands at 75.71%, while the fatality rate is 0.38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-dept-increases-focus-on-rural-pockets-101620582194321.html
09-05-2021||Gurugram||Beneficiaries allege mismanagement of vaccination process||Many vaccine beneficiaries who had registered slots for vaccination at the government-run session sites on Sunday returned without taking their shots as they were unaware of a token system for vaccinations at the primary health centres (PHCs), amid limited availability of vaccines.Officials of the health department, however, said that the problem is mainly among those aged 18-44 who are walking in without registration, as the number of vaccines in their stock is limited.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “It is mandatory for people above 45 years, front-line workers and healthcare workers to get themselves registered on Co-WIN , while people who need second dose can directly walk in as they are already registered. Nearly 70% of the allocated stock is for second dose and 30% for first shot. In case of beneficiaries under 18-44 years, online registration along with appointment is a priority.”At the government vaccination centres, people who have got themselves registered are given a token based on which they are vaccinated. At some primary health centres, the registration did not reflect on the computer system, leaving people in a panic. Officials said that people who are walking in are first registered on the database and are only then assigned a token.Residents alleged that the problem has been compounded as private hospitals have not started the vaccine drive.Anand Chawla, a resident of Sushant Lok-1, said that he had a harrowing experience at Tigra PHC on Sunday. “The doctor deployed there denied vaccination even after reaching on time, taking token and waiting in queue for 45 minutes. They said the quota for the day was over and asked me to come on another day. It is already painful to get an appointment for the 18-44 age group, and then this happens. They called the police to send people back home after their quota was over,” he said.Chawla took to the internet to post his experience, following which many residents were critical of the exercise.Ajay Sharma, resident of Tulip Ivory in Sector 70, said, “Logging and getting the appointment is a huge task. For us, it was manageable, but the rural population was facing a tough time and were in panic. Vaccination should be automated and message should be sent to people stating their vaccination date and time.”As per Sunday’s daily bulletin of the district, 8,756 people got their first vaccine dose and 3,770 got their second jab, taking the total vaccination count to 535,518.Health department officials and doctors at PHCs said that many people are coming for vaccination without getting registered and they create a ruckus, forcing officials to vaccinate them.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The department received over 25,000 doses of Covishield and 6,000 doses of Covaxin on Saturday night. These doses will be given to vaccine beneficiaries above 45 years, who are scheduled for their second dose. Additional 7,500 doses have been allocated for those aged between 18 and 44. Vaccination centres can inoculate between 100 and 300 people every day. At various health centres, footfall has been high, but we can only appeal to people to maintain social distancing as they wait in queues.”Residents said that more people want to get vaccinated due to the recent spike in cases and limited vaccine availability is a concern, due to which arguments also break out at the vaccination sites.Vinod Tayal, a resident of DLF Phase 2, said that he had booked an appointment for taking the second dose of vaccine on May 6 between 10am and noon slot at Sukhrali UPHC-2. “When I went there and showed my booking details to the staff concerned, they refused to accept my booking slot details and asked me whether I had a token issued by them in the morning. Then, a friend informed me that I can go to Nathupur UPHC and get the second dose without a prior booking. I went there with my wife and we got the same. It is totally mismanaged and people are really suffering,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/beneficiaries-allege-mismanagement-of-vaccination-process-101620582136118.html
09-05-2021||Gurugram||Committees to assign remdesivir, ensure oxygen to patients in home isolation||The district administration formed separate committees on Sunday to allocate remdesivir injections to critically ill Covid-19 patients and ensure oxygen availability for patients in home isolation.The order issued by the district administration stated that a four-member committee, headed by additional deputy commissioner Prashant Panwar, will scrutinise the applications for remdesivir twice a day and ensure that the medicine is issued to both private and government hospitals in a transparent manner.As per the directions, hospitals that require this injection can send an email to the committee at remidesivir.gurugram@gmail.com or submit a pro forma in physical form at the office of the civil surgeon.Two officials at the civil surgeon’s office, Surender Singh and Anil Parmar, will ensure communications between committee members for the meeting and also communicate with the hospitals through email and phone, the order issued by deputy commissioner Yash Garg stated.The district administration on Sunday also constituted a three-member committee headed by Rajnarayan Kaushik, an IAS officer, to ensure oxygen cylinders are made available to patients in home isolation. For this purpose, private firms, NGOs and the district Red Cross will work jointly and ensure that cylinders are made available, said officials. It shall also fix the rate at which oxygen cylinders shall be made available to patients, said the order issued by Garg.Apart from delivering oxygen, the Gurugram administration will also distribute Covid-19 kits, containing 15 items such as an oximeter, digital thermometer, steamer, ayurvedic medicines, masks and information booklet, free of cost as a part of the statewide exercise. This is expected to cost around ₹80 lakh, said officials.At present, there are over 37,000 Covid-19 patients who are in home isolation in the district. The kits will also include allopathic medicines such as azithromycin, paracetamol, and vitamins, said officials. A fund of ₹2.46 crore has been earmarked for distribution of these kits across the state and the order issued by the additional chief secretary, health, Haryana has also directed the deputy commissioners to procure these kits at the earliest.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “Workers of health department will ensure that these kits reach patients in home isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/committees-to-assign-remdesivir-ensure-oxygen-to-patients-in-home-isolation-101620582135526.html
09-05-2021||Gurugram||Cases per week dip for first time in four weeks||For the first time in over a month, the number of new Covid-19 cases per week decreased, with the district recording 25,860 new cases between May 3 and 9, lower than the 27,358 new cases recorded over the previous week, between April 26 and May 2.Since April 4, there has been a continuous increase in the number of cases per week, with cases increasing by 2% around March-end to around 27% in early May (see box). The last time cases per week dipped was on April 4, when 1,098 cases were recorded between March 29 and April 4, lower than the 1,589 cases recorded between March 21 and 28, according to the health department data.Officials attributed the dip in cases per week to the implementation of a lockdown in Gurugram. On May 1 and 2, Gurugram was among the nine worst-affected districts in the state, due to which the Haryana government initially enforced a weekend lockdown in the nine districts, following which a week-long lockdown was enforced on May 3 across the state.“A combination of lockdown by the Haryana government and the efforts of the district administration and various government bodies in the city are likely to have been a major contributor to this drop in Covid-19 growth along with the support of residents (who are) opting to stay indoors. While this drop is encouraging, we know that the Covid-19 situation is still not completely under control, and continuous efforts are being executed to limits its spread and prevent people from contracting it,” said Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.According to the data, since April 4-11, the weekly percentage increase in cases has consistently remained higher than the preceding week. Between April 26 and May 2, the city saw an increase of 26.48% in cases compared to the preceding week. But this week, between May 3 and May 9, the increase in cases was 19.79%.Data from the daily health bulletin of the district administration also lends support to this recent downward trend.On April 29, the district recorded its highest single-day spike in cases, at 5,042 new cases, but since then, the district recorded more than 4,000 cases in a single day on only four more instances. On Sunday, the city recorded 2,842 cases, the lowest single-day spike in cases since April 20, when the city recorded 2,344 cases.Although the spike in cases has taken a dip, various studies and experts have pegged the second wave of Covid-19 to peak in mid-May or next month.As per both a State Bank of India (SBI) research report and the three-member national Covid-19 supermodel committee, formed by the central government to make projections regarding the spread of the pandemic and follow its trajectory, the second wave is expected to peak in mid-May. However, a report by CLSA, a foreign capital market firm, pegs the spike in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cases-per-week-dip-for-first-time-in-four-weeks-101620582134893.html
09-05-2021||Gurugram||Lockdown extended till May 17||The Haryana government on Sunday extended the ongoing lockdown in the state for another week, until May 17, to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections, with officials concentrating on Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat districts, which account for almost half of the total number of Covid-19 infections in the state.As per the directions issued by state government officials, only 11 persons will be allowed to attend gatherings, including weddings and funerals. Wedding functions are only allowed at residences and courts with not more than 20 people, while baraat processions were disallowed. Health minister Anil Vij on Sunday evening announced the lockdown through a tweet, stating that the stringent enforcement will continue. Previously, the state government imposed a week-long lockdown in the state from May 3, following a weekend curfew in nine worst-affected districts. Vij, while announcing the extension of the curbs, however, indicated that the nomenclature of the lockdown would be changed and it would now be called a “mahamari alert” or a “Surakshit Haryana”. He also said that a detailed order in this regard will be issued soon. Vij in his tweet at 8.49pm on Sunday wrote, “Mahamari Alert / Surkshit Haryana announced from 10 May to 17 May. Stringent measures will be taken to contain spread of Corona in Haryana. Detailed order to be issued soon.” The tweet by Vij, who also holds the charge of home ministry in the state cabinet, also cleared the confusion regarding the extension of the lockdown as it was set to end at 10am on Monday. A senior district administration official, when asked about the matter, said that they are still awaiting the order. As per the previous lockdown order, the district administration stated that all educational institutes, malls, theatres, restaurants and similar places will remain closed, but industry outside municipal area, those producing essential goods and several others would be allowed to operate. Under the current lockdown, all social gatherings, parties, meetings are disallowed, unless specifically allowed by deputy commissioners. All religious places are closed and religious congregations are not allowed. Hotels, restaurants, food joints, including those in malls, are allowed to operate till 10.30pm only for takeaways. Roadside dhabas and food stalls, and fruit vendors were also allowed to operate but only for takeaways. Most activities are not allowed in the containment zones or large outbreak regions, with only home delivery of food permitted in these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lockdown-extended-till-may-17-101620582134311.html

Some big medical shops have started selling grocery items, bakery products, ice-creams and various other such items. “There is one 24x 7 medical shop on Satara road where we get almost everything which we buy from a normal grocery shop. There are biscuits, chips, packed food items and many other things,” said Ashutosh Phad, a student living near Swargate. These shops mostly operate round the clock and people rush here not to buy medicines, but these grocery items. Even the civic body or police department won’t take any action against such violators. Shivaji Desai, joint commissioner, Foods and drugs administration, said, “There are complaints received about such medical stores selling food items, but they have a legal food license for it. If needed and found violating the rules the police department or civic body can take necessary action.”Folk artistes to raise Covid1-9 awareness from talukas to municipal areasThe state government has decided to create awareness about Covid-19 through local folk artistes.

The study found that original vegetation on the hill of Pune city is home to 86 bird species as compared to the exotic plantation where only 38 bird species are found. The study also revealed that 14 migratory bird species were seen in original vegetation as compared to only four migratory species in exotic vegetation across Pune city. The paper regarding the same was published on May 2 by researchers from Pune in the ‘Tropical Ecology’ by Springer Journal. The study further revealed that exotic plantations have the lower richness and high dominance of woody plant species compared to savanna patches. Currently, original vegetation to the hills in Pune city are under threat of non-scientific plantation forestry, therefore awareness among citizens, policymakers, forest officials are necessary for its conservation, said researchers. Kiran Choudaj, PhD student at department of Zoology at SPPU said that he decided to work on this topic for his PhD thesis and started exploring different reasons for the decline in the number of bird species in exotic plantations. “I carried out work for two years (2017-2019) over the five hills in the city, that are, Chaturshringi, Vetal, Bavdhan reserve forest, Pashan-Baner, Pachgaon-Parvati (Taljai tekdi). During this study, we observed a total of 86 bird species in savanna patches and 38 bird species in exotic plantations. Grassland birds such as Jungle Bush Quail, Jacobin Cuckoo, Shrikes, Indian Roller, White-bellied Minivet, Pipit, Rosefinch, Buntings were absent in exotic plantations. Higher percentage of omnivore birds while lower percentage of predator and herbivore bird species were seen in exotic plantations, as compared to Savanna vegetation,” said Choudaj. He further added that the study observed that there were only four migratory bird species in exotic plantations which was found to be very less as compared to 14 bird species which were seen in original vegetation. “In exotic plantations, Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), African Blackwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon) and River Tamarind ( Leucaena leucocephala) were the abundant exotic plant species present. Gliricidia was the most dominant and densely planted species over savanna vegetation. Its allelopathic secretions have herbicidal and insecticidal activities which have reduced grass and herb cover which was present before in those regions. River Tamarind also secretes allelopathy secretions and is regarded as one of the world’s worst invasive plant species. Thus, due to the decrease in the grass-herb cover there is a decrease in the animals that are dependent on it, ultimately leading to decrease in the bird species,” said Choudaj. The guide to the study, Varsha Wankhade, associate professor with the department of Zoology at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) said that common citizens perceive the savanna patches as of low conservation value compared to the plantations. “One key reason is that the citizens think that these savanna patches are manmade and thus not ancient. The citizens believe in the myth of existence of a ‘thick forest’ sometime back in history, which was degraded by humans and now we get the savanna patches. Emerging research shows that savanna patches are not ‘degraded forests’, savannas existed even before humans started using them. Global and Pune savannas is quite ancient. These remnant savanna patches are slow to recover once destroyed by plantations. Destroyed savanna patches require at least a century or more of time to recover their plant species richness in that case weedy plant species have the ability to thrive in recovering savanna but some of the savanna species may not recover easily. This implies that little savanna patches which have been left must be preserved at any cost and to conserve these patches some of the savanna specialist birds should be used as mascots,” said Wankhade. She added that birds like the Yellow-wattled Lapwing and White-bellied Minivet can be used as canvas for saving these grassy patches. “Awareness and sensitization about these grassy habitats among citizens, planters, managers and policymakers are necessary for the conservation of these unique habitats,” said Wankhade. Kiran Choudaj and Varsha Wankhade published one more article in the journal of Threatened Taxa, titled ‘Changed avian assemblage of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) campus in the last four decades. “In this study, we tried to assess the bird diversity of the SPPU campus and Khadki pond which is adjacent to campus in two time periods 1976 and 2018. In 2018, we failed to notice 34 bird species out of 90 bird species listed for campus and pond in 1976. A major reason for the decline in bird diversity is due to changes in the campus habitat from low scrub jungle, fallow lands and grassland to buildings, roads, and exotic plantations. Increased human settlement surrounding the campus is also one of the contributing factors for the decline in bird species on the campus. Khadki pond was a perennial pond, now transformed into the seasonal pond that has been overtaken by natural vegetation due to blockage of water channels,” said Choudaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rampant-exotic-plantations-have-reduced-avian-diversity-across-pune-study-101620577575092.html

The latest animals to be treated were pangolin which was found in Raigad and a hyena in Nashik. According to Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest, “The work done at TTC is rapidly getting known through the district now that there have been 70 animals rescued and treated at the centre. The rescue and release of the pangolin from wildlife traffickers who had kept her tied in a jute bag for days, with help from Satara and Junnar forest divisions and the RESQ team travelled a long distance where they hiked deep inside the forest to release the pangolin at a safe and secure location.” The Wildlife Transit Treatment Centre has 16 mammals which includes Indian Hyena, Indian Jackals, Pangolin, Barking Deer and several monkeys, 14 reptiles which includes different species of turtles, tortoises and some injured snakes under recovery and 40 birds - Bonellis Eagles, Eurasian Eagle Owls, Spotted Owlets, Black Shouldered Kites, Parakeets and several others. The team also managed to save 37 Star-Back Tortoises from Pune and Thane Forest Department that were repatriated in Chandrapur near Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) after a 16-hour journey by road. “Several forest departments send animals to us from outside Pune division. Either orphans for special rehabilitate or critical cases needing surgery and intensive post-operative treatment and care,” said Sumedh Tarde, RESQ volunteer. “Wildlife comes to us in very critical condition or as orphans, and their treatment and rehabilitation is challenging. Some are more resilient and some are very sensitive. Our rehabilitation success rate which is based on how many fully recover and go back to their natural habitat varies between 60-85 per cent based on species,” said Neha Panchamia, founder RESQ Charitable Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/resq-transit-centre-treats-animals-beyond-district-borders-101620577393967.html

09-05-2021||Pune||Forest department working to prevent repeat of 2019 flash floods||In order to prevent flash floods this monsoon, the department of forest has taken an initiative to create bunds and check dams atop Taljai Hills. The department has been working on the behest of local corporators and guardian minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who wrote to the authorities to find solutions to avoid 2019 flash floods. “We were approached by the local corporator and some local residents living near Taljai who requested if the forest department could do something to avoid the flash floods that caused destruction in 2019. Initially, we asked the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to look into the matter after conducting a survey, but the authorities said that the hill was in our jurisdiction, hence we thought of an environmental, sustainable and ecological friendly concept that could benefit the entire city,” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests. According to Patil, the forest department began their survey a month ago and are now clearing the Taljai hill of Gliricidia which is a medium size leguminous tree of zero bio-gradable value and instead plant native plants. “There are JCBs at work also to create small and medium bunds and check dams to help control the water flowing down towards the city. We have around two hectares of these trees to be cleared and plant native plants which will help in percolating rainwater.” Several societies are directly hampered by the water flowing downhill from Taljai hill, Savarkar Society, Sahakar Nagar and others. Suresh Buddhisagar, resident of Savarkar Society said, “We faced problems two years ago due to the illegal compound wall constructions allowed by PMC in the area surrounding us. Until the 70s, our society was the last one to be built officially. Now this area has undergone a lot of changes with several illegal constructions built over natural water outlets of Taljai hills.” According to Buddhisagar, the PMC constructed concrete roads which blocked the water outlets, choking the drainage system. The water now flows on the road consequently causing flood water to rise and breach compound walls, causing the water gush into houses. “This flow further connects to the nallah near Gajanan Maharaj temple. There is no proper provision of maintaining the water overflow. There are number of nallahs in this area which further connects to Ambil Odha. However, due to mismanagement of rainwater disbursement and illegal construction of slums near Taangwala Society, Lakshminagar area resulted in the Ambil odha Crisis. After writing to officials, we finally got the local corporators to look into the matters and the forest department is now building check dams so that the water atop in the quarry at Taljai does not percolate downhill,” said Buddhisagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/forest-department-working-to-prevent-repeat-of-2019-flash-floods-101620577274054.html
09-05-2021||Pune||Indian women’s rugby team captain Vahbiz Bharucha optimistic of the sport’s future||Last month, right in the middle of the pandemic, Pune was at the peak of a devastating debacle due to Covid-19. Regardless of the situation, city-based physiotherapist Vahbiz Bharucha, who is the captain of the Indian women’s rugby team, had to mark her presence in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). On April 10, a squad of 12 women from the national rugby team, along with 12 other local Kashmiri women players, had come together to accomplish a collective goal at Srinagar’s sprawling TRC turf ground. “For the past few months, the Indian Rugby Football Union (IRFU), aka Rugby India (the nodal body for rugby in India) has been holding multiple discussions with the union sports minister Kiren Rijiju, primarily seeking support to scale up the sport’s position nationally but due to poor representation of the game in mainstream media, Rijiju wasn’t too confident about where the team stood in terms of its performance and merit. He wanted to check whether the players were really promising enough. So, he asked us to show up at Srinagar and play an exhibition match, which would help him make a judgment,” informs Bharucha, when asked about the reason for the team’s J&K expedition. She adds that on behalf of IRFU, the team also made a couple of presentations, and she feels, from the looks of it, Rijiju seemed impressed. “He shared some encouraging updates about the exhibition matches on his social media platforms. This has sent out an optimistic message for us. However, we haven’t yet heard from the ministry in an official capacity,” she said.The women from the team are scattered across different pockets of India, from Delhi to Siliguri, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, and Patna, and so on. Back from Srinagar, and Vahbiz, just like the other teammates, has been busy prepping for the nationals. “I try to clock in about two-and-a-half hours of fitness training daily. Rugby demands a lot of speed, stamina, focus, and strength—everything packed into one individual. I focus on running and bodyweight workouts—there’s a lot of endurance, power, agility and speed that I am focusing on,” she marks, adding that the team has a set of coaches in South Africa and Mumbai, and they regularly determine fitness targets and exercise regimens for the girls. The anticipated timeline for the nationals would’ve been somewhere between the end of May to June but there’s no confirmation on that front so far,” she said. Sounding slightly apprehensive, Bharucha said, “We are not sure if the nationals are going to happen, given the Covid-19 havoc in the country. Also, if the matches happen, the funds required would go up significantly as all the safety guidelines, and quarantine rules would have to be adhered to. Let’s see what happens.”For the team, the immediate plan of action may not be too clear but what remains undeterred despite all the odds is the team’s preparedness to hit the ground running. As the captain of the team, Bharucha believes in leading by example. “Thanks to social media, the team is connected. I make sure I regularly post videos and pictures of my workouts, training, and diet. Of course, if need be, I also lend a listening ear to any teammate, who wishes to talk to me about any challenges in achieving the fitness goals,” she said. Bharucha is certain that good times are in store for the game in the coming future, given the rising numbers of women players. “Serious participation and awareness about the sport are going up steadily over the years. Also, the state of Odisha recently struck a partnership with IRFU, with a view to develop rugby as a professional sport in India. This is so reassuring,” she smiled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/indian-women-s-rugby-team-captain-vahbiz-bharucha-optimistic-of-the-sport-s-future-101620577213922.html

09-05-2021||Pune||PMC ward offices, departments disobey standing committee’s decision on expenditure||Despite Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) standing committee’s decision to cut down 10 per cent amounts from capital works, ward offices and heads of various departments are not following order. Now, the chief account of the corporation has instructed all ward offices and departments to follow the order to raise funds for Covid-19. On the other hand, civic activists have raised questions on spending on health infrastructure in the annual budget allocation. In 2020, PMC had taken a decision to cut down 20 per cent on various developments. Last year, the PMC utilized more than ₹150 crore on the development of health infrastructure related to Covid-19. In 2021-22, the civic body allocated around ₹350 crore to set up oxygen producing plants and oxygen bed Covid centres, purchasing Remdesivir injection, ventilators, and medicines. Most of the funds were diverted from project works. When the standing committee has taken decisions to divert big budget development work, ward offices and various departments are utilizing funds on the minor works such as repairing food paths, changing drainage and water lines, changing paver blocks in each ward office area. Taking cognizance of spending on minors works, PMC chief account has issued an order to all departments and ward offices to consider standing committee decision to cut down 10 per cent development works while floating tenders and carrying out development works. Ulka Kalsakar, PMC chief accountant officer said, “At present, Covid-19 patients are increasing gradually. The state has imposed a partial lockdown. We need funds to control the Covid-19 and use funds to purchase masks, foods for quarantine patients, to spend funds on purchasing medical equipment and provide medical service. We will have to secure a certain amount of funds so that it can be used for medical emergencies.” “Standing committee has already given permission to cut down 10 per cent funds on capital work. However, the order is not followed by the ward officers and department heads. So, we have issued orders to keep in mind while issuing tenders, work orders and issuing tender advertisements. We don’t know how much we will need in the future to spend on health related issues, so it is advisable to make financial arrangements right now,” she added. Civic activist questions spending on health infrastructure On the other hand, civic activists have raised questions on the spending on health infrastructure by PMC. They have said that PMC is spending crores of the budgets on minor and non-essential work such as changing paver blocks, cement concretisation of lanes, seating benches and footpath repair work instead of health infrastructure. Vivek Velankar, civic activist said, “Every year, PMC spends crores of funds on non-essential works. This year, the corporation has approved an annual budget of ₹7,500 crore. It is an inflated budget, and they are also using footpath repair and concretization by lanes. It should stop.” “According to Velankar, due to spending on non-productive work, PMC has embarrassed itself in the high court over the health infrastructure issue. “PMC lawyer submitted an affidavit in Bombay high court that PMC doesn’t have financial capacity to spend on health infrastructure as compared to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Actually, that is not the case. PMC has enough funds, but they are not using it on infrastructure issues,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-ward-offices-departments-disobey-standing-committee-s-decision-on-expenditure-101620577034002.html

The road will bypass from Trimurti chowk to Maitri chow in Katraj. The road work has been pending since 2017 due to land-related issues. The dairy has a milk outlet on the spot from where the connecting road passes. The civic body has promised that it would pay them ₹1.60 crore as compensation for demolishing eight houses on the road. A fencing wall at the cost of ₹56 lakh would be constructed and the 200-metre road will be constructed at the cost of ₹2.50 crore.Area corporator Yuvraj Beldare who spearheaded the work and had set a target of four months for road completion said, “A lot of follow-up was done and it was due to the intervention of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar that issue was sorted out. Once the road fund is sanctioned, work on the stretch will begin soon.”Beldare said that the issue was stuck due to unreasonable demands of the dairy administration and PMC officials were ready with a win-win plan. Ultimately the issue has been resolved, he claimed.Sanjay Bhosale, an area resident said, “The new road will reduce traffic and sort out the commuting problems of the residents. It’s a positive step in right direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-complete-connecting-road-via-katraj-dairy-101620573013767.html

Citizens have complained that the slots do not open at a fixed time and even when they do, they fill up within minutes of opening. Some have stated that bots and apps have been put in place to alert citizens regarding opening of slots which makes it difficult for others to get a vaccination appointment.Since vaccination opened up for those aged between 18 and 44 years from May 1, Pune city has had to shut down vaccination for four days for all those aged above 45 years. This was done primarily because of the vaccine shortage. Although the app has been designed by the central government, local authorities have to open up slots and create sessions at vaccination centres depending on stock. In Pune city, the PMC does not have an official means of communicating with the citizens, unlike Mumbai, which has an official Twitter handle which posts daily updates. On Sunday, additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal stated: “For those aged between 18 to 44 years, Covid vaccination is planned at 6 centres tomorrow (Monday). Covishield will be available at two centres and Covaxin at 4 centres. Appointment/slot booking will start at pm and only citizens who have got prior appointments would be vaccinated. Vaccination is planned for citizens above 45 years of age at 111 centres tomorrow. Covishield will be available at 101 centres and Covaxin will be available at 10 centres. The second dose will be given only to the citizens who have taken the first dose before April 12, 2021 at the 10 centres where Covaxin is available. Citizens who took the first dose before March 22, 2021 will be given priority at centres where Covishield is available. Also, the first dose will be given to 20% of citizens who come as per appointment.”A senior PMC health official said, “The slots are created according to the availability of the vaccine which is not regular. The vaccines which the centre sends are available for those aged above 45, while the ones the state purchases are reserved for those aged between 18-44 years of age, and so, slots are created accordingly. “In rural Pune, the Zilla Parishad has given the authority to taluka heads to book slots depending on vaccine availability. ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “Rural areas are not places with nothing. In rural areas like Lonavala, Hinjewardi, Baramati and Chakan, everyone is using smartphones and so people book and see the list online just like everywhere else. The authority to book the slots has been given to the talukas and there is no fixed time, but the mechanism is very efficient in rural Pune.”However, despite all efforts, the district’s vaccination rate has fallen down in comparison to what was expected. While Pune had aimed to vaccinate 0.1 million people daily, on Saturday, only close to 7,000 people got the jab. Aniket Kasabe, who has been looking for a slot said, “As soon as i got the letter I went online to check it but the slots are not opened up. They say it will open up by 8pm but since the past few days I have been glued to my computer to book the slot, but within minutes it says all booked.” Another beneficiary due his second dose, Sushil Joshi said, “There are many people above 45 years of age who are waiting for their second dose of Covaxin. Authorities in Pune are prioritizing the 18 to 44 year age group. This is a waste of the first dose for the 45+ group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/irregular-slot-booking-process-has-45-age-group-fretting-over-second-vaccine-dose-101620570313513.html

Bureaucracy and Police act as per wishes of Badal Family, more often than listening to our MLAs and Party workers. Govt run not for welfare of the People, but for continuing control of Mafia Raj (sic),” alleged Sidhu in a Tweet post on Sunday.The former minister has been critical of his own government ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed a special investigation team (SIT) probe report into the police firing incident, which had taken place in Faridkot district during a protest against the desecration of a religious text and left two men dead. On Saturday, Sidhu had said the government was forced to accept the HC order due to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s “incompetence”, and claimed that giving six months to the new SIT to compete the probe will further “extend the delay” in delivering justice to the victims.Responding to his unrelenting attack, the Punjab CM had earlier called the Sidhu’s outbursts “total indiscipline”, suggesting that he may be leaving for the Aam Aadmi Party.The Congress had in the run-up to the 2017 assembly polls promised to take strict action against those guilty in the firing case. The new three-member SIT formed on Friday is headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badals-not-capt-govt-ruling-punjab-sidhu-101620568093914.html

In addition to that, some corporates have pledged additional financial support for the oxygen plant. The plant will ensure round-the-clock oxygen supply to the ICU and patients in need, allowing 350 oxygen beds to be managed successfully. Additionally, the plant will have an oxygen storage tank with a capacity of 0.2 million litres.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “The MP will be allotting ₹25 lakh for the new plant. Also, some prominent corporates committed to help us set up the plant. As of today, there are a number of challenges for oxygen cylinder replenishments. The in-house facility will give us strength to serve an increased number of patients at the hospital.” Former PCB vice-president Vinod Mathurawala said that board was purchasing oxygen cylinders at the price of ₹30,000 each with a daily requirement of 125 cylinders.“With the commissioning of the plant, it would become hassle-free as oxygen supply is guaranteed. This will boost the capacity to protect more lives from the Cantonment area,” he said.The PCB hospital has a dedicated Covid treatment ward with a capacity of 125 patients, in addition to 18 beds in the ICU. All the beds are currently occupied.Social activist Manjett Singh Virdi , president of Camp-based MS Virdi foundation said, “The oxygen plant will ensure 24-hour oxygen supply and it will play a key role in the board mission to treat and save lives of patients.

Even shop owners stayed open with shutters half down or back doors open, which led to crowding outside the shops.Similar scenes were noticed on internal roads, where vegetable vendors drew the crowds. During the weekend, starting from Friday 8 pm till Monday 7 am, all non-essential shops are to remain closed, except medical stores. Milk delivery is allowed in the morning hours. Speaking anonymously, the owner of a mutton shop in Katraj area said, “Sunday is our main day to do business and most of our customers come to buy meat only on Sunday, so we cannot keep the shop shut. Due to this weekend lockdown we are facing a lot of difficulties. On one side customers call us to get meat and then, we have to manage it with shutters down.”There eight chicken and mutton vendors in the Katraj area near the Dattanagar chowk. When the local police came to know about the crowds, they immediately rushed to the spot to close down the shops. “Meat shops should remain open on the weekend, as lots of people plan to eat non-vegetarian food only on weekends. Also vegetable shops and roadside vendors should also be allowed. I got one kg of mutton from my regular shop, but from the backdoor,” said Vipul Alekar a resident of Hadapsar. Another resident, Sachin Alande, said, “We prefer to eat chicken every Sunday, and in this situation protein is a good option. When I went to the nearby shop to buy chicken it was closed, but then I contacted the owner and he called me to another place. Now some restrictions need to be relaxed as the Covid cases are dropping.”Talking about this weekend lockdown restrictions, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “During weekend only emergency services are allowed and medical shops, all other essential shops or vegetable and fruit vendors should remain closed. If anyone is opening the shops then they will be penalised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chicken-mutton-vendors-beat-weekend-lockdown-with-half-shutter-downs-101620567493350.html

The cub is suspected to have been killed by another adult tigress T-124, also known as Riddhi, in a territorial fight.A month back on April 1, a five-month-old tiger cub was found dead in Gandhra Deh area of RTR in mutilated condition. In the post-mortem, canine marks were found on its neck and the forest officials then said they suspected it was killed by another tiger.Additional conservator of forest Sanjiv Sharma on Sunday said this cub’s neck was broken and there were many injuries on the body, which was sent for a post-mortem.Sharma said the cub was one of the four born to tigress T-102 in August 2020. He suspected this cub might have separated from her mother last night and entered another tigress’ territory. They suspect that other tigress to be Ridhi, who was spotted moving in the area.“We were on routine patrolling today and spotted two tigers running, little ahead we spotted the cub’s body with a broken neck and injuries and [realised that it had been] dragged,” he said.Another forest official said the area where the cub’s body was found is the juncture of territories of tigress T-102 and T-124. He said four tigresses: T-84 (arrowhead), her two daughters Ridhi (T-124) and Sidhi (T-125), and T-102 (the mother of the dead cub) move in zone 3, 4 and 5 of the RTR. “In RTR, the issue is of territory. The Reserve has crossed its carrying capacity, now either there will be fights related to territory or migration of tigers, which then will be difficult to track outside the protected area,” he said.The official claimed that since November 2020 to January 2021, the daughters of tigress Arrowhead – Ridhi and Sidhi have fought for territory at least five times.Retired IFS Sunanyan Sharma said RTR was overpopulated and the tigers will either move out to other forests; get into territorial fights, which could lead to even deaths; or move towards villages, where they could be poisoned.He said the only solution for effective tiger conservation is relocation, after developing the habitat.RTR’s 76 tigers including 21 cubs and sub-adults live in an area of 1,334 square kms, making it the third most congested habitat for the big cats in India after Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam.The ‘Status of Tigers in India-2018’ report said that Rajasthan has witnessed an increase in tiger population by 115% in the last 12 years.In a major setback to tiger conservation in Rajasthan, four tigers including two sub-adults were reported missing from RTR in March 2021. The administration had conducted intensive search for these missing tigers, which were not sighted for the past year, without success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/tiger-cub-killed-in-rajasthan-s-ranthambore-tiger-reserve-in-territorial-fight-101620563593903.html
09-05-2021||Mumbai||Role of private doctors crucial in fight against Covid-19: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday stressed on the role of private doctors, specially family physicians, in the fight against Covid-19, saying they can help in early diagnosis of the infection in their patients and facilitate timely treatment for them.Addressing around 700 private doctors from across the state during a meeting held via video conference, Thackeray appealed to them to join hands with the state administration to curb spread of the viral infection.Thackeray said if family physicians keep a check on the treatment of their patients in home isolation and update ward officers regularly, the civic body concerned can make arrangements for their further treatment in a proper way."Family doctors play an important role. If they guide the patients at the initial stage of the infection, it will be helpful to curb the virus spread. They can identify symptoms and check whether a patient is asymptomatic or needs hospitalisation," he said.The CM said family doctors should focus on patients in home isolation so that if required, they can be shifted to hospitals timely.He appealed to private doctors to register themselves with the Covid-19 care centres and jumbo field hospitals in their localities and visit the facilities for consultation.It is necessary to have uniformity in the treatment protocol, he added.Thackeray also said the state's oxygen production capacity is 1,270 metric tonne, but due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the demand has risen to 1,700 MT."We have prepared short and long-term plans to become self-sufficient in oxygen and the enhanced production capacity of the life-saving gas will be realised soon," he said.During the meeting, the state government's task force of medical experts, comprising Sanjay Oak, Shashank Joshi, Rahul Pandit, Tatyarao Lahane and others, informed private medical practitioners about Covid-19 treatment protocols.They told the doctors about use of steroids, importance of six-minute walk test, how to identify the need for giving oxygen, identifying reduction in oxygen level, treatment of mucormycosis-a fungal infection detected in Covid-19 survivors, use of key anti-viral drug Remdesivir and taking care of patients on ventilators.Thackeray said a paediatric task force is also being set up by the state government as experts are of the view that the third wave of Covid-19 could affect children.Around 700 private doctors participated the virtual meeting on Sunday, while 300 doctors had attended a meeting held some days back via video conference with Thackeray and the task force members, a statement issued by the Chief Minister's Office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/role-of-private-doctors-crucial-in-fight-against-covid-19-uddhav-thackeray-101620561996053.html
09-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Covid patient was sold ICU bed for ₹1.3l in Jaipur, nurse arrested||Rajasthan anti-corruption bureau (ACB) caught a male nurse of a private hospital red handed while receiving part payment of the ₹1.30 lakh he had sold an ICU bed for to a Covid-patient in a government hospital in Jaipur.The police suspect that a doctor and a male nurse at the government hospital could also be involved in selling hospital beds to kin of Covid patients needing emergency care. The arrest has underlined the sad reality of black marketing of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and life saving medicines at a time when an unprecedented rise in Covid infections has created a shortage of these essential medical supplies causing several deaths across the country.The case in Jaipur came to light after a man lodged a complaint with the ACB naming Ashok Gurjar, a nurse at a private hospital, as the man who sold him an ICU bed at the government-operated Rajasthan University of Health Sciences hospital for ₹1.30 Lakh. He said he was made to pay the first instalment amounting to ₹95,000 before his Covid infected wife was admitted to the ICU on Wednesday. She died within 48 hours of her admission on Friday; however, Gurjar kept calling him through the day demanding payment of the remaining ₹35,000 as part of the deal, said an ACB officer.The ACB set up a trap on Sunday evening and Gurjar was caught red-handed while accepting ₹23,000 from the complainant. The bureau said it was investigating the nature of his links with another male nursing staff at the RUHS, who introduced the complainant to Gurjar in the first place. It was also probing the role of a doctor posted in the ICU of the government hospital, who too has been accused of taking his cut of ₹50,000 from the total bribe amount, said the ACB officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-covid-patient-was-sold-icu-bed-for-rs-1-3l-in-jaipur-nurse-arrested-101620561433700.html
09-05-2021||Pune||Your Space: Timely test results will help check Covid-19 spread||Residents are getting the results of RT-PCR, test for diagnosing Covid-19, as late as after five days in some cases, as it has become mandatory for selected workforce and residents are also coming forward to give swab samples. While the delay in getting test results poses risk of spread of the virus, what steps should authorities take to streamline the system and ensure timely delivery of diagnosis report? Increase testing centresDelayed RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test results are causing a lot of hardship to people. Flights are missed and asymptomatic people pose risk of Covid infection spread. The government should set up more testing centres and take steps to speed up the process for timely release of results. Also, they must have rapid antigen testing (RAT) done to identify positive cases and contain the spread. It’s because of the delay that people are resorting to fake reports.Mehzabin Saiyed Zilla parishad should arrange testing campsTo undergo RT-PCR test was a challenge in our neighbourhood. There are private players who were overloaded since the government mandated the test for all staff and vendors. Hardly any private partner was taking samples. The situation improved when the Covid test mandate was removed. The cost charged by private vendors is more than the government regulated rates. Few vendors are charging ₹1,000.We request the zilla parishad to set up more testing centres, mobile vans for RT-PCR and antigen testing near big housing societies or at ward level. This will serve the purpose of getting tests done at the earliest and avoid delays which may worsen with respect to infected residents and their close contacts.We also struggled to get our workforce, housekeeping staff and security tested. Even the gram panchayat team approached us that they will conduct door-to-door test for residents who show symptoms, but later denied due to shortage of staff. We appreciate if testing resources and manpower is increased by the zilla parishad.Girish RaghuwanshiDelay in test results affected our businessFollowing the directive from authorities for mandatory RT-PCR test for hotel staff, we arranged our staff to undergo the Covid test. However, the reports came after four days as the lab cited overload of cases. This long delay affected our business and caused apprehension among staff. It would be better if the agencies concerned launch mobile van facility for carrying out the Covid tests and release results in time.Vaidehi SuryavanshiTest is sometimes bothersome for residentsRT-PCR is just a formality asked by hospitals and families are pressurised to get it done if they want to admit their already sick members. I understand that the medical facilities are also under pressure, but why put that on our heads. It is obvious that a person will seek admission only because his symptoms are worst and yet the hospitals will admit only after the test. Doing the test is fine, but the time lost in getting the result is bad for those suffering. People are afraid and it would be better if the officials ease off on not asking for these tests when the patient is getting worse and symptoms can be visibly seen.Shumita MahajanTest should only be for symptomatic casesGiven the present huge turnaround time for RT-PCR tests, the recent guideline by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) to enable rapid antigen test (RAT) for non-symptomatic and inter-state travellers should be strictly followed, as RAT is time efficient. RT-PCR should be applied only for symptomatic cases, thereby reducing the load on diagnostic centres. The local authorities should also find viable ways to cut down the time lag between sample collection at hospitals and transporting to the testing lab. Very few hospitals have their own in-house test facility.Hary KurupSelf-discipline should be top prioritySelf-discipline in following the Corona protocol and vaccination is the best way to restrict the spread of Covid. Imposing RT-PCR tests on all and sundry will result in overload of system and might deprive those who urgently need to test. We need to identify and set up micro containment zones and enforce strict regulations for these zones.Col KD Pendharkar (retd)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-timely-test-results-will-help-check-covid-19-spread-101620557173437.html
09-05-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: A solo act play, on stage and online, hits home social message||One of the last plays that I saw live, in a theatre, was “Every Brilliant Thing”. This was in 2019. Weird. Yes. But let’s move on, shall we? Even though it’s nearly two years since I watched it, the play is still fresh in my head. This statement is meant more for the play than my ability to remember things. Adapted from the eponymous play written by Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahoe, the Indian version was adapted and directed by Quasar Thakore Padamsee and produced by Toral Shah and Vivek Rao of theatre company QTP. Vivek Madan is the protagonist and the only actor who has rehearsed the play! We’ll get to the details in sometime.Before the play begins, Vivek walks amongst the audience. Chats with them informally. He hands a few people some chits with a seemingly random number written on it and requests them to open it only when he calls out that number. Once everyone has arrived and is seated, he walks to the centre of the stage and addresses everyone and the play starts. Just this structure of interacting with the audience beforehand diminishes the line between pre-show and actual performance. You are a part of the atmosphere from the moment you enter the auditorium. The story starts with a seven-year-old boy, finding out that his mother has just tried to take her own life. It starts with him asking his father a series of “why?”, because naturally a seven-year-old hasn’t understood the reason behind this act. “Every Brilliant Thing” is an interactive piece of theatre. So, Vivek asks an audience member to play his seven-year-old self and he plays his father. The person playing the son just responds with a “why?” to every explanation that Vivek, as a father, can give. Most adults have a hard time understanding what depression is, let alone a seven-year-old child. So, in whatever he grasps from that situation, he starts making a list for his mother. A list of every beautiful thing he has encountered. He decides to make a list of hundred things first. When he realises that there is so much beauty around, he continues with the list well beyond the hundred. While the subject of the play is extremely serious, the writing and presentation isn’t. But it is this combination that hits the message home!The protagonist grows up, makes friends, gets into a relationship, gets married and continues his dialogue with his parents. All other characters are played by members of the audience picked by Vivek. I wasn’t aware about this format till I watched the play and it was one of the best evenings I had experienced in a long time. The crowd that day was sensitive, some were even natural actors. It was a cathartic experience and it made me understand what a few of my friends might be going through in real life. I even gifted a ticket to one of them for the next show.Once we entered the new normal, Quasar and company took this play online. As far as I know, Quasar wasn’t too keen as he belongs to the group of people who doesn’t consider online performances as “theatre”. But he was convinced that the need to discuss this subject during the lockdown was extremely important and they decided to go ahead with a limited run. I bought a ticket for my entire family and watched it with them. The play had been adapted again for the online performance – with Vivek at his house in Bengaluru, Quasar and the technical team in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Lucknow! It was a good show but like any other play, I felt the impact was a lot better when I watched it live.But what was different about the online performance was that after the show there was a two-minute break and the audience was asked to stay behind to have a conversation. And the producers had made sure that the conversation was conducted by a psychologist. This sensitivity towards the material and the subject was new to me! The producers understood that many of the audience members might be isolated, probably out of work and also dealing with their personal demons.

09-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 lockdown extended till May 17, stricter enforcement promised||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced the extension of the ongoing lockdown in Delhi by another week and promised to tighten its enforcement while ordering complete suspension of metro rail services this week, citing the need to control the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 cases in the capital and scale up the health infrastructure proportionately.“In the last few days, we spoke with large sections of people – men, women, youngsters, traders, etc. The larger public opinion suggests that we cannot let our guards down now. So, we are forced to increase the lockdown by another week for the safety of people,” Kejriwal said, making it clear that saving lives was a bigger priority right now. “If we survive, we can think of economic recovery in later stages,” he said.The current lockdown, which was earlier supposed to end at 5 am on Monday, May 10, has now been extended till 5 am May 17 through an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) at 12 noon on Sunday. DDMA is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and CM Kejriwal is its vice chairperson.“We have also decided that now enforcement of the lockdown will be scaled up and metro services will remain completely shut down. I am sure people will follow all regulations,” Kejriwal added.Under the ongoing lockdown imposed since April 20, there are restrictions on general movement of people and economic activities in Delhi, with exemptions for essential services and goods with certain conditions. So far, the metro service was open for people engaged in the delivery of essential services.“On April 20, we were forced to impose a lockdown because of an unprecedented increase in Covid-19 cases. We were also running out of beds, ICUs, etc. On April 26, the positivity rate increased to 35%. After April 26, because of the lockdown, the situation slowly started improving. Positivity rate has now reduced to 23%... We cannot afford to go back to a worse situation from this stage. The situation has to be further controlled,” said the chief minister on Sunday.Delhi recorded 17,364 fresh Covid-19 cases and 332 deaths in the last 24 hours preceding the release of the health bulletin on Saturday. The national capital has lodged a total of 1,310,231 cases including 87,907 active cases and 19,071 related deaths. The test positivity rate for the disease is at 23.34% and the case fatality rate is 1.46%. In the last few days the number of infections recorded daily has come down along with the test positivity rate, making some health experts spot early signs of plateauing of the second wave which paralysed the health infrastructure with shortage of life saving medicines, oxygen, oxygenated beds, ICU beds and ventilators causing several deaths. The chief minister said Delhi had used the lockdown to strengthen the health infrastructure and it needed to continue.“...Now, the oxygen situation has slightly improved with interference of the Supreme court and Delhi high court and cooperation of the central government. The vaccine drive has also been expanded now. All arrangements are in place and turnout is high. There is a shortage of stock but we have sought help from the central government in this regard and we are sure this will be resolved soon,” he said.Apart from suspension of metro services, the DDMA has imposed a complete prohibition on organising any marriage ceremony at any hotel, banquet hall, marriage hall, or a public space. Marriages can happen only in court and in private spaces with (a) maximum gathering of 20 individuals, it said.“DJ, sound system, tentage, catering and similar kind of services will not be allowed for the marriage ceremony. Owners of the marriage halls, banquet halls, hotels, DJs, sound system, tentage, catering and other service providers will have to either return the advance amount paid by the customer for conducting marriage ceremony during curfew period or they will have to mutually agree to organise the marriage on a later date,” said the order.While, under an order issued on April 11, there was already a cap of 50 guests for marriages in Delhi, there was no clarity on how marriage ceremonies even with 50 guests could be organised after the lockdown was imposed on April 20. A senior government official, who did not wish to be identified, said that lack of clarity on the matter was leading to instances of violation of the DDMA orders related to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-lockdown-extended-till-may-17-cm-seeks-stricter-enforcement-101620547572873.html
09-05-2021||Delhi||Mother’s Day: Frontline warrior moms juggle work and family||It’s the second Mother’s Day that will be celebrated during the pandemic. While some may get to be with their mothers today, there are some others whose mothers are frontline warriors, and will head out for a regular day away from their children, to fight the battle against coronavirus. Hear from some such Delhi-NCR based mothers, on how challenging yet fulfilling it has been to juggle home and work during the pandemic. There is fieldwork involved but I try to keep my kids safe: JyotiFor Jyoti, Inspector Investigation at Chanakyapuri, the pandemic has been the toughest part of her 14 year career in Delhi Police. “Even though we were vaccinated on priority, there is always a fear of spreading the infection at home. I was put on announcement duty in various Covid containment areas and small localities. While I sanitise everything the minute I go home, I know I have to go back to work the next day and face the same risk. But it’s a part of the job. Duty is duty,” says Jyoti adding that while her seniors are supportive, spending long hours away from her kids is hard. “I have two daughters — one in 10th and the other in 5th standard — who have been my strength through this time. I wish I could spend more time with them, but they know their mum is a Covid warrior, and they are happy to see me work, which is the best Mother’s Day gift!” she says. As a lactating mother, it’s hard to be away from my baby: Rakhi JohnPosted in the gynaecology Covid ward at AIIMS Delhi, nurse Rakhi John has been doing alternate shifts with her husband, who is also posted at the same hospital. In order to take care of their two daughters — the younger one being barely a year old — John has been juggling between her professional duties and motherhood responsibilities with extreme care. She says, “If my husband does morning shifts, I do evening shifts. I’m constantly worried about infecting my kids, and this is after I wear a PPE kit with masks and shield all day! As a lactating mother, it’s hard to be away from my baby. But amid the pandemic, healthcare workers like us have a responsibility and I can’t shirk away from it! Simply being able to come home each day to my kids in the current scenario feels like a blessing!”It has been 14 months since I got a welcome hug at the door: Dr Sarika Verma “At our dining table we have a ‘no phone rule’. But, over the last one year, I’ve been taking 4-5 calls even when in the middle of dinner as I can’t ignore them. Though my kids are young, they are aware of what I do... It has been 14 months since I got a welcome hug at the door when I’m back from the clinic. They know I’ve to sanitise myself and take bath first,” says Dr Sarika Verma, a Gurugram-based ENT surgeon. “As an ear, nose and throat specialist, we are seeing and treating Covid patients all day. I have a strict process; I wear surgical gown, masks, face shield and gloves. All this is to keep my kids safe since this wave is infecting younger generation as well. I know my kids might have some plans for Mother’s Day, but the fact that they are mature, independent and allow me to do my job without stress, brings me immense joy,” adds Verma.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mothers-day-frontline-warrior-moms-juggle-work-and-family-101620546255909.html

Most pharmacists across the capital said they were struggling to meet their daily requirements even when paying whole-sellers or warehouses in advance.Akhilesh Kumar runs a medical store near Phulwari Sharif railway station, said not enough medicines were available for Covid-19 patients in home isolation. “We are getting barely half of [our total] demand from whole sellers at Govind Mitra Road. The stock generally runs out in the afternoon,” he said.An Apollo Pharma retailer located on Ashiyana Road said the situation of supply from Kolkata-based warehouses was no better. “Doxycycline tablets are unavailable for the past two days, while Ivermectin is running out,” said Shankar Kumar, adding he hoped to get some emergency medicines from the local wholesaler the next day.Ramjeet Kushwaha, who owns a medical store near Jagdeo Path, said the supply of Azithromycin and Ivermectin was disrupted for the past one week. “I have never faced a scarcity of basic medicines like this. Even Paracetamol tablets are going off the shelf quite fast...,” he said.Bharati Kumari, a homemaker from Rukanpura, said she had to visit at least five-six drug stores daily to arrange for medicines for her husband who is under treatment in home isolation. “Unlike other medical necessities like oxygen or Remdesivir injections, which are selling at exorbitant prices, medicines are available on maximum retail price (MRP),” she said.the positivity rate has gone up past 15% in the state while recovery has plummeted to 78-79%, increasing the mortality rate.Raids were being conducted across Bihar to stop the black marketing of oxygen cylinders and life saving drugs by unscrupulous traders and middlemen.

He even did not forward reports of DGP, West Bengal police, and CP Kolkata police sent to him on May 3," he said."While State faces worst post-election violence- people being made to pay with their lives and freedom only for having exercised right to vote in a democracy, Chief Secretary of Manata Banerjee government comes up with an alibi for not briefing Governor. Directed him to comply by 7 PM today," Governor said in another tweet.In a statement attached with the tweet, Dhankhar said, "there can be no sane takers for the response of CS (as conveyed to ACS to governor) that since the matter is before HC it will be inappropriate for CS to brief Governor. As per CS stand is as per CM directive."He said West Bengal is facing the "worst post-election violence" where people are being made to pay with their lives and freedom only for having "exercised the right to vote in democratic and state apparatus has virtually abandoned lawful obligation""No input to the constitutional head makes a mockery of the constitution and rule of law. CS stance is shocking to reflect the least and unexpected of a member rpd service to which he belongs. CS be directed to comply and desist from the unconstitutional and undemocratic stand," he added.The MHA has deputed a four-member team, led by an Additional Secretary level official and including a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) official, to visit the affected areas and assess the ground situation.Violence has been reported in several parts of West Bengal after the results of the assembly elections were declared on May 2. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that nine of its party workers have been killed in the post-poll violence.

09-05-2021||Delhi||23 Covid-19 patients missing, Delhi's Hindu Rao Hospital says||At least 23 Covid-19 patients admitted at north Delhi’s Hindu Rao Hospital have reportedly gone missing from the hospital between April 19 and May 6, confirmed officials from the hospital administration and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.Officials from the north corporation, which runs the hospital, said the 23 patients left without informing authorities. The hospital currently does not know whether these patients have taken admission in other Covid hospitals or have gone home.This is not the first time that the Hindu Rao Hospital has reported cases of patients who “left against medical advice.” Last year, between June 27 and July 18, five Covid-19 patients had left the hospital without informing authorities.Mayor of north corporation Jai Prakash said on Saturday the 23 patients did not go missing altogether and left on different dates. “In many cases, patients find better facilities in other hospitals and shift there. This happens in hospitals run by the Delhi government also. The police have been informed so that we can trace the patients as they are Covid positive and can infect others,” said Prakash.Also read | Delhi has got SC-mandated oxygen quota only once, urge centre for more: SisodiaA senior police officer from north district, who did not wish to be named, however, said, “We have not been informed either by the hospital authorities or the concerned civic agency about the missing patients.”Around 800 patients have been admitted to Hindu Rao Hospital ever since it was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility on April 19.A senior doctor of Hindu Rao Hospital, who requested anonymity, said poor medical infrastructure and sanitation in the hospital has compelled many patients to move out as soon as they found better facilities. However, in this case, since the hospital does not know whether these patients have actually shifted to other facilities, there is a higher possibility for them to spread the infection. “Around mid-April, when people were desperately running around in search of beds, they were taking admission in any hospital available. But at a time when so many people are dying of the infection, everyone wants the best treatment and facility for their family and most people prefer private hospitals. There is a proper procedure for shifting patients to other hospitals,” said the doctor.Experts said that it was irresponsible of the authorities to be unaware of the whereabouts of Covid-19 patients at a time when the governments are grappling with a large number of cases.“There is a reason why Covid-19 patients are asked to isolate themselves from the people around them. This is a highly contagious disease and we still do not know the ways in which people are getting infected. So, it is imperative to contain the disease,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/23-covid-19-patients-missing-delhi-s-hindu-rao-hospital-says-101620508999812.html

He urged the Centre to streamline its processes and ensure that all states and union territories receive oxygen in better quantities so that states don’t have to fight for oxygen supply.Also read | Need 26 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses for Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal“It is my humble appeal to the government of India to increase Delhi’s oxygen allocation to 700MT as soon as possible. At present, Delhi requires a minimum of 700MT oxygen supply to cater to the patients admitted in hospitals. Further, an increase in Covid beds and health infrastructure will necessitate a total oxygen allocation of 976MT for Delhi... With this deficit, it would be hard to manage proper supply for all hospitals,” he said.Sisodia said 700MT of oxygen is the “bare minimum” required for Delhi, based on the Centre’s formula for allocating oxygen supply to hospitals and patient-wise data.“During court proceedings, the Centre claimed that India continues to receive a surplus in oxygen, with 10,000MT oxygen produced and 7,000-8,000MT consumed.

Other samples were negative. “I am told one of the vets at the safari has also tested positive,” he said.The IVRI has advised the safari to get all of its staff, including food suppliers, tested.According to officials familiar with the matter, in the absence of Covid protocol for infected animals, the treatment of the lionesses has started in consultation with veterinarians. Gauri had 104 degrees fever and Jennifer 105.6 degrees, said the official. It is suspected the transmission of the virus could have taken place through an asymptomatic carrier, said an official.“We will investigate the source of infection,” said the safari director.Earlier, eight Asiatic lions at the Hyderabad zoo tested positive, following which all parks and zoos were shut down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2-lionesses-test-covid-19-positive-at-up-safari-101620507556894.html

In such a situation, a door-to-door survey and distribution of medicine kits should be carried out, he said.This will enable timely examination of symptomatic patients and it will be easier to save lives by providing medicines at the initial stage of the infection, he added.Gehlot said experts are also anticipating a third wave of Covid-19 that could be more deadly. It is feared that it will affect children more.In view of this, infrastructure should be strengthened in children's hospitals. Intensive care facilities like NICU and PICU, etc., should be strengthened in these hospitals, he said.Health Minister Raghu Sharma suggested setting up oxygen plants at children's hospitals, too, to prepare the state for the potential third wave of the pandemic.Rajasthan recorded 160 Covid-19 fatalities and 17,987 fresh cases on Saturday that pushed the death toll to 5,506 and the infection tally to 7,38,786, according to an official report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-will-consider-importing-covid-19-vaccines-cm-ashok-gehlot-101620506601788.html

Three units are located in Dera Bassi and one each in Barnala, Nangal, and Tonsa and they will relocated to different hospitals in the state by May 30. . “We are working out the modalities with the owners of these privately owned (nitrogen) plants,” said PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg, adding that Prime Minister’s Office is coordinating with the board to make these plants operational at the earliest. Through these units, the state government is targeting daily production of 5MT, enough to fill 500 cylinders of 10-litre capacity. As many as 45 such plants have been identified countrywide for conversion and the Central Pollution Control Board is coordinating to import equipment from Germany. Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC) has identified three hospitals in Mohali, one each in Barnala, Nawanshahr and Nangal where these plants will be set up. All these hospitals are privately owned. According to principal secretary industries and commerce, Alok Shekhar, these plants should ideally be ready in two to three weeks. As per the plan, these plants will supply oxygen to the hospitals concerned and also fill cylinders for supply to other hospitals. The state’s daily requirement for oxygen is 280MT. “These plants will add negligible amount of life-saving oxygen, but a beginning has been made. We are also seeking capacity addition from the Centre,” said an officer in PHSC. There are 19 oxygen plants in the state out of which three are in Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Faridkot, and remaining 16 of varying capacities in other parts of the state. Oxygen plant a thrust area The Punjab government has declared oxygen production a thrust area as per the business development policy of 2017. “Our government has given approval for including oxygen production a thrust area for the state and we are giving a slew of sops for these units,” said Alok Shekhar. The promoters of these plants will get a waiver in GST, property tax, besides tax exemption in external development charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6-nitrogen-plants-in-punjab-to-converted-into-oxygen-units-by-may-30-101620506350169.html

In other parts of the district, however, there are 192 Covid patients currently on oxygen support at various government and private hospitals. With just 150 cylinders in its possession currently, the district health department is struggling to meet the demand for oxygen. Moga’s current oxygen requirement is 4.7 MT a day, against which it is getting only 3.5 MT. Oxygen plants based in Mandi Gobindgarh are ready to supply the life-saving gas to the district to meet the requirement, but the non-availability of empty cylinders is posing a challenge. When HT contacted, the supervisor of the quarantine facility for cops, inspector Gurpreet Singh, who is the station house officer of City police station, confirmed that the facility has 30 beds and five oxygen cylinders. “More can be arranged as per requirement. This facility is only for cops,” he said. SSMD Ayurvedic College and Hospital’s principal Dr PC Singla said the five oxygen cylinders at the facility have a combined capacity of 33 litres. Moga civil surgeon Amarpreet Kaur Bajwa said, “Doctor’s prescription is mandatory for getting oxygen supply. Besides that, I cannot say much. It is up to the administration as they are regulating the oxygen supply.” Sub-divisional magistrate Satwant Singh, who is the nodal officer for management of oxygen supply in the district, said, “One cannot possess an oxygen cylinder without a doctor’s prescription.

As per the police, Jobanjit had carried out the crime along with one Lovedeep Singh of None village. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said a team, led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP-PIB) Ravisher Singh, had tracked down the accused with the help of technical evidence. He added that after the crime, the duo had left the state to avoid being traced. “We laid a trap to bring Jobanjit to Jalandhar. As soon as he reached here, we arrested him,” said the SSP.As per the deceased cop’s son, Manpreet Singh, 19, who was present at the scene of crime, the duo had waylaid them when they were on their way back home. “When the accused tried to snatch my mobile phone, my father fought back. One of the accused shot my father thrice and then assaulted me with an iron rod,” said Manpreet. The case against the accused was registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 379-B (snatching with force) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Tarn Taran Sadar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/7-months-on-one-held-for-asi-s-murder-in-tarn-taran-101620504670525.html
09-05-2021||Chandigarh||No question of sabotaging farmers’ agitation: Capt||Chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday reiterated that no violation of the weekend lockdown or other restrictions would be allowed at any cost, given the current grim situation in the state, and that there was no question of sabotaging the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s farm laws, which his own government was vehemently opposed to. “There are lives at stake, saving them is our priority. It is the responsibility of every Punjabi to save them,” said the CM while urging BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and BKU (Ekta Dakaounda) leaders to not twist his Friday’s comments on the issue. Amid the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s call to oppose the weekend lockdown, the CM had on Friday asked the DGP to strictly enforce all weekend restrictions and not allow any violation at any cost. Nobody can be allowed to play with the lives of the people, he reiterated on Saturday. “Leaders of the two organisations had misinterpreted my statement and questioned my intentions towards the ongoing farmers’ stir,” said the CM, adding, “How can my government go against the interests of the farmers when it was the first in the country to move the amendment laws in the Vidhan Sabha to annul the draconian laws?” Appealing to the farmers to extend support and cooperation to the state government in its endeavour to combat the Covid crisis, Amarinder said the lives and safety of the people of Punjab were of paramount importance to his government. He added that the state government would continue to stand with the farmers in their fight against the central laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-question-of-sabotaging-farmers-agitation-capt-101620504370050.html

In a letter to sect chief Gurinder Singh Dhillon, the CM urged him to make all branches available with the Radha Soami Satsang Beas for the treatment of Covid patients, along with attendants deputed for the purpose. He also requested Dhillon to extend help in the form of medicines and other relief material for Covid-affected persons across the state. While the state government was making efforts to ensure best possible medical care for Covid patients, the constantly spiralling cases warranted unstinted support from religious institutions, NGOs and other such organisations, the CM said. The CM said experts had warned that the next wave would be even more dangerous, which necessitated the collective efforts of all in the battle against coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-seeks-radha-soami-satsang-s-help-in-fight-against-covid-101620504130088.html

09-05-2021||Mumbai||Urgently need Covaxin doses: Maharashtra to Centre||The state has written a letter to the Centre, asking for the urgent supply of Covaxin doses as more than 500,000 people, from the age group of above 45 years, are due for their second dose. The state’s inoculation drive is expected to be massively hit on Sunday, if the new stock does not reach by morning, Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the health department, wrote to the ministry of health and family welfare. The letter also said that since the Centre had told them to not retain the buffer stock for the second dose, the state did not reserve it.State public health minister Rajesh Tope had said on Friday that if the Centre failed to provide them with a fresh stock of Covaxin, they will be left with no option, but to divert the stock meant for the age group of 18-44 years. After the Centre supplied 1,150,000 doses during this week, the state has now run out of stock. Many vaccination centres were shut down on Saturday owing to the shortage of doses, while most of them will not operate on Sunday as well.After inoculating 234,578 people on Saturday, the state is almost exhausted with the vaccine stock. The state inoculated 4,54,546 and 3,63,753 people on May 6 and 7 respectively.“Out of 900,000 doses received in the past two days, fewer than 100,000 doses are left with the state. This has hindered implementation of the vaccination drive,” Tope had said on Friday.The central government has assured Maharashtra of 2,300,000 doses of vaccine until May 15, of which 1,150,000 have been delivered in the first week of May. “We expect the remaining stock to be delivered this week, but there is no clarity on the time line, which makes it difficult for us to plan and transport the doses to remote places,” said an official from health department.Minority affairs minister Nawab Malik, of the NCP, said that the Central government’s failure in supplying the adequate doses in due time has left many in the lurch. “The Centre has been operating the vaccination drive through CoWIN app and has the data of the people due for the second dose. Despite it, there is no supply of the doses required. It is unacceptable that lakhs of people are left in distress waiting for their second dose,” he said.Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said, “We have almost exhausted the existing stock of 1,150,000 lakh doses we received over the last one week. We are expecting the fresh stock of more than 3 lakh on Monday morning. We have been following with the Central government for the stock of more than 5 lakh Covaxin vials for the people waiting for their second dose. The number of centres depends on the stock we receive from the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/urgently-need-covaxin-doses-maharashtra-to-centre-101620503649546.html

Further, in what may be seen as a hopeful sign, Delhi’s test positivity rate continued its slow, but steady, decline, dipping to 23.3% on Saturday, with over 74,000 samples collected in the previous 24 hours.The positivity rate, which is an indicator of the spread of the infection, shot up to 36% on April 22, during the peak of the current surge of the infections.The World Health Organization recommends a positivity rate below 5% for two weeks for an infection to be considered under control in a region.The city also reported 332 deaths due to the infection on Saturday’s bulletin, taking the toll to 19,071. The infection has claimed over 300 lives every day for 17 days now, with the toll crossing 400 on three days.The seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of positive people who die of the infection – has also started inching upwards, standing at 1.82% as on Saturday. The cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of total cases and deaths reported in the city since the pandemic began – stood at 1.46%.Also read | Need 26 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses for Delhi: Arvind KejriwalWith fewer cases and more recoveries, the number of active cases in the city dipped below 90,000 for the second time in a fortnight, and was the lowest on Saturday in this period.On Saturday evening, 99.2% of the 5,661 ICU beds in the city were occupied, while 92.6% oxygen beds were taken, the state government’s health dashboard showed. The Delhi government plans to set up 1,200 makeshift ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, as part of its plans to tackle the fourth wave of infections.Meanwhile, state health minister Satyendar Jain inspected the bed expansion work at GTB Hospital. “Inspected the extension of the GTB 500-bedded ICU hospital. Work at this hospital is almost complete. Remaining final touches will be completed in a day or two,” tweeted Jain.Health experts said Delhi’s infection numbers must be treated cautiously.“This is a good sign, but we have to approach it with cautious optimism. Some of the mathematical models have shown that Delhi is likely to reach the peak of infections earlier than the whole country because the number of cases in Delhi were very high and the numbers started going up before they did for the country. So, that is what might be happening. We need to see a downward trend for at least a few days before we say anything. Also, the decline has to be accompanied by persistent high testing,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-fewest-new-infections-in-a-day-since-april-15-positivity-rate-falls-to-233-101620503237243.html

On Friday, the district administration had announced a 17-hour curfew in Ludhiana starting May 10 (Monday), under which all shops will be allowed to stay open from 5am to noon. Industrialists say lockdown in other states of the country had affected their output and while payments were stuck, stocks were piling up even as labour was leaving in hoards. In his latest orders, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma had said all industries will continue to function and labour and employers will get curfew passes. Barring a few sectors such as chemists, emergency medical facilities and milk vendors, all shops, including those selling essential items, will remain open till noon, after which curfew will be imposed. Chamber Of Commercial And Industrial Undertakings (CICU) general secretary Pankaj Sharma said the government was turning a blind eye to the large number of labourers leaving the district on a daily basis in private buses, which were choked. “If the government wants factories to run, they should encourage the labour to stay back. How will we run our units if labour continues to leave? There should be complete lockdown for at least one week,” Sharma said, adding that a partial lockdown will not reap any benefits as the restricted timings will lead to panic buying, especially when it will be close to noon. “Everyone will rush to shops between 10am and noon. Who will open their shops at 5am?” asked Sharma. United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) president DS Chawla said the small and medium scale industry was unable to generate financial resources as at least 15 states, which the industry caters to, are under lockdown. “A number of industrialists have died of Covid recently. The government should impose complete lockdown. I appeal every industry to take care of their employees. The labour is our asset,” he said. As per Badish Jindal, chairperson of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association, there is bound to be unprecedented rush during the relaxed hours, which will accelerate the spread. “We have requested the chief minister to impose complete lockdown for the industry as we no longer have any markets amid the lockdown in other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/want-complete-lockdown-in-ludhiana-17-hr-curfew-will-not-suffice-industry-101620503050507.html
09-05-2021||Delhi||Need 26 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses for Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi’s current stock of vaccines against coronavirus will last only five to six days, and urged the central government and manufacturers to expedite the supply of doses so that every adult in the national capital can be inoculated within three months.Giving a breakdown of figures, Kejriwal said Delhi has received 4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far and it requires at least 26 million more doses to inoculate its entire adult population of around 15 million in the next three months. Out of these, nearly 20 million doses will be needed for the around 10 million people in the age group of 18-44 in Delhi.“Today a major obstacle we are facing is that of vaccine scarcity. If we get adequate doses, we will be able to vaccinate the entire Delhi in three months,” the CM said at a digital news briefing.Delhi is currently in the grip of its fourth and worst wave of Covid-19 infections that has overwhelmed the city’s health care infrastructure, leaving people to scramble for hospital beds and crucial medical supplies such as liquid oxygen and life-saving drugs in recent weeks.Also read | SC task force to audit oxygen usage nationwideOn Saturday, Delhi added 17,364 cases and 332 deaths.Amid this public health crisis, the eligibility for India’s vaccination drive, which began on January 16, was expanded to cover all adults under phase 3 from May 1. However, most states said they were not able to purchase shots for the 18-44 age group and won’t be able to kick off the third phase of the drive on time.In this phase, the central government is supposed to provide vaccines to states/UTs for inoculating people aged 45 and above. For younger adults in the 18-44 age group, state governments and private hospitals directly procure shots from vaccine makers.While some private hospitals in Delhi began vaccinations for younger adults from May 1, the Delhi government only started doing so from May 3.While the Delhi government is in the process of increasing the number of schools -- which are presently being used as vaccination centres for younger adults -- from 100 to about 300, Kejriwal said scaling up Delhi’s capacity will still not be possible if the city does not get around 8 to 8.5 million vaccine doses every month.“Delhi’s population is 2 crore. About 1 crore people are in the age group of 18-45, approximately 50 lakh are under 18, and another 50 lakh are older than 45. So, those above 18 years are roughly 1.5 crore. These 1.5 crore people have to be given 3 crore vaccines, which is our requirement. From these 3 crore vaccines, the Delhi government, as of now, has received approximately 40 lakh vaccines. Therefore, we need 2 crore 60 lakh additional vaccines,” he said.Also read | Delhi records slight dip in daily Covid-19 casesThe chief minister further said this is the minimum number of doses that Delhi needs and the actual requirement is likely to be higher because many people from the neighbouring cities and towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, Sonepat, Faridabad and Gurugram are also coming to the Capital to take the jab.“In fact, more doses will be required since people from the NCR and other neighbouring areas are coming to Delhi to get vaccinated. But the minimum requirement of Delhi must be met with. Thus, I appeal to the central government that sufficient vaccines be made available to us,” he added.As per government data at 10am on Saturday, Delhi had a stock of 771,860 doses of vaccines, out of which 339,080 doses are those procured by the city administration for those between 18-44 years and 432,780 are from the central government, meant for those 45 years old and above.On average, for the last seven days, the city has been administering 63,511 shots per day, according to the daily health bulletin.With the current stock remaining as is without getting replenished and the same rate of daily vaccinations, the Delhi government will run out of shots 12 days from Saturday: May 20.Delhi government officials, however, said on condition of anonymity that they expect to receive vaccines from manufacturers and the Centre soon as orders have already been placed. The officials did not give details about the timeline or number of vaccines they are likely to receive.Around 79,800 recipients were administered the jab on Friday, according to the government’s health bulletin issued on Saturday. Later in the evening, government officials updated the figure to 114,657.Overall, 3,746,494 “cumulative beneficiaries” had been vaccinated in the city, the bulletin said.“To vaccinate every adult in three months, we have to administer 80-85 lakh vaccines every month. It means we need to administer 3 lakh vaccines daily. Today, we are already administering 1 lakh vaccines in 100 schools (and other centres). This will be increased to 300 schools. So, we can easily increase our capacity to 3 lakh vaccines per day. But in the end, it will all depend on how much and how quickly vaccines are delivered to us,” Kejriwal said.Delhi has enlisted schools, which are closed down due to the pandemic, to inoculate younger adults, while government-run medical facilities are for the older age groups.Watch | Blood clots in Covid patients: Top doctor decodes early signs & prevention﻿On Saturday, the vaccination drive at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, run by the central government, was delayed by an hour in the morning “due to shortage of vials”, according to the hospital spokesperson Smriti Tiwari.The hospital is a vaccination centre only for those who are 45 years and above. A senior doctor, who did not want to be named, said, “The vaccine doses are distributed by the district officials. There were no leftover vaccines in the hospital today and there was a delay in getting the vials from the administration.”The hospital has a capacity to store vaccines for a couple of days.Several other states too have brought up the issue of limited vaccine supplies. The Maharashtra government, which is also facing the issue, said earlier this week it is “constantly” following up with the Centre to provide vaccine doses for inoculating people aged 45 and above.Kejriwal on Saturday also appealed to all experts and the Centre to arrange vaccines for those below 18 years of age.”We are particularly concerned about children. Youngsters and children under 18 cannot get vaccinated right now. I appeal to all experts and the Centre to arrange a vaccine for them too so that they can also get inoculated,” he said.To be sure, most vaccines against Covid-19 have only conducted clinical trials involving adults. Canada is the only country in the world to have approved the Pfizer-BioNtech’s Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents as young as 12. The US and Europe are expected to do so shortly.Experts say the current lockdown and adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour will slow the spread of the virus, but vaccinating entire populations is key to fighting the pandemic as a long-term measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-26-million-more-covid-19-vaccine-doses-for-delhi-arvind-kejriwal-101620502214866.html

The Central Vista project involves the construction of a new Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat, along with residences of the Prime Minister (PM) and vice-president, and a revamp of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.“Poor countries are offering help to India as per their capacity, but our honourable PM is not ready to stop the ₹ 20,000 crore Central Vista Project,” the editorial stated.“Bangladesh has sent 10,000 Remdesivir vials as donation, while Bhutan has sent medical oxygen. Even countries such as Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have also offered help to ‘Aatmanirbhar [self-reliant]’ India,” taunted the Sena. The Sena-led Maharashtra Government has been in constant friction with the Central government over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and its support to the state’s fight against the outbreak.The editorial said that UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) has declared that the world faces threat from India’s Covid-19 pandemic and has appealed to all the countries to offer help to India.It further stated that earlier countries such as Rwanda, Pakistan and Congo used to face similar problems and procure help from other countries. “Today we are facing this problem due to the wrong policies pursued by the current rulers,” said the editorial.Criticising the Central government further, the editorial stated that it was getting censured regularly by the Supreme Court for its inept handing of this pandemic. It further went on to dub the Central government as “insensitive”, stating that instead of forming a panel of all main political parties, it is more interested in cornering West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee even today.“Had this been a sensitive and nationalist government, it would not have focussed on political gains or losses but would have constituted a committee of all major parties to deal with such a calamity. But they are more concerned about an incident where a minister’s car was pelted stones in West Bengal,” the editorial stated. Describing the Union health ministry as a complete failure, the editorial further stated, “BJP MP (Member of Parliament) Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Nitin Gadkari, who is one of the active Union ministers, be given the charge of health ministry. This aptly proves the failure of the ministry.” The editorial concluded by stating that Modi should tackle the current situation without indulging in politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/india-could-resist-covid-19-onslaught-due-to-system-created-by-nehru-gandhi-shiv-sena-101620502509419.html

The committee, comprising five-six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government.The Maharashtra government also asked chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to review the recruitments which have been affected owing to the verdict. According to the officials from the state government, there are more than 3,000 employees who have been recruited between November 2018 and September 2020 when the law was in force. The decision over according them permanent recruitment has to be taken. “There are thousands of employees who were recruited on the basis of the reservation given in 2014, but are currently out of job because it was later struck down by the Bombay HC. Kunte has been asked to take a call on them with deliberations from the secretaries of other departments,” said an official from the general administration department.The Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. On Wednesday, SC quashed it, stating that people from the community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge SC bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment that set a 50-% cap on reservation to a larger bench for reconsideration.The state cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, headed by public works department minister Ashok Chavan and comprising other senior ministers, held a meeting to take a call on future course of action. “The committee under retired HC judges will study the SC verdict minutely and give their observations and available legal remedy on the reservation. The state government will take its decision after the report is submitted in two weeks. The decision over filing the review petition before the five-judge [SC] bench will also be taken based on the report,” said Chavan.The state government is also tapping the option of requesting the central government to intervene, as the judgment stated that the right to accord the reservation is with Centre after the 102nd Constitutional amendment. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to the President and prime minister, requesting them to take steps required for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” said Chavan.Urban development department minister and member of the cabinet sub-committee Eknath Shinde said that the government was committed to continue the benefits to the Marathas. “We have already rolled out the sops to the community in terms of scholarship, freeships, hostel facilities and financial assistance for entrepreneurship. They will further be streamlined,” he said.Legal experts have opined that the state government has very limited options left on the issue. “The review petition before the same [SC] bench would not help as there should be some other ground than the ones that have been exhausted. Even if the Maharashtra government requests the Centre for the reservation, the ratification of the backwardness of the Marathas would be a task as the quantifiable data submitted by the state backward class commission has not been accepted by the top court. The state can think of an entirely new law by weeding out the lacunae in SEBC Act, 2018, but it too will be subject to legal scrutiny,” an official from Mantralaya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-maharashtra-govt-to-form-rtd-judges-panel-to-suggest-way-ahead-101620502389399.html

Officials said on Saturday that an inquiry has been marked against Eden Hospital in Industrial Area, Phase 2, which has been using 400 oxygen cylinders everyday.They added that previously, a private hospital had been found using 400 cylinder per day, while another hospital of around the same capacity was using about 90 cylinders.However, Dr Sanjiv Bansal, the hospital’s owner, denies any foul play and said that oxygen is being utilised according to the needs of patients.“The oxygen consumption is high, as some Covid patients need a very large quantity of it. Some suffer from Happy Hypoxia, in which oxygen saturation drops to 50 or 60, without the patient being aware of it. In such cases, immediate hospitalisation and high quantity of oxygen is needed. Why will our hospital waste such an important resource?,” he added. A UT spokesperson said, “It has been decided that a detailed inquiry will be carried out and action will be taken against the hospital authorities as per the findings of the probe.”Senior doctors say that some reasons for oxygen wastage could be leakage in pipelines and outlets, valves left open and oxygen masks not fitted property over the face of the patients.“The consumption of each private hospital was determined with regard to capacity and beds reserved for Covid patients. Even senior doctors from the government hospitals could not find out the possible reason for such high consumption by the hospital. It seems almost impossible to consume such a quantity, even if all the patients were on ventilators,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-probing-excess-oxygen-use-by-private-hospital-101620502209904.html

The PGIMER has requested the Government of India to enhance their quota from 20MT to 40MT. The UT administration has forwarded and strongly supported this,” he said.The PGIMER administration shot back that it has been designated as a Covid hospital of the UT and is allocated a quota of 20 MT oxygen to meet its requirements.“As on date, we at the PGIMER have already reached the consumption of 20 MT per day in view of the consistent surge in the patient load. Therefore, it may not be possible to increase the COVID bed strength in case the oxygen allocation is not enhanced with immediate effect,” it said.‘Can’t increase beds’Meanwhile, explaining the situation, Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in Chandigarh, said the administration has been assigned a total quota of 40 MT oxygen, which includes 20 MT exclusively for the PGIMER. Of the remaining 20 MT quota, 17 MT oxygen is given directly to GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and the dedicated hospital in Sector 48 while 3 MT is given to a private vendor in Dera Bassi to refill oxygen cylinders of all government and private hospitals. “On Saturday, when a team of senior officials visited the plant, despite clear instructions to the vendor that the quota provided is to be used for specific hospitals, it was observed that some cylinders of the PGIMER were also being filled... This was in gross violation of directions of the UT administration,” said Garg, adding that consequently directions were issued to fill PGIMER cylinders only from its quota of 20MT to avoid any disruption of supply to other hospitals.Badnore intervenesMeanwhile, the Punjab government also stopped the supply of oxygen to the PGIMER from a plant in Mandi Gobindgarh.Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson, PGIMER, said the institute used to get around 60 cylinders from the private vendor, but the supply was stopped by the Punjab government “with reasons best known to them”.None from the Punjab government was willing to comment on the issue.Amid the two developments, Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore shared a message on Twitter late at night, stating that hospitals including the PGIMER are being closely monitored. “#PGIMER is lifesaver & premier health institute of Northern India; won’t let down its request; will see there is no O2 shortage (sic),” he said in the message, while also thanking the Haryana government for apparently arranging 3 MT oxygen for the PGIMER.Not the first tussleThe UT administration and PGIMER have been at loggerheads since the beginning of the outbreak. While the administration has demanded that the premier institute should increase its capacity to deal with the situation, the latter wants more beds to be created at other hospitals . The two had a tussle over conducting a sero-survey in the city and conversion of the Infosys Sarai into a Covid hospital as well. The administration had last year formally written to the PGIMER to take steps to convert the Infosys Sarai on its campus into a Covid facility. However, the institute had said that the focus is to cater to patients already admitted at its dedicated Covid wards, which have almost 400 beds. The facility was finally handed over to an NGO to run a Covid Care Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-and-chandigarh-admn-fight-over-oxygen-101620501731462.html

09-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Uncertainty looms over HSC exams in absence of govt decision||Barely three weeks before the scheduled exams, HSC (Class 12) students in the state are still unsure about whether or not their exams will take place amid high Covid-19 infections and the resultant lockdown. Students said the state government’s delay in declaring the status of exams is causing severe anxiety and confusion at the last minute. “We have been studying for the entire year and still do not have any clarity on whether or not exams would take place offline. The government should not wait anymore and should announce its decision immediately,” said an HSC aspirant. On April 12, the state government had postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June. However, following CBSE’s decision to cancel Class 10 exams and a similar decision from ICSE, IGCSE and IB there was growing pressure to cancel exams from students and parents to ensure equivalence across boards which is key at the time of admissions to colleges. On April 20, Class 10 exams were declared cancelled by the state government and students will now be marked based on internal assessments. However, the government continued to say that HSC exams will be conducted as per the schedule. Over the last several days, the education department has been holding numerous consultation meetings with various stakeholders including schools, teachers and parents to come up with a formula for internal assessments. However, a decision on the formula and the conduct of Class 12 exams is yet to be arrived at. “Meetings are on and an announcement in this regard will be made soon,” said an official from the education department. Many students urged the education department to cancel exams for Class 12 altogether. They also participated in a Twitter storm recently with a hashtag- #cancel12thboardexams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-uncertainty-looms-over-hsc-exams-in-absence-of-govt-decision-101620501489331.html

09-05-2021||Mumbai||Olive Ridley nesting sites in Maharashtra double since 2020, up five times since 2015||The number of turtle nesting sites along Maharashtra’s coastline has doubled this year as compared to 2020, according to data by Maharashtra forest department’s Mangrove Foundation. During nesting season (which runs from December to March), a total of 451 nesting sites were recorded through field observations, up from 288 during the same period last year.Of these, the majority were recorded in Ratnagiri district, where 277 nesting sites were seen (up from 148 last year). This was followed by Sindhudurg, where 146 nesting sites were seen (as against 68 last year). In Raigad, which is the only other district where sea turtles are found to regularly nest, the number went up from 15 last year to 28 in the current season. The proportion of nesting sites across these three districts is in line with past data up to 2015, as provided by the mangrove foundation.In fact, data shows a significant increase in the number of nesting sites in over the past six years. In 2017, for example, only 75 nests were recorded across these three districts. That figure has shown steady improvements, year on year. While there are four species of sea turtles recorded in Maharashtra, Olive Ridleys are the only one that nest in the state and have widest population distribution. While officials and experts unanimously agreed that the development is a positive one, they did not reveal specific reasons for the same.“It will require more study to understand why there has been a sudden jump this year, but my hunch is that this is a result of more than a decade of conservation efforts by the state. Hatchlings that were released from these same areas a few years ago are now coming back to lay their eggs as mature adults,” said Harshal Karve, a marine biologist with the Mangrove Foundation.Karve explained that sea turtle conservancy has been a focus of not only the government, but also NGOs and local communities since the early 2000s. The movement can be attributed almost singularly to the work of an NGO named Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra (SNM), which started a marine turtle conservation program in 2002 in Ratnagiri’s Velas village. Since then, a range of measures to conserve turtles have been implemented, including removal of ‘ghost’ fishing nets from deeper waters and setting up of turtle treatment and rehabilitation centres in multiple districts.In 2018, a compensation scheme for fishermen under the Wildlife Protection Act was also implemented, which provides cash incentives to fishermen who may inadvertently catch sea turtles while fishing. So far, a total of 146 sea turtles have been released under the scheme, including 90 Olive Ridleys, 51 green sea turtles, three hawksbill turtles, and two leatherback turtles. A marine respondent group comprising forest department officials was also set up around this time to coordinate faster response to stranded cetaceans in Maharashtra, a significant majority of which includes Olive Ridleys.This is not the first time that such a sudden increase in Olive Ridley nesting sites has been seen in the state. A similar doubling was also observed between 2017 and 2018, when the number of observed nests increased from 153 to 303. Notably, 2017 was the year in which the mangrove foundation stepped in as the state’s nodal authority overseeing turtle conservation efforts. The first capacity building workshop among locals and officials was conducted at the Regional Coconut Research Centre, Ratnagiri on 4th February, 2017. Others, however, said that the spurt -- which has followed a year of halted developmental and commercial activities around the world -- may be due to a more complex interplay of factors. A kasavmitra (or ‘turtle friend’) employed with the mangrove foundation speculated that reduced fishing activities during the lockdown, which were further affected by rougher weather conditions at sea , have likely played a role in reducing Olive Ridley deaths as bycatch, allowing a larger number of females to reach their nesting grounds. “It cannot be ruled out. If a slowdown in fishing is responsible, then it is worrying because we are finally getting a sense of how much risk commercial fishing poses to Olive Ridleys. We will have to wait till next year and see, whether resumption of fishing brings the numbers down again,” they said.It also remains to be seen whether the increase in nesting sites this year translates to the release of more hatchlings back into the sea after birthing season, which typically lasts between April and May. In 2020, the ‘hatchling success rate’ -- or proportion of turtles which survive the nesting period -- stood at a six year low of 39% (down from 57% the previous year). “We have begun releasing turtles from our hatcheries, but the final results will be available only at the end of the month,” said Karve.Varad Giri, a herpetologist who has been closely involved in sea turtle conservation in Maharashtra, said the trend is undoubtedly a positive one. “Of course, reduced human activity during the pandemic may have played a role in the current increase, but the long-term increase in nesting sites is entirely due to community participation, which NGOs like Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra have been able to facilitate in districts like Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri. Where turtle eggs were once being poached, they are now actively protected and cared for by citizens. The involvement of people outside of usual interest groups, such as government officials or researchers, is what has made the program successful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/olive-ridley-nesting-sites-in-maharashtra-double-since-2020-up-five-times-since-2015-101620501249349.html
09-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fudged data to reduce number of deaths, Fadnavis alleges||Hours after Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi lauded the Maharashtra government over the handling of the pandemic and days after the Supreme Court (SC) applauded for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for its Covid-19 management, leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis has alleged that Mumbai civic body was manipulating the data on infection rate and the number of deaths.Fadnavis, in his three-page letter dated April 8, has said that the BMC has put the Covid deaths in the non-Covid deaths category to reduce the number of deaths due to infection. He said that when the death percentage for ‘death due to other reasons in the rest of Maharashtra in the second wave is 0.7%, it’s as high as 39.4%. Fadnavis said that this is because the Mumbai civic body put the Covid-19 deaths in other category violating the norms of WHO and ICMR. “The deaths out of accident, suicide, murder or cancer patients of the fourth stage can be categorised in non-Covid deaths even if they were tested positive. But the BMC is misusing the category by putting the Covid-19 deaths in this category to manipulate the numbers,” he said stated.Fadnavis has also alleged that even during the first wave, the BMC fudged the data in a similar fashion. He said that when the death percentage for ‘death due to other reasons in the rest of Maharashtra in the second wave is 0.7%, it’s as high as 39.4% (in Mumbai). He also alleged that the infection rate data is being manipulated by increasing the percentage of the rapid antigen test instead of RT-PCR.Congress has hit back at Fadnavis by saying that the BJP leader has not been able to digest the praises showered by the prime ministers. “When the second wave started on February 10 this year, there were total 313,000 active patients and 11,400 deaths, which rose to 671,000 active patients and 13,687 total deaths as of today. There are 2,287 deaths in 3 months of the second wave, which translates into 0.7%, which is the lowest in the world. Even if other than Corona deaths are added to the Corona deaths, the rate would be 0.8% again the lowest in the world. Instead of raising fingers at the state government the BJP leaders should treat their stomach pain and pay attention to the false statistics given in BJP-ruled states like Gujarat,” said Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fudged-data-to-reduce-number-of-deaths-fadnavis-alleges-101620501069345.html

The demand has risen manifold in the second wave as many patients are now needing oxygen support,” said Yogi Adityanath in Moradabad and Bareilly, according to a state government statement.“Special plans have been made as the demand for oxygen has grown many times, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved 61 new oxygen plants for UP. The process is on to set up one oxygen plant in every district by the sugarcane department,” he added.It was Yogi’s first visit outside the state capital since he recovered from Covid last week. He visited Mordabad and Bareilly for the Covid review of all the districts in the two administrative divisions. To review the work of the nigrani samitis (surveillance committees), he visited Manoharpur village in Moradabad. He asked the members of surveillance committees and the RRTs (rapid response teams) regarding the antigen tests conducted at Manoharpur village. The committees reported that one person was found positive in the village during the special testing drive. The chief minister interacted with the Covid positive person while maintaining social distancing.About the nigrani samitis and the village surveillance drive, Yogi said, “At present, more than 60,000 committees are working under the special screening campaign in around 97,000 revenue villages of the state. Door-to-door rapid antigen tests are being conducted on a massive scale.”He also reviewed the availability of medical kits and gave proper instructions to the officers. A state government statement said that the government on May 5 launched a five-day testing drive to identify symptomatic patients and provide them medical aid.Later, talking to reporters, Yogi said Covid-19 cases declined significantly in the state since May 1. “Total active cases were around 3 lakh on April 30. Within eight days, from May 1 to 8 the cases have decreased by 65,000. So far, more than 3,500 cases have reduced in Moradabad under the action plan of Covid management,” he said.“There were doubts that Covid-19 positive cases will touch the one lakh-mark by May 5, and today is May 8. The count of fresh cases on Saturday stands at 26,847. The second doubt was that cases will increase during the panchayat polls. The panchayat elections ended on April 29, and there has been a continuous drop in the number of cases,” he underlined.Along with officials, he inspected the facilities at the Integrated Command and Control Centre in Moradabad and Bareilly. He also reviewed the arrangements being made at the centres to tackle the Covid-19 situation in the district.“It is a disaster and not an ordinary disease. Sometimes, all kinds of resources fall short in such pandemic. While many big nations are getting battered in this epidemic, we are fighting it strongly with the support of the central government. With collective efforts, we shall overcome this disaster,” Yogi Adityanath said.He also said the state government had directed each district administration to give priority to Covid positive patients.Talking about the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group people, Yogi said that the drive will be launched in several more districts, including Moradabad on Monday. He asked Moradabad district administration to prepare well for the launch. The drive was launched in Bareilly on May 1 along with six other UP districts, including Lucknow.Yogi asked officials of the districts in Moradabad division and Bareilly division to scale up Covid management resources--beds, human resource etc. (WITH AGENCY INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-demand-rose-three-five-times-in-second-wave-says-yogi-101620500949369.html

The curbs will remain in place still May 16. The state on Saturday recorded a high of 41,971 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 28.25%. Addressing mediapersons through a virtual meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said the second wave was really challenging and the government will do everything possible to save lives. “Situation is really tough during the second wave. Though we face shortage of doses we started vaccinating people below 45 years. The government is keeping a strict tab on oxygen situation and availability of hospital beds,” he said. In the morning he held a series of meetings with heads of various departments to spruce up the ongoing fight against the pandemic. “Experts say in the second phase of virus strain is deadly. So we all will have to take extra caution,” he said requesting people to remain at home and follow directives of the state health ministry in letter and spirit. Experts have warned recently that the double mutant variant or SARS-COV2 lineage B.1. 617 is found to be prevalent here. They said it was almost similar to the one reported in Maharashtra (Amaravati strain) and it was at least twice infectious as earlier variants. Earlier the state had confirmed the presence of mutant strains from United Kingdom and South Africa. Experts said the double mutant variant is dangerous than UK and African variants. As cases soar the government imposed a complete down as the weekend restrictions and curbs failed to check the rising graph.

In eight districts where there has been a surge in Covid-19 cases, there is a complete lockdown, where citizens can step out only for medical emergencies.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that various options are being explored by the government which will be finalised next week. “We are recording 50,000-60,000 cases daily. These figures are not declining, but are stable. We have various options such as extending the lockdown or to continue with restrictions only in those areas where the cases are increasing,” said Tope, adding that in 12 of the total 36 districts, the Covid-19 cases have re reduced, of which is a positive thing in the battle against the virus.According to Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Parel’s Gut Clinic, the government is faced with a Hobson’s choice. “It will be very difficult call for the government as it concerns the lives as well as livelihood of citizens. The middle path would be to open in a staggered manner in places like Mumbai where the positivity rate is low and Covid-19 cases have been controlled,” said Dr Mandot. “However, the authorities should enforce strict adherence of Covid-19 protocols so that there is no surge in areas where there is a partial opening,” he added.Meanwhile, the state has complained to the Central government about the Karnataka government stopping 50 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen from a steel plant in Bellary meant for Kolhapur and other parts of western Maharashtra.“The Centre needs to keep politics aside and save the lives of people in places such as Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri which have been affected by the blockade imposed by the Karnataka government,” said minister of state for home Satej Patil.The state recorded 82,266 recoveries on Saturday and conducted 260,751 tests. Currently there are 628,213 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops the list with 106,829 patients, followed by Nagpur (62,159) active patients.Mumbai has reported the highest death toll in the state with 13,713 deaths, followed by Pune (10,024).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decision-on-lockdown-in-maharashtra-likely-to-be-next-week-101620500829837.html
09-05-2021||Other||TRS former MLA arrested in lawyer couple’s murder case: Police||Hyderabad Telangana Police on Saturday arrested Peddapalli zilla parishad chairman and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) former legislator Putta Madhukar in connection with the murder of an advocate couple in broad day light in Peddapalli district on February 17. According to police, they took Madhukar into custody from Bhimavaram town in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district in the early hours on Saturday. He was brought to Ramagundam police commissionerate later in the evening. A statement from Ramagundam police said Madhukar was absconding from his house in Peddapalli for the last 10 days after switching off his mobile phone. Police said they are questioning the leader to find out why he had gone underground and to where. On February 17, high court advocates Gattu Vamana Rao (53) and his wife P V Nagamani (50) were waylaid and hacked to death by some miscreants at Kalvacharla village in Ramagiri block while they were returning after a court case at Manthani, according to police, who had earlier questioned Madhukar in connection with the couple’s murder. Ramagundam police said Vamana Rao’s father Kishan Rao has recently lodged another complaint in connection with the murder, suspecting it was abetted by Madhukar. “Based on the complaint, police have taken the zilla parishad chairman into custody for questioning,” the statement said. Madhukar represented Manthani assembly constituency from the TRS ticket between 2014 and 2018. In December 2018 assembly elections, he lost to D Sridhar Babu of the Congress. According to police, Madhukar’s nephew Bittu Srinu and his followers, who were accused in the murder of the advocate couple, are in judicial custody. On April 6, following a direction from Telangana high court, which has taken suo motu cognizance of the murder case, police registered a case against Madhukar’s wife and Manthani municipal chairperson Putta Shailaja for allowing Bittu Srinu to use her mobile phone to make a video call with someone from the court premises. A police official from Ramagundam said on condition of anonymity that Madhukar was also a close associate of senior TRS leader and former state health minister Eatala Rajender, who was sacked from the cabinet by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao following allegations of encroachment of lands assigned to Dalits in Medak district. “It is suspected that Madhukar was also involved in various land transactions in Karimnagar district along with Eatala. We are also probing this angle,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trs-former-mla-arrested-in-lawyer-couple-s-murder-case-police-101620500829284.html
09-05-2021||Other||Why Karnataka had to extend curbs||Bengaluru: Halfway through the first lockdown, the Karnataka government on May 7 announced fresh curbs which would come into effect from May 10. Experts say the government was left with no choice as even seven days after imposing a lockdown, the number of Covid-19 cases in the state did not show a downward trend. The state on Saturday reported 47,563 new Covid cases and 482 deaths out of which Bengaluru alone logged 21, 354 cases and 285 fatalities.Even senior cabinet members didn’t hold themselves back to acknowledge the failure of the lockdown. While announcing the fresh lockdown measures on Friday, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said: “Since the 14-day partial lockdown imposed by the state from April 27 failed to yield the desired result in containing the spread of the virus, we are forced to enforce stringent restrictions.” A similar opinion was shared by the Karnataka health minister who said the lockdown has been a failure. “I needn’t say how this ‘Janata curfew’ has been ineffective with congregations continuing. The trend is not limited to Bengaluru; districts, too, have failed to see its strict implementation. The result is not to our expectation,” he told reporters on Friday. So, where did the government go wrong? Several stakeholders responsible for enforcing the restrictions said that the lockdown was a knee-jerk reaction that was not well thought out. “For starters, the government didn’t call it a lockdown, and used terms like curfew, lockdown like restrictions, since it didn’t want to cause a panic. Looking at the measures implemented, it wasn’t a complete lockdown either. This showed that it was a half-hearted measure,” said a senior IAS officer on the condition of anonymity. “The government allowed several industries, garment industries and private companies to operate during this lockdown. To give an example of Bengaluru, the Peenya industrial area alone employs close to 900 thousand people and close to 500 thousand people work in the garment industries. This a large population still roaming on the streets and many using this privilege for non-work-related activities,” said the officer. A senior police officer in Bengaluru said that one of the biggest complaints received from various police stations was the overcrowding and travel between 6 am to 10 am window for buying essential services. “Even though the government had allowed people to purchase essential commodities, there were no restrictions on vehicle movement. People just assumed on their own that they had a free pass between 6 am to 10 am. When we stopped them, they would say they were going to shop,” said the deputy commissioner of police rank officer. He further added that the number of exceptions in the lockdown rules made enforcement difficult. “Since there were several categories of the people who were allowed to travel, such as employees of various industries and offices, the numbers on the streets were large and it was difficult for the police to effectively enforce the lockdown,” he added. The IAS officer said the big list of exceptions in the lockdown rules made it clear that the government wanted to please all. “The government extended the window for grocery stores from 6 am to 10 am to 6 am to 6 pm, is an example of non-commitment towards the lockdown,” he said. Dr Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist and member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) also felt the containment measures in the state had failed. “The containment efforts are failing in Bengaluru. The test positivity and tests per million are inversely related. With raging infections, the testing per million is decreased over a period of time. At the same time, mitigation measures (irrespective of what we call whether curfew or semi-lockdown) are incomplete and ineffectively implemented. As a result, there is no benefit in reducing the speed of transmission. This is the opposite of what Bangalore model was known for,” he tweeted on Saturday. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the fresh lockdown announced between May 10 to May 24. Unlike the first, in the second lockdown, there are restrictions on the movement of people between 6 am to 10 am the window to buy essentials. “Several people misused this and started moving around freely, leading to crowds on the streets. Since we raised an objection to this, the rules have been changed,” said the senior police officer. In the fresh set of curbs, the government has banned people from using private vehicles to purchase groceries, parcels from hotels and liquor shops. The new lockdown mandates that it should be done by foot to avoid people travelling long distances during the window. Most importantly, all industries, garment factories and offices have been shut during this period. “The strict implementation of the lockdown is key to controlling the spike in the Covid-19 cases in the state. We will know how serious the government and the people are about preventing the virus when we see the traffic on the roads from Monday,” said the member of the TAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/why-karnataka-had-to-extend-curbs-101620500769303.html
09-05-2021||Other||K’taka goes Mumbai way in Covid fight||Bengaluru: Taking a cue from Mumbai’s fight against Covid-19, the Karnataka government has announced decentralisation to fight the spread of the virus in the city. In an order issued on May 7, the government has ordered to set up Ward Decentralised Triage and Emergency Response (DETER) Committees for Covid-19 management in all 198 wards in Bengaluru. The main goal of this step is to ensure the hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients is not delayed and those who require oxygen find support within two hours. In the order issued on Friday, Manjunath Prasad, the principal secretary of the revenue department and member secretary of the state executive committee said that decentralisation will help provide better supervision for ward-level Covid-19 activities. In the new system, Wad DETER committees (WDC) will run in coordination with the ward committees, volunteer residents’ welfare associations, civil society organisations and disaster support initiatives. Open-source technology platforms will be utilised to operationalise WDC functioning, and a suitable online platform will be used by the BBMP to support this. The WDCs will be responsible for resource mapping the ward i.e. identifying general practitioners, mapping existing RWAs, colonies, apartments, slums, NGOs working in the public health sector, mobilise citizen volunteers, and upload all medical facilities, including primary health centres, Covid-19 care centres, hospitals and nursing homes, and testing centres. The current system, response to Covid-19 in the city is controlled by the helpline number 1912 and zonal level helplines for each of the BBMP’s eight zones. The change in policy takes a leaf from their counterparts in Mumbai. “Ward level Community Triage is seen as a successful intervention in many cities including Mumbai. Currently, there is a delay in informing the test results to the patient due to the centralised ICMR process followed by BU number generation process,” reads the order by the Karnataka government. “To reduce delay in (Covid test) results and avoid panic, positive cases are relayed to the triage coordinator directly from the PHC throughout the day. The triage coordinator will delegate numbers to relevant citizen volunteers. The volunteers must be trained to do triage to identify persons who need to be admitted to ICU and those who require hospitalisation or should be sent to Covid care centres or isolated at home,” reads the order. As per the order, the committees will be responsible for helping people access hospital beds. The data of those in ICU, hospital, CCC or at home will be maintained by the triage centre. The order also mentions an exit strategy to reduce the bed turnaround time in hospitals. Limiting hospital admissions to people with severe illness and shifting those with moderate illness to CCCs in five days, are part of this strategy. The WDCs will also conduct bed audits thrice a day and prioritise admissions to those who need it the most. Apart from this, the WDCs will be responsible for contact tracing and testing, identify cases under home isolation and offer support, ensure maximum vaccination coverage by holding vaccination drives, hyper-local IEC (information-education-communication) on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, using pulse oximeter, prone position to improve oxygen levels etc. The printed IEC material in multiple languages should be distributed to all grocery stores in the ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-goes-mumbai-way-in-covid-fight-101620500709226.html

Many eyebrows in the political circles were raised after Modi showered praises on the MVA government in the backdrop of the frequent clashes between the state and Centre and also leaders from both the sides over Covid-19 management.According to the statement issued by chief minister’s office, Modi lauded the government for its handling of the second wave. “He took information from the CM about the steps being taken by the state government for the management of Covid-19. The CM apprised the PM about the measures planned by the state in anticipation of a potential third wave of the pandemic,” the statement said.Thackeray also requested PM for the additional allotment of oxygen for Maharashtra amid the shortage it has been facing. “PM Modi and the Centre have been guiding Maharashtra in its fight against the virus since beginning and it has proven beneficial too. Expressing his gratitude for it, the CM also thanked Modi for accepting some of the recommendations the Maharashtra government made,” the statement further read.Modi’s gesture of praising Maharashtra has however surprised many in the political circles amid the frequent wars of words between the central and state governments over the supply of Covid-related aid. The recent clashes between Union ministers Harsh Vardhan and Prakash Javadekar and state health minister Rajesh Tope and others over vaccine supply had triggered a controversy. Tope and other MVA leaders have also been targeting the Centre for the alleged discrimination over the supply of oxygen to the state.State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including leaders of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, have been continuously targeting the state government over its handling of the pandemic. The BJP leaders had alleged corruption in the setting up jumbo Covid centres and had targeted the state government for its failure in constructing adequate facilities ahead of the second wave. Thackeray, on two earlier occasions, had complained to the PM about the state BJP leaders politicising the issue of pandemic.A Congress leader, while expressing his surprise to the development, said, “But what else is left with him, considering that the BJP-led state governments’ failure in combating the pandemic. We have been very transparent in terms of cases and deaths unlike other states.”Political analyst Prakash Akolkar said that by praising Thackeray, Modi has indirectly taken a pot shot at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.“Delhi and Mumbai, the political and financial capitals of the country, are always compared with each other. By praising Thackeray, Modi has taken a dig at Kejriwal. Also in a way, it’s a slam to Fadnavis and Darekar who keep targeting the Thackeray government on every Covid-related issue. I also feel that on a personal level, Modi and Thackeray share cordial relations and seldom attack each other,” he said.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had applauded the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) oxygen and bed management.Meanwhile, Thackeray also wrote a letter to the PM, seeking permission to develop a separate app for vaccination to avoid the malfunctioning of the CoWIN platform. He said that the Centre can also develop dedicated CoWIN apps for each of the states to avoid such glitches. The Maharashtra CM has also requested Modi to design a medical framework by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under which the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) of the respective states can procure vaccine stock from other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-lauded-maharashtra-government-on-its-fight-against-covid-19-cmo-101620500649292.html

Vipin Kalta, 29, a technician at a local clinical labour rotary, besides collecting patients’ blood samples at his routine job also supplies cooked food and delivers medicines to patients.Kalta, whose entire family had been infected in 2020, says, “I go to patients’ homes to collect their blood samples and know from first-hand experience the difficulties they face when suffering from Covid. One my clients told me that he was unable to get cooked food as few restaurants in Shimla provide home delivery, so my wife and I decided to prepare food for Covid patients. I deliver food to nine patients a day.”Katla had also donated his plasma after recovering from the infection.Four days ago, Hotel Himland East proprietor Umesh Akre, 73, started a service to deliver food to Covid patients. “My phone is flooded with requests for homemade food,” says Akre, adding, “The situation is grim.”“On the first day, we delivered food to 40 patients near the Khalini bus stand, Chotta Shimla, and Kanlog. Now, I am receiving calls from far off places requesting food “ says Akre.Though they are facing difficulty delivering food in areas inaccessible by roads, Akre says they have asked youngsters to volunteer to help deliver food.Almighty Blessing, a non-profit organisation that runs langars for patients and attendants at Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) is also delivering food to Covid patients with the help of Himanshu Chauhan, a 26-year-old tattoo artist.“We started the home delivery service only a few days ago but are receiving more calls every day. We need more volunteers,” says philanthropist Sarabjeet Singh Bobby of Almighty Blessing. Chauhan walks nearly 7km on foot to deliver food to patients from his residence in Sanjauli to Chaura Maidan “These days there is no work, so I decided to devote myself to social service in this hour of crisis,” says Chauhan, who owns a shop in Sanjauli .There are nearly 1,500 Covid patients in home isolation in Shimla who are registered with the government hospital. However, the numbers are expected to be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/from-preparing-food-to-delivering-medicines-shimla-s-good-samaritans-walk-the-extra-mile-101620500589865.html

The woman then threatened the senior citizen at knifepoint and fled with cash and jewellery worth ₹3.10 lakh. The complainant, Swati Patil, and her nine-year-old grandson Sarvagya were alone at their house at the time while her son and daughter-in-law were out on work. Around 12 noon, a woman arrived at their residence and asked Patil if she had received Covid vaccine and under the pretext of completing some procedure gained entry in the house, a police officer said.“The accused asked for a glass of water and the moment Patil turned to fetch it, the accused took out a knife, threatened to kill her and robbed her of cash and jewellery. She then tied and gagged the senior citizen and her grandson before escaping,” the officer said. Patil somehow managed to get to the window and screamed for help. A passer by noticed and helped them. The family then reported the matter to police.Police suspect that the accused was aware that the victim was alone at home during afternoon hours, which helped her commit the crime swiftly. “A case has been registered against the unidentified woman under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 392 (robbery), 334 (causing hurt) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Multiple teams have been formed to locate her. The elderly woman and the kid are safe,” said Anil Koli, senior inspector of Worli police station. Police have begun investigation and are checking their records of criminals matching the description of the robber. “There is no CCTV around the society and our men are checking if any CCTV of the adjacent streets captured the suspect woman’s movements,” Koli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-woman-poses-as-civic-vaccine-official-robs-74-year-old-of-3-1-lakh-101620500469276.html
09-05-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reprieve for owners of land near Kolshet air force station||In a reprieve for owners of properties in the vicinity of Kolshet air force station in Thane, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday struck down communications issued by the station commander which imposed restrictions on development of nearby properties falling within 750 metres of approach and take of funnel zone of heliport at the defence establishment.The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht struck down the communications after noticing that two notifications issued under provisions of the Works of Defence Act, 1903 imposed no fetters on development of properties lying beyond 100 metres from boundary wall of the air force station, but the station maintained that no construction of multi-storied building was permitted in the funnel zone of their heliport.The court was hearing a petition filed by Runwal Constructions. The developer had moved HC last year after the air force authorities repeatedly refused their requests for no objection certificate (NOC) to construct a ground-plus-10 storey building at about 500 metres from the station, but the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), which approved the developers plans in August 2019, insisted for an NOC from the air force station before starting the construction.The developer contended that under the statutory notifications issued under the Works of Defence Act, restrictions on constructions were imposed only to the extent of 100 metres from the compound wall of the air force station, and therefore the authorities could not have extended the restrictions on the development of properties beyond 100 metres by issuing executive instructions.“In our view, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on a citizen’s rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) and Section 300A, only by enacted law,” said the bench.“The only way to impose restrictions on enjoyment of the property in the vicinity of a defence establishment is by invoking powers under the Works of Defence Act, 1903,” it added and struck down the communications, issued by way of executive instructions.Defence authorities had opposed Runwal’s petition contending that the plot in question was within 500 metres from the air force station where Indian Air Force is operating a helipad which is extensively used for military operations, training purposes and is also earmarked for movement of VVIPs like the prime minister.The operation of heavy helicopters require flight path to be clear of any obstruction up to 750 metres and a mandated glide slope of 3 degree on approach would provide height of 39.3 metres above the ground at a distance of 750 metres from helipad landing point. The safety requirement warrants that there should be a safety margin of 50 metres between any obstruction and the mandated glide slope. Therefore, to ensure safety of helicopters no construction can be permitted in the flight path of heliport to the extent of 750 metres.They added that the NOC for the project was denied because substantial part of the plot comes within flight take-off and landing path of heliport.The contentions, however, failed to impress upon the bench. HC said defence authorities exercised their right of restriction by issuing notifications of February 14, 2007 and January 13, 2010 by clearly specifying that all areas falling within 100 metres of the air force station need to maintain restrictions.It is relevant to note here that the notifications came to be issued after considering all relevant factors pertaining usage of the air force station and following due process as prescribed under provisions of the Works of Defence Act. The said notification still hold and therefore any restrictions imposed, contrary or in addition to the notifications, would be illegal and contrary to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reprieve-for-owners-of-land-near-kolshet-air-force-station-101620500349952.html

09-05-2021||Mumbai||Elections proved to be good for helicopter industry: Operators||The 2021 elections proved beneficial for the growth of the helicopter industry. Helicopter flights operated for around 45 days exclusively for election purpose with more machines being used from March till mid-April, as compared to pre-pandemic elections, said operators. Rajan Mehra, chief executive officer of Club One Air, said he saw a healthy growth of around 25% in March and April but added that elections were not the only reason for this increase in bookings. “There was increased travel to Dubai, Maldives and Europe, especially in the days before most countries announced travel bans from India due to the second wave. During elections, the most prominent increase was noticed for the Northeast and West Bengal, which contributed to around 40% of election flying, followed by Chennai, Karnataka and Puducherry,” Mehra said. However, according to Gulab Singh, chairman of Saarthi Airways which operated helicopters only to West Bengal, the elections in the five states were dull when compared to previous ones. “We had around 250 flights in around 45 days. We had lesser rallies this time. Majority of the election flying was over by the first week of April,” Singh said.Data collected from various private helicopter operators reveal that around 2,500 hours of flying took place in about 45 days during elections. According to the data sourced by operators, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) used 11 aircraft, followed by Congress and Trinamool Congress with six helicopters each, for campaign. Helicopter services were flying to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam during March and April, whereas it continued for a longer period in West Bengal. According to Captain Uday Gelli, president of Rotary Wing Society of India (western region), the situation was normal with respect to flying in March as Covid-19 cases remained in control during the month. He said the industry could do a better business this election season. “Initially in May, no one talked about the pandemic and hence flying was in full swing then. Rotary Wing Society of India estimates that during elections, helicopter operators seem to have flown three times more than the earlier elections, with the southern states seeing flying for 20 days while West Bengal saw flying for 45 maximum days. Corporate helicopters were also used for election flying, and it is estimated that they would have flown about 400 hours of the total 2,500 hours. Single-engine helicopters, too, were used but in a very limited way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elections-proved-to-be-good-for-helicopter-industry-operators-101620500290282.html

He had arrived in India on a business Visa.In order to evade getting caught while travelling with the bag with contraband, he deliberately left it at the Dubai airport and arrived in Mumbai via Delhi. He then lodged a missing bag’s complaint at CSMIA and went to a hotel in Juhu for stay. As NCB officers had already received inputs about Mulowa’s suspicious involvement in drugs trafficking, they kept a close watch on his movements from airport to hotel and hotel to airport for two days. On Friday when Mulowa arrived at the airport entry area to collect his bag, he was apprehended by NCB officers. On examining the bag, the NCB team found three packets of heroin weighing around 4kg from hidden cavities. The seized drugs could be from Afghanistan, said NCB investigators.“The accused is a Zambian ex-army officer and was injured in combat operation. He retired from the army on medical grounds. His wife and four kids live in Lusaka. This was the third time Mulowa had arrived in India and we are checking if he smuggled drugs on his previous visits,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB.African drug traffickers, according to NCB, are no longer using ordinary citizens as mules and are roping in ex-army personnel for trafficking narcotics as they are trained professionals and are hard to crack during investigation, Wankhede said.The senior Indian Revenue Services (IRS) officer added that amid the extensive crackdown by anti-narcotics agencies on African nationals trafficking cocaine, drug rackets have now switched to smuggling heroin, mostly cultivated in Afghanistan, and bringing it to India via the air route. The usual route of smuggling heroin has mostly been from Afghanistan to Pakistan and then to India through the porous border or from Afghanistan to Pakistan then to Sri Lanka by sea route. It is smuggled in India mostly via Chennai,” Wankhede said.According to NCB officers, due to Covid-related movement restrictions imposed across various nations, the demand of heroin, a highly addictive narcotic, has increased and thus its rate has also gone up. The drug now cost around ₹6 crore per kg in the illicit market, from ₹5 crore per kg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ncb-arrests-ex-army-officer-from-zambian-with-heroin-worth-26-crore-101620500229863.html

The department has also sent out another survey form asking for feedback on the conduct of entrance exams for first-year junior colleges (FYJC), a plan that it has been mulling over the last few days after receiving suggestions to that effect. Officials from the state education department did not respond to calls and messages.Nearly 17 lakh students appear for the SSC exam from across nine divisions in the state every year. This year, due to rising Covid-19 infections in the state and the resultant lockdown, the government decided to cancel the exams and announced the same on April 20. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that students will be marked based on internal assessments.After a series of deliberations and discussions with various stakeholders including educationists, schools, teachers and parents, the education department has now asked schools to give their suggestions and objections on the proposed marking criteria for students. “This survey is conducted to know if there should be an internal assessment on a school level and the schools are prepared for that or not. Internal assessment will be based on online classes, WhatsApp-based teaching and assessment, online tests, term examinations, practice tests. Schools which didn’t undergo these processes will assess their students’ performance based on performance if the student is in 9th class,” stated the survey brief. The department has been mulling several options like considering cumulative scores of students over the years, conducting entrance exams and adding seats for junior college admissions this year. Another survey has sought responses from students on the conduct of common entrance test (CET) for FYJC admissions. “All the aspirants will be eligible for this CET which would have multiple-choice questions. There will be only one paper of 100 marks consisting of questions of all the subjects and the duration of the paper will be 2 hours. This offline test is planned in July 2021 or after the decrease of the spread of Covid-19 in every school following SOPs of Covid-19 break the chain regulations” stated the form while inviting responses. All schools in the state including government, non-government, aided, unaided, self-financed can participate in the survey and can indicate whether or not they can mark students based on internal assessments.Schools, however, said forms have added to unnecessary confusion. “First, the government decided that students will be marked on internal assessments. Now when they ask schools, everyone is going to say yes, because there is no other logical answer after exams are cancelled. Besides, this form is widely circulated on social media and anyone can fill it. Why can’t it be done formally through an online portal?” said a principal.Vikas Garad, deputy director, Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training said that the survey was only conducted to take feedback and the final decision will not be dependent only on the survey results. “We just want to know if schools are in a position to give us details of internal assessments and whether they have such data. If we look at the responses so far, majority of them have said yes. Similarly, majority students have said they will be okay with entrance exams,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-internal-assessments-maharashtra-edu-dept-holds-feasibility-study-101620500229203.html

Benevolent and well-intended, his act may be; the same cannot breach the Constitutional provisions of equality. On the touchstone of these morals & principles of law, MM seems to have faltered,” the judge said in his order.Also read | Covid-19 in Delhi: Fewest new infections in a day since April 15, positivity rate falls to 23.3%Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) V K Swami, appearing for the state, argued that “the oxygen concentrators should be released to such facilities where they could be used round the clock for those who needed it the most”.On May 5, MM Anuj Bahal had ordered the release of 12 oxygen concentrators seized from two accused persons, Vinay Agarwal and Akash Vashist.The court noted that the MM was greatly influenced by the fact that two judicial officers had lost their lives in battle with Covid-19. “One of them being his own brother colleague with whom he shared the corridors. As I pen down this order, the judicial fraternity has lost one more officer, who also succumbed to Covid-19 virus,” the judge noted.The court asked the Investigating officer (IO) to move a fresh application before the District Magistrate who, according to the directions of the Delhi high court, would release the seized concentrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-sets-aside-order-to-release-o2-concentrators-for-use-by-police-judicial-officers-101620499509783.html

The cellphones of people who are close to Kalra have been put on electronic surveillance and a close vigil is being kept on their movements as well, the officers said.HT tried to contact Kalra on Saturday through calls and text messages but he could not be reached for comment.After recovering oxygen concentrators from the firm’s godown, police also arrested Gourav Khanna, the 47-year-old chief executive officer (CEO) of Matrix Cellular company from Gurugram on Friday in connection with the alleged cheating, criminal conspiracy, hoarding and black marketing case that was registered by the south district’s Lodhi Colony police station. Khanna is the fifth person to have been arrested in the case.The other four include the company’s business head, manager and a sales executive, and the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, from where the first batch of 32 oxygen concentrators, a carton of thermal imagers and a carton of N95 masks were recovered.Also read | Police raid Khan Market restaurants, seize O2 devices“Khanna was overseeing the import of oxygen concentrators and their sale at high prices. The private firm (Matrix Cellular) was being used to import oxygen concentrators and they were being sold through ’Xpect Everything’, an online portal,” deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said after Khanna’s arrest on Friday.On Saturday, all the files and documents related to the case were handed over to the crime branch team that will further investigate the case to establish the entire nexus behind the alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators. According to police, the accused were selling oxygen concentrators, costing around ₹20,000, for around ₹70,000 using fake price tags. Police said that the 524 seized concentrators were among 650 such machines that were imported from China and Hong Kong earlier this month.“Apart from tracing the remaining 126 concentrators that were already sold, the investigating team will also look into rumours that the illegal trade started in October-November and many such devices were sold in the past five-six months. Khanna’s questioning may help the investigators piece together the missing links in the case and also identify other players who were involved ,” said an officer, requesting not to be named.According to the police, of the 524 seized oxygen concentrators, 96 were recovered from Khan Chacha restaurant and nine from Town Hall restaurant, both in Khan Market, following raids on Friday. The remaining 419 were recovered from Nege & Ju restaurant-cum bar in Lodhi Colony and the Matrix Cellular company’s godown in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur two days before.“All oxygen concentrators have been imported and acquired by paying applicable import duties, GST / IGST and all sales are done through on their mobile app, and payments are received through online banking channels,” said Samudra Sarangi, lead counsel for Matrix.“The charges of black marketing and hoarding are not only baseless in law, but also irresponsible in such times when Matrix should be focused on fixing the demand-supply gap for oxygen concentrators. Unfortunately, Matrix is victim of police excess and will follow the due legal process to defend itself and its employees to the fullest extent. Matrix has complete faith in our justice system and trusts that the Courts will protect the unjustly victimised,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crime-branch-to-probe-recovery-of-524-oxygen-concentrators-from-3-restaurants-godown-101620499509196.html

09-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala court allows NRI couple to adopt minor siblings||In a rare instance, an Ambala court has allowed an NRI couple to adopt minor siblings — their nephew and niece — after the children’s stepmother refused to accept them. The siblings’ paternal uncle who is of Indian origin holds a permanent visa of New Zealand while his wife is a citizen of the country. The minors — a 13-year-old boy and his 11-year-old sister — reportedly get along well with the couple who had come to India in 2019. The separate applications were cleared by the court of Sangeeta Rai Sachdev, additional principal judge (family court) on May 3 and May 5, almost one-and-a-half months after it was moved by the couple in March.As per the orders, the judge, while approving the adoption said it was in the interest of both the children and fresh documents will be prepared by the authorities. The biological father had no objection to the adoption, the order reads.“The man had married another woman almost after six months after the death of his first wife in 2010 and has a 10-year-old boy with his second wife. Apparently, their second mother refused to accept them and the children do not relate to her as their mother. They are being cared by their grandparents, who cannot sustain the burden of this responsibility at this age,” the order read.Sukhvinder Singh Nara, the couple’s counsel said that as per the process, proper verification through Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) and an in-camera consent from the children was taken by the court.“The Ambala court issued the guidelines under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and Hague Convention On Protection of Children And Cooperation In Inter-country Adoption, to which India and New Zealand are signatories,” Nara said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-court-allows-nri-couple-to-adopt-minor-siblings-101620499089741.html
09-05-2021||Other||Kotkapura firing case: New SIT product of Capt incompetence, says Sidhu||In yet another tirade against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, this time over the constitution of a new special investigation team (SIT) to probe the 2015 Kotkapura firing, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said the government was forced to accept the high court order due to his (CM’s) “incompetence”.Giving six months to the new SIT to compete the probe will further “extend the delay” in giving justice, the Amritsar East MLA said on Saturday. The state government on Friday constituted a new three-member (SIT), headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav, to probe the Kotkapura case. The SIT will complete the investigation within six months. The high court on April 9 had quashed a report in the case by an earlier Punjab Police SIT, headed by IG (now retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh and asked the government to form a new SIT. In a series of tweets, the Congress leader hit out at the CM, who also holds the home portfolio, saying: “Sad !! Due to incompetence of the home minister, govt is forced to accept orders of the high court, which the people of Punjab are standing up against. Giving 6 months to new SIT, extends the delay of govt’s biggest poll promise, unfortunately up to next elections code of conduct.”“Injustice caused by deliberate delay is betrayal of people’s mandate. After multiple inquiry commissions, SITs and passage of 6 years, evidence has weakened while accused have gained in wisdom, making their defence stronger due to repetitive investigations on the same matter,” Sidhu said in another tweet. The cricketer-turned-politician has been critical of his own government after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the earlier probe report into the firing case. He had accused Amarinder of evading the responsibility in the case. Last month, he blamed “one person” for having colluded with the culprits of 2015 sacrilege cases, without naming the CM. Reacting to the criticism, the CM had termed Sidhu’s outbursts “total indiscipline” and said he may be leaving for the AAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sidhu-at-it-again-attacks-capt-over-new-sit-in-kotkapura-case-101620491168695.html
