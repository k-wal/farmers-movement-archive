He said the state urgently needs more tankers, as it currently had only 15 at its disposal. These, he said, were not enough to handle the requirement for transporting the oxygen supplies from other states. Punjab has a 195 metric tonne (MT) allocation from plants in other states, but the actual supply received over the past seven days has been around 110-120 MT daily. The number of patients on oxygen support has also gone up from 4,000 to 9,000. “The situation remains fluid and a matter of concern,” he said. The current consumption of oxygen in the state is more than 225 MT daily. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said a tanker takes 4-5 days to bring the 90MT allocation from Bokaro plant and unless the state gets more tankers, the situation could aggravate. In addition to 90 MT from Bokaro, the state’s current allocation is 60MT from a plant in Baddi, 20MT from Panipat, 15MT from Roorkee and 10MT from Dehradun. Another 80MT is generated daily from air separation units (ASUs) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants in the state. Medical education minister OP Soni said more oxygen cylinders were also needed at government hospitals to meet the growing requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-needs-more-tankers-to-transport-oxygen-capt-to-centre-101620065714002.html

03-05-2021||Gurugram||25 docs come forward to help in Covid care after Gurugram admin’s appeal||A week after the Gurugram administration appealed to private medical staff for help, some 25 doctors and other healthcare staff have come forward to help in Covid-19 management, according to officials on Monday.Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “We have received inputs from 25 health professionals, who want to help in managing the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. We are screening their profiles, to decide where they can be deployed — tele-consultation, online consultation, or in the additional bed facilities that are being added.”Panwar, the nodal officer in the project, said that all 25 healthcare professionals will provide services, depending on their time and availability. “As the number of health professionals are still low, they will be judiciously deployed for different services so that everyone is helped. We hope that more doctors will come forward in the future.” he added.Last week, the district administration had appealed to private doctors, retired medical professionals, and students to come forward and help in managing Covid-19 cases. The district administration, through social media, had put out an appeal, stating, “The Gurugram administration requests for volunteer doctors, nurses and MBBS students who are fit and willing to provide their services in public health facilities. We appeal to such professionals to come forward at this hour of need… We would be immensely grateful for your support, to help us treat our residents.”Meanwhile, doctors from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Gurugram chapter, said that they are ready to help the government with additional doctors, but are unable to help due to lack of oxygen supply.Dr Sarika Verma, secretary, IMA, Haryana chapter, said, “All private doctors are ready to come forward and help the health department in managing the rising Covid-19 cases, but our hands are tied. Most patients in hospitals need oxygen, which is not always available. Even if there are additional beds and private doctors, we would not be able to do much unless there is enough oxygen available... Gurugram has approximately 4,000 private doctors at various hospitals, and it can be doubled, but first, the existing beds should have sufficient oxygen supply.”At present, Gurugram has an allocation of 35 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen.Commenting on the concerns, Panwar said, “We are continuously working to increase the oxygen quota of the district. We have an additional capacity of 5 MT of oxygen (over already allotted 35 MT), and more will be supplied by the oxygen express. The situation should improve in the next two to three days, but meanwhile, I appeal to the doctors to come forward and help…”Meanwhile, Gurugram reported 3,037 fresh Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths on Monday. The active cases in the district now stands at over 37,000. The recovery rate is at 71.69%, while the fatality rate is 0.38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/25-docs-come-forward-to-help-in-covid-care-after-gurugram-admin-s-appeal-101620065357659.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Remdesivir records in hospitals to be checked to prevent black marketing||A day after three people, including two staff members of private hospitals, were arrested for black marketing remdesivir injections, the district drug controller said they will start verifying stocks of the antiviral drug in all city hospitals from Tuesday. Amandeep Chauhan, the district drug controller, said they will count the empty vials and cross-check them with the batch numbers. “The nursing staff of many hospitals have been found involved in illegal activities and black marketing antiviral drugs. Hospitals need to keep a close watch on them and ensure the injections issued for patients are used in the presence of duty doctors,” he said. At least 43 hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients in the district. With a massive surge in the number of Covid-19 patients and deaths, the healthcare system is under stress. Medicines, oxygen and hospitals beds are in short supply, taking advantage of which many are engaging in illegal sale to make a quick buck. At least six people have been arrested in five cases of black marketing Covid-19 drugs so far, said police. The police said that in many instances, it was noticed that suspects were replacing new stocks of remdesivir with empty vials. Any hospital found involved in any illegal activity related to Covid vaccination and antiviral drugs will face strict action, including termination of licences, said officials.Concerning the arrest of a staffer of Narayana Hospital in DLF Phase-3, Chauhan said, “Nitin Jose, who worked as a nursing staff supervisor at Narayana Hospital in DLF Phase 3, was involved in selling injection for ₹55,000. After he sold the first injection we activated the teams and verified the injection was original and checked its batch numbers so that we could track where was it supplied,” he said. Commander (retd) Navneet Bali, regional director, northern region of Narayana Health, said, “We would like to confirm that the remdesivir injections of the batch numbers mentioned in the notice shared by police department were not supplied to or received by Narayana Superspeciality Hospital. The hospital is maintaining the internal records about remdesivir stocks and will extend full cooperation with the authorities on this matter,” he said. The police said they arrested Jose when he was supplying remdesivir to a decoy customer they sent. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department (CID), said that three of the suspects they arrested so far worked as a gang and shared their numbers with the families of patients. “Chetan Kapoor, a resident of Punjab, working as a senior security assistant at Max Hospital, Gurugram, was the agent who used to deal with families and used to send his wife for the deliveries,” he said.An official spokesperson for Max Hospital said, “We are following all government orders and ensuring our stocks are checked daily and audited regularly.”Another official from the investigating team probing the case said that many gangs are selling fake remdesivir vials in the city. “We are looking into details on who has bought them through them and how many deaths were reported from them. We are suspecting more staff members of these hospitals are involved and were helping them but the probe is underway,” said Yadav. The suspects were produced before the district court on Monday and taken on two-day police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/remdesivir-records-in-hospitals-to-be-checked-to-prevent-black-marketing-101620065356951.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Veggies, fruit prices go through the roof and out of stock in Gurugram||Gurugram residents complained that vegetable and fruit prices shot up on Monday as Haryana went into a seven-day lockdown in an effort to curb Covid-19. Haryana State Agricultural Market Board (HSAMB) officials said they suspected that the prices were being artificially inflated. But vegetable vendors said that the price rise was due to the increased demand as people scrambled to stock up for the week.Gurugram was locked down since Friday night when the state government announced a weekend curfew in nine districts. On Sunday, the government announced a lockdown till May 10 in the entire state. Even as the residents alleged prices were higher in the retail market, HSAMB officials did not share the information on prices.“I purchased onions at ₹60 per kilogram from my local vegetable seller, more than double the market price. The vendor informed me that the his stock was fast running out and hence, he was selling all the vegetables at inflated prices. I am now exploring ways to procure frozen vegetables, packaged potatoes, and dehydrated onions via online shopping until the lockdown is over as they will be much cheaper,” said Tanuja Kumar, a resident of sector 53.Mihir Kohli, a resident of DLF 5, said that a wholesale vegetable seller near his house ran out of stock by noon, while stocks of fruits and vegetables were also over around the same time on several e-commerce apps.“The wholesale seller delivers to homes and is an ideal option for hundreds of residents during the lockdown. However, such was the demand that his stock finished by noon. I then tried to purchase them through e-commerce website but their stock too was over. I finally asked the vegetable seller inside the condominium for a few vegetables and purchased it at three times the price,” said Kohli.Anaita Kaul, a resident of DLF Phase 4, said that she had been relying on e-commerce stores for her fruits and vegetables till now but they were now running out early in the day.“The app I used had a midnight deadline for items. A week ago, they moved it up by an hour citing high demand. While the deadline remains the same, fruits and vegetables since Saturday have been running out of stock by around 1 PM. On the app, the company has put a notice stating that they have run out of capacity and cannot take any more orders,” said Kaul.Low wholesale, high retailMandi sellers said that without their daily customers, and only catering to vendors, have forced them to sell their goods at 10-15% lower than market price.“We have too much stock and hardly any buyers. Only small time vendors are visiting the mandi to purchase items. Without any daily customers, we are selling our goods at lower prices to ensure vendors pick up more of our stock which would otherwise go to waste,” said Rajesh Yadav, a vegetable vendor in Sadar Bazar mandi. Local vegetable vendors said that in the last two days, they have ran out of stock by afternoon, and they increased prices due to demand.“Earlier, my one-time purchase from the mandi (market) would last me for a minimum of two days. However, such is the demand now that the stock is over in less than half a day. Realising the demand, I have increased my prices to increase my profits and I am also in the process of procuring more stock from wholesale markets and local mandis due to the surging demand,” said Ashok Yadav, a vegetable vendor in sector 50.Will act: agriculture boardVinay Yadav, secretary, HSAMB, said that the board has taken cognisance of the issues and will curb it.“The board has received complaints from many residents about the inflated prices of fruits and vegetables throughout the city. We will take two main steps to keep a check on this. On Tuesday, we will be releasing both the retail and wholesale market prices of vegetables and fruits via a public notice as well as circulating the same on various RWA groups to ensure people are informed about the correct prices and can report instances of inflated prices back to us so that our teams can penalise such violators,” said Yadav.Yadav also said that the HSAMB will be constituting teams on Wednesday who will be visiting various retail markets, roadside vendors, and residential shops at random to check for inflated pricing and penalise offenders while they will also pay a visit to other such establishment based on a tip-off from residents or RWAs.HSAMB officials, as well as vegetable vendors, shopkeepers, and sellers at markets maintained that there is no issue in regards to supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/veggies-fruit-prices-go-through-the-roof-and-out-of-stock-in-gurugram-101620065349653.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||RWAs say they can’t set up Covid centres without admin’s help with essentials||Two days after Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg empowered resident welfare associations (RWAs) to set up their own Covid-19 care facilities (CCFs), RWAs said that the plan might fail without help from the administration to procure medicines, machines, oxygen cylinders.Garg’s plan was to reduce the burden on existing facilities, including big and small hospitals, that are reeling under the heavy case load in April. The city had suffered over 59,000 cases in that month alone.Garg’s order issued on Saturday stated that RWAs can set up the facility at community centres, clubhouses, or empty flats using their own resources. It said that the facilities were approved following requests from the RWAs.“The deputy commissioner’s order does not mention any financial assistance or supply of resources from the administration,” said Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC) an umbrella body of RWAs in the city. “RWAs simply do not have the capital or the resources to themselves set up a fully functional CCF. We will be reaching out to the DC for more assistance in the matter.”On Monday, the district administration also issued a set of guidelines for setting up these facilities.The CCF, it said, will not be for critical patients, senior citizens, children below 10 years of age, pregnant or lactating women, people with comorbidities, or those whose immunity was compromised. They, the guidelines said, should be admitted to proper hospitals. Those admitted in a CCF must be attended by a doctor residing in the complex who should undergo training organised by the chief medical officer.This point has come in for criticism.Nilesh Tandon, president of Fresco Apartments RWA, a condominium in Nirvana Country, said, “The order is impractical and not feasible. The whole idea of setting up a CCF was to ensure patients that cannot find hospital beds can use this facility instead. Asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients are anyway isolating at home, we wanted to set up a facility where severe patients can get admission along with the correct line of treatment.”Tandon said that the aim of setting up a CCF was to use the assistance of the administration and the health department to treat patients rather than the other way as it is now. “Also doctors are likely to be overburdened at this point where the cases of Covid-19 are surging day-by-day,” he said.Garg could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rwas-say-they-can-t-set-up-covid-centres-without-admin-s-help-with-essentials-101620065290864.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Death toll crosses 500, over 35% of state’s active cases in Gurugram||The Covid-19 death toll on Monday reached 511, with 14 deaths confirmed by private hospitals and the district health department. The steep rise in Covid-19 cases in the last one month and escalated death count, especially in Gurugram and Faridabad, have put Haryana among the 10 most affected states having a high fatality rate. “Since Haryana is among the affected states showing a rapid surge in cases, it is likely that fatality will also rise. It can reach up to 2%,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Currently, the fatality rate in the state is 0.88%, which is lower than the national fatality rate of 1.1%. In the last seven days, the district recorded 65 Covid-19 deaths, according to the district health bulletin. The situation, however, on the ground, has been different as many Covid-19 deaths at the cremation ground are going unreported. According to the union ministry of health and family welfare data issued on Monday, due to a powerful resurgence in coronavirus cases, the state on Sunday recorded 145 new deaths and 13, 322 new infections. Over 104,722 cases are currently active in the state, out of which Gurugram has 35.5% of the infection load. On Monday, at least 3,037 new cases were confirmed in the district, which took the active case count to 37,244. The average number of coronavirus cases reported every day is now at the highest since the outbreak of the epidemic. According to officials and experts, poor respiratory hygiene, lax social distancing and influence of the new variant have led to a spike in new cases. On average, the district reported about 3,834 new cases per day in the past seven days. It has increased from 3,329 cases confirmed in the previous week, with the number of active cases soaring from 10,691 on April 17 to more than 37,000 at present, in just a fortnight.Currently, the test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of total samples tested, has also increased to 33%, compared to the 10% reported in the second week of April, when the daily case count began escalating. The positivity rate of the state has also increased to 7%. “Testing has been increased in at least 170 large outbreak regions (LORs). On Monday, about 16,000 tests were done in affected areas. The health department has recommended the district administration to extend LORs to roughly about 200,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district Covid-19 surveillance officer. The health department along with private labs has been conducting 12,000 tests per day, on average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/death-toll-crosses-500-over-35-of-state-s-active-cases-in-gurugram-101620065290171.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Oxygen supply increased on CM’s intervention||The district received 43 metric tonnes of oxygen on Monday from plants in Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and neighbouring Panipat, besides a share from the oxygen express from Rourkela, on its way to Faridabad. Officials said that the supply was eight metric tonnes (MT) more than the supply on Sunday and also three more than the allotted quota of 40 MT. Officials said that the increased supply of oxygen over the past two days has helped in reducing the number of distress calls from hospitals and they are working towards streamlining the distribution of oxygen.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that the district has over 37,000 active Covid-19 cases and needs resources on a large scale to manage the situation. “We have started receiving more oxygen within a day after the chief minister took over monitoring and the quota has also increased. We got 35 MT on Sunday and on Monday, 43 MT was given. This has reduced the number of distress calls coming from hospitals and things will improve further. The CM will be assessing and monitoring the situation daily, which will help in faster decision making,” said Garg. Senior administration officials, however, said that the distribution of oxygen to private individuals and small nursing homes was still a cause for concern. In another important development, the health department said it has allocated 500 remdesivir injections to 42 hospitals that are registered with the government for treating Covid-19 patients. Also, the health department has allocated 10 doses of tocilizumab injections to patients after a requirement was raised by hospital authorities concerned. Officials privy to the matter said that an increase in allocation of oxygen quota for Gurugram district, and the decision to distribute remdesivir and tocilizumab was done on the intervention of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who, on Saturday, took direct charge of managing and coordinating the Covid-19 measures in the city. The decision came after an unabated increase in the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Gurugram over the past one and half months.Garg said that the prices of ambulances were also capped on Monday after the matter was discussed in the review meeting chaired by Khattar. “The distribution of life-saving drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab has also started,” said Garg.An official privy to the matter said that the issue of oxygen supply from Bhiwadi in Rajasthan to large hospitals in Gurugram, which had been initially stopped by the Rajasthan government, was also resolved on Khattar’s intervention. “The situation is serious in the city and his presence will also push government officials to work with more alacrity,” he said.Intervention by the chief minister, said officials, also helped them work out the modalities of airlifting oxygen trucks with the help of the Indian Airforce to Rourkela, as currently oxygen is being ferried through the rail network. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, regional transport authority, Gurugram, said “We have airlifted four empty oxygen tankers to Angul in Odisha, which will carry nearly 70 metric tonnes of oxygen. Five tankers have been sent to Rourkela in Odisha, from where an additional 50 metric tonnes of oxygen will be procured.”Yadav said the tankers were sent to Rourkela by train from the Faridabad railway station and will return late Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/oxygen-supply-increased-on-cm-s-intervention-101620065289545.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Limited jabs affect Covid vaccination drive||Amid the limited availability of Covid-19 vaccines, many private hospitals in Gurugram did not conduct a vaccination drive as they failed to procure vials from the manufacturers. Only 1,898 people above 18 years took their first jab on Monday, at 20 government sites and only two private hospitals.“There is no clarity on the vaccination drive now. Our hospital has to close its vaccination centre as there is no stock . We have also approached the Serum Institute of India (SII) for procurement of Covishield, but the private hospitals have to wait for at least three to four months,” said Dr Devlina Chakravarty, managing director, Artemis Hospital, adding that the limited availability of vaccines has impacted the second dose inoculation too. “Since there is no vaccine available, people who require a second dose will have to go to government facilities,” Chakravarty added.Anil Khatana, head of operations, W Pratiksha Hospital, confirmed that the vaccination centre was shut. “The hospital has approached Bharat Biotech for the procurement of Covaxin. But we didn’t yet get a response from the vaccine manufacturer. Many corporates have been approaching us to set up vaccination booths, but there is no clarity when the hospitals are likely to get the vaccines.” Earlier this week, the state government had directed private hospitals to directly procure vials from the vaccine manufacturers. Currently, only two private hospitals, Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI) and Max Super Speciality Hospital (MSSH), have been giving the jab to those above 18 years. These facilities vaccinated only 514 people above 18 years on Monday, while at least 1,384 took the jab at government sites.Arpita Mukherjee, vice president operations and head, MSSH, Gurugram, said, “The hospital administered the jab to 500 people from across the district and nearby areas by 6 pm on Monday.”“The health department no longer provides vaccines to private hospitals. They have to directly coordinate with the manufacturers,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO). Yadav, however, said that the department has roughly about 18,000 doses for the population above 18 years. “It is expected that the state government will allocate more vaccines,” he added.Data shows that at least 1,502 took the second shot on Monday, of which private hospitals covered only 52 people above 45 years of age.Even the Gurugram health department has limited the number of doses. “At present, the department has 2,000 doses for second shots. Over 13,000 additional doses were to come on Monday night. Vaccination for 18+ people will be now held at 20 vaccination centres. For people aged 45, who require the second dose, vaccination will take place at 37 sites,” said Dr Amandeep, urban nodal officer, refusing to comment on the vaccine stock for inoculation of the 18+ population.Amandeep also said that the health department will continue giving jabs at the 20 vaccination centres for the time being. These centres will be reflected on the CoWin portal during the self-registration process, which is mandatory for people in the age group of 18-44 years, to receive the shot. The list includes Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) Tigra, Nathupur, Mullahera, Rajiv Nagar, Firoj Gandhi, Fazilpur, Gandhi Nagar and Patel Nagar. In rural areas, the listed centres are Community Health Centres (CHCs) Farrukhnagar, Pataudi, Ghanghola, and health centres at Daulatabad, Bhondsi, Bhangrola, Garhi, Mandpura and Bhora Kalan, among others. The other sites are government polyclinic in Sector 31, Civil Hospital in Sector 10, and sub-divisional hospital in Sohna.In the previous vaccination drive, the Gurugram health department and private hospitals in the district had jointly covered more than 30,000 people a day. Now, the health department is likely to utilise the limited doses gradually, due to the constrained supply of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/limited-jabs-affect-covid-vaccination-drive-101620065229569.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Ambulance rates for Covid patients fixed, violation will lead to loss of licence: RTA||The regional transport authority (RTA) on Monday imposed a limit on the charge private ambulances could levy to ferry a Covid-19 patient.An advance life support ambulances (ALS) can be hired at a maximum of ₹15 per kilometre, while a basic life support ambulance at ₹7 per kilometre. The patient need to show a Covid-19 positive certificate or prescription for admission from a doctor.The surge in cases in Gurugram and the subsequent rise in demand for private ambulances has left relatives of many Covid patients fuming at exorbitant fares.On Monday, HT had reported on how private ambulances demanded ₹20,000 to ₹30,000 to transport patients to a private hospital within a 5 km radius. For outstation transport, the rates went up to ₹1.5 lakh. At present, there are not rate cards for any type of ambulance service.National health mission director (Panchkula) on Monday fixed the rates and directed all transport commissioners to impose it.RTA secretary (Gurugram) Dhaarna Yadav said, “We were not dealing with ambulances earlier and were involved only with the requisition, but now onwards we will ensure no one is fleeced by the ambulance drivers and providers.”Yadav said anyone facing issues with ambulances could send a complaint to rta.grg@hry.nic.in.“The complaints should include the registration number of ambulances, name of the driver and location from where they booked to destination. If they can collect any evidence or recording that will help us in investigation and making a strong case against the driver and service provider,” she said.Yadav said if any driver is found overcharging their driving license will be cancelled. “Also the registration certificate of the ambulance will be cancelled, vehicle will be impounded and a fine of ₹50,000 will be imposed in case of noncompliance,” she said.The officials also instructed the drivers to keep masks, gloves and PPE kits for attendants in case of emergency.Jalandhar administration has fixed price of ₹1,200 for the first 15 km and an additional ₹12 per km for additional distance in BLS ambulance up to 2,000 cc with basic life support. As per the Maharashtra government’s order, private ambulances are not allowed to charge more than ₹1,190 for 0-25 kms or for two hours. And beyond 25 kms, the rate can’t be more than ₹25/km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ambulance-rates-for-covid-patients-fixed-violation-will-lead-to-loss-of-licencerta-101620065230254.html
03-05-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram lockdown off to a rocky start||On the first day of the week-long lockdown, markets, shops and shopping malls remained shut but moderate traffic was witnessed during the rush hour as office-goers and industry workers flocked to their workplaces. Residents said that the main issue was a lack of clarity regarding the movement of domestic workers, including drivers and helpers, as a detailed order was issued late Sunday. While the administration clarified that domestic helps will not be stopped, the police said that they will ensure strict enforcement of lockdown, particularly in the large outbreak regions, where entry and exit are banned unless for emergency reasons.A spokesperson for the district administration said, “The movement of domestic workers is allowed.”Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao said that their focus is to prevent non-essential movement, particularly in large outbreak regions. “Police presence at borders to Delhi, Sohna, Nuh and Pataudi has been increased. We have set up 40 police pickets, adding to the 35 which were set up outside containment zones where a total of 1,600 personnel are deployed,” said Rao, adding that non-essential entry of people from other states is also not being allowed. The movement of people in residential areas is also being curtailed if they are moving around for non-essential reasons, he said. Many colonies in the city also closed their gates to ensure that the non-essential movement of people is controlled. Gates of both sides in sectors 4 and 5 were closed on Monday afternoon and vehicles were not allowed to enter. In Palam Vihar, entry and exit were regulated through a single gate by security guards. Unlike last year, when the lockdown had to be enforced by the police and many violations were noticed, the markets and shops across the city on Monday afternoon were found to be closed. Barring shops selling essential goods, major markets in sectors 4, 7, 14, 22, 23 and 31, Palam Vihar, Old Railway Road, Sadar Bazar, New Railway Road and MG Road wore deserted looks. Shops in irregular colonies such as Ashok Vihar, Sheetla Colony, New Palam Vihar and adjoining areas also remained shut. However, residents alleged that the lockdown was flouted in areas along the Dwarka Expressway, Southern Peripheral Road and Golf Course road. “At present, the people are staying indoors themselves but there are large-scale violations. There is no screening or checking of people entering or exiting the large outbreak regions. If the enforcement is strict, cases will go down in a week. Else, it would take longer,” said Pravin Malik, a resident of Sare Homes in Sector 92. Malik also said that there was confusion about whether domestic workers are allowed. “There should be clarity on this matter as several families are unwell due to Covid-19 and need help,” he said. Manish Wazirabad, a resident of Ardee City, said, “In Sector 56 market and Wazirabad, several shops were open. The police must enforce lockdown strictly.”The district administration, however, said that adequate police personnel were deployed to enforce the lockdown. “The lockdown is being enforced, but we also appeal to the people to follow guidelines strictly,” said the spokesperson for the district administration cited above. Residents and members of trade associations said that rapid surge in infections, lack of hospital beds, shortage of oxygen and rising number of deaths has forced residents into adhering to norms. “A large number of people are infected and several deaths have been reported. With health infrastructure already creaking, no one wants to visit a hospital. We can earn later, but it is necessary to break the chain of infection,” said Vinod Sharma, a resident of Rajendra Park. After the extension of the lockdown, the police also changed the locations of police posts and pickets across the city. The Gurugram police has a total of 6,500 personnel and around 2,500 home guards and special officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-lockdown-off-to-a-rocky-start-101620065169541.html
03-05-2021||Chandigarh||No takeaways from restaurants, only home deliveries allowed: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday banned all takeaway deliveries from restaurants, which, he said, was being used by youngsters as a pretext to move out of their homes. Chairing a virtual meeting to review the Covid situation, Amarinder directed the officials that only home deliveries of food should be allowed. He also gave permission for shops selling fertilisers to be open, modifying the additional restrictions imposed by the state home department a day ago. Reiterating that he was not in favour of a complete and harsh lockdown, the CM warned people against laxity in adherence to the curbs imposed in the state. If the the situation did not improve, we would be forced to consider a total lockdown, he said, adding that he had so far refrained from ordering a sweeping lockdown because it would hurt the poor the most and would lead to exodus of migrant labourers, plunging industries into chaos again. ‘Bed capacity to be increased by 20% in 10 days’ Underlining the need to step up preparedness amid projections of a peak in the coming days, Amarinder ordered 20% increase in bed capacity in the next 10 days. He directed the health and medical education departments to get stadiums, gymnasiums and other such places ready to house patients. Tented camps should be set up, and gyms/halls should be converted into L2 and L3 facilities to be prepared for the worst, he added. Health minister Balbir Sidhu said the situation was grim with only 300 beds now available at L3 level in the state. Health secretary Hussan Lal pointed out that the state’s positivity rate had on Sunday stood at 12%, with the Malwa region showing increase cases in the last 7-10 days. The state’s overall CFR is close to 2%, and even higher in rural areas at 2.7%. The worrying factor was that 17% of all deaths had no co-morbid conditions, he said. Journalists among frontline workers The CM also announced the inclusion of all accredited and yellow card journalists in the state in the list of frontline warriors. All power corporation employees in the state have also been brought into the ambit of frontline workers. These employees, along with the journalists, will now be eligible for all benefits, including priority vaccination, that frontline workers are entitled to from the state government, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-takeaways-from-restaurants-only-home-deliveries-allowed-capt-101620065050214.html

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath made the announcement at a Covid review meeting with Team-9 here.This will be the first time the state will have such a Covid-focused panel of health experts, said the state government on Monday. There was no such panel to assist Team-11 that was engaged in Covid management in the state during the first wave. The decision was taken on a day on which the state reported 29,192 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking its total case count to 13,42,413 while the death toll reached 13,447 with 288 more fatalities, according to official data.Reputed medical experts from SGPGIMS (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences), KGMU (King George’s Medical University), Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical University and RML Institute (Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences) will join the advisory panel, said a state government statement.Team-9, formed to deal with the second wave of Covid pandemic, is a restructured form of Team-11. It consists of the health minister, the medical education minister and several top bureaucrats in the state.At the meeting, Adityanath stressed the need for such an advisory panel for effective control and necessary strategy on Covid-19.He said the current strain of the coronavirus had constantly been mutating and was 30 to 50 times more infectious than it was in the first wave.“In some cases, it has been observed that Covid’s TrueNat, antigen or RT-PCR test rule out Covid even though CT scans (of the chest) show that a patient’s lungs are infected. Such a problem has also been observed in people without symptoms,” he added.He once again asked for setting up of teams like Team-9 at each of the 75 districts and these teams would report daily to the chief minister’s office.Yogi said that in last 24 hours a total of 38,687 had recovered. So far, 10.43 lakh people recovered from Covid since the first case last year.Regarding oxygen supply, Yogi said that rail, road, and air routes were being used to transport oxygen. Within two days, 40 tonnes of oxygen from Jamnagar (Gujarat) would come on an Oxygen Express train while a 10-tanker Oxygen Express from Jamshedpur had left for UP.Rural testing drive deferred by a dayThe chief minister asked Team-9 to launch an extensive Covid testing and tracing drive in the villages from May 5. Earlier, the chief minister had announced May 4 as the launch date for the drive.

03-05-2021||Pune||Private hospitals in Pune approach pharmas for vaccine supply||Given the shortage of vaccines in the city, prominent hospitals have begun to approach manufacturers directly to procure adequate supply. The hospitals have sought clear guidelines from the government about the buying process from manufacturers, who they are in touch with. “We already have contacted the Serum Institute to get vaccines for our hospitals, as we only were the ones who did trials of Covishield at our hospital. We also directly contacted Bharat Biotech, but they told use it will be first given to the government. After two months the vaccines will be available for the private sector. We are ready to buy the vaccines… as much as we can,” said Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Vidyapeeth medical college, hospital and research centre. Oswal’s remarks came at a time when many industries and big corporates based in Pune have asked hospitals to arrange mass vaccination for their employees. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “We approached vaccine manufacturers within the country to get the vaccines, but it is not available now for private players and we are going to wait. Whenever it is going to be available in the open market, we have plans to purchase it.” Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, demanded clearer guidelines regarding vaccine purchase. He said, “There is a need of crystal-clear guidelines about vaccine purchasing by the private sector. Currently, there is a shortage of vaccines and so we have closed our vaccination centre, but there is a need to have guidelines through which the process will be carried out smoothly.” Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall Clinic said, “We have not yet approached any vaccine manufacturers, but are ready to buy the vaccines when they will be available in the open market.

We will start vaccination (for the 18-44 age group) from May 5. The vaccines will be administered free of cost to all the citizens," he added.The vaccination drive for the 18-44 category, which was scheduled to take off on May 1, was deferred due to the unavailability of vaccines in Madhya Pradesh.Vaccination of eligible beneficiaries from other categories is already going on in the state.Madhya Pradesh's Covid-19 tally stood at 6,00,430 on Monday while the death toll reached 5,905, as per the state health department.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath doubted the feasibility of the vaccination programme announced by Chouhan."The vaccination programme, which should ideally be held round-the-clock at a very fast pace, will now be held in sessions on different dates in the state and that too in limited numbers. It will take months to vaccinate the citizens of the state," Nath said.He alleged Covid-19 patients and their families are still struggling to get a bed in a hospital, medical oxygen and life-saving drugs."....Who is responsible for this situation?" he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/covid-in-mp-vaccination-for-18-44-age-group-to-begin-on-may-5-says-cm-chouhan-101620058579965.html

Facing this problem, a private hospital in Ramgarh was recently forced to shift all its Covid-19 patients to other hospitals, officials said on Monday.Proprietor of Niramaya Das Health Care Centre in Ramgarh, Dr Bhanu Das said, “I shifted all my our Covid-19 patients to other hospitals where beds were available two to three days back, as we were facing acute shortage of Covid-19 related medicines. I have no right to keep patients in the dark if I can’t treat them in absence of the drugs.”However, many patients at the hospital did not want to be shifted initially, Dr Das said. “I told them that I was ready to treat them provided they could arrange certain Covid-19 drugs. I gave them the prescription but they failed to find the medicines. Finally, they agreed to shift. We provided them hospital ambulance service for the same.”There were 24 beds, including three oxygen supported ones and a ventilator, at the hospital. Dr Das said demand of medicines used treating Covid-19 increased manifold with the rise in number of cases in the district. “I have heard that some big hospitals were stocking the medicines to avoid shortage during treatment. Besides, common people are also panic purchasing the drugs and stocking them for emergency purposes,” he said, adding that more than half of the total staff at the institution were also suffering from the disease.Director of state drugs control directorate Ritu Sahay could not be contacted for her comment over the issue despite repeated efforts. However, officials of Ramgarh administration said they received complaints anout medicine shortage a couple of days back. “But now, there is no such shortage. Frequent inspection of medical stores is also being done,” they said.Besides hospitals, Covid-19 patients, who are getting treatment while under home isolation, were also facing the same problem. A resident of Tenughat in Bokaro district, Siddhartha Shankar, who was recently detected with infection, said, “Almost all essential medicines for the disease are out of stock here. Most of the medicines prescribed by doctors such as Doxycycline, Ivermectine, L Montus, Zincobit or Zinc tablet are not available at medicine stores here. In such situation, how do we treat ourselves in home isolation?”Ramgarh registered 197 new cases and five deaths on Sunday, according to the state’s Covid-19 bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ramgarh-hospital-shifts-patients-for-want-of-covid-drug-101620058148100.html

The weather pattern is likely to remain the same till May 8-9.”Ranchi on Monday recorded the maximum temperature at 35.2 degrees, around two degrees below the normal temperature. Even though the rainfall was scanty at 1.4mm, it was enough to cool the city’s weather, officials said. Ranchi also recorded significant fall in night temperature at 20.7 degree Celsius on Sunday night, 2.1 degrees below the normal.Anand said, “There is hardly any chance of heavy rains in the state due to lack of moisture. There is a system forming in Rajasthan, but winds coming from there carry limited amount of moisture. So, only light rain and winds are expected. Jharkhand can expect respite from the hot weather for at least a week.”Most parts of the state experienced relief from warm weather. Jamshedpur recorded 5mm rainfall, that brought down the day mercury at 37.5 degree Celsius. Similarly, Daltonganj recorded the day temperature at 38 degree Celsius.

Several colleges are already running counselling sessions and mental wellbeing programmes for their students throughout the year. “From the last one and half years since the pandemic started, we are continuously working on our students for their mental wellbeing, as everyone of us are affected due to Covid and need mental support. Initially, we organised various online programmes and sessions for students, but as they were already overloaded with several online lectures and education series, we stopped that and focused more on group activity building, one to one counselling and mentoring sessions by senior students to new students. In the last one year, more than 1,000 students at COEP have benefited from this wellness programme,” said Kshipra Moghe, centre head of COEP wellness centre. COEP is one of the foremost engineering colleges in the country that has introduced a dedicated helpline for their students. Besides, the ‘COEP Mitra (friend)’ and ‘ICareWeCare’ initiatives have made a mentorship programme for this year’s new first year students. Around 600 newly admitted students are divided into batch of 20 students each, while each batch has a final year one student as their mentor along with a faculty teacher. “The new initiative which we have launched is mental health awareness month, which is celebrated in USA, and we are also doing it here for our students. Daily we give small activities or things to do to students which will give joy and a bit of relaxation to them. We all know that situation is worse outside, we are talking about it for a year but now we need to live with this new normal and get going forward. So, our focus was on the mental wellbeing as well as to be productive now in our studies and daily life. We have created a 30-day calendar for students, declared it on social media platforms and told students to share their daily activities,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/coep-launches-month-long-wellness-programme-for-students-101620057907967.html

Patna also accounted for 24 of the 82 Covid-19 deaths in the state during this period, which takes the state’s cumulative casualties to 2,821 and cases to 5.09 lakh since the detection of the first Covid-19 case in the state on March 22 last year. Among those who died on Sunday were the registrar of the Veer Kuer Singh University Nanheshwar Prasad and Narvadeshwar Rai, principal of the Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak College, Buxar. The Patna district administration ordered shifting of the Mithapur wholesale vegetable market to Chitkohra ground and the Digha market to ITI Maidan, which were comparatively more spacious. It had also ordered shifting of the Kankerbagh and the Rajendra Nagar vegetable markets to Rainbow Maidan, Rajendra Nagar. Meanwhile, the health authorities have decided to add 112 oxygenated beds for Covid-19 patients at the Patliputra Sports Complex in Kankerbagh locality of Patna. “The system doesn’t show admission of patients at the Patliputra sports complex today. We are trying to make the facility functional as soon as possible,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh. “From May 1, we have added 100 beds at the ESIC Bihta hospital and 115 at the Rajendra Nagar eye hospital. Eighty-four of the 115 beds at the Rajendra Nagar facility are oxygenated beds,” said Dr Singh. “We’re increasing beds in Patna as well as in other medical college hospitals.

Dr Singh, who has been advocating for a national lockdown for around 15 days now, said it would ease the burden on heathcare facilities, which are already stressed. Dr Ajay Kumar, acting president of the IMA, Bihar chapter, said many senior doctors and heads of institutions were also in favour of a lockdown. “Many senior doctors, I spoke to, are in favour of an immediate lockdown. I have spoken to the directors of AIIMS-Patna, Dr PK Singh, and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Dr NR Biswas, besides the principal of the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) Dr Vidyapati Choudhary, superintendents of PMCH Dr IS Thakur, NMCH Dr Binod Kumar Singh and the Netaji Subhas Medical College and Hospital Dr Uday Kumar, and they are unanimous about a lockdown,” said Dr Kumar. “We are also trying to involve in our campaign for a lockdown the heads of medical units of BJP and JD(U), but they are yet to respond,” Dr Kumar said. He said the United Kingdom and China did well to contain the spread of virus by imposing lockdowns. “The United States of America, on the other hand, had to pay a heavy price for not imposing a lockdown,” Dr Kumar said. Talking about the lack of awareness in rural areas, he said there were still many people who came for consultation at his private clinic in Maner without wearing mask, and he ended up giving them one in order to sensitise them against the virus. Besides, six out of seven people, who come to my clinic with complaint of fever, still do not get themselves tested for Covid-19, roaming around freely, without masks, spreading the virus in the society,” recollected Dr Kumar. “Free movement of all such people will be curbed and the Covid-19 chain broken in case a lockdown is imposed, though some may argue that the country’s economy will suffer. Still, the risk is worth taking,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ima-for-lockdown-to-break-covid-chain-101620057728673.html
03-05-2021||Other||Bihar govt gripped in a state of indecision: HC||PATNAThe Patna High Court Monday said the state’s health department was fighting the Covid battle without of help of experts in their respective fields and the hospitals were struggling without adequate supply of oxygen, important drugs and manpower. “It is like complete failure, as infection seems to be unabated. The government seems to be gripped in a state of indecision,” it said.The court’s observation came after the director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna, declared Covid hospital by the state government, said it had only 200 beds available, including 60 ICU beds, and it could not admit more patients due to irregular/short supply of oxygen cylinders and lack of required manpower. The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah observed that the situation was even worse at ESIC Hospital in Bihta after the authorities informed the court about the problems due to non-availability of medicines. “The doctors deputed there by the armed forces are virtually sitting idle. The government is not able to provide adequate support,” the court was informed. Upset over wrong facts submitted before the court that IGIMS was fully converted into Covid hospital and ESIC had 500 beds, the bench said that what the state government had furnished before the court in the name of a comprehensive action could “by no means be treated as an action plan, let alone a comprehensive action plan”. “We had directed the state government to prepare a comprehensive action plan for Covid management on April 15 and since then we have been reiterating during every hearing, but to no avail,” it observed. The court said that in the absence of an action plan, the system appeared to be moving aimlessly. “When the court wanted to know whether the state determined the quantity of oxygen it would require for treating Covid patients, it was informed that such determination is based on the number of patients in hospitals. This calculation is not displayed in the so-called action plan. We want a war room, comprising experts, to be developed to deal with the alarming situation,” it said. The bench also took note of the black marketing of essential drugs and oxygen and said it would hear all the aspects again on Tuesday, including the composition of an experts’ group. Advocate general Lalit Kishore, appearing for the state, told the court that if permitted, the state shall constitute a team of experts to advise the state government. Additional advocate general Anjani Kumar informed the court that against the allocated quota of 194 MT of oxygen by the Centre, Bihar had lifted 134 MT. “The state is facing unprecedented challenge, but a government hospital with less beds is raising demand for more oxygen, while others with more beds are struggling for it. The pace of RTPCR tests is also very slow and even slower is the supply of reports to the patients. The undertaking of the health department that the CT value will be displayed in all the RTPCR reports is also not fully honoured. It is a matter of serious concern for us, as it adversely affects treatment. The state must inform the court regarding development in this regard,” the court said. The court had last week expressed displeasure over lack of a strong information system and directed the state’s principal secretary (health) to ensure that the information regarding Covid care centres and hospitals, with their respective addresses and phone numbers, are put on the website of the health department by Friday so that the people in need may approach appropriate centers/hospitals for Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-govt-gripped-in-a-state-of-indecision-hc-101620057727950.html

Rest of the cremation sites, including Gulbi Ghat, Khajekalan Ghat and Nandgola Ghat, will continue the cremation of Covid and non-Covid patients. Like other crematoriums, Nandgola Ghat will also have CCTV camera installation and ‘May I help you’ desk for strict vigil and assistance of grieving families.”“To overcome shortage of wooden pyres at all crematoriums, we have procured the same from Bengal and Sikkim. We have provided 250 tonnes of wooden pyres at Khajekala Ghat and 20 tonnes at Gulbi ghat. Around 50 tonnes of wood will reach here on Tuesday,” he said.PMC provides electric and wooden cremation facilities of Covid-19 victims for free and fixed rates for non-Covid deaths at all three ghats under its jurisdiction. Sharma appealed to people to contact control rooms and provide prior information before visiting cremation sites.“People are requested to inform control rooms of crematoriums and enquire about time slot before taking the bodies of the deceased there. Prior information will help crematorium staff make advance preparations for last rites. This will minimise the time required for cremation and prevent gathering at ghats,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hospitals-a-dedicated-crematorium-for-covid-patients-101620057667916.html

The man was identified as Annasaheb Arjun Ghaytidak (36), a resident of Range Hills area of Khadki in Pune. The police are on a lookout for one other person identified as Nabab Ali, a resident of Sanjay Park, in the case. A team of anti-dacoity and vehicle theft cell-2 raided Ghaytidak’s house to initially find 56 bundles of Indian currency notes. The first note in each bundle was the demonetised note of ₹1,000 followed by 99 notes of “Manoranjan Bank of India” printed on them. Similarly, 400 duplicate notes of ₹500 denomination were also found. Upon checking the man’s vehicle, the police recovered six gunny bags full of such bundles. In those six gunny bags, the police found a total of 288 bundles of ₹1,000 notes. The total worth of the face value of all the seized notes was found to be ₹24,35,440. The police also seized the arrested man’s vehicle, a Tata Safari, found to be worth ₹3 lakh. The man was found to be a Hawaldar in the Indian Army who had been absconding from his post at 521 ASC Battalion in Guwahati, Assam since February 2020, according to the police. The police had raided the place based on an anonymous information input but later found a witness called Santosh Ramchandra Raje (43), a resident of Satara who was duped of ₹4 lakh by the duo. The duo had convinced Raje that they had demonetised notes of ₹1,000 worth 200 crore collected from non-resident Indians (NRI). The duo had made Raje believe that the Reserve Bank of India was now exchanging notes collected from NRIs. The duo then promised a 5 per cent commission to whoever could get the new ₹2,000 notes for half of the money they made the victim believe that they had. However, when Raje approached them to take up the job, they took ₹4 lakh from him as deposit. However, as Raje could not find a legitimate method of changing the money, he started asking for his deposit back but never got it. A case under Sections 489(c), 420, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 7 of the Specified Bank Notes Act 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/absconding-army-hawaldar-arrested-for-cheating-using-fake-notes-101620057247698.html

Kare said, “There are several new roads being built in areas like Hadapsar with road connecting Kalapadal and Chintamani Nagar, Mohammadwadi road, the road along Pune-Kolhapur railway line from Ramtekadi to Sasane Nagar, Phursungi border, Kondhwa to Katraj road, the connecting road from Magarpatta to Koregaon Park and Kharadi bypass to Mundhwa. There is not a single new tree planted.” “According to the tree authority rules and urban street design, any new roads have to have trees as they are essential to provide shade to road users especially, pedestrians and cyclists, to reduce local ambient heat and provide cooler atmosphere as well as improve quality of air by absorbing pollutants,” he added. As recommended by IRC codes, street trees should typically be upright and branched above 2.4m to provide adequate walking clearance under branches. It is mandatory to have tree pits (0.6 X 0.6) which provide space for tree growth. Tree pits can be individual, elongated or connected. They may be surfaced with porous pavers, or grates that allow water to readily flow to the root zone. Vijay Shinde, superintending engineer of the PMC road department said, “We have been planting trees in various areas wherever they are uprooted to make new pavements. I am not aware of the progress of the new roads and if there is any pending work, will inspect and plant new trees accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-flouts-own-rules-on-tree-plantation-in-hadapsar-mohammadwadi-and-kondhwa-101620057187632.html

The total worth of the seized material is estimated to be around ₹2,09,70,000, according to Navneen Kunwat, sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Lonavla division. The factory was running out of a structure in Fangane village in Lonavla, located along the old Pune-Mumbai highway. “We got information from people in that vicinity that something wrong was happening in a building in that area. We did not know what was happening, so we went there and found these people producing large quantities of something and filling it in drums. We found 118 different types of chemicals. Upon questioning, the people present there revealed that it was gutkha. They produced patents of nine different brands of gutkha when it is illegal to produce gutkha in Maharashtra. So, we are investigating where they acquired the patent from. This product was clearly made illegally,” said SDPO Kunwat. The men were found preparing gutkha of different varieties and revealed that the drums filled with these products were transported to another facility where it was packaged in different brands’ packets, according to the police. “We are investigating where they bought this quantity of raw material from and where they sell it,” said SDPO Kunwat. A case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and National Food Security Act 2013 was registered at Lonavla rural police station against seven people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gutkha-products-worth-rs-2-crore-seized-from-lonavla-101620057127643.html

The police were investigating the murder of a woman named Shubhangi Sagar Lokhande (21) who was killed in Shivshaktinagar chowk in Bhekrainagar area of Hadapsar on the morning of April 7. The case was registered at Hadapsar police station under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) when the woman’s body was found. Upon investigation, the police found that the woman had been killed by her husband Sagar Balu Lokhande (23), a resident of Uruli Devachi area of Pune. During interrogation, the man revealed that he was enraged about his wife getting in touch with her former husband, according to the police statement. “During a fight with the arrested man, his wife had revealed that her (former) husband had already killed a man in the past and that he would kill him if he tried to break them up,” read the police statement in Marathi. The former husband was identified as Santosh Sahdev Shinde (27), a resident of Kamthe Ali area of Fursungi in Hadapsar. The police tried to find him at his address to investigate the murder that the deceased woman had allegedly told the arrested man about. However, the police found out that the man had been missing from his own address for the past year and a half. At the time of Shinde’s disappearance, in December 2019, the police found an undetected murder case registered at Hadapsar police station. The deceased in that case was Narsingh Vitthal Gavhane (65) who was found dead in the burning ghats of Fursungi with his head bashed with a brick. The police found Shinde at his sister’s place in Chikhali on April 9 and interrogated him to find that he had killed Gavhane. However, he was found to be Covid-19 positive upon arrest and sent to Sassoon Hospital for treatment. He was remanded to police custody to April 21 and later sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-crack-december-2019-murder-case-during-investigation-of-another-murder-101620057067652.html

He said the IMA would continue to urge the government to impose a nationwide lockdown as it would lessen the burden on the healthcare facilities which are already stressed.Dr Ajay Kumar, acting president of the IMA, Bihar unit, said many senior doctors and heads of institutions were also in favour of a lockdown.“Many senior doctors I spoke to are in favour of an immediate lockdown. I have spoken to the directors of AIIMS-Patna, Dr PK Singh, and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Dr NR Biswas, besides the principal of the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) Dr Vidyapati Choudhary, superintendents of PMCH Dr IS Thakur, NMCH Dr Binod Kumar Singh and the Netaji Subhas Medical College and Hospital Dr Uday Kumar. All of them are unanimous about a lockdown,” said Dr Kumar.“We are also trying to involve the heads of medical units of the BJP and the JD(U) in our campaign for a lockdown but they are yet to respond,” Dr Kumar added.He said the United Kingdom and China did well to contain the spread of the virus by imposing lockdowns. “The United States of America, on the other hand, had to pay a heavy price for not imposing a lockdown,” added Dr Kumar.Talking about the lack of awareness in rural areas, he said there were still many people who came for consultation at his private clinic in Maner without wearing a mask. He said he would give sanitiser and masks to such patients to sensitise them against the virus."Six out of seven people who come to my clinic complaining of fever still do not get themselves tested for Covid-19 and roam around freely, without masks,” Dr Kumar said.“Free movement of all such people will be curbed and the Covid-19 chain will be broken in case a lockdown is imposed, though some may argue that the country’s economy will suffer. Still, the risk is worth taking,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/indian-medical-association-calls-for-lockdown-to-break-chain-of-covid19-101620054441045.html

Several patients have lost their lives in the national capital since last month as hospitals have only managed to make temporary arrangements to address the oxygen shortage and their supplies are exhausting regularly.In a letter to Sitharaman, Sisodia said oxygen concentrators have become essential life support machines during this unprecedented health crisis. “Oxygen concentrators are in short supply and even if one manages to arrange an oxygen cylinder, there is an unprecedented shortfall in the availability of medical oxygen creating uncertainty and panic among patients under home isolation. There is no availability of oxygen concentrators in the market,” Sisodia said.Also Read| Delhi to receive 205 tonnes of liquid oxygen in Railways’ biggest single-day loadCiting Delhi’s Covid-19 disease situation, the deputy chief minister wrote there have been 25,000 fresh cases on a daily basis and 10% of these require some form of hospitalisation including oxygen support. Over 50,000 patients are in home isolation and around a quarter of them require some sort of oxygen support at home due to difficulty in availability of beds in the national capital.Sisodia informed Sitharaman that there are 16,272 non-ICU oxygen beds and 4,866 ICU beds in Delhi and the Aam-Aadmi Party-led government is creating additional 15,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,200 ICU beds “which are likely to be operationalised over the next 10 days.”The deputy chief minister also wrote that he was grateful to the Centre for allowing import of oxygen concentrators for personal use through e-commerce portals till July 31 and the reduction of integrated GST (IGST) on these imports from 28% to 12%.Also Read| Centre exempts imported Covid-19 relief material from IGST till June 30 for free distributionEarlier in the day, Sisodia wrote to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, seeking the Indian Army’s help to set up and operationalise coronavirus facilities with 1,000 ICU beds and 10,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds.Also Watch| Delhi Covid crisis: Sisodia seeks Army’s help; speaks on oxygen shortage﻿Nearly 1.2 million have been infected with Covid-19 in Delhi while 16,966 have succumbed to the disease.

03-05-2021||Pune||Covid second wave: Young patients in grip of ‘Happy Hypoxia’||Pune: The second Covid wave has infected many young population (0-25 years), unlike the first outbreak. Young people are reporting lung infections and suffering from “Happy Hypoxia”, a condition where the patient does not know that their blood oxygen level is low and continue with their daily activities. According to medical experts, non-regular monitoring of oxygen saturation levels in these cases could cause death also as the drop could be too steep and youngsters would not realise because of their high immunity and health. The normal oxygen saturation in bloodstream of a healthy person is above 95 per cent, but these cases could display dangerous decline of as less as 40% and would need immediate oxygen support and in critical cases, ventilators as well. Dr Kapil Zirpe, a member on the city and district Covid-19 task force and head of department, critical care at Ruby Hall Clinic, said that patients with mild and severe symptoms show “Happy Hypoxia”. “Some patients who are at home also display drastic drop of oxygen levels which is common in this condition,” said Dr Zirpe. Dr Dnyaneshwar Mote, member of the Pune city Covid task force for Social Action, said that at least 10 per cent of patients showing “Happy Hypoxia” will need critical care. “This condition is seen in patients with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic. They may not show symptoms of breathlessness but their SPO2 (blood oxygen saturation) levels are dangerously low. This can worsen the Covid symptoms and damage lungs severely,” said Dr Mote. He said patients should regularly monitor oxygen level in blood. “If they notice a drop in oxygen, they must contact their physician immediately and arrange for a bed before symptoms get worse. Patients who are treated in time can recover fast without much lung damage in Covid,” said Dr Mote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-second-wave-young-patients-in-grip-of-happy-hypoxia-101620053168403.html
03-05-2021||City||'Govt not showing true picture of Covid-19 situation': Goa resident doctors||Goa's resident doctors, who are at the frontline of dealing with the pandemic, have written to the Dean of Goa Medical College complaining that the ‘higher authorities’ are misleading the state about its preparedness to tackle the growing number of Covid-19 patients developing serious complications, HT has learnt.“The oxygen supply in various covid wards is not even close to sufficient. The central oxygen flow delivers a very low flow of oxygen at times and that is inadequate to keep NIVS and ventilators working effectively. Also, the oxygen cylinders being used for patients get over in the middle of the night and it takes at least 2-3 hours for replacement cylinders to come. Sometimes, when patients are kept without oxygen during this time, their oxygen levels drop to as low as 60%,” the doctors said in their letter.“The situation with respect to the availability of beds is even worse. Some critical patients have to be managed on trolleys and floors and are kept on ventilators in the critical covid wards. Wards with a capacity of 30 beds have more than 50 patients on average,” they added.“Every day we read in the news that all higher authorities are saying that there is no issue of oxygen and beds. People come and ask us if that is the case then why are patients kept on trolleys/wheelchairs/floor and not getting oxygen? In the middle of the night when oxygen gets over, patients' condition worsens and some even die. The junior doctors on duty are the ones who face angry relatives,” the doctors said.The portal set up by the Goa government to inform about the availability of beds shows that there are more than 50 beds available in health facilities across the state while the actual availability is close to none.Goa reported 2,023 fresh cases taking its tally past the 95,000-mark while the total number of patients who have succumbed since the beginning of the pandemic is nearly 1,300. Over the last couple of days, Goa has recorded deaths in excess of 50 per day.The resident doctors also spoke about a ‘VIP’ culture which they say is forcing them to admit VIP patients despite such patients not requiring hospitalisation.“Residents in covid casualty who are managing more than 30 new patients at a time are told to see these "VIP" patients on a preferential basis and get them admitted fast, even if many times, they don't require admission. The other critical patients who have been waiting for 2-3 hours to be seen then fight with us,” the doctors said.State health minister Vishwajit Rane assured to "resolve their grievances".“The GARD has been our backbone in this fight against Covid-19. During our interaction, we took suggestions from them and also assured them that all their issues will be resolved at the earliest. The government will provide support to them in resolving their issues as their concerns were valid,” Rane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-not-showing-true-picture-of-covid-19-situation-goa-resident-doctors-101620052056695.html

Besides the Indian Plains Blue Royal, the students also found several seasonal butterflies like the Silverlines, Albatrosses, and Orange and Crimson Tips, as well as Pioneers and Gulls.The research paper is a collaboration between Rajat Joshi and Kalyani Bawa, students of environmental sciences in Fergusson College; and Advait Chaudhari and Atharva Bapat, data science students at MIT, Pune; and Swanand Oak, a student of hospitality sciences. The five began to document these butterfly species from 2017. “We traversed six different paths connected to the hill and documented the butterfly species using line transect methods in sunlight conditions on pleasant sunny days,” said Joshi.“Butterflies are amongst the most important creatures thriving in an ecosystem. These are sensitive to their habitat changes and we get to know the state of a particular habitat due to their presence. These are vital pollinating agents and an important food link in the intricate food chains,” said Joshi, who got interested in butterfly watching and photography in Fergusson College, due to a college assignment. “Vetal tekdi is in the heart of the Pune city and an attraction to various nature lovers due to the varied ecological forms here. Many people enjoy the proximity of the green woodland trees, grasslands and the stone quarry filled with water for most of the year. The hill is decorated with various life-forms prevailing on it,” said Kalyani Bawa.From being Sunday photographers of flora and fauna, the students aimed at protection of the butterfly species. “There has been construction planned on the hill premises which would prove dangerous for the local biodiversity to thrive. Thus, considering the ecological point of view, along with educating the people about the lesser known aspects of nature, we selected the hill,” said Joshi.“The most important thing is public participation. Linking the scientific knowledge with the citizens will develop awareness about the rare butterfly species. The awareness would lead to a people’s movement in protecting and conserving the butterflies, as well as the tekdi, from human disturbances,” added Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rare-butterfly-species-documented-on-vetal-tekdi-by-city-research-students-101620051546742.html

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) funded pollution abatement of the Mula-Mutha river and the Mula-Mutha riverfront development project.Under the Jica project, the PMC will construct 11 new sewage treatment plants (STPs) in different parts of the city.Presently, the city generates 744 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage and treats 550 MLD. The project will create an additional treatment capacity of 396 MLD. This includes the laying down of 113.6km of sewage lines and renovation/rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations. When the Jica project is completed in 2025, it will process 850 MLD of sewage, whereas the sewage generation in the city then is expected to increase to 1,200 MLD.The riverfront development project aims to curb sewage flowing directly into Pune’s rivers by laying an interceptor sewer, which will curb and divert the sewage to the nearest STP. It therefore becomes essential to plan for infrastructure services in advance. The embankment will be so designed that it will house the interceptor sewer line.Vivek Velankar, convenor of the Sajag Nagrik Manch, said, “On the riverfront development project, the corporation is assuming that Jica will take care of all the sewage water. However, Jica will happen in 2025 and will treat only 860 MLD of sewage water, as mentioned in the project. By that time, there will be an increase of 350 MLD of sewage flowing into the river. The whole riverfront development project will be useless. Due to the merger of new villages, sewage will increase.”He added, “Jica and the riverfront projects are dependent on each other. If we cannot stop sewage and clean rivers, there is no use implementing a riverfront project. If all sewage released in the river is not treated, finally public money will be wasted.” Mashish Ghorpade, director and a member of Jeevitnadi, said, “Before implementing a riverfront development project, PMC should frame water quality norms. PMC should achieve a certain type of water quality. Otherwise, there is no point in spending crores of rupees on the project.Sarang Yadwadkar, environmentalist, said, “The river should be clean before implementing a riverfront development project. PMC has to give priority to cleaning the river rather than beautification of the riverfront.” Mangesh Dhighe, PMC’s environment officer said, “Water has to be treated. There is definitely a requirement of more sewage treatment plants because of the addition of villages. We will air mark the areas for new STPs. If Jica falls short, we definitely need more numbers of STPs.”Jagdish Khanore, project head of Jica, said, “The main purpose of Jica is to treat sewage water and release it in the river so that clean water will flow in the river. Jica has considered the project population of the existing city area. It has not considered the proposed merger of 23 villages in PMC limits. We will have to make another plan to treat sewage water generated in these villages. At present, we have made plans for the 11 merged villages worth ₹392 crore, to treat 107 MLD of sewage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jica-riverfront-devp-projects-hinge-on-pmc-ability-to-ensure-all-sewage-generated-is-treated-101620050406678.html

03-05-2021||Other||Karnataka bypolls gives hope for Congress revival in state||The Congress emerged victorious in one of the three bypolls in Karnataka and managed to make significant gains in Belagavi that infuses new hope into a party, which analysts said, appears to nurse the potential to reinvigorate its fledgling strategies and its chances in the 2023 assembly elections.Despite the poor outing of the Congress in other state elections, such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Kerala among other places, the results in Karnataka paint a picture of hope for a chance at power for the Congress. DK Shivakumar, the party’s state unit president, said that the results hint that the people were showing their confidence in the party.With just two years to go for the assembly polls, the Congress has an opportunity to capitalise on the internal bickering within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the growing voices against chief minister BS Yediyurappa, they add.“If they (Congress) make their candidate choice strategically and carefully, they can fight the BJP,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru said.Also Read | Karnataka deputy CM Ashwathnarayan appointed as chairman of Covid-19 task forceNayarayan adds that Satish Jarkiholi was a strong local face who was not “paradropped” by the high command, and has influence over the district which can help “stop the juggernaut” of the BJP. The BJP is a cadre-based party as opposed to the Congress that depends on mass support. The supporters of the BJP are more likely to vote for the party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi than the candidate but the same may not be true for the Congress.Analysts said that the Congress has gained in Karnataka by decentralising power, leaving more decision-making powers with the local units than with the high command. However, this has led to the creation of local chieftains like Siddharamaiah who refuse to cede control over party affairs to Shivakumar, who is party president in the state, analysts said. In the case of Belagavi, the party chose Satish Jarkiholi, a legislator known to be politically tactful, despite his well-known differences with Shivakumar, who is known to put the interests of the party over his personal gains. Jarkiholi lost Belagavi by just around 5,200 votes against Mangala Suresh Angadi. In comparison, the Congress candidate in 2019 lost to the late Suresh Angadi of the BJP in 2019 by a margin of nearly 400,000 votes.Though the BJP has made light of any talk on Congress revival in Karnataka, indicators such as local body elections, run on extremely hyper local issues, point to a potentially contrasting narrative.The Congress won six out of the 10 urban local body (ULB) elections across several districts in Karnataka, including pockets of Shivamogga, the home district of chief minister Yediyurappa.The results came as an embarrassment to the ruling BJP, which is yet to put its house in order despite being in power for two years in the state. With allegations of mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, poor performance, cash crunch, running a parallel administration through his second son (BY Vijayendra) and simmering dissent, Yediyurappa has spent most of his time in office managing one crisis after another.The other factor, analysts said, that was helping the Congress was the gradual dilution of the former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S).Analysts also said that the Congress has put Siddharamaiah and Shivakumar at the helm of affairs which gives them the best chance for a revival, if the two can manage to put their differences aside.“We have seen the gradual dilution of the JD(S), are increasingly getting marginalised and searching for a political identity for themselves. So that gives the Congress greater credibility in terms of revivalism in Karnataka politics,” Vinod MJ, a Bengaluru-based political analyst said.“This is a kind of revival that the BJP cannot ignore,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-bypolls-gives-hope-for-congress-revival-in-state-101620046566380.html

03-05-2021||Bhopal||Damoh bypolls: Madhya Pradesh BJP candidate blames internal sabotage for defeat||The BJP's Rahul Lodhi on Monday blamed "massive internal sabotage" for his defeat at the hands of Congressman Ajay Tandon in the Damoh bypoll in Madhya Pradesh, the result of which was announced a day earlier.Tandon beat Lodhi by 17,097 votes, the bypoll having been necessitated after the latter left the Congress and joined the BJP late last year.Speaking to reporters in the early hours of the day, Lodhi said, "The reason for my defeat is absolutely clear. It was due to massive internal sabotage. We lost heavily from the urban areas. People who said the BJP was like their mother have committed dishonesty."Queried about who he was referring to, Lodhi said, "It is senior BJP leader and former MP minister Jayant Malaiya (74) and his family. They are solely responsible for my defeat. We lost in their ward. We lost heavily in city areas where Malaiya's son Siddharth was supposed to drum up support for us."He said the "Malaiya family gameplan" had succeeded while the BJP had lost, and demanded that they be expelled from the party.During the day, Union Minister and senior MP BJP leader Prahlad Patel too had blamed "conspiracies" on the part of insiders for the party's defeat in the Damoh bypoll.The Damoh bypoll result gives clear indications of future challenges, conspiracies and improvements in the system and workers will find solutions through diligence and without being malicious, Patel, the local Lok Sabha MP, had said in a tweet.While former state minister Jayant Malaiya, who was BJP MLA for several terms from the area earlier, stayed away from the bypoll campaign, sources said there were several local leaders in the party who were upset with Lodhi joining it.Lodhi, incidentally, had defeated Malaiya in the 2018 Assembly polls, though the former at the time was in the Congress.MP Home minister Narottam Mishra on Monday said "we lost Damoh due to out own Jaichands".It is a common reference for an insider who betrays, the term coming from the role played by Jaichand who back- stabbed Prithviraj Chauhan in the latter's fight against invader Muhammad Ghori in the 12th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/damoh-bypolls-madhya-pradesh-bjp-candidate-blames-internal-sabotage-for-defeat-101620045537035.html
03-05-2021||Patna||Bihar raises wheat procurement target, sets May 31 deadline||The Bihar government aims to complete wheat procurement based on the minimum support price (MSP) by May 31 despite the process not having begun in the majority of districts.With the aim to procure around 1 lakh MT (metric tonne) wheat, the food and consumer protection department last month asked the district authorities to start the procurement drive through primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) and Vyapar Mandals. However, it received a lukewarm response from the ground-level officials due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.After complaints that farmers were being forced to sell their produce at ₹1,500 to ₹1,600 per quintal against the MSP of ₹1,975, secretaries of food and consumer protection, cooperatives and agriculture departments, held a meeting on Saturday and announced intensification of the procurement drive along with a substantial hike in the procurement target to 7 lakh MT against the previous target of 1 lakh MT announced last month.Agriculture secretary N Sarawana Kumar said this year’s wheat production was estimated to be around 65 lakh MT, up by 10 lakh MT compared to last year. “The procurement has started from PACS and Vyapar Mandal outlets from across the state. The department has roped in ‘Krishi Salahkars’ to prepare the list of farmers in their areas, who are interested in selling their produce to the state government, and facilitate the process,” Singh said.Bihar accounts for 5.7% of the total wheat production in the country. Statistics show that wheat has been cultivated in over 233,000 hectares in Bihar this year. According to the Central government’s records, the state government could produce only 5000 MT of wheat last year, which was less than 1% of the national production.Food and consumer protection department secretary Vinay Kumar said farmers have benefitted from the government’s announcement to procure lentil and gram on the MSP. “The market price of pulses has jumped up since then,” he claimed.Cooperative secretary Vandana Preyasi said the procurement process has been made flexible to reach the maximum number of farmers. “PACS and Vyapar Mandals have done record procurement of paddy this year, even as a district cooperative officer and four other department staff fell victim to Covid pandemic. All the personnel of procurement agencies have been asked to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-raises-wheat-procurement-target-sets-may-31-deadline-101620045666514.html

03-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai's oxygen quota being diverted to Thane, Navi Mumbai, says BMC||The diversion of Mumbai's quota of liquid medical oxygen, currently in high demand for Covid-19 patients, to neighbouring Navi Mumbal and Thane has led to its "short supply" in some hospitals here, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has claimed.BMC's Additional Commissioner P Velrasu has demanded that local administration officials be deployed at the refilling facilities of two companies in Navi Mumbai to monitor and ensure smooth supply of the life-saving gas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).He wrote a letter last week to Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal, claiming that the diversion of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) had led to multiple distress calls of its "short supply" in some hospitals and on one occasion, patients were shifted to other medical facilities.The Maharashtra government has fixed a quota of the liquid medical oxygen for Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and other areas in the MMR, considering the huge increase in its demand due to a surge in Covid-19-19 cases, the letter said."It has been observed that the supply of LMO received for Mumbai quota has been diverted to Navi Mumbal and Thane region from common suppliers," the BMC said in the letter, which was also marked to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner.In spite of the allocation of LMO quota, its availability at re-fillers is decreased for the BMC by more than 50 per cent of the available quota, it said.The BMC said the the supply of LMO should be as per the quota fixed for a particular region.It also requested to deploy adeputy collector and a tehsildar (revenue officer) at the refilling facilities of two companies in Navi Mumbai area, to monitor the supply and ensure smooth delivery of LMO, as per the allocated quota."This will certainly help in reducing the distress calls from hospitals and also avoid forceful transfer of patients or loss of human life due to unavailability of medical oxygen," the civic body said in the letter.The letter said the BMC-run hospitals receive some liquid medical oxygen in jumbo tanks and a part of the LMO is diverted to re fillers, who in-turn provide filled cylinders to the civic medical facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-oxygen-quota-being-diverted-to-thane-navi-mumbai-says-bmc-101620039087312.html

This will help reduce the burden on existing facilities for managing pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and very mild cases of Covid-19 residing in that particular society. Such orders are extremely crucial at this juncture to check the exponential increase in the number of cases and to contain the pandemic,” read the order.Setting guidelines for CCFs, the order said it is not meant for critical patients, senior citizens, children below 10 years of age, pregnant or lactating women, people with comorbidities or immuno-compromised -- all of whom should be admitted to proper hospitals.Confirmed and suspected cases need to be kept in separate partitioned areas and there should also be separate toilets for both categories.Garg’s order further states that CCF can be set up in a community hall, common utility area located within the residential complex, or in empty flats.The facility should have a separate entry and exit point while beds need to be placed at a minimum distance of three feet from each other. CFCs should also be adequately ventilated and a doctor residing within the residential complex or provided by an NGO should facilitate daily medical examination of the admitted patients.The doctor and a caregiver will have to undergo a training on Covid-19 management and infection, prevention, and control practices, organised by the chief medical officer.The CCF will also need to be either monitored by CCTV cameras or guards should be placed at the entry and exit points to ensure patients don’t leave the premises or their relatives, friends, or acquaintances don’t visit them.“The DC’s order only allows RWAs to convert their community center, empty flats into a CCF. It does not provide any financial assistance or supply of resources to the RWA. Without any monetary aid or supply of oxygen cylinders, concentrators, Covid-19 related medicines, and machinery, RWAs simply do not have the capital or the resources to themselves set up a fully functional CCF. We will be reaching out to the DC for more assistance in the matter,” said Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC) an umbrella body of RWAs in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rwas-get-nod-to-set-up-covid-care-centres-101620038164856.html

However, they were visited by a jail warder on Sheru’ request a few days ago. The warder arranged his parents’ video consultation with the doctors in Naini jail and also handed them over a free medicine packet. Later, Sheru was made to talk to his parents over the phone from the jail.Similarly, Chandan, who is lodged in Sonbhadra district jail for the past 20 months, was worried for his old mother, who stays alone in her village. His mother suffers from lung problems and can’t visit the doctor due to her old age. The authorities of Sonbhadra district jail send a warder to her house, who gave her a packet of medicine free of cost after arranging a telephonic medical consultation with a doctor for her.UP prisons headquarters spokesman Santosh Kumar Verma said four prisons in the state are now providing medical assistance at doorsteps to prisoners’ parents and family members, who are seriously ill or suffering from Covid-19 infection. “We have provided medicines for Covid-19 positive people on the same lines,” he added.He said this service was first started at Prayagraj’s Naini Central Jail apart from the district jails at Sonbhadra, Firozabad and Mathura. The facility for prisoners to call their family members over phone started last year at all jails after in person meetings were stopped to curb Covid-19 infections among prisoners.Verma said over 40 such in-house calls have been made so far since last week of April. He said the jail authorities are planning to extend the medical assistance service for prisoners’ families at all 71 jails across the state by setting up a dedicated and trained team of jail personnel for the purpose.Meanwhile, the jail authorities are also focused on maintaining hygiene and cleanliness to curb any infection in the state jails where over 1.10 lakh prisoners remain lodged at a time. At present, 45 temporary jails are operational to quarantine new prisoners for two weeks before they are shifted to permanent jails.Verma said at least 16,611 inmates have been infected with Covid-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic in April 2020. 14,882 of these have recovered leaving 1,722 active cases in UP jails, including 353 in 71 permanent jails and 1,230 in 45 temporary jails .

03-05-2021||Delhi||#StudentsLivesMatter: Cancel, don’t just defer exams say DU students||The new wave of Covid has hit almost every other household across the Capital, impacting lives of many students, directly or indirectly. Students of Delhi University have come forward to raise their voice about the stress to appear for exams, sooner or later. While some are battling Covid themselves, others are tending to their Covid positive family members, and feel that it’s taking a toll on their mental health to prepare for exams alongside. Unable to cope this stress, students of varsities across India have also written to the authorities, with a signed petition, asking for their exams to be cancelled and not just postponed. Alongside, the youngsters are also participating in Twitter storms to ensure that their voice is heard. “Humare exams cancel nahi hue, they have been rescheduled in July. And we really want suspension of online classes for atleast two weeks. Teachers ko bhi request kiya tha, but koi nahi sun raha humari,” says Disha Bhatia, a first year student of Gargi College, DU, adding, “Second and third year ke exams abhi ke liye cancel ho gaye hain, but phir bhi unko bola ja raha hai ki June 1 se unke exams honge... The new wave of Covid has created a turbulence in lives of most of us. Irrespective of this, the professors have been continuously pushing us with back to back tests and assignments. With all the negativity and emotional trauma around us, even the online classes have become a headache and are affecting our mental health.” The digital petition signed by more than 3,000 students, mentioning about this stress that they have been facing during the ongoing Covid wave, asks for complete cancellation of exams and suspension of classes. Arya Ray, a second year student of Sri Venkateswara College, who started the digital petition says, “We didn’t know whether a petition would matter, but we just couldn’t sit at home and do nothing about it. So this was just us doing our bit, trying to make the system play its part. Frankly, it is ridiculous that my classmates and I had to start an online petition, participate in Twitter storms and mass emailing campaigns just to get DU and other universities to take note of the situation and emphasise that #StudentsLivesMatter... The situation with regard to the pandemic is worse than ever; we are struggling day and night to find hospital beds and oxygen cylinders so that our loved ones can at least have a fighting chance and even then, every day brings news of relatives and friends not making it. Our professors are trying their best to take classes even when there are people suffering in their own homes. Despite all of this, there had been no action for respite from the university and we were expected to prepare and sit for exams. Even if they ignore our mental health, our physical suffering is quite tangible and visible now.”DU has postponed the intermediary and final year exams for the moment, and is planning to conduct them at a later stage in the coming months. However, the students have been requesting for complete suspension of exams as well as the online classes. “This wave of Covid 19 has hit everyone, both professors and students, and if they go ahead with the examinations at any stage - later or now - it’ll be a terrible burden for everyone,” opines Sumaho Guha, a second year student of Kirori Mal College, DU, adding, “No one is in the right mindset to either write an exams or check the answer scripts. They should cancel the exams completely for the second year and put greater weightage on the assignments, so that students can put more effort in it. The exams for third year students are crucial, so they could be postponed further.” Meanwhile, IITians have also been facing extreme mental pressure with regard to their examination, and want them to get postponed. Aditi Singh, a student of IIT Delhi, says, “Actually, a lot of students have directly or indirectly been affected by Covid, and we all want the exams to be postponed. They have neither lessened the assignment strain nor have they changed the examination dates yet. Only, there has been a relaxation in the grading and passing criteria. But we want exams to be postponed by at least a week or so, considering the current scenario.” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/studentslivesmatter-cancel-don-t-just-defer-exams-say-du-students-101620025626027.html

Many lives have been lost nationally with hospitals running out of oxygen, prompting a diversion of oxygen supplies to struggling states.Bihar added 13,534 new Covid cases and recorded 97 fatalities, taking the total number of infections to 497,640 and the death toll to 2,739 on Sunday. 40 of these deaths registered on Sunday were reported from capital Patna, where it was difficult to find hospital beds, both in public and private facilities. The state capital reported 2,748 new infections on Sunday- the most by any district.The minister said the oxygen production policy will support the efforts to contain the Covid-19 crisis and will promote, facilitate and incentivise investment in medical and industrial Oxygen manufacturing units in Bihar to lessen the dependence on other states. It will also help create local skilled manpower and employment opportunities in the oxygen manufacturing sector, he added.Underlining the efforts to augment the state’s oxygen generation capacity, the minister claimed that while at the beginning of the current month, Bihar had 11 oxygen refilling plants supplying 16 tonnes of LMO, it had now increased to 19 plants supplying 110 tonne of LMO.As on April 22, Bihar required 157.67 MT (metric tonne) of oxygen for oxygenated beds and 12.42 MT of oxygen for ICU beds, which totals to 170.09 MT. On April 25, Bihar had 156 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) followed by 119 tonnes on April 28 and 107 tonnes on April 29, suggesting an increase in shortfall of the life-saving gas.Supply of 194 MT medical oxygen per day from the Centre will fill the shortage of around 40-50 MT (approximately) that the state is facing, said an official, who wished not to be quoted. The Centre on Sunday increased Bihar’s oxygen quota to 214 MT.Under the new Oxygen Production Policy 2021, the state government will provide 30% capital subsidy for establishing plant and machinery with maximum assistance limit of ₹25 crore for cryogenic oxygen plants producing liquid medical oxygen (LMO); ₹0.25 crores for setting up oxygen storage tanks at existing hospitals, and a maximum of ₹75 crore for oxygen cylinder manufacturing.Investments from the underprivileged social groups of Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Extremely Backward Castes (EBC), women, differently-abled, war-widows, acid attack victims and the third gender, will get a capital incentive of 15.75%.“For availing incentives under this policy, the eligible units will be required to submit Stage-1 application and also apply for financial clearance latest by September 31. This policy will remain in operation till 31st March 2025,” said HusainNoted analyst and former director of the A N Sinha Institute of Social studies, D M Diwakar said the policy was introduced very late by the government.“This policy has come too late and speaks of the government’s insensitiveness towards common people. The proposal for plants, as per policy document, has to be submitted by September. How will the government cope with the requirement in-between? No work has been done in Bihar’s health system and people have been pushed to the wall,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-incentivises-oxygen-production-amid-shortage-for-covid-patients-101620022381189.html

Late Ansari’s son, Hafizul Hassan, who was inducted in the Hemant Soren cabinet in February, managed to retain the assembly seat that has been a traditional strong hold of the JMM, with Ansari winning from Madhupur on four occasions. Though Hassan continued the winning streak, the margin victory reduced from over 23,000 votes in 2019. Thanking the voters and alliance partners of the UPA for their support, chief minister and JMM working president Hemant Soren said, “This is the third by-election win for the UPA dispensation. I hope this will come as n answer to many people who are involved in political gossip in the state.”This was the third by-election in the state since the Hemant Soren goverment came to power in December 2019. The other bypolls were also won by the ruling dispensation . The opposition BJP fielded Ganga Narayan, reportedly a money bag with business interests in Goa, in Madhupur days after he joined the saffron party. Singh contested from Madhupur on AJSU Party’s ticket in the 2019 Assembly polls and stood third in the race. BJP’s former minister and two-term legislator Raj Paliwar lost to Haji Hussain Ansari in 2019. The party’s central election committee picked Ganga Narayan over Paliwar to take on JMM’s candidate in Madhupur, that witnessed a direct fight between the two parties, unlike 2019 when Singh made the election triangular. Meanwhile, state BJP president and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Prakash described the bypoll result as “victory of power and not of the JMM”. “The fact that the JMM managed to win by a thin margin shows that it is losing people’s support. We gave them a close fight and the ruling combine just scraped through. We thank people of Madhupur, as we have lost by very few votes. We will continue to work hard and continue to raise issues of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/madhupur-bypoll-jmm-retains-seat-hafizul-defeats-bjp-s-ganga-narayan-101620017159617.html

Patna, with 2,748 new infections during the last 24 hours, topped the districts with most number of cases as patients found it difficult to get hospitals beds, both in public and private facilities. Hospital beds were scarce as the AIIMS, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), which has been designated as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) were overwhelmed with patients in the state capital. The NMCH, which reported 11 deaths on Sunday, was treating 378 patients while 122 beds were still available there, according to a bulletin released by its nodal officer Dr Mukul Kumar Singh. Similarly, the PMCH had 102 patients out of around 135 beds available for Covid-19 patients. The hospital reported nine Covid deaths on Sunday, according to a bulletin released by its superintendent Dr IS Thakur. Among other leading districts, Vaishali accounted for 805 new infections, West Champaran 652, Nalanda 611, Begusarai 569 and Gaya 544, among others. Meanwhile, former deputy chief minister and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi lost his younger brother Ashok Kumar Modi to Covid-19 on Sunday. Former special secretary, ministry of home, JK Sinha, also lost the battle to Covid-19 on Sunday. The government came in for criticism amid reports that some ventilators, sent by the Centre under the PM-CARES, were lying unutilised in absence of trained manpower to operate them at a government isolation centre in Khagaria. The state faces acute shortage of trained anaesthesiologists and technicians to operate ventilators at its facilities. Barring AIIMS and the IGIMS, government facilities, ventilators were largely underutilised at many public facilities. The government, said sources, was considering to rent out ventilators to private facilities, which had the required infrastructure to operate them. In its vaccination drive, the state inoculated 62,402 people on May 1 against a daily target of over 2 lakh beneficiaries. The state had so far vaccinated 72,28,280 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-reports-97-new-deaths-13500-cases-in-last-24-hours-101620017099651.html

Oraon (38), a tribal leader and state president of LJP’s scheduled tribes (ST) cell, has unsuccessfully contested 2020 assembly elections from Manihari in Katihar.He was abducted Thursday last and his family had claimed to have received a ransom call for ₹10 lakh. While his sister Seema Devi had filed a missing report at Khazanchi Hat police station, his family claimed they also paid the ransom to kidnappers. “Though the family paid ₹10 lakh, the leader was killed,” said a person close to the family.“Oraon was killed due to a land dispute,” said LJP state general secretary, Shankar Jha, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits.The situation became tense on Sunday morning after the police recovered Oraon’s body from Dangraha village of Krtiyanand Nagar block in Purnia district, about 10 kms from his residence. The injuries on his body indicated he had been beaten mercilessly before being shot dead. Both his hands were also tied to each other, said a doctor at Purnia district hospital, where Oraon’s body was taken for autopsy.Later, hundreds of people went on a rampage, vandalising traffic barriers and attacking policemen. Station house officer of Khazanchi Hat police station, Sunil Kumar Mandal, claimed they had carried out raids and the case would soon be cracked.Three persons, including a woman, were earlier detained in the case. Police said Oraon’s body was recovered on the basis of information received from these detainees. A police officer aware of the developments in the case said land dispute was being looked at as a possible motive for the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ljp-leader-s-body-found-three-days-after-abduction-101620017039693.html

03-05-2021||Lucknow||Covid-19: UP real estate sector seeks relief from state, Centre||The real estate sector in Uttar Pradesh is demanding a relief package on the lines of the one given to the micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector by the Central and state governments. They are demanding moratorium on loans, extension of key approvals by a year and on site vaccination drive for workers to cope up with the fresh slump driven by the second wave of Covid-19.The real estate sector has been hit hard with sales and construction activity coming to a halt since the pandemic-induced lockdown in March last year.Just when it started showing some signs of recovery from November last, the second Covid wave has derailed it again, claim industry representatives.Citing various relief measures announced for MSMEs such as moratorium on loans and subsidies, the UP unit of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), an apex body of private real estate developers, has requested for a couple of major reliefs for the real estate sector from the state government.“We have requested the state government to extend the deadline of all statutory approvals by a year. This extension must be enforced after the pandemic subsides,” said Shobhit Mohan Das, president, CREDAI, UP.The developers’ body cites Covid-related challenges hampering progress of projects to seek extension of approvals given by development authorities, housing board and UP-RERA by a year. While UP-RERA has made registration of all projects compulsory, it has also specified a timeframe for completion of the project so that homebuyers get possession of flats within due time.The sector’s other demand to allow vaccination of labourers working at project sites using the fund collected as labour cess from developers.The building and other construction workers’ welfare board of the state government collects labour cess. This fund is utilised for various welfare schemes launched for labourers by the state government.“Vaccination at project sites will to some extent ensure holding back of labourers and continuity in the projects,” said Ramandeep Singh, president-elect, CREDAI, Uttar Pradesh. The CREDAI is also planning to meet union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman with its demand for moratorium on loans taken by developers for their projects. The labourers employed in the sector are primarily migrant workforce, which has begun to leave for their hometowns amid the resurgence of Covid infections. Their departure during the lockdown last year had stalled several projects, which picked up pace only towards the end of the year.“Soon, we will meet the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking moratorium on loans availed by developers and also homebuyers on the lines of MSMEs. This will, to some extent, ease financial constraints of both developers and home buyers,” said Ramandeep Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-up-real-estate-sector-seeks-relief-from-state-centre-101620009839938.html

03-05-2021||Delhi||DU to postpone final-year exams||The Delhi University (DU) has decided to postpone the examination of final year students by at least two weeks in the wake of the fourth wave of Covid-19 that has swept across the Capital. The exams were scheduled to begin from May 15.The decision comes amid demands for postponement of exams by both students and teachers in the light of the current Covid-19 situation.DU’s dean of examination D S Rawat said the decision was taken on Saturday in a meeting attended by all deans, officials and chaired by the acting vice chancellor (V-C) P C Joshi. “Taking the current situation into consideration, it was decided to postpone exams by at least two weeks. There are so many Covid-19 positive cases in the university itself. Sixteen officials in the examination branch have tested positive in the last few days and two of them succumbed to the virus on Sunday morning. The examination branch will remain closed for the next three days,” he said.“We will wait for two weeks for the situation to stabilize. Exams are likely to begin from June 1,” he added.The examination was to be conducted only for final year students. It will be conducted in an online open book format. The university has already announced that it will conduct exams for students of other semesters later.Earlier on Friday, the DU Teachers Association had written to the acting V-C requesting him to postpone the exams. “The fact that students are battling illness of self and family members is evident from the fact that the attendance in classes has significantly dropped. It is cruel for us to continue to behave as if we ought to be unaffected by whatever is happening around us...Many Heads of Departments have already written to the Dean, Examinations requesting that the exams for final year/ semester students be postponed in view of the number of Covid positive cases among students and teachers...Hence, we request you to consider cancelling examinations for all students and decide upon alternative means to evaluate students,” read the letter released by the association.Meanwhile, students welcome the decision. Rashi Rajput, a final year BCom student, said, “Many of my family members are currently down with Covid-19. I have also recovered recently. We can’t give exam under such stressful situation.

03-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi hospitals raise alarm with perilously low oxygen stock||Several hospitals in Delhi sent out desperate calls to authorities to replenish their oxygen supplies when they dropped precariously, threatening lives as the health infrastructure was crumbling under the pressure of an unprecedented rise in the number of Covid patients requiring oxygen or ICU support.With the city reporting over 20,000 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) each day, city hospitals have been facing acute oxygen shortage for nearly two weeks. Many hospitals sought help from the authorities on social media and three --- Sita Ram Bhartiya Hospital, Venkateswara Hospital, Maharaja Agrasen Hospital --- moved the high court, demanding replenishments, saying lives were at stake.Delhi received 454 MT of oxygen in the last 24-hours against its increased quota of 590 MT. This doesn’t even meet its previous quota of 490 MT. The Delhi government has demanded 976 MT of medical oxygen to add 1,200 ICU and 15,000 oxygen beds. According to the Delhi Corona app, only 20 ICU beds of the total 5,154 were available at 11pm on Sunday.Delhi government officials said that the Indian Oil Corporation has given five tankers to the Capital to transport oxygen. On Sunday, the government deployed an official at an oxygen plant in Faridabad to ensure steady supply.After the Vimhans hospital sent out an SOS around 7pm on Sunday, AAP MLA Raghav Chadha tweeted, “This is criminal abdication on part of those who were supposed to supply oxygen. However, we are in process of arranging 2MT of LMO for Vihmans from our reserves so that they get through the night. I urge Central Govt to deliver to us the allocated oxygen. We too are raising SOS.” At least 94 patients were admitted at Vimhans ICU when the hospital said it was about to run out of oxygen.The oxygen shortage has directly resulted in the deaths of 32 Covid-19 patients in two private hospitals of the city in the last ten days. Without attributing any deaths to the shortage, managing director of Aakash healthcare in Dwarka Dr Aashish Chaudhry said, “With erratic oxygen supply, many a times the pressure to the machines in the ICU drops, we have teams on standby but it does result in the worsening of clinical conditions of some.”Around 1pm, the Madhukar Raibow Children Hospital and Sitaram Bhartia hospital, which are primarily mother and child care hospitals, reached for the last few cylinders of oxygen on Sunday.“It has been a constant challenge for the last ten days or so as the need for oxygen soared. We used to need 10 to 12 cylinders of oxygen a day, now we use 90 to 100 cylinders. The government has allotted vendors to us but when we are in need, they might not have supplies. We do high risk deliveries and many neonates are on ventilators other than Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Shishir Paul, clinical director of Madhukar Rainbow hospital, where at least four babies with Covid-19 were admitted on Sunday morning.Madhukar rainbow is the only hospital that has consistently reserved ICU beds for pregnant women and children even as the city had completely run out of ICU beds.Sitaram Bhartia hospital ran out of liquid oxygen on Sunday afternoon and has been managing patients on oxygen cylinders ever since. They received some 20 cylinders as an emergency backup from the government reserve. “But, with the current demand, five cylinders last about 40 minutes,” hospital officials said. Their full tank of oxygen used to last 14 days earlier, now it lasts about 24 – 30 hours, they said. The hospital had four babies on oxygen supply, two of whose mothers were Covid-19 positive and admitted to the same hospital.Maha Durga city hospital ran out of liquid oxygen at 2am on Sunday morning; the oxygen tanker with emergency supply of 0.7MT reached the hospital at 7 am. For five hours, the hospital managed the 130 Covid-19 patients on backup oxygen cylinders. The hospital received another 2MT of oxygen by afternoon, however, there was no assurance for further supply as the vendor had said they were not getting any oxygen.“We have been allotted a restricted quota of 2.7MT, our current requirement is 3.5MT,” said Dr Nitin Makhijia, medical director of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hospitals-raise-alarm-with-perilously-low-oxygen-stock-101620005883275.html
03-05-2021||Delhi||SC tells Centre to raise Delhi’s oxygen quota; SOS calls persist||The Supreme Court directed the Union government to ensure the deficit in oxygen supply to Delhi is met by the midnight of May 3, according to its order uploaded on Sunday, which came hours after at least five hospitals sent distress messages about their dwindling stocks and a day after 12 people died at a private hospital when their oxygen support dried up.The court noted details of allocations, demand, projected demand, and actual daily dispatches of liquid medical oxygen and said it “accepts the submissions” by the solicitor general to ensure Delhi is supplied with oxygen as per its “projected demand”. The order cited an April 18 forecast that predicted Delhi would need 700MT of oxygen daily.“We accept his submission and direct compliance within 2 days from the date of the hearing, that is, on or before midnight of 3 May 2021,” the order said.According to data available on Sunday, the Capital received the most amount of medical oxygen in a day so far with 454 MT on Saturday, which came after the Delhi high court threatened to initiate contempt proceedings against Union government officials. The apex court’s directions now mean Delhi will need to be supplied with 700MT of liquid medical oxygen by the May 3 deadline.Earlier in the day, the Delhi HC pulled up officials from both administrations afresh in an unusual Sunday sitting, which was to discuss an application by the Centre for the HC to recall its May 1 order warning of contempt proceedings if the Capital did not receive its quota of 490MT.“On Saturday, Delhi received 454 MT oxygen, of which 32 MT was arranged from Haryana at the last minute by the central government,” said a senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be identified.Delhi government records showed that between April 21 and 30, the city received total 3,534 MT oxygen – which comes down to 353.4 MT per day. But supplies on Friday were particularly low, 312MT.Delhi government officials said the Capital’s oxygen demand has risen further. “Delhi needs 976 MT oxygen per day. On the other hand, the allocation is only 590 MT. We have already requested the central government to increase the allotment to 976 MT, and to preferably do it from nearby oxygen plants to reduce the supply time. We are not even getting what has been allotted to us. We are doing our best to manage with whatever oxygen we are getting on a daily basis,” said a spokesperson.Some of the shortfall came into focus on Sunday when hospitals began sending SOS messages about their oxygen stock drying up. “We have Liquid Oxygen supply till 12 Noon today at Madhukar Rainbow Children Hospital, Malviya Nagar, New Delhi,” said a tweet by the hospital at 10.27am. A representative later said they had 50 patients, including four newborns, on oxygen support. The hospital does not have a liquid oxygen storage tank and depends on oxygen cylinders from a private vendor.Rainbow Children Hospital was among five hospitals that sent out such SOS messages. Together, these had over 550 Covid-19 patients, although it was not immediately clear how many of them were on oxygen support. The hospital said it received 20 oxygen cylinders around 1:30pm.On Saturday, 12 Covid-19 patients, including a senior doctor, died at south Delhi’s Batra Hospital after the facility ran out of oxygen for around 80 minutes. Late on April 23, 20 coronavirus patients died in similar circumstances at the Jaipur Golden Hospital. The crisis has persisted since April 21 due to a combination of factors. Delhi’s quota set by the Union government is 490MT, lower than the 700MT the Capital’s government says it needs; the city does not have adequate number of oxygen tankers to bring in supplies from neighbouring states, and other states have been unable to spare vehicles for Delhi since they too are recording a surge in oxygen demand as the Covid-19 infection continues to spread.The problem relented briefly last week with the Capital appearing to be able to source adequate oxygen for its reduced bed strength, but that has meant hospitals have not been able to add more vacancies for seriously ill patients who may need oxygen even though they had empty beds.The situation prompted the interventions of the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court, and top officials of the state and central governments, including the Prime Minister, held key meetings.Solutions include setting up more oxygen plants in the city, and link them to hospitals, so that these facilities can become self-sufficient; and bringing in tankers from other states or countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sctells-centre-to-raise-delhi-s-oxygen-quota-sos-calls-persist-101619989137929.html
03-05-2021||Chandigarh||32 ventilators lying unused in upcoming medical college in Mohali||Even as several parts of the state are reeling under an acute shortage of critical care facilities for Covid-19 patients, 32 ventilators are gathering dust at the upcoming Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, Mohali.The ventilators were received nine months ago under PM-Cares Fund, but the institute itself has not been made operational yet. Punjab government had planned to start the first academic session from 2021, but it was delayed due to the Covid-induced lockdown.Principal Dr Bhavneet Bharti said, “We received 32 ventilators under PM-Cares Fund, but we cannot use these until we make the college operational. We are waiting for a team of the National Medical Council to visit for inspection, which was due in March. We will get a go-ahead only after inspection.”It may be recalled that on Thursday, Hindustan Times had reported how eight ventilators, which the civil hospital in Phase-6 had bought around eight months ago were lying unused due to lack of infrastructure and staff to operate it. The next day, hospital authorities had handed over the ventilators to two private hospitals in Mohali. Member of Parliament Manish Tewari said, “In such trying times when people need critical care, ventilators are lying unused. I will take up the matter with the authorities concerned.” Mohali has emerged as a medical tourism destination with 30 private hospitals, having top-class facilities, catering to patients from the region. These currently have 256 ventilator beds, of which 251 were occupied, as on Sunday. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “We will be making the BR Ambedkar Medical College operational soon. We are trying to have some ICU beds in government hospitals too.”Om Parkash Soni, minister of medical education and research, Punjab, said, “We are coming up with 100 more beds at three medical colleges in Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot. We will use these ventilators there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/32-ventilators-lying-unused-in-upcoming-medical-college-in-mohali-101619987518660.html

03-05-2021||Chandigarh||Not a single Chandigarh area untouched by Covid’s second wave||The fast-spreading second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has not spared any sector, village or rehabilitation colony in Chandigarh.In contrast, during the first wave last year, the cases were concentrated in 75% of the city areas, with rehabilitation colonies, particularly Bapu Dham Colony, predominantly affected.According to municipal corporation figures, as of April 30 more than 4,000 houses in the city had active cases. Nearly 73% of these are in sectors and remaining in rehabilitation colonies.Sectors worst affected Notably, almost half of the affected households are located in Sectors 21 to 50.On the other hand, only three areas in colonies/villages – Manimajra, Dhanas and Mauli Jagran – are in the Top 10 areas in terms of number of houses with active cases (see box). Manimajra tops the list with 280 households having more than 450 positive patients, followed by Sector 41 with 145 affected houses and Sector 38 with 141 houses.While in the first wave, the northern sectors remained largely untouched by the pandemic, this time around, the virus has spread to the posh areas as well. In Sectors 1 to 12, 280 houses have over 430 active cases.Absence of curbs to be blamed: ExpertThe lack of lockdown or strict restrictions this year is being seen as one of the reasons for the wider spread of the disease in the city.“Last year, the lockdown was enforced much before the pandemic peaked in September, limiting mobility across different locations of the city. This time around, the restrictions are coming when the infections have already spread widely, allowing the virus to spread to more areas,” said Dr Rajesh Ahuja, former head of the department of community medicine and public health, PGIMER.The new variants of the virus, which are considered to be more infectious, are also to be blamed for the current scenario. “Last year, if one person tested positive, they further infected half or one-third of their family members. But, now, two-thirds or entire family members are testing positive,” said Dr Ahuja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/not-a-single-chandigarh-area-untouched-by-covid-s-second-wave-101619986499579.html

03-05-2021||Other||3 held for overcharging people for Covid supplies amid crisis||New Delhi: A day after the Delhi Police made their Covid helpline number, launched a fortnight ago, available for addressing complaints of cheating and overcharging by medical service providers or any other unscrupulous elements amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, three more people were arrested for allegedly taking advantage of people in distress. On Saturday, police took note of media reports and social media posts claiming that ambulance service providers are overcharging and many people are cheating in the name of providing oxygen cylinders and life-saving drugs for treating Covid-19. The Delhi Police threw open their Covid helpline number 011-23469900 for receiving all such complaints of illegal activities. The helpline, launched on April 16, has 10 lines to facilitate movement of people falling under exempted categories and resolve issues related to issuance of e-passes. The helpline receives more than 500 calls every day, said police. While two of the three people arrested are ambulance drivers who were overcharging Covid-19 patients or their kin, the third is a chemist who was charging four times the MRP on medical equipment. On Saturday, two ambulance drivers were held for overcharging. The first of the three fresh arrests was that of ambulance driver Kandhi Lal, about whom police received a complaint of overcharging. “We sent a policeman as a decoy customer. He was asked to pay ₹14,000 to move a body from a hospital in north Delhi to Nigambodh Ghat, which is a 6km-journey,” said Guriqbal Singh Sidhu, additional deputy commissioner of police (north-west). The two other arrests were in south-east Delhi. Bablu, an ambulance driver, was arrested for allegedly demanding ₹9,000 for moving a patient from one hospital to another located 10kms away. “Sudhir Gahlot, a chemist, was arrested for charging four times the MRP on equipment, such as oxygen flow meters, oxygen pumps and water nozzles,” said R P Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). In both these instances, the police used their personnel as decoys to verify the authenticity of the allegations levelled against them and subsequently, arrested them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-held-for-overcharging-people-for-covid-supplies-amid-crisis-101619986318673.html

03-05-2021||Delhi||Covid orphans: Child rights body issues a caution||Flooded by requests for adopting children who lost their parents to Covid-19, both online and offline, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has urged people not to fall for misinformation floating on social media, and advised interested families to follow the due legal process to initiate the adoption process.Several children have lost their parents to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic -- fourth wave, as per the Delhi government -- in the national capital. Earlier this week, DCPCR appealed to people on social media to call on their helpline number and report cases where children need essential supplies, have lost their parent(s), or are struggling to support themselves due to the illness. Following this, the child rights body said requests for adopting children orphaned amid the pandemic have also started pouring in.Commission chairperson Anurag Kundu tweeted on Saturday evening: “Do not believe anyone who says he/she can give you the child for adoption. They are either lying or misleading or simply involved in illegal practices. Do reach out to your lawyer friends for advice.”Kundu said he himself has received around 10 such requests in the last few days. “Besides, I see a lot of posts floating around about child adoption. People need to understand that they have to follow a legal process. Any adoption without it is illegal,” he said.Explaining the standard process of adoption, Kundu said that when a child is orphaned, abandoned, surrendered or the parents are unable to support him/her, the child is produced -- by anyone -- before the concerned Child Welfare Committee (CWC). “The committee, in the interim period, sends the child to a children’s home, fit facility or Special Adoption Agency (if the child is below six years) and the Committee then passes order conducting a social investigation report by social worker, child welfare officer or child welfare police officer to check the background of the child and his family in a structured format. It’s called a social investigation report. Once it’s established that the parents are either unwilling to support, or simply unable to, or the child has turned orphaned and nobody is coming forward, the committee declares the child legally free for adoption, following the procedure laid down in JJ Act, 2015, and Model Rule, 2016, as well as adoption regulations. Then the CWC directs the appropriate authority in CCI (child care institution) and DCPO (district child protection officer) to complete medical examination report and registers the child on the Central Adoption Resource Authority as per procedures and upload all relevant documents required. No child can be adopted without following this process,” he said, adding that any other route is illegal and punishable under law.Kundu also flagged some posts on Twitter by people claiming that few children who lost their parents to Covid-19 were adopted within hours of them seeking help on social media. He also tagged Delhi Police while flagging another such post inviting people to adopt two girls whose parents allegedly succumbed to the virus.“We are encouraging people who are approaching us to follow the legal process. Besides, they should not take any decision in the heat of the moment. It’s a lifelong decision which needs to be taken after due consideration,” he added.A Delhi police spokesperson decline to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dcpcr-warns-against-falling-for-social-media-posts-to-adopt-children-orphaned-by-covid-101619986198078.html

The victim, Azad Ahmad, lived with his family in Sangam Vihar and worked as a mason. The crime happened while he was returning on his motorcycle from his brother’s home in Tughlaqabad around 11.15pm on April 18. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said as Ahmad rode past a school in Sangam Vihar, his motorcycle brushed past one of the suspects, who were drunk and were walking to buy cigarettes. “That led to a verbal altercation during which they thrashed Ahmad,” said the DCP. Ahmad, in his complaint to the police before his death, said he was pulled down from his motorcycle and thrashed with sticks and an iron rod. The DCP said as the trio thrashed him, they also decided to rob him as no one was around. “They robbed his mobile phone, ₹1,000 cash and some documents,” said Thakur adding that a case of causing hurt during robbery was registered. The victim succumbed to his injuries on April 25 after which police added murder charge in the FIR. Simultaneously, the police started screening CCTV footage and enquiring from locals to find the suspects. The suspects were arrested one by one over a period of several days until the last suspect was arrested on Saturday. The police have recovered the robbed phone and the documents which were dumped in a drain near the crime scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/road-rage-3-held-for-killing-robbing-man-101619986138640.html
03-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cancellations mount: Second Covid wave hits Mohali’s banquet hall owners hard||The second spike in Covid-19 cases has affected the wedding business the most, with owners of banquet halls decrying complete losses and a sea of cancellations during one of their peak seasons.A maximum of only 10 people are allowed to attend weddings, which has taken away all the business from the banquet hall owners in Zirakpur. As per Rajiv Chhabra, owner of AKM Resorts in Zirakpur, the period between April 24 and May 24 every year is usually peak wedding season for resorts, but now they have had to cancel all bookings: “Rather than bring 10 people to a resort, people are cancelling the weddings or opting for hotels in Panchkula or Chandigarh. We have been facing similar hardships since March 2020 and many resorts are shutting down because of shortage of funds.”Parvinder Singh, who runs Nimantran Banquet halls in Dhakoli, said, “Giving refunds to people isn’t easy. We had already paid the money to caterers and decorators, so we had to pay people out of our own pockets. Considering how the situation has worsened, people don’t know how long it will take for things to improve.”Samuel Massey, who runs Sohi Banquets in Zirakpur, added, “The government needs to look out for banquet hall owners. We employed a lot of people who we have had to let go. Some concession in the taxes we pay or in the electricity and water bills will be welcome.”Even though some marriage ceremonies have gone over to the hotels in Chandigarh, the hospitality units are still struggling. President of the Chandigarh Restaurants and Hotels Association, Arvinder Pal Singh, said, “We have had a lot of cancellations as well because of the 6pm lockdown rule. We can host only one marriage party per day, but only up to 50 people are allowed to attend.”Apart from banquet hall owners, the Chandigarh Tent Dealers Society is also reporting losses. Chief adviser Anil Vohra said, “Lockdown means all our bookings get cancelled and have to be refunded. It would be tough doing this again this year and some of the smaller tent houses are likely to shut down if things don’t improve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cancellations-mount-second-covid-wave-hits-mohali-s-banquet-hall-owners-hard-101619985661003.html
03-05-2021||Chandigarh||Desperate parents in Chandigarh seek school fee waiver||With the second wave of the Covid pandemic extending the economic slowdown, parents of schoolchildren are demanding fee concessions on the lines of the last session.In the absence of any instructions by the administration, schools have been charging annual charges and other dues, along with tuition fees.“My child’s school has announced the waiver of only medical, diary, magazine and ID card charges, which do not amount to much. Schools should waive the annual charges and only levy tuition fees,” said a parent of a student at Mount Carmel School, Sector 47, requesting anonymity.A notice sent out by the school to parents (copy with HT) adds that they won’t charge late fee for the first quarter and even consider waiving fees for parents who had lost their jobs. However, the notice cautioned parents against “anti-school activities or mobilising parents”. School principal Dr Parveena John Singh was unavailable for a comment.Parents of students at KBDAV School, Sector 7, have already held two protests this month seeking waiver of annual charges. Principal Pooja Prakash said, “We had written to the UT education department about this and are awaiting their directions. No parent is being coerced to pay. Our charges are already nominal and only an up to 8% hike, allowed by the Right to Education Act, has been effected.”Officials of the UT education department said they were exploring all options keeping in view the court cases, provisions of the Fee Regulation Act and the pandemic situation.President of the Independent School Association, HS Mamik said, “Some schools are allowing concessions on their own, but not schools can afford to do so.” At Tender Heart School, Sector 33, academic charges for four months have been waived. “Taking the parents’ plight into consideration, we took this decision voluntarily. We will decide on whether to extend this after the summer vacations,” said principal Vikrant Suri. Mamik, who is also the chairman of Vivek High School, Sector 38, said his school had not hiked fees during the current or the previous session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/desperate-parents-in-chandigarh-seek-school-fee-waiver-101619985660032.html

Currently, we are catering to around 150-170 patients, but not their attendants,” said Mehta, who is also a BJP worker.The Roti Bank that is run by 10 permanent members contributing on yearly basis is grabbing attention after state health and home minister Anil Vij on Friday praised the facility in his constituency and appealed to the residents to replicate the model in other districts of Haryana.The minister tweeted: “All social, political, commercial, religious and other organisations in the state are requested to run ‘Roti Bank’ for Covid patients, as is being done at civil hospital, Ambala Cantt.”Professor Vinay Malhotra, a retired principal, said, “They’ve adopted a hygienic and a smooth system to serve food at the doorstep of the patient, which is prepared at a kitchen at the hospital. We occasionally donate to them. Even patients who have had their meal once return after months to donate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-ambala-cantt-s-roti-bank-free-protein-rich-diet-for-covid-patients-101619985598740.html

Parkash’s father, who also served as an SGPC member, was excommunicated by the Akal Takht after a video, purportedly showing him in an objectionable position with a woman, was circulated on social media in 2017. He has been seeking pardon over the past week, with his parents also submitting an application to the Takht. Gurdaspur SSP Dr Nanak Singh said they had a tip-off that some youngsters were coming to supply heroin to Rajesh Kumar at his house in Dhariwal town. The team conducted a raid at the house where they found five persons with heroin. Apart from Parkash and Kumar, the other accused are Aditya Mahajan, Kunal and Sudhir Singh, who belong to Dhariwal. “On checking, 8gm heroin was recovered from Mahajan, while 2.5gm heroin and 2gm heroin was recovered from Kunal and Sudhir, respectively. The other two were consuming heroin. A case has been registered against all these accused under relevant sections of the NDPS. The accused are being quizzed about their network of drug trade,” the SSP added.The former SAD minister said, “This is nothing, but a conspiracy of my rivals. They do not want me to be pardoned, and are afraid that as I am visiting the Sri Darbar Sahib for atonement, my prayer will be granted. My son is innocent. Police did not recover anything objectionable from him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/langahs-son-among-five-held-with-heroin-during-raid-in-gurdaspur-101619985299105.html

Four of those killed were Sikhs, including three women. The memorial service on Saturday was opened with “ardaas”, a Sikh prayer.“We are so thankful to everyone who came together to attend and help put on this important event,” said Balwinder Singh, an Indianapolis Sikh community leader.“What happened on April 15 is a tragedy that forever altered too many lives, and only by coming together to grieve, honour, and call for action can we move forward,” he said.The event, held at a city stadium, featured city, state and federal representatives, Indianapolis-area interfaith leaders and Sikh community members.“As your governor, I stand with you in support of the Sikh community, with each of the families of the victims, with the hundreds of others who are feeling the impact of this tragedy, and with our law enforcement and first responders who face it daily so most of us don’t have to,” Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb said.“And we stand with this city and the entire community, still reeling from the impact of that terrible day. I’m grateful for each person here today to honour lives so tragically lost, to show support for survivors and to extend a comforting hand to the families and friends who were taken from us far too soon,” he said.Several of Indiana’s congressional representatives sent letters of support that were read aloud at the event.President Joe Biden also wrote a letter of support, IndyStar reported.The letter was read by Erika Moritsugu, deputy assistant to the president and Asian American and Pacific Islander senior liaison. “To the people of Indiana, I share the heartbreak you are experiencing after such senseless violence pierced your community and our nation’s soul once again,” Biden wrote. “They were our friends and neighbours. They were immigrants and fellow Americans, seeking their piece of the American dream.” Komal Chohan, whose grandmother was killed during the shooting, said: “It makes us feel like we’re not alone.” “We don’t know if this was bias-related. It feels good to know that not everybody views us in that manner and not everybody sees us as outsiders,” Chohan said.There are an estimated 8,000-10,000 Sikhs in Indiana. Though Sikhs began settling in the state more than 50 years ago, the first gurdwara was not established until 1999. There are 10 gurdwaras in the state now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indianas-sikh-community-honours-victims-of-fedex-mass-shooting-101619985178662.html

On Sunday, 50 migrant labourers, with their luggage, were seen at Amritsar Railway Station to board trains bound for UP and Bihar. They were carrying bags.People working as vendors, factory workers, construction workers and those employed with in hotels and restaurants have been hit. Most of them are migrant labourers and don’t have houses. “We have been left jobless due to covid-19 restrictions and have chosen to return home, instead of staying here. We will not return till normalcy returns,” one of them said; this was the common refrain. Manoj Kumar, of Chandoli village, in Banaras district of Uttar Pradesh (UP), said, “I have been living here for the past 15 years and work in a factory manufacturing fans in Amritsar. The unit has been non-operational for the last few days. What will I do here if the factory is lying defunct? I have decided to go back with five more people accompanying me.” He added, “The current lockdown has affected the factory owner severely. He has expressed inability to accommodate us anymore.”Another migrant Vinay Kumar, said, “I am a daily wager and have no work to do amid lockdown. I am going back home the second time due to lockdown as we had no work.”Workers who have not stepped out to go to their homes, also fear that the lockdown will be prolonged and that they will lose their source of livelihood and their housing.“Migrant labourers have started going home. The lockdown and night curfew have hit small businesses run by migrant and factories and factories have cut jobs. Unemployed workers are unable to pay rent. So, a section of the labourers has decided to go back home,” said Mahesh Verma, leader of migrant labourers, and president of the Shiromani Akali Dal’s Parwasi Wing.He added, “Travelling home is not affordable by everybody. Only those who have some money are going. A sizeable number of migrant workers are vendors, who start their work after 5pm. How can they run their livelihood in the new lockdown timings?”Notably, tourism, restaurants, hospitality, textile, handicraft, fan manufacturing, medicines, rice sheller etc are main fields of industries in Amritsar. Kamal Dalmia, chairman, Focal Point Industries Association, Amritsar, who runs a textile unit, said, “Most factory owners have reduced their shift to eight hours. New orders are rare and payment from customers is blocked. No factory owner can afford manufacturing of unsold goods for much time. Temporary workers are being asked to go for leave for 20 days or more.”3 buses from Barnala move to native states BARNALA Over a hundred migrant workers moved to their native states amid rumours of complete lockdown due to covid-19 and Ramadan by hiring special private buses from Barnala district on Sunday. Those going back claimed that they will return for work after a short period. Wheat crop harvest season has almost ended and paddy transplantation will start in the month of June in Punjab.The driver of the private bus, who did not want to be named, said the migrants had hired three buses, which would drop them at Purnia from Barnala and Sangrur districts. Mohammed Jaladeen, of Purnia district of Bihar, who boarded the bus from Dhanaula town, said, “We are going home for Ramadan. I want to celebrate the festival with family members. However, we will come back again for work,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/migrant-workers-start-leaving-amritsar-in-a-trickle-for-now-101619984939298.html

His wife Richa had won as member of the zila panchayat.This time, people in Bikru village were happy with the freedom they had to cast their votes. Many youngsters saw candidates canvassing in their village for the first time and they participated wholeheartedly in the process. Bikru village has a total of 1,400 voters.

It is awaiting fresh stock from the Centre to continue with the inoculation of 45+ population at vaccination centres across the state. The state, which could not start the vaccination for 18-45 years category from May 1, due to non-availability of direct supply from the Serum Institute of India (SII), is left with just 30,000 vaccination doses. Director, health, Dr GB Singh said there were hardly any vaccine doses left with the state and vaccination would be carried out at very few centres. “The last batch of two lakh doses was received from the Centre on April 30. We have not got anything since,” he added. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has allocated 6.2 lakh doses, including 4.7 lakh Covishield and 1.5 lakh Covaxin, for the state during the first fortnight of this month for free vaccination of 45+ population. “They have confirmed this allocation, but no consignment has been received. We are waiting for fresh stock of vaccine to continue the inoculation drive,” Dr Singh added.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, nodal officer for Covid-19, said that since the health department was left with just 30,000 doses, few vaccination sessions would be conducted on Monday. “The district authorities will decide on which hospitals will administer the jab,” he added.

But the Congress in Punjab is not celebrating his success for two reasons. The Congress, which once ruled West Bengal, failed to open its account there and then Kishor also announced his retirement from election management work. “I do not want to continue what I am doing. I have done enough. Time for me to take a break and do something else in life. I want to quit this space,” he told private news channels in separate interviews on his decision to quit as an election strategist. On being asked by a channel about his appointment in the state, he said: “If you help someone win an election, it is nothing if they offer you principal adviser or adviser’s post. They always like you to be by their side because it suits them. It is for me to decide whether I want to do that or not. I am telling you that I am not doing this work for anybody anymore.” Kishor, or “PK” as he is often called in political circles, was widely expected to draw the Congress’ poll strategy for the 2022 assembly elections. His announcement has come as a bolt from the blue for the Congressmen. While there was no official word from the chief minister or his other advisers, the poll strategist’s decision has left the party leaders in suspense. The sultan of spin, who has scripted several successful election campaigns across the country, had held meetings with the party’s first-MLAs and top officials of the state government after his appointed two months ago to gather feedback on the ground realities, implementation of poll promises and focus areas to draw the strategy for the assembly polls due early next year. “When I met him five weeks ago, PK gave no such indication and was all ears. He took a lot of interest and had everything on his fingertips,” a first-time MLA, who was among those who met Kishor at the chief minister’s residence in Chandigarh and seemed impressed, expressing disappointment over the development. A senior party leader, while being hopeful that he will not back off from his commitment made to the chief minister, did not sound sure. “He has not specified any timeframe for quitting as an election strategist. I think he will stick here, but one never knows,” he said. However, an aide of the chief minister said that since he now occupies an official position in the government as the chief minister’s principal adviser, Kishor is distancing himself from the company. “Under the government rules, any person occupying an official position cannot carry out any business activity,” he said. Kishor, in his interviews to a number of channels following the West Bengal poll results, also said that he would be parting ways with the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), the political advocacy group he founded. The poll strategist, who was inducted by Amarinder in the chief minister’s office on March 1, had worked with the Congress in Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls with Amarinder as the state unit chief. He was seen as the brain behind the “Coffee with Captain” and “Punjab da Captain” that had worked well for the party and the CM-face. “PK & his team and their work was absolutely critical to our victory in Punjab!” Amarinder had tweeted after the party’s victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prashant-kishor-s-bolt-from-the-blue-leaves-punjab-cong-leaders-in-suspense-101619984519061.html

The Bengalis saw through their designs,” Mir added. “Today, the country is paying the price of the failure of the Modi government to take timely steps to upgrade the facilities and resources to deal with second Covid wave which has gripped the entire country in its worst form,” he said, adding that the strategy of West Bengal voters and their commitment to keep the communal and divisive forces at bay against all sorts onslaughts would be a lesson for voters elsewhere in different parts of the country. He also congratulated Tamil Nadu and Kerala voters for rejecting the BJP and its political ambitions.‘COVID-19 CRISIS: JAIRAM SHOULD TAKE CHARGE OF HEALTH’CM Jairam Thakur should take command of the health department in his hands, as the severity of the covid-19 pandemic demanded it, the state Congress said on Sunday. He also added that speed of decision-making was important in such a scenario. Former Jubbal-Kotkhai legislator as well as ex-chief parliamentary secretary Rohit Thakur said, “In view of the devastating second wave of the Corona epidemic, the state must keep the option of limited lockdown open in public interest. To effectively tackle the pandemic, the government must fill 5,984 vacant posts of doctors and paramedics of the total 15,306 sanctioned.” Thakur added that AIIMS Bilaspur, which was under construction for the past six years, should be made functional as soon as possible.In a letter to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, CPIM legislator from Theog, Rakesh Singha, has questioned the state government’s strategy to deal with the Covid second wave. Citing data, Singha claimed that more than 50% deaths due to covid-19 were of referral cases. He said the major reason for this was a gap in the uninterrupted supply of oxygen to the patient.“These deaths can be minimised by preventing the repeated referral of the patient from one dedicated covid-19 hospital to another. The creation of several covid centres at this stage will only prove counterproductive,” he said.He said that analysis of the spread of the virus indicates the situation is going to become precarious in the days ahead and there are possibilities that the situation gets out of control. The reason for the same is there is qualitative difference in the nature of spread of the virus. “My suggestion to the government is to shift the OPD from IGMC, Shimla, to another institute and recruit more staff,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wise-bengalis-saw-through-modi-claims-j-k-cong-chief-101619984399570.html

A ticket checker, identified as Narinder Kumar Meena, 37, had slipped while trying to board a moving train following which his right leg was caught between the platform and the train. Staff deputed at the railway station’s hospital provided him first-aid and called for an ambulance through the emergency number 108 but the ambulance took over an hour to arrive. Railway station employees said that even after the ambulance arrived, the ordeal was not over. The ambulance drivers refused to take the injured ticket checker to a private hospital and said that they are allowed to drop patients only to government hospitals. The railway staff later took the injured to the Fortis Hospital on Chandigarh road in a private car. The victim succumbed to his injuries on April 26. When contacted senior divisional medical officer Dr Chetna Kapoor confirmed that the railway station’s hospital does not have a designated ambulance. “We have tie-ups with various hospitals which send their ambulances to us in case of an emergency. We asked the ambulance driver to take the patient to the private hospital but they said they can only ferry patients to government facilities,” she said. According to railway employees, the railway hospital has not had an ambulance for the past 10 years and the sole ambulance driver at the station had retired two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-railway-station-has-no-ambulance-of-its-own-101619984158449.html

The general administration department issued an order on Friday terminating the services of Idrees Jan, a teacher of Government Middle School, Kupwara. “The Lieutenant Governor is satisfied under sub-clause (c) of the proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution of India that in the interest of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of Idrees Jan, teacher, Government Middle School, Kralpora, Kupwara,” the order read.“Accordingly, the LG hereby dismisses Idrees Jan from service with immediate effect,” the order adds. The dismissal comes after the government, on April 21, set up a Special Task Force to identify and scrutinise employees involved in any case related to posing a threat to the country’s security or anti-national activities.The order has not gone down well with employees and union leaders. Former employee union leader and chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum (JKCSF), Abdul Qayoom Wani expressed resentment over the dismissal, calling it an attack on employees’ integrity.“The dismissal of Idrees and two other employees comes as a strange shiver for the whole Kashmir society under the shade of Article 311. This also neglect all other disciplinary service rules that govern the employees performance and conduct of his service career,” Wani said, adding, “This type of dismissal from government service remains ambiguous until the facts are made public and/or subjected to the judicial system for legal proceedings.”JKCSF has demanded that the decision must be revoked and reviewed judiciously, under service norms, so that justice can prevail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-dismisses-teacher-in-interest-of-state-security-101619983918607.html

As per official data, there are 481 Level-3 beds in the district, of which 454 were occupied on Sunday while of the 1, 468 Level-2 beds earmarked for Covid patients, 1, 176 had filled up. DC Sharma said the decision to augment the bed capacity was taken after almost all Covid beds in city hospitals were occupied by Saturday night.Presiding over a virtual meeting with hospitals, along with deputy director local government (DDLG) Amit Bambi, civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia Gill and ADC (D) Sandeep Kumar, the DC said there is an immediate need to scale up the bed capacity in view of the emergent situation. He added that a four-member team, comprising the civil surgeon, DDLG, ADC and the DC himself, will inspect the newly added beds.On the availability of oxygen, the DC said the administration has already ramped up the oxygen capacity by nearly 33% (2, 900 cylinders daily). He said earlier, Vardhman Steel Plant had been filling up 1, 500 cylinders of medical oxygen a day but now it has increased its capability to 2, 100 cylinders a day.Similarly, Weltech Equipment and Infrastructure Limited had also been generating additional oxygen, he said.The DC further requested the public to refrain from calling their relatives to the district. “We are augmenting bed and oxygen facilities in the district. That does not mean that we should call people from distant locations for treatment in Ludhiana hospitals. The surplus arrangements have been made to meet any exigency,” said Sharma.He is the second senior official to urge city residents to avoid inviting people living in other states for treatment in Ludhiana.He reiterated that people should avoid venturing out unnecessarily and also assured the migrants that factories will remain open. “However, I urge businessmen to discourage crowding in their respective units. If the set protocols are followed, the situation may improve in 15 to 20 days. Wehave the example of Delhi and Maharashtra before us. We should not land ourselves in a similar situation,” said Sharma.On the other hand, Dr Saroj Aggarwal, president of Indian Medical Association’s Ludhiana Chapter, said, “It is time the government takes control of the bigger medical institutions. The small hospitals neither have the manpower nor L-3 infrastructure to accommodate more patients. Since elective surgeries have been stopped in all hospitals, the ICU and beds of these departments are lying vacant. These can be put to use for treatment of Covid patients,” said Dr Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-dc-instructs-all-private-hospitals-to-increase-l3-bed-capacity-by-25-101619983738678.html

On May 1 this year, the figure rose to 127,033, an increase of 63,720 cases in a month-long period.Data from the district health bulletin also gives perspective on the surge of Covid-19 cases in the city, especially over the last three weeks. Since April 11, daily cases in the city has continuously broken the previous single-day record -- 964 on November 8 -- with Thursday’s figure of 5,042 cases the highest now. The surge in cases has also had an effect on the infrastructure, with Gurugram having scant or no available Intensive Care Unit (ICU), ventilator, or oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients over the last three weeks.Of the city’s 2,347 beds across 43 Covid-19 hospitals, only 2 ventilator beds, 14 oxygen beds, and no ICU beds were available on Sunday evening, according to Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3), a real-time portal managed by the district administration. Of the 2,347 total Covid-19 beds, 1,848 are isolation beds, 499 are ICU beds, and 255 are ventilator beds.Meanwhile, studies suggest the situation is not expected to improve any time soon.As per a State Bank of India (SBI) research report, the second wave of Covid-19 is likely to reach its peak by mid-May in India while a CLSA, foreign brokerage, report pegs it in June. The three-member national Covid-19 supermodel committee, formed by the central government to make projections regarding the spread of the pandemic and follow its trajectory, has also pegged the second wave to peak in mid-May.“The second wave of Covid-19 is unprecedented not just in Gurugram but across the country. We have carried out various measures to ramp up the existing infrastructure by adding more Covid-19 beds, regulating the supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) both on the part of procurement as well as the distribution within the city, to mitigate the situation. We are working continuously on various aspects that can lead to the addition of infrastructure, LMO supply, and other such measures that can provide more medical aid to those in need as well as curb the spread of the virus,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.Last week, the district administration released a statement of various tie-ups with corporate companies and government agencies that will lead to the addition of around 1,200 Covid-19 beds across the city within this month.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh also issued an order stating that only hospitals and nursing homes registered with the administration will be provided LMO from the city’s three oxygen refilling stations and no such establishment outside the district will be able to access the plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/confirming-worst-spread-total-covid-cases-doubled-in-a-month-in-ggm-101619983558506.html
03-05-2021||Other||Hospital booked, three held for selling remdesivir for ₹45,000/vial||Gurugram: Three people, including two hospital staff, were arrested for black marketing remdesivir--a broad-spectrum antiviral medication, and charging ₹45,000 per vial amid the shortage of the medicine in the market. Five vials of remdesivir were also recovered from the suspects, said police. A case has also been registered against Narayana Hospital in DLF Phase 3 for cheating and negligence after the suspects revealed they used to steal injection and sold them at premium rates, said police. In a joint raid conducted by the chief minister’s flying squad, the crime investigation agency of Sector-40 and district drug controller on Sunday, a decoy customer was sent to buy the injection at Sector 52 and the suspects were arrested while handing over the vials, said police. Amandeep Chauhan, district drug controller, said he received a secret information that a nexus of hospital staff is engaged in black marketing and hoarding of remdesivir, which they were selling for ₹45,000 per injection. The informer provided the contact number of the suspects on the condition that his identity remains confidential. “A head constable was asked to make a call as a decoy customer. It was decided that the injections will be delivered at gate no 2 of Ardee ity at 10pm on Saturday,” said Chauhan. The suspect asked the decoy to receive the injection from the T-point of gate 2 and told him he will come on a scooty. The suspects also asked him to pay ₹45,000 for a remdesivir injection and agreed to deliver five injections for ₹2,25,000 in Sector 52. Chauhan said two teams kept a distance from the decoy customer and followed him in plain clothes. “After 15 minutes, one person came at the decided spot and informed the decoy that the injections are reaching in five minutes. A woman came, handed over the injections to the suspect and went away. While one staff member followed her, our teams caught the suspect while he was handing over the injections to our decoy and asking for money,” he said. The suspect was identified as Chetan Kapoor, a resident of Punjab working as a senior security assistant at Max Hospital, Gurugram. Meanwhile, police followed the woman up to a house on the ground floor and asked her to come out. Police said around 11.10pm Chetan got a call on his mobile. He informed the person that police had apprehended him and now, his wife will also be arrested. Chauhan said the caller was identified as Nitin Jose, a resident of Kerala who works as a nursing staff supervisor at Narayana Hospital, and was told to reach the spot in 10 minutes. “The woman was identified as Lima Oomen. She disclosed that her husband Jose gave her those injections and usually asked her to hand them over to prospective buyers,” he said. When asked from where he procured the remdesivir injections, Jose said he got the injections from Narayana Hospital. Instead of administering the injection to the patients, he made entries that he had injected the vials and later stole them, said police. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department (CID), said families were paying for the injection, which the suspects never injected. “These injections are further sold by him through his network in the black market. He was working with Chetan at Max Hospital in Gurugram earlier. It is a major flaw on the part of Narayana Hospital to allow this pilferage.” Chauhan said they are investigating if the patients who paid for the injection survived or died. “This is a matter of investigation. It is a heinous crime that someone, who was to be administered this injection, did not get the dose,” he said. The teams suspect more people from these hospitals are involved in this nexus. However, the suspects have not given any names so far, said police. The Narayan Hospital is responsible for this negligence and carelessness, which is a criminal act and breach of trust, said police. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said they conducted a recce of the house into which the woman had entered. “We knew there are more people involved in black marketing, so we followed the woman. She entered a house in Housing board colony in Sector 52, which we raided and then arrested her,” he said.  Police said they are yet to verify details as to from where the injection was supplied to the private hospital and how the suspects stole them. The number of vials and the persons who bought them are also being ascertained. A case was registered at Sector 53 police station under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Sections 27(2) and 27-D of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,1940, and Sections 420 (cheating ),120B (conspiracy) of the IPC. In a statement released on Sunday, the spokesperson of Max Healthcare said, “We have been informed by the police regarding an incident involving one of our staff. We have checked our stock of remdesivir and have not found anything amiss. We are supporting the authorities in their investigation”.Narayana hospital did not respond to messages and calls despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hospital-booked-three-held-for-selling-remdesivir-for-rs-45000vial-101619983557957.html

The families have demanded capping ambulance fares and asked the district administration to take steps to stop the fleecing.According to relatives, private ambulance drivers are allegedly demanding ₹20,000 to ₹30,000 to shift a patient from a house to a private hospital, within a 5 km radius. For outstation transport, the drivers are allegedly demanding between ₹70,000 and ₹1.5 lakh. Many doctors at private hospitals also alleged that ambulance operators and drivers are making exorbitant demands to shift patients. With shortage of oxygen reported across the city on Saturday and Sunday, several families have taken steps to move patients to hospitals in their home towns.Nandkishore Deoli, whose brother-in-law was admitted in a Sector 56 hospital, said he decided to shift him to Dehradun but the ambulance driver asked him for ₹70,000 for the transport. When they finally agreed to the demand, the driver raised the fee to ₹1.50 lakh, claiming that he will have to return with an empty ambulance. “We took my brother-in-law in our private car as we didn’t have any other option,” he said. Amit Kumar, brother of a critical patient who was shifted to Jaipur on Sunday, alleged that they had to pay ₹80,000 to the ambulance driver. “We contacted six ambulances and their prices were almost the same. We had no choice, so we hired and shifted the patient to another hospital. There was no oxygen and by paying this amount, at least we have saved his life,” he said. Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, said they operate 35 ambulances. “We are providing these ambulances free of cost, but other private ambulances do not fall in our jurisdiction. These drivers do not come under our department and we do not have their details. Families should contact us on 18001801817 or 1950 helpline numbers after any home isolation death or to shift a patient from home to hospital,” he said. On the other hand, the regional transport authority (RTA) of Gurugram, said that they have provided 20 ambulances to MCG, capping the charges at ₹15/km. “We can only cap those whose requisitions are done through us. There are more than 200 private ambulances and we do not maintain their records and movements. We can only provide their registration details. They are private ambulances belonging to individuals and hospitals,” said Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurgram. Yadav said they have not received any complaints so far but added that they will take action if anyone come forward and share details. “People should share videos, pictures, and details of the ambulance or drivers. We will take action as soon as we receive a complaint. People should come forward and hand over a complaint to us mentioning they had booked an ambulance from which area to which destination. If they want, we will not disclose their identity,” she said. A senior district official said that steps are underway to fix rate per kilometre to ensure people are not fleeced by drivers.

The MCG commissioner does not reply to messages or attend calls. The deputy commissioner has helped us arrange 20 cylinders and is trying to support us, but we need oxygen regularly to run operations, so we have stopped our operations,” she said.Asha Devi, director of Mamta Hospital, said they have stopped taking fresh admissions as they have not received a single oxygen cylinder for the last four days. “There has been mismanagement at refilling stations with people with connections getting supplies out of turn while others are waiting for more than eight hours to get oxygen cylinders. We have stopped taking Covid-19 patients as we can’t save lives without oxygen,” she said.In the absence of continuous oxygen supply, many doctors said they had to turn away new patients and ask families of existing patients to arrange for oxygen cylinders to continue treatment.Some hospitals have put up notices announcing no new Covid admissions at their centres.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, said that the hospital is not in a position to take new admissions. “We have placed a notice that there is no out-patient department, no beds and no oxygen on Saturday. Since Thursday I have been requesting officials to provide me with oxygen for my patients, but we have not received a single cylinder until now. The situation is getting out of control, families create havoc and staff have to run away to save themselves,” he said, adding that the hospital, which has 70 beds, is occupied by Covid patients.Umkal hospital in DLF Phase 2 said its staff members were standing in queue for the last 12 hours but were yet to receive any oxygen. They said their requests to the MCG have also gone unanswered.Around 10.13 am on Sunday, Park group of hospitals said the liquid oxygen allocated to Park Hospital in Gurugram was hijacked by some other hospital. “More than 140 patients’ lives are in danger,” it tweeted, asking for help.At 10.43 am, the hospital tweeted saying that they have received about less than one tonne of oxygen. “What happens after this? We are always under huge stress. Administration is constantly pressuring us to admit patients, but oxygen supply remains erratic,” it said.Other hospitals such as Signature Hospital in Sector 37 D, Center of Diabetes and Allied Sciences (CDAS) in Sector 47 and Sethi Hospital in Model Town have also stopped fresh Covid admissions due to non-availability of oxygen.Amandeep Chauhan, district drugs controller, said there is adequate oxygen supply now and they have ensured all hospitals have received their share on Sunday. “We have received 14 metric tonnes (MT) from Panipat and 20 MT from Bhiwadi on Sunday and more is expected by tonight. The situation is improvising and will be streamlined this week,” he said.Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, said a counter was placed at the refilling stations in Manesar for refilling oxygen cylinders. “Covid-positive patients, carrying test reports, will be given oxygen cylinders,” Singh said.Meanwhile, a few hospitals have also demanded extra security after staff and doctors of a hospital were assaulted and premises vandalised after the death of eight patients at the facility in Sector 56 on Friday night.Dr Aryan said his hospital has requested for protection to prevent any untoward incidents.On Sunday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said he held a meeting with the deputy commissioner and the MCG commissioner and directed them to ensure a smooth oxygen supply to all the hospitals in the district. “Oxygen allocation will be made strictly for institutions that have filled up and submitted Google forms. Incomplete forms will be rejected. In case of doubts, they can drop a message with their contact numbers at covid19gurugram@gmail.com, and the district administration will reply... There are 160 oxygen concentrators in the city hospitals,” he said, adding that the situation in the city has improved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/many-smaller-private-hospitals-shut-operation-due-to-lack-of-o2-supply-101619983437866.html

It is our contribution to stop the spread of coronavirus in the city.”Bahadurke Textile and Knitwear Association president Tarun Jain Bawa said that the situation is worsening day by day and it can be controlled by imposing a lockdown in the city. The government should impose a complete lockdown and should not allow any industry and shop to operate for at least seven days. This would bring down the number of cases and the government would get time for the preparation to fight against Covid., he added.The associations said that they would also discharge their social duty and would take care of their workers and their families.Vipan Vinayak, president of Knit and Fab Hosiery Association, said that at least 38 associations had decided to observe a voluntary lockdown.Industrial associations demand imposition of complete lockdownAs Covid deaths are rising exponentially, the demand for imposing a lockdown in the city is getting louder. The death of Dinesh Lakra, 56, a city-based industrialist and vice-president of Laghu Udyog Bharati and member of the governing body of Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), who had succumbed to Covid-19 on April 30, triggered panic among the industrialists.This is the first time that the industry and traders are asking the government to impose a lockdown.Darshan Dawar said that they had demanded a complete lockdown for at least one week in the city to control the spread of the virus. The representatives of the association also met cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to discuss the same.He added that if needed the government should extend the lockdown for another week.“We have sent at least 10 letters to chief minister Captain Amrinder Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for a complete lockdown in Punjab or at least in the city as Ludhiana has the maximum number of Covid cases and deaths in the state,” said Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association.“The city hospitals are already struggling to meet the need for oxygen and beds. The lockdown will break the chain of Covid infection,” he added.Gurmeet Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation, claimed that they were the first to request the government to impose a complete lockdown in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-hosiery-textile-industry-go-on-3-day-self-imposed-lockdown-101619983318429.html

03-05-2021||Mumbai||2,427 from 18-44 age group get vaccinated in Mumbai||A total of 2,427 beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 years were vaccinated across five centres in Mumbai on Sunday, the second day of the third phase of the Covid-19 inoculation drive. According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 3,419 beneficiaries in this age group have been vaccinated over two days – Saturday and Sunday. The vaccination drive for the age group of 18-44 years will continue on Monday between 9am and 5pm, only for citizens who have registered and have been allotted a slot by BMC. It will take place at Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, SevenHills hospital in Andheri, Rajawadi hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, and BKC’s jumbo Covid-19 facility. Each of the five centres has 500 doses available for Monday’s drive.Owing to a shortage in doses, the drive for beneficiaries above the age of 45 will remain suspended on Monday. BMC said it will resume the drive for this age group only after receiving adequate stock from the Centre. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have approximately 20,000 vaccine doses available, which are being utilised for vaccinating beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group. On Monday, BMC is expected to receive some more doses. Depending on availability, BMC will take a call on when to resume the drive for citizens in the age group of 45 years and above. It will remain suspended on Monday.” In Mumbai, the BMC has an estimated 9 million people between the ages of 18 and 44 qualify for vaccination. At 7.30pm on Sunday, BMC opened booking for slots for the age group of 18-44. Within 20 minutes, all slots were booked. At 7.50pm, BMC tweeted, “All slots taken! That was really quick dear 18-44s. Looking forward to see the ones who booked slots for tomorrow & we look forward to hosting the remaining some time soon too.It’s a just a matter of time. It will soon be time for you to #TakeTheJab #YoungAndVaccinated”. A statement from BMC on Sunday said, “Presently, people of all ages are visiting vaccination centres. Considering the prevalence of Covid-19, citizens should not come out of their house and visit the vaccination centres without an appointment and an allotted slot.” Presently, Mumbai has 136 vaccination centres, of which 73 are private, 50 are BMC-owned, and 18 are state or central government owned. BMC’s statement also said, “Appropriate decision will be taken from time to time regarding keeping these centres operational, based on availability of stock. All citizens will be informed in advance.” In a tweet on Sunday evening, BMC said, “Dear 45 and above, we know some of you are due for the second jab & some have not even got their first yet. But please rest assured that we will keep you constantly updated & each & every Mumbaikar will be vaccinated. All in good time.Thank you for your patience.” While vaccination in 27 districts from Maharashtra took place on May 1, the state government had announced that vaccination will start in all the remaining nine districts on Sunday. However, information regarding Sunday’s vaccination drive for citizens in the age group of 18-44 years was awaited on Sunday. The Maharashtra government had 300,000 vaccine doses distributed across the state , with a plan to cover seven days. It has instructed all districts to keep a maximum of five centres open so that the stock can last for seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2427-from-18-44-age-group-get-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101619983017956.html
03-05-2021||Other||Mumbai coastal road project work leaves fisherfolk in uncharted waters||Despite two Covid-related lockdowns in the last year, work on the city’s Coastal Road has continued at a swift pace. At least 217 acres of land has so far been reclaimed from the Arabian Sea for the project, with an additional 50-odd acres yet to be created. Officials estimate that about 30 percent of the work has been completed. The ‘Mavala’ underground tunnel boring machine (TBM) also continues to excavate earth from under Malabar Hill, at a pace of 7 metres (m) every day. About 330m of tunnelling has been finished presently. While the project is at least two years away from completion, land reclamation along the Worli coast has already begun impacting the livelihoods of fisherfolk, with women and small fishermen’s incomes being the first to be hit. For decades, these groups within the broader fishing community have conducted their trade almost entirely along the rocky shore between Nepean Sea Road and Worli.They largely include the Kolis, but also consist of members of the Agri and Christian communities who practice artisanal fishing. Boat owners, labourers, migrant workers, daily-wage or subsistence fishers, net-menders, oyster pickers and other vocations tied to the artisanal fishing trade have all been affected by the loss of these coastal commons, HT learnt through interviews and ground reporting. Since construction work on the coastal road began in late 2018, about 5-6km of the rocky intertidal zone between Priyadarshini Park and Worli sea face have been reclaimed, two officials involved with the project estimated. As a result, productive fishing grounds near Priyadarshini Park, Amarsons Garden, Breach Candy, Shree Mahalaxmi Temple, Worli Dairy and a significant portion of Haji Ali have been completely wiped out, fisherfolk said. Crucially, the space for women, who pick oysters and shellfish by hand, as well as small-scale fishermen who use non-motorised ‘tony’ boats, gill nets, cast nets, drift nets or simple fishing rods in shallow waters, has been reduced to a small patch of rocky shore outside Haji Ali. This area, popularly called Lotus Jetty, is set to shrink further once a connecting bridge is built across the waterfront. ‘Dol ka dhandha’, or the more lucrative practice of fishing in deeper waters at depths of over 20-25 feet, with larger ‘dol (bag nets)’, is reserved for certain families or groups of fishermen from Worli Koliwada. As per a March 2019 report by advocacy group Collective for Spatial Alternatives (CSA), their customary fishing grounds extend from Malabar Hill to Mount Mary. “For small fishermen, many of whom do not even have boats or official IDs, the shore is where you make a living. I have myself been doing it for decades. My family does not have permission to do dol fishing,” said 48-year-old fisherman Lawrence Fernandes, from Worli. During low tide, if one peers across the Lotus Jetty pier, one can see dozens of women, hunched over jagged rocks with tochas (ice pick) in hand, picking oysters, or scraping for shellfish in the muddy substrate with khupris (spade). They speak without pausing work, attempting to gather as much as possible before the tide returns. “There are more women coming here now. Earlier, we used to pick shellfish and oysters, even crabs, all the way from Worli Dairy to Priyadarshini Park. Now there is no more business along that shore, only Haji Ali is left,” said Turbherkar. “Marginal fishermen and women were always going to be the first, and hardest, hit by this project. They should have been given compensation before reclamation work started. Almost all indigenous land use has been completely erased along this coast. Most of the reclamation work was done during lockdown. Poor fishermen who were badly hit by the pandemic were left with no way to recoup their losses,” said Debi Goenka, founder of the Conservation Action Trust, one of several legal petitioners against the CRP. At Haji Ali too, shellfish and crab are getting scarce, fisherwomen say, pointing to the once gravelly part – that has now been reclaimed – where one could find them in large quantities – of the beach. But a small bucketful of oysters, which can be harvested even 200m away from the shore during low tide, will fetch them about ₹400-500 in the market. “Before the pandemic, if we were lucky, we could sell it for ₹800 also. But prices have been down for a while, and it takes a lot longer to gather enough money. I don’t know if there are more women or fewer oysters,” Turbhekar said. Multiple groups of women from Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Wadala, Trombay, Mahul, Sewri and Worli, expressed similar concerns. “Sometimes, one could find really big lobsters and crabs in front of Mahalaxmi temple. At Worli Dairy, I have picked up stingrays and other big fish that used to get washed up at low tide. Everything was gone after lockdown,” said Shubangi Tanel, 44, from Machhimar Nagar in Badhwar Park, Colaba, who has been foraging along this coast for over 20 years. Most women HT spoke to had fishermen husbands who ventured into deeper seas, either on their own boats or as labourers. “But this haath ka kaam (work by hand) has always been done by us. We sometimes go to Nariman Point or Marine Drive, but have to wait for the lowest low tide, which comes once every eight or nine days. And the tetra pods make it hard to enter the water. Mahalaxmi temple, Amarsons Gardens, Breach Candy and Worli Dairy were the best places to find shellfish and oysters on most days, until the reclamation,” says Madhuri Tandel, 36, from Colaba. Some, like Pratibha Patil, 40, from Cuffe Parade Koliwada, rely on this trade as the sole bread-winners in their family. Patil’s husband, Jayant, a fisherman, lost his legs in an accident at sea in 2016, after which she has relied solely on oyster and shellfish picking to make ends meet for her family of four. She sells her wares at Sassoon Dock. Out of at least 15 women HT spoke to over multiple visits to the area, four said this was the sole source of income for them and their immediate relatives. Three of their husbands had been in debilitating accidents, while one had passed away over a decade ago. Several others were unable to pay off existing debts, incurred largely due to medical expenses in the family. “Once they finish building the road, even what’s left at Haji Ali will be wiped out. Where will we go after that,” said Patil. Still others did not have any family history of fishing and had learnt the trade purely out of necessity. “Anyone who wants to make some money in a day can come here and do this work. No one will stop you,” said one of two women from Wadala, declining to give her name. Unlike their male counterparts, who are represented by unions such as the Worli Machhimaar Sarvoday Sahakari Society and Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsyavevsay Sahakari Society, these women, who hail from several localities other than Worli, are not organised into similar interest groups. This also seemed to be the case for fishermen like Mahesh Waghela, a 30-something resident of Worli Naka who now works as a security marshal, guarding an access road to the coastal road project construction site near Lotus Jetty. Waghela’s family, from Gujarat, has not been historically associated with fishing. But having lived his whole life around the Worli fishing zone, he picked up the trade growing up. “I’ve spent days at a stretch out at sea. During the August to December season, there is a need for labour on boats. When there is a job squeeze, during the off season, one could throw a net close to the shore and fend for themselves. Ghar ki kadhi toh ban jaati thi (you could catch enough to make a curry at home). Now we can’t even manage that much,” Waghela said. A Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute “rapid-report” from 2019 had stated that this particular segment of the seashore is a rich oyster bed, and that “livelihoods of oyster pickers, particularly fisherwomen,” is likely to be impacted by reclamation of the coastal road. The report also notes multiple instances of artisanal fishing across the shore from Haji Ali and Worli Dairy, at a distance of about 300m, recording catches of prawns, stingray, Ghol, seabass, moonfish, ribbonfish, acetetes and pomfret running into dozens of kilos in a single day. Even in deeper waters, Worli Koliwada’s fishermen say, they are anticipating tough times ahead. A range of commercially important species – pomfret, khaira, Ghol, barramundi, catfish, halwa, rawas (Salmon), hekru – are becoming harder to catch in viable quantities. “There is sedimentation in the water due to construction work and a lot of noise pollution. Fish are very sensitive and run away to deeper areas on slightest of disturbance. This reclamation is clearing out water even faster than the sea link did,” said Deepak Vasudev, an artisanal fisherman from Worli Koliwada. In their March 2019 report, experts at the Collective for Spatial Alternatives had noted, “Based on the past experience of Bandra-Worli sea link project, which caused siltation in Worli (affecting access to the sea), reduced fish catch, and affected navigation (due to sea link columns), it is inevitable that reclamation and construction activity for the coastal road will adversely impact fishing and livelihoods in the area. Except that the impacts are likely to be much worse.” Anand Pendharkar, a naturalist who has closely studied the area, said, “These predictions are now beginning to manifest themselves. Over the years, community dependence along this coast has come to include many stakeholders across categories of jobs, class and caste. The scale of dislocation is massive.” Officials in the civic body’s coastal road department did not directly respond to a detailed questionnaire seeking a comment for the story. However, a spokesperson for the department said that civic body is currently in the process of appointing a third-party agency to assess the nature and extent of the project’s impact on fisherfolk. “We have already floated a tender for a thorough rehabilitation assessment. A third-party organisation will take stock of the situation and work out a compensation plan for affected fishermen. We can give more details only after this has been done,” said the official. As per the tender floated by the civic body last December, the entire rehabilitation process for project-affected people (PAP) is slated to take about three years, which the fisherfolk said is far too long. HT also reached out to Ashwini Bhide, chairman of the civic body-appointed Fisherfolk Rehabilitation Assessment Committee (FRAC) for a comment, but did not receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-coastal-road-project-work-leaves-fisherfolk-in-uncharted-waters-101619982717867.html

The chief minister asked them to cooperate in the war against Covid and join hands in overcoming the medical oxygen problem.“With the Covid infection rate 30 to 50 times (more) intense in the second wave, there was a huge rise in oxygen requirement. Though the state took a lot of steps to overcome the problem and succeeded to a great extent, the business community and entrepreneurs may work towards new experiments and innovations in the areas of oxygen production and manufacturing of oxygen concentrators,” he said.Observing that entrepreneurs had always been with the society and the country in tough times, he said nation once again needed their energy and cooperation in overcoming the second wave of the infection.The government would extend all cooperation to those who intended to set up medical oxygen ventures, he said.He noted that 16 lakh business people had done GST registration so far and more of them should do so.“Life and livelihood both are hit under the present circumstances. To break the chain of infection, the government has introduced an effective system of weekly closure and night curfew. But all essential and emergency services will continue. Continue to extend cooperation. In case, any untoward incident happens with you, immediately inform the local administration. If you don’t feel satisfied with their action, then inform the chief minister’s office. Immediate action will happen,” he said.He also said business community’s interests were a priority for the state government which had “done a lot for their safety, security, insurance, ease of doing business”.Uttar Pradesh finance minister Suresh Khanna too participated in the event.

Experts said the numbers need serious reconsideration and hence the survey is not trustworthy. “The number of cane cutters in the state is itself 150,000 and then there are workers in brick kilns, quarry workers, construction workers, etc. The number of students who have migrated, haven’t been into schools and who might have been put in child labour is likely to be way higher than what the government has found. It is imperative to get a more realistic picture if the government wishes to act on it,” said Heramb Kulkarni, a Pune-based educationist. In 2015, the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government held an out-of-school survey to identify students who had never attended school or who were on the rolls but were not attending. The survey had identified around 50,000 such students. Multiple such surveys were conducted after that; the most recent one was conducted in March 2021 wherein only 25,000 students were found out of school while only 288 students were found engaged in child labour. Experts said every year, the outcome of these surveys remain a mere formality. “The government needs to first come up with a realistic figure and then act. It is not enough to identify the problem, but it is crucial to be consistent and ensure that the found out-of-school students remain in schools over time,” said Ghanshyam Sonar, convenor of the All-India RTE forum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/experts-urge-govt-to-review-data-on-out-of-school-students-in-maharashtra-101619981398348.html
03-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man kills wife over suspicion of affair, arrested||Kurar police on Sunday arrested a 54-year-old man for killing his wife with a kitchen knife after he suspected her of having an extramarital affair. According to the police, a 22-year-old man approached the Kurar police on Saturday night after his father allegedly killed his mother after an argument in Kandivli (East). The complainant, Shiva Soni, a resident of Kranti Nagar, came home after work. Police said that his father opened the door, took him inside and seconds later ran out himself.In his complaint to the police, Soni said that his father, Mahesh Soni, 54, a diamond polishing worker, used to fight with his mother Poonam, 45, often suspecting her of having an extramarital affair.Soni said that he would witness his father beating his mother on multiple occasions. However, on Saturday the fight between the two got violent after which his father picked up a kitchen knife and slit his mother’s throat.The officers said that after Soni saw his mother’s body, he ran after his father and tried to stop him, but could not as he was overpowered. Soni then alerted the neighbours who called up the police emergency number and informed them about the attack.The victim Poonam Soni was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead on arrival. “After searching the locality, we intercepted Mahesh near the Poisar drain and arrested him,” said Prakash Vasant, senior police inspector of Kurar police station.The police arrested Mahesh after registering a case of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiman-kills-wife-over-suspicion-of-affair-arrested-101619981397777.html
03-05-2021||Mumbai||300 citizens write to BMC, seek second public hearing for Deonar WTE plant||Over 300 citizens have written to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) solid waste management department in the past five days, voicing objections against its proposed waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at Deonar landfill. A public hearing organised on April 27 had seen several attendees criticise the project and the manner in which the public consultation process was being carried out.Citizens have sought an outright suspension of “all matters requiring public consultations until such time that normalcy can return”. Public consultations are an essential part of the environmental clearance process under the Centre’s Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006.“Not to do so would result in the citizenry unable to voice their concerns and participate in any meaningful way in matters that require their attention. The WTE plant proposal is one such example,” the letter continues, which was signed by at least 301 citizens at the time of going to press.Citizens pointed out that around 900,000 people, who inhabit the areas around Deonar dumping ground, would be immediately impacted by the WTE project, which apart from incentivising the production of waste, also is a potential source of harmful emissions such a dioxins, toxins, furans and particulate matter pollution.In the broader central Mumbai area, it has been alleged, the project will also impact people in living in Deonar-Mankhurd-Govandi, Powai, Pirojshah Nagar and even near the international and domestic airports. “After the experiences of the communities living in Mahul, it would be an extremely negligent exercise to not work along with this community before giving a go-ahead to a potentially harmful project,” states the letter. Hindustan Times had, on April 28, reported that the Environment Impact Assessment report for the 4MW WTE plant had not been made publicly available by BMC (as per the Centre’s EIA Notification, 2006) at the time of virtual public hearing. Responding to citizens’ demands for the same, BMC shared a copy on their website, and has given until May 4 for any comments or inquiries.“The hurried way in which the EIA was conducted and the public hearing was held has not given the larger public the time required to independently assess the project. The public was not adequately informed about this project; we say this because the newspapers in which the notice was provided are not publications that are read extensively. The onus of making sure that the members of the civil society are properly informed about such matters falls on the government and in this case, the same was not carried out. The MCGM, therefore, must provide the people with adequate time, 30-60 days, to properly go through the EIA and articulate their suggestions/objections to this project,” petitioners have demanded.Officials from BMC’s solid waste department could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/300-citizens-write-to-bmc-seek-second-public-hearing-for-deonar-wte-plant-101619981337916.html
03-05-2021||Mumbai||West Bengal, Tamil Nadu poll results boost morale of MVA||Assembly election results in five states, especially in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, have given a boost to regional parties after Mamata Banerjee’s All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) and MK Stalin’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) emerged as undoubted winners in their respective states. Experts and observers believe that this has given a moral boost to Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, which comprises of two regional parties and has always been under the threat of getting dislodged. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis had, during his campaign rally for Pandharpur bypolls, said that bringing a change in the state leadership was his responsibility and that the steps for the same would be taken at appropriate time. Other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders had also been hinting that West Bengal election result would add momentum to a change in the reign in Maharashtra. The leaders had said the focus of the party’s central leadership would shift to Maharashtra after the results.MVA, comprising of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, formed government in Maharashtra in November 2019 after the alliance between the Sena and BJP was broken.Leaders from the three ruling parties in the state believe that the victory of the two regional parties in those states has given buoyancy to MVA government in the state. “Leaders from NCP and Sena share good relations with both Banerjee and Stalin and his family members. Both the parties had given open support to Banerjee in the Assembly polls by not contesting the elections. (NCP chief Sharad) Pawar saheb had planned to hold campaign rallies for TMC candidates in West Bengal, but could not go due to his health problems. Banerjee’s victory gives more power to regional parties while fighting against the mammoth strength of BJP,” said a Sena leader.“It has been proved by today’s results that if you have the courage and desire to fight against communal forces, people stand with you. We had exercised it in Maharashtra in 2019 and later replicated elsewhere at regional levels,” said NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik.On August 26 last year, during the meeting of chief ministers of all non-BJP ruled states with Congress’s interim president Sonia Gandhi, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray had praised Mamata Banerjee for her fight against the Centre. He had also said all non-BJP parties should come together and fight unitedly to ensure that their voice was not suppressed (by the BJP and the Central government led by it) in the federal structure of the democracy. “It is time to decide whether to fight back or seat idle out of fear,” he had said.Later in December, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had floated the idea of strengthening the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to create a combative combine that could fight the BJP. In an interview with a local newspaper he had also said that the front and Congress should extend its support to regional leaders like TMC in their respective states by keeping differences aside.After West Bengal poll results, Pawar tweeted, “Congratulations @MamataOfficial on your stupendous victory! Let us continue our work towards the welfare of people and tackling the pandemic collectively.”Reacting to the controversial Nandigram constituency results, Pawar tweeted, “The voters of Bengal have overwhelmingly supported Mamata and endorsed her for a third term. This result has to be accepted with a large heart. But the manner in which attempts are being made to revoke her win can only be called pettiness.”Leaders from Maharashtra feel that the ‘Maharashtra model’ of fighting out the BJP aggression has given strength to smaller parties at regional level. “RJD’s Yashaswi Yadav gave run to ruling JD(U) and BJP for their money in Assembly polls last year. Now, TMC and DMK have replicated it in their respective states. If any leader of regional parties like Mamata emerges as national leader against Narendra Modi, it will give more power to regional parties to fight against BJP’s political power,” a Congress leader said requesting anonymity.Political analyst Hemant Desai said after the setback in West Bengal, the BJP would not go for any attempt of toppling the Maharashtra government at least in immediate future. “BJP is a party which senses the waves very quickly. It has realised that using central agencies against regional parties boomerangs against them, and same may be witnessed in Maharashtra in probes by CBI and NIA. The BJP will resort to course correction in Maharashtra and would not go for any attempt to dislodge the government. But at the same time, the NCP or Sena too should take a firm stand and show courage to fight against BJP, like Mamata did,” he said.Fadnavis on Sunday said they would take steps against MVA at appropriate time. “This is the time to fight against Covid-19 pandemic and we are devoting our time for it. But yes, we will take steps (to dislodge the government) at appropriate time,” he said. Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said if the BJP tried to topple the government in Maharashtra, its tremors will be felt at the national level.While the MVA partners are elated with the result of elections in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, closer home they received a setback with the defeat of MVA candidate and NCP leader Bhagirath Bhalke in Pandharpur bypolls. BJP’s Samadhan Autade defeated Bhalke by 3,733 votes. The defeat was more significant for MVA as it was a battle of three ruling parties against the BJP. It has also given a boost to the BJP in Maharashtra. NCP state chief Jayant Patil said, “Our candidate lost the seat by a narrow margin. We failed in proper coordination of workers and leaders in two tehsils, Pandharpur and Mangalvedha, and it resulted in the defeat.”Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said, “We accept the mandate given by the electorate very politely. The defeat of the MVA candidate was a result of local issues and unpaid bills to farmers by Vitthal sugar factory.”Fadnavis said, “The mandate is against the corrupt, failed governance of the MVA government. Voters are upset as the government could not extend them any help during Covid-19 pandemic, electricity connections were rampantly disconnected for non-payment of bills. The ruling parties resorted to ill practices, despite of which the electorate stood by us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/west-bengal-tamil-nadu-poll-results-boost-morale-of-mva-101619981277865.html

As a part of the operation, the Navy has deployed INS (Indian Navy Ships) Kolkata, Kochi, Talwar, Tabar, Trikand, Jalashwa and Airavat for shipment of oxygen-filled cryogenic containers and associated medical equipment from various countries. The first batch of the ships, INS Kolkata and INS Talwar, deployed in Persian Gulf, were immediately diverted for the task, and entered the port of Manama, Bahrain, on April 30. INS Talwar is likely to reach India with 40 MT (metric tonnes) LMO on May 4. INS Kolkata has proceeded to Doha, Qatar, for medical supplies, and will head to Kuwait to bring liquid oxygen tanks, said naval spokesperson commander Mehul Karnik. Similarly on the eastern seaboard, INS Airavat, too, has been diverted for the task and will enter Singapore to bring liquid oxygen tanks. INS Jalashwa, the LPD (landing platform/dock) which played a key role during operation Samudra Setu last year, was pulled out of maintenance, prepared and is on stand-by in the region to embark medical stores at a short notice, the Navy has mentioned in its press release. The second batch of ships comprising INS Kochi, Trikand and Tabar, deployed in Arabian Sea, have also been diverted to join the national effort. From the Southern Naval Command, the landing ship tank, INS Shardul, is being readied to join the operation by Monday, commander Karnik added. Apart from this, Indian Air Force aircraft C-17 has carried out several sorties from within the country and abroad to supply oxygen tankers to different places to assist the civil administration dealing with oxygen shortage for Covid-19 patients. Three oxygen tankers were airlifted from Bangkok to Jamnagar on April 28, while one was lifted from Agra to Ranchi, and another from Chandigarh to Ranchi, said Karnik. Two oxygen tankers were airlifted by C-17 aircraft from Indore to Raipur and Bhopal to Surat last week. Operation Samudra Setu was launched last year by the Navy to rescue Indian citizens stranded in neighbouring countries amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Around 4,000 stranded citizens were successfully brought back to India, said commander Karnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rindia-navy-launches-samudra-setu-ii-deploys-7-ships-to-bring-medical-oxygen-101619979297821.html

A total of 1,342 beneficiaries were inoculated in the district on May 1, the first day of the drive. Dr Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer, PMC, said that doses for everyone above the age of 18 years have been given to the centres.“As the turnout on day 1 was less, there were just 200 doses at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital. We can inoculate 350 beneficiaries every day at every centre as vaccine stock is available for the next seven days. Beneficiaries should schedule an appointment on the Co-WIN application,” said Dr Deokar.Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, said that efforts from local bodies helped with the turnout on Sunday.“The control rooms, war room, call centres of Pune rural and municipal corporation played a big role in ensuring good vaccination numbers by urging people to come to the vaccination centres,” said Prasad.PMC aims to reach at least 700 beneficiaries each day. Three centres in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have a target of 200 beneficiaries each. Pune rural has 14 centres with 100 beneficiaries at each centre expected to take the jab.Rujuta Jalan, a beneficiary who was waiting in line at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerwada to take her first jab, said that there were three family members who wanted to take the dose, but the slots got filled quickly.“Until I booked my own slot, the appointments were full for May 2. I have been waiting at the centre for almost an hour as there is a huge line of beneficiaries to take the jab,” said Jalan.Dr Poonam More, medical officer (MO) at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, said that there are 200 doses with the hospital as of Sunday.“We received 200 doses and a list of 200 beneficiaries on Sunday. The turnout is good. By afternoon, we inoculated 100 beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who were expected to come on Saturday, but could not, will have to reschedule their vaccination for another day,” said Dr More.Rashmi Malpani, a 36-year old beneficiary at Kamla Nehru Hospital said that she tried to book a slot late on the night of May 1.“I booked the appointment around 10 pm and luckily got Kamla Nehru hospital. By the next afternoon I had taken the jab. Except for the registration and appointment scheduling, the whole process was smooth,” said Malpani.Dr Rajshree Patil, medical officer at Kamla Nehru Hospital, said that by Sunday afternoon the turnout for those aged 18 and above was good.“We have inoculated over 150 beneficiaries. We have 350 doses of Covishield and beneficiaries are expected to schedule an appointment and only then come.

03-05-2021||Pune||At 0.3 mn, Pune district records most cases in April||Pune district recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases - 3,07,000, and fatalities – 1,263, in April 2021, since the pandemic broke out last year. According to state health department, areas under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had 1,53,740 cases with 843 fatalities in April, which saw active cases in the district increase by 41,742. In 2020, when the Covid pandemic peaked in September, Pune district had 57,298 active cases. On April 30, 2021, the number of active cases in the district stood at 1,06,019. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19, says that this could be the peak of the second wave and by mid-May, urban parts of the district may see a downward trend.“This could be the highest growth. By third week of May, cases will go down in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, but they likely will not go down in the rural areas, which will take another fortnight to see the downward trend,” said Dr Salunke. Despite the spike in April, the positivity rate has been gradually decreasing, as per Rajesh Deshmukh, collector, Pune. “As the positivity rate has been going down, we can expect the curve to bend,” said Deshmukh. Salunke attributed the surge to a vulnerable population getting exposed to the virus and also to the increased transmissibility of it. “The virus now has been very efficiently transmitted. That is the reason why it is affecting all the family members. If one person is infected, then others are also getting easily infected,” Dr Salunke said. In Pune district, the highest number of cases have been recorded in PMC limits in April. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that PMC has been relentlessly working to increase bed capacity. “Only in April we have increased our strength of isolation beds, oxygen beds and ventilator beds. Every week we are adding to these numbers. Now the positivity rate has come down. Let’s be optimistic,” said Mohol.According to Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, cases in the second wave are almost six times higher than the first wave. “For rural areas, currently cases are higher because mass testing is taking place at hotspots. We are getting a positivity of 18-20 %. In each house one person is tested. Because of the testing, positive cases are being identified,” said Prasad. As the caseload has substantially increased, the demand for hospital beds, and especially for medical oxygen has increased. On January 22, the per day demand for medical oxygen in Pune district was 67.5 metric tonnes (MT). On April 22, the demand rose up to 386.1 MT and, on April 29, Pune recorded a demand of 420 MT of medical oxygen. Supply is low in proportion to the demand. On April 29, 353 MT was supplied to Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/april-2021-pune-district-records-highest-number-of-covid-cases-0-307-million-101619967057233.html
03-05-2021||Pune||Covid curbs see drop in Pune industrial production levels in April: MCCIA survey||PUNE Even as state government allowed industrial units to function during lockdown, stricter curbs have resulted in bringing production levels of firms, surveyed by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) in April, down.In its 13th survey, 150 companies from Pune district who participated in the exercise said that their current level of production has decreased from 83% in March to 69% in April, on an average. The production level had seen a dip of 2% in March from 85% in February, as the month had seen only partial restrictions, that too in some parts of the state. As Covid cases saw a massive spike across the state including Pune and Mumbai, the state government, on April 15, imposed a curfew and allowed only essential services apart from industrial units and the real estate sector, to function. Sudhir Mehta, president, MCCIA said, “Supply chains are once again disrupted and we are really concerned about the small, informal manufacturers and contact-based services. The government at the centre and state must front-load their allocations for MSMEs, industries and infrastructure development in FY 21-22.” Despite a drop in production, industrial firms managed to keep it above the level of April 2020, when the entire country was under lockdown and only units engaged production of essential items were allowed to function. “Given the heightened levels of restrictions, the drop was expected. Glad that the drop is not as bad as it was in April 2020. God forbid if there is any more contribution of restrictions, it needs to come along with an increased level of economic activities as impact on livelihoods for those who work at the bottom of the economic pyramid is unbearable,” said Prashant Girbane, director general, MCCIA. The units that participated in the survey said that on average, the number of employees working has decreased from 86% in March to 70% in April. The surveyed companies were also asked about when their production levels were expected to go back to pre-pandemic levels. Twenty-four per cent of the companies said their production was already at pre-Covid levels; 19% of the respondents now said that they expect their production levels to go back to pre-Covid levels in less than three months; and 35% of the respondents said they expect it to take between three and six months; while 22% said it would take more than six months. According to MCCIA, the profile organisations surveyed from micro, small, medium and large scale organisations was 14%, 34%, 21% and 32%, respectively. Also, 66% of the organisations surveyed were from the manufacturing sector, 14% from the services sector and the rest were involved in both manufacturing and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/production-levels-drop-from-83-in-march-to-69-in-april-mccia-survey-13-101619965317161.html
