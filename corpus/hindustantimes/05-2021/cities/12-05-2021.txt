Officials said that only nominal charges will be taken for these cylinders to ensure that there is no financial burden on patients in isolation. As per the directions of the district administration, the rate of a small B-type cylinder has been fixed at ₹80, while the rate of the bigger D-type cylinder has been fixed at ₹250, with a standard delivery charge of ₹100 per cylinder. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that with the fixing of rates, the home delivery system has been fine-tuned to ensure people don’t have to stand in long queues at filling plants to get a refill. “Our teams will ensure that patients in home isolation get cylinders timely and at a nominal cost,” said Garg. A spokesperson for the district administration said that the charges were fixed by a three-member committee headed by Rajnarayan Kaushik, an IAS officer. “If a person wants a small cylinder, they will have to pay ₹180, while for the large cylinder, payment would be ₹350,” the spokesperson said. The district administration and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) are working in tandem to ensure that patients in home isolation are given oxygen cylinders at their residence. For this purpose, the residents have to register on a dedicated portal (oxygenhry.in) and apply with documents, after which oxygen is made available.Meanwhile, to curb the spread of infection in rural areas, the Haryana government on Wednesday also decided to set up 50 isolation centres with adequate healthcare equipment. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the village isolation centres should have well-equipped beds and beddings, triple-layered masks, hand sanitisers with bottle dispensers, steamers, catering for the patients from the community or on a hire basis, and regular cleanliness and sanitation drives of premises and toilets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/home-delivery-of-oxygen-cylinders-to-cost-180-to-350-101620842746432.html

The move comes in the wake of large crowds being witnessed in the market over the past few days.Officials of the Agriculture Marketing Board, which manages the Khandsa market, said that entry of private vehicles is banned, while the retail sale of vegetables and fruits to individual buyers was already disallowed.Vinay Yadav, executive officer cum secretary of the market, said that the move will ensure adequate space for social distancing. “We will ensure that despite the closure of shops, there is no shortage of fruits and vegetables in the city,” said Yadav.Only wholesale buyers, who supply stocks to city markets, residential colonies and villages will be allowed to enter the market. As per the decision, shops with odd numbers will remain open on the odd days of the month and those with even numbers will be allowed to remain open on even-numbered days. Khandsa vegetable market is the largest wholesale market of vegetables and fruits in the city, with around 120 large shops and over 50 small shops.Yadav said that they have decided to restrict the number of carts in the market so that there is no overcrowding. “We have a large vacant area in the market and it will be used now. Some of the shops would be shifted there. We have also issued directions to all commission agents and shopkeepers regarding the odd-even formula,” he said.On Wednesday, the board officials penalised 13 persons for violating Covid-19 safety rules and collected ₹26,000 in penalties.

12-05-2021||Gurugram||Residents raise concerns over increasing deaths in rural areas||Rural areas of the district have started to bear the brunt of the second wave of Covid-19, with several villages reporting deaths either due to suspected influenza-like illnesses or confirmed Covid-19 cases. Locals said that almost every third household in villages of Sultanpur, Darbaripur, Badshahpur, Sikanderpur Barha and Baspadmaka in Pataudi are exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19.The situation has been compounded because a majority of villagers are thronging to chemist shops and relying on local medical practitioners or indulging in self-treatment, which has delayed hospitalisations and led to several deaths, according to locals.Naveen Kumar, a resident of Baspadmaka village in Pataudi on Tuesday, took to Twitter on Tuesday seeking the intervention of authorities over rising Covid-19 infections and deaths in his village. “Around 10 people have died in the last 10 days in my village and all these are Covid-19 cases. Almost half of the families in the village have people suffering from cold, fever and other symptoms. I want the authorities to increase testing, create local medical facilities and also enforce lockdown strictly,” said Kumar.Most of the village heads as well as residents said that people were scared of getting tested as they did not want to get quarantined. Besides, people do not have access to testing facilities in the vicinity, they said.Pravesh Chouhan, a resident of Sultanpur village said that his brother’s business partner contracted Covid-19 and relied on medication from an acquainted chemist for a couple of days, and did not go for a Covid-19 test. “His condition deteriorated suddenly and he was admitted to a hospital in Farrukhnagar, where the test confirmed Covid-19. He could survive only a single day in the hospital,” said Chouhan, whose younger brother is also under treatment for Covid-19.In Sultanpur, locals said that around seven to eight people have died due to Covid-19, with three of the deceased in their thirties.Despite the frequent deaths and rising Covid-19 cases, villagers allege that there have been little efforts from the administration to increase testing, sanitise the rural areas or enforce Covid-19 safeguards. “We have multiple people within same families who have serious Covid-19 symptoms. The administration needs to extend the outreach to villages and help them,” said Ram Bir Sarpanch, a resident of Darbaripur.In Bajghera village, locals said that around seven to eight senior citizens have died in the last 10 days due to influenza-like symptoms. “I have myself spent half a month in a hospital due to infection. Although the situation is not bad in our village, things need to be brought under control,” said Virender Singh, who is popularly known as Biru Sarpanch.Sunder Yadav, sarpanch of Sikanderpur Barha village, said that he has started taking rounds of the streets and prevents any gathering over hukka or card games. “The cases are increasing every day. We need to enforce masks and also isolate contaminated zones,” said Yadav, whose entire family tested positive for Covid-19 positive over the past week.In response to the pleas for intervention and help from locals in rural areas, the Gururgam district administration on Wednesday said that it has decided to introduce thikri pehra (village patrols) to check the movement of people in the rural areas.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that directions have been issued in this regard and patrols will be done with the help of respective panchayats.Officials of the health department, meanwhile, said that testing has been increased to identify new cases.Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19, said, “In seven high-risk rural areas, at least 17 deaths have been reported till now. Until April, the positivity rate was almost 21%, which we trying to control through aggressive testing.”Although many patients are under home isolation, critically ill patients are referred to Civil Hospital in Sector 10.Dr Manmeet Nehra, medical officer, Bhora Kalan primary health centre, said, “Critical cases are referred to Civil Hospital in sector 10 or subdivisional hospital in Pataudi, where 25 beds with oxygen concentrators have been reserved for Covid-19 patients. Only a few critical cases have been reported till now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-raise-concerns-over-increasing-deaths-in-rural-areas-101620842745133.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Five minibuses converted into ambulances||Amid increasing demand for ambulances, the transport department has converted five minibuses at the Gurugram bus depot into ambulances, with each having a capacity to ferry four patients.According to a release issued by the district administration on Wednesday, the buses have provisions for beds, oxygen cylinders and fans, and will be handed over to the health department this week.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram district, said, “Implementing the guidelines issued by the state government, it has been decided to convert the five minibuses into ambulances. There are four beds installed in each ambulance. Apart from this, they have been designed in such a way that the patient can be given necessary facilities like oxygen. Along with this, arrangements have been made to keep the medical box, oxygen cylinder stand, PPE kit and a sanitiser, among other necessities.”A senior official from the Gurugram bus depot, requesting anonymity, said, “Along with converting minibuses into ambulances, we are also converting 10 old buses into makeshift hospital beds, which will be used as additional facilities to treat patients at the district government hospital. Each bus will have six beds and we will hand over these also to the health department this week.”The deputy commissioner appealed to the residents to stringently follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and getting vaccinated. He said that all departments are collaborating round-the-clock to break the chain of Covid-19 infection in the district.“Every effort is being made to provide better health facilities to Covid-19 infected patients and to prevent further spread of the infection, with volunteers from Red Cross society, defence services and various social organisations working in solidarity, supporting the district administration in this crisis hour,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-minibuses-converted-into-ambulances-101620842688384.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Vaccinations for 18+ may stop due to shortage of doses||Left with only 800 doses of Covid-19 vaccine for the 18-44 age group that will be administered on Thursday, the district health department said it is on the verge of stopping inoculation for the general population. Health officials said they are likely to suspend vaccinations for the 18-44 age group from Friday if the district does not get additional doses. “Vaccination for 18 plus could have stopped from Thursday onwards. But we managed to collect a few unused vials of Covishield from different health centres. After collating it, we distributed 100 doses each to eight centres. Vaccination for 18 plus might stop as the department has already run out of stock. Second dose inoculation for those above 45 will continue at 37 vaccination centres,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. On Wednesday, nearly 77% of the 4,500 Covaxin doses allocated for the 18-44 age group was used. According to the data, at least 3,456 people took their jabs at government vaccination centres. Only 590 people took their first dose in two private hospitals. “At least 20% of vaccines are reserved as per the state government protocol. The district administration will suggest its usage. The state health department has also been apprised about the current situation as we have asked for doses to continue with vaccination drives,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. According to Singh, there are roughly about 15,000 doses for people above 45 years who are to take their second dose. More than 4,500 people took their second dose at 37 health centres on Wednesday. Long queues were seen at urban primary health centres catering to newer areas of Gurugram. At some locations, only those who took their first shot in March were getting inoculated with the second dose. “Co-WIN portal is accepting details of people who took their first jab after March 30. It is confirming only those registrations which have completed six to eight weeks of their first dose. Until Tuesday, there was no such problem in the portal. Therefore, many people who took the shot in the first week of April were asked to leave,” said a medical officer, requesting anonymity. Many people above 45 years who had walked in without registration to receive their first dose were also asked to leave due to vaccine shortage, which has been persisting over the last 12 days. Until now, 569,461 doses have been administered in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccinations-for-18-may-stop-due-to-shortage-of-doses-101620842687736.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Mucormycosis cases on the rise in the city||Private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are reporting a surge in mucormycosis (black fungus infections) cases, with five hospitals reporting at least six cases each over the past week. The health department does not have a record of these cases at present.Mucormycosis arises due to indiscriminate consumption of steroids during treatment. Excessive use of steroids during the Covid-19 treatment escalates blood sugar in the body and weakens the immune system, according to doctors.“The trend of black fungus cases is on an upward trajectory. It is a serious concern because those who have recovered from Covid-19 and have co-morbidities, diabetes, in particular, are at risk. They already have a weakened immunity as they have been treated with steroids,” said Dr Atul Mittal, director, otorhinolaryngology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, who has come across at least six cases in the last three days, including one in an active Covid-19 patient. The hospital has opened a dedicated mucormycosis clinic to handle cases.Due to many Covid-19 patients, who are mild to moderately ill, consuming steroids for treatment without any consultation with the doctors, doctors at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences –Rohtak (PGIMS) on May 6 revised their treatment protocol by limiting steroid consumption during the early phase of infection.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, state nodal officer for Covid-19 cases, who is a respiratory and lung disease specialist at PGIMS-Rohtak, said, “Excessive use of steroids use without consultation can be harmful. People, however, take steroids based on the recommendation from family members or a recovered patient. It not only leads to diabetes but other infections, too, like mucormycosis. Therefore, in the treatment protocol, we have introduced steroid administration only after the fifth or seventh day, based on symptoms.”If left untreated, mucormycosis can spread to the bloodstream, reach the brain and heart, eat the tissue, and spread to the blood vessels. “As a result, the blood supply is cut off and the tissue is deprived of oxygen. It also invades the nerves and arteries causing progressive necrosis of tissue which turns it dead and black. It makes the disease life-threatening,” said Mittal.Common symptoms associated with the black fungus disease are headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, loss of vision or eye pain, swelling of the cheeks and eyes, and black crust in the nose. The disease has to be treated surgically, for the removal of dead and infected tissues, following which anti-fungal therapy has to be undertaken.Dr Amitabh Malik, chief, ENT department, Paras Hospital, Gurugram, said at least nine cases were reported to him in the last three days. He operated on two non-diabetic patients in their 30s who developed the black fungus infection.Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, consultant- internal medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, said that over six cases have been reported at their facility.Dr Sameer Kaushal, head of ophthalmology, Artemis Hospital, who is currently treating at least four cases, said, “Last year, only a few cases were reported. During the peak, not more than four cases were reported. But this time, the magnitude of Covid-19 surge has increased as a result of which black fungus infection is also on the rise. Even the medicine which is used to treat the illness is in short supply,” said Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mucormycosis-cases-on-the-rise-in-the-city-101620842687081.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Over 100 beds available for first time in three weeks||After a gap of nearly three weeks, the availability of oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients crossed the three-digit mark, with around 127 oxygen beds available across 14 Covid-19 hospitals in the district on Wednesday afternoon, as per the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3) real-time portal managed by the district administrationOfficials attributed the improvement in bed availability to the recent reduction in cases, increase in recovery and the simultaneous increase in infrastructure. As per a release by the administration, the number of people recovering from Covid-19 was more than the new cases for the sixth consecutive day. There were 3,960 recoveries in Gurugram on Wednesday, while 2,747 new cases were registered, the release stated.“The recent trend has been encouraging. We have had a lower number of Covid-19 cases, higher rates of recovery that have reduced the burden on existing infrastructure. Over the last three weeks, we have also ramped up the infrastructure and added more than 1,000 Covid-19 beds across the city. While the signs are positive, until the Covid-19 situation is fully under control, we will continue to take both preventive and preparatory measures,” said Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram.He said that the administration will further augment the strength of Covid-19 beds, by adding at least 400 more within the next seven days.As per the daily health bulletin, the number of new Covid-19 cases per week decreased for the first time in a month, with the district recording 25,860 new cases between May 3 and 9, lower than the 27,358 new cases recorded over the previous week between April 26 and May 2.There has also been a rise in the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients recently. Between April 26 and May 2, the total number of recoveries was 13,120, which nearly doubled between May 3 and 9 to 27,603, indicating that recoveries were higher than new cases by a margin of 1,743.Increased recoveries and discharge of Covid-19 patients from hospitals has also increased the availability, said administration officials. As recently as last Tuesday, May 4, all of the city’s Covid-19 beds were occupied, but since Saturday, the availability of oxygen beds has been consistently improving.According to the coronaharya.in portal, the district currently has 3,083 Covid-19 beds, of which 1,795 are oxygen beds, 552 are general beds, 736 are ICU beds, and 244 are ventilator beds, a significant increase from the 1,948 Covid-19 beds reported on April 20, of which 466 were ICU beds and 226 were ventilator beds.On April 20, the last time more than 100 oxygen beds were available, the district had 129 non-occupied Covid-19 oxygen beds, four ICU beds, and a solitary ventilator bed. The portal, at the time, did not display the total number of oxygen beds or general beds in the city.“The situation of oxygen beds has improved, especially over the last three days. Earlier, we were having around 30-40 extra Covid-19 patients looking for beds on a daily basis. Now, there are only five to 10 such patients. The pattern of patients has also changed. The five to 10 people are patients, coming from districts near Gurugram, usually looking for ICU or ventilator beds, as their respective districts have limited availability. Now. we frequently have oxygen beds available,” said Dr PN Kakar, the chief executive officer of Park Hospital.Kakar said that until early this month, a sense of panic prevailed that also added to the demand for oxygen beds. “Now, such patients prefer to isolate at home and realise that they don’t necessarily need treatment inside a hospital. Virtual consultations for such patients have also increased, which, along with the recent decline in Covid-19 cases and higher recovery rates, have mitigated the beds situation,” said Kakar.While the situation of Covid-19 oxygen beds has improved, the same cannot be said for the ICU and ventilator beds situation. As per the GC3 app, throughout Wednesday, the city had less than a dozen ventilator or ICU beds, each, and by night, only a solitary ICU bed was available and all ventilator beds were occupied.Although there has been a recent decline in Covid-19 cases, studies and experts have pegged the second wave of Covid-19 to peak around mid-May or next month.According to the three-member national Covid-19 supermodel committee, formed by the central government to make projections regarding the spread of the pandemic and follow its trajectory, the second wave is expected to peak around mid-May, as does a State Bank of India (SBI) research report. A report by CLSA, a foreign capital market firm, pegs the spike to peak in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-100-beds-available-for-first-time-in-three-weeks-101620842686454.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Labs overcharging for Covid-19 test despite price caps, allege residents||Residents alleged that private laboratories and hospitals are overcharging them for Covid-19 tests, despite the government on Tuesday capping the price for a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test at ₹450 and an additional ₹200 for home collection.According to residents, private labs are citing a shortage of staff and a need to pay additional incentives for sample testing for charging them more than the specified prices.Tanisha Kumar, a resident of DLF Phase 1, said that she contacted two private labs to get samples collected for all her family members after they started exhibiting symptoms on Monday. “The lab technician charged ₹1,250 per sample and said the prices are fixed as they do not go on home visits for lower than that. On Wednesday, I called another private lab as I was doubtful of my result and they charged me ₹750 for the same test,” she said. Sohna Road resident Arun Sarwan, who got three of his family members tested, said he paid ₹1,000 per sample on Wednesday. “When I asked the lab why they are charging extra, they said all the technicians are overworked and they are paying them an extra incentive for home collection. They said they are working more than 14 hours a day and have to travel to different parts of the city, risking their lives,” he said. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that they will take action against labs that are violating the orders and issue notices. “We haven’t received a complaint against any lab. We will take prompt action if anyone comes forward (with a complaint),” he said.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Action will be taken against labs if the department will receive any complaint against them.” Even as officials warned of action, representatives of private labs said the price cap for RT-PCR test is not viable and it will eventually, lead to a dip in testing.“The situation is challenging for us as the prices fixed are too less and our staff has to travel across the city. With the fixed price, it will be difficult to run the operations. A delegation of lab representatives is planning to meet the deputy commissioner this week to request an increase in the price,” an executive of a private lab said, requesting anonymity. Representatives of private labs said that residents are ready to pay additional charges for home testing as they want to avoid exposure by visiting hospitals. Dr Santosh Kumar, the managing director of Times PathLabs Private Limited in Sector 14, said, “Many people are ready to pay more for the test because they want samples to be collected from home. Since labs have been overburdened with samples and their staff was tested positive, home collection has got affected.” Many labs also reported a shortage of RT-PCR kits and stopped home collection of samples on Wednesday. It is for the seventh time that the state health department on Tuesday revised the test cost and fixed separate rates for samples given directly at the lab and those collected from residences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/labs-overcharging-for-covid-19-test-despite-price-caps-allege-residents-101620842685856.html
12-05-2021||Gurugram||Drive-through vaccination to be held on Friday||Despite the limited availability of Covid-19 vaccines in the district, the health department has planned to hold a drive-through vaccination at DLF City Centre, MG Road, on May 14 for people above the age of 45 who are waiting for their second shot. Only 200 doses will be administered during the drive, said officials. “People will be vaccinated in their cars. After the vaccination, they will have to wait in the parking lot for 30 minutes under the observation period. If they face any difficulty, they can flash their car lights. Our team will address those who will report any side effect. The drive through is only for those above 45 years, who are scheduled for their second dose,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to Yadav, the lift lobby in the building will be used as an Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) room for people who require medical assistance. It is for the first time since March 31 that the health department will be holding vaccination drive in a private building. The district on Wednesday reported 2,747 new cases, taking the total count of active cases to 32,895. The death toll stood at 621, with nine deaths confirmed on Wednesday.

12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Four ministers seek Navjot Sidhu’s suspension for anti-party activities||The chorus for disciplinary action against former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu in the ruling Congress in Punjab gained momentum on Wednesday as four more cabinet ministers demanded his immediate suspension for anti-party activities. The ministers—Balbir Sidhu, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar—lashed out at the Amritsar East MLA for his unwarranted belligerence against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. “Sidhu’s provocative and targeted attacks on the chief minister over the past several days are an invitation for disaster for the Congress,” they said in a hard-hitting statement, insinuating collusion between the MLA and state opposition parties, such as Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They said it was quite possible that Sidhu’s targeted attacks on the chief minister were instigated by the AAP or BJP leaders to create problems in the Punjab Congress to further their electoral agenda in the state. “The manner in which Sidhu had launched the offensive against the state government, particularly Captain Amarinder, suggested a conspiracy against the chief minister,” they added. Kangar’s name is significant as he was among the five ministers and MPs who met at cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s official residence on Monday and expressed their disenchantment with the state government’s handling of the police firing case. The number of ministers seeking strict action against Sidhu has now gone up to seven. On Monday, Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had made a similar demand from the party high command. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has also thrown in his lot with the chief minister. Sidhu, whose relations with Amarinder have been strained for more than two-and-a-half years, has been taking swipes at the chief minister almost daily ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed the chargesheets filed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. He directly blamed the CM for the legal setback, accusing him of “collusion” with the culprits of the 2015 sacrilege incidents. Amarinder last month held a series of meetings with MLAs who conveyed their apprehensions about the political fallout if justice is not delivered in sacrilege and police firing cases. When some other ministers, MPs and MLAs started regrouping, the chief minister’s camp launched the counter offensive with three ministers demanding action against the cricketer-turned-politician. Though the silence of several ministers had raised eyebrows, the statement of more ministers, which came a day before the cabinet is scheduled to meet here, is likely to put pressure on detractors. The four ministers, in their hard-hitting joint statement, termed Sidhu’s blatant defiance as an act of total indiscipline. “Such anti-party activities cannot be tolerated by any political establishment, and, more so, in a state headed for elections. He should be immediately suspended, if not expelled, as his continued presence in Punjab Congress is creating a mess in the party’s state unit,” they said. Pointing to Sidhu’s track record of controversial statements, the ministers said that his habit of ‘biting the hand that feeds him’ had made him a persona non grata earlier in his former party. “He is nothing but a troublemaker whose contribution to the Congress and the state government in Punjab in all these years has been virtually nil,” they said, questioning the rationale behind allowing him to continue in the Congress at a time when the party was preparing for the next assembly elections in Punjab and the state government was battling an unprecedented Covid crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-ministers-seek-navjot-sidhu-s-suspension-for-anti-party-activities-101620842505652.html

They were admitted to a local hospital, where five of them died. Three were still undergoing treatment and four others have been discharged.He said some other deaths in the area were being incorrectly attributed to the hooch tragedy.The SP added the police searched every house in the village for country made liquor in presence of district magistrate Samuel Paul.The SP said a country made liquor shop owner was among the five people arrested in the case from Azamgarh. He was found to be selling liquor illegally despite the corona curfew in the state since April 30. “Those arrested have been booked for violating the state government order, epidemic act, excise act as well as causing death due to negligence,” the SP said.The Azamgarh district administration, however, said no deaths have been reported in the district due to spurious liquor and they were cooperating with the Ambedkar Nagar police in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ambedkar-nagar-hooch-tragedy-death-toll-rises-to-six-5-arrested-4-cops-suspended-101620840944701.html
12-05-2021||Pune||Two men arrested for online scam involving nude videos||Two men have been arrested in Rajasthan in a case involving at least 100 males, in the age group of 25 to 55 years, being duped in an online scam involving nude videos of the victims. The accused posed as women, befriended the victims and then solicited the nude videos, based on which the victims were then blackmailed.

This is nearly double the wheat procured during the corresponding period last year. “We have purchased 21.45 lakh MT wheat from 4,20,948 farmers and have already paid ₹2933.34 crore to them while ₹4237.50 crore will be credited to their accounts very soon,” said commissioner, food and civil supplies, Manish Chauhan. “The government procured 12.11 lakh MT wheat during the corresponding period previous year,” he pointed out. The Centre has fixed the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat at ₹1975 per quintal for the current procurement season. For the first time, the state government fixed no wheat purchase target this year, deciding to purchase all the wheat brought to the purchase centeres during the procurement season. “The target was not fixed but we expect to purchase around 50-55 lakh MT wheat by the end of the procurement season in mid-June and funds are being arranged for the same,” another official revealed. He said the wheat purchase progress was quite satisfactory despite the challenges posed by the deadly second Covid wave in the state. “We are taking all the precautions for farmers as well as the staff at the procurement centres,” the official claimed. The state government has installed electronic point of sale (EPoS) machines at all the 6,000 procurement centres that have been set up across the state to buy wheat from farmers, to do away with complaints related to weighing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-has-purchased-22l-mt-wheat-from-farmers-so-far-paid-rs-2933-34-crore-101620839684431.html

12-05-2021||Bangalore||After Maharashtra, Karnataka suspends Covid vaccines for 18-44 from Friday||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has decided to suspend vaccination for people in the 18-44 age group from Friday because it does not have enough vaccines, the state health department said in a statement on Wednesday evening. The move comes a day after Maharashtra announced that it would divert 310,000 Covaxin doses meant for those aged between 18 and 44 to the 45+ age group.“Today the state government has decided that the vaccine procured directly by the state for vaccination of persons between 18 to 44 years will be utilised for vaccination of beneficiaries who are due for second dose,” the Karnataka health department said in a statement.“In this regard vaccination for the 18 to 44 age group (including those who have already booked appointments) will be temporarily suspended from 14.05.2021 (Friday) till further orders,” the health department said.The decision to slow down jabs for the 18-44 population comes at a time when the Covid- 19 surge continues in Karnataka, with the number of active cases inching towards the 600,000 mark. The state has reported 39,998 new infections during the 24-hour period on Tuesday. The positivity rate remains around 30%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. It said 517 people died in the state during the 24-hour-period. Bengaluru accounted for 275 out of the 517 fatalities.But the state has already had to go slow on the vaccination drive due to depleting stocks.Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Wednesday said there were just 40,000 doses of vaccines left in Bengaluru. There have been multiple reports of vaccine shortage over the last few days, prompting some people to travel to vaccination centres 100 km from the city where local residents were slow to book slots on the CoWin app.The state government, till it formally announced suspension of the vaccination programme for the 18-44 age group, had been insisting that there was no shortage of vaccines.“We don’t have a shortage as such. As and when the vaccine arrives, we will give vaccination to all. We want to give it to everybody,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said on Wednesday.Karnataka has administered 10,882,080 doses of vaccines of which only 2,293,210 have received both doses, as per the data. This is just around 3.5% of the state’s estimated population of 60.5 million. Karnataka has, in all, placed orders for 10 million Covishield vaccines from Serum Institute of India. In addition, it has said it will float tenders for another 20 million doses including 10 million doses of Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-running-out-of-vaccines-suspends-jabs-for-18-44-from-friday-101620839264973.html

12-05-2021||Pune||Govt officially issues order about cancellation of exam, questions on FYJC remain||Days after it made an announcement, the Maharashtra government officially issued a General Resolution (GR) on Wednesday stating that the Class 10 exam has been cancelled. However, the fresh announcement wasn’t clear about how and on what basis students will be admitted to FYJC course. In a recent survey by the Maharashtra State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT), 65 per cent students have said that they want a common entrance test for first year junior college (FYJC). The GR stated that the decision was taken to cancel the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination due to the ongoing pandemic. This GR also states that an independent decision will be taken regarding the evaluation of Class 10 students and the admission process for Class 11. Board officials noted that a common entrance test will be beneficial for students. “If internal mark assessment is used for admission for Class 11, the overall marking can be inflated by schools. To avoid this, the common entrance test would be fair and unbiased towards the students of state board as well as other boards,” said board officials. The survey conducted by Maharashtra SCERT saw the participation of over 3 lakh students from across Maharashtra. Around 65 percent students said that a common entrance test for class 11 would be beneficial to the students. SCERT deputy director Vikas Garad said that along with a survey to find out if students want a common admission test for class 11, principals from various schools were also asked to participate in a survey to understand how prepared they were for the internal assessment of students. “Around 17,487 schools have said that they are ready for internal assessment to evaluate students of Class 10. A total of 21,110 schools are there across Maharashtra,” said Garad. Prathmesh Kulkarni, a student of Class 10 said that the decision to cancel the examination is welcomed. “I think a common entrance test for class 11 will be a fair platform to evaluate all students ahead of their admissions. It will also help students who have studied hard and also students from other boards,” said Kulkarni. Education experts noted that though some students have given a positive response to the entrance test for Class 11, interest of students from rural parts of the state should also be kept in mind before the board takes the final decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/govt-officially-issues-order-about-cancellation-of-exam-questions-on-fyjc-remain-101620836503757.html
12-05-2021||Delhi||No Covaxin doses available for 18-44 age group in Delhi from Thursday; Sisodia alleges 'mismanagement' by Centre||People in the 18-44 age group won't be able to get Covaxin shots in Delhi from Thursday as deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that its manufacturer Bharat Biotech has refused to provide "additional" vaccine doses to the city government, a development that is likely to hamper the inoculation drive severely in the national capital.Stocks of the other coronavirus vaccine --- Covishield, will last only nine days, AAP MLA Atishi said while releasing vaccination bulletin of the city.As Covaxin's stock finished, the Delhi government temporarily closed down around 100 centres administering the vaccine on Wednesday.The AAP MLA said that there are four days of Covaxin left for frontline workers and those above 45, while Covishield stock will last three days for such category.Addressing an online press briefing on Wednesday, Sisodia said, "The Covaxin manufacturer has in a letter said that it cannot provide the Delhi government vaccines due to unavailability, under instruction of government officials concerned. It means that the central government is controlling supply of the vaccine."However, Joint Secretary in the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal on Tuesday denied that the Centre had any role to play in the purchase of vaccines by the states.Sisodia accused the Centre of vaccine mismanagement and reiterated that exporting 6.5 crore doses to foreign countries was the "biggest mistake".The Delhi government had ordered 67 lakh doses each of Covishield and Covaxin on April 26, the deputy chief minister said.According to the Delhi government figures, it has received 1.5 lakh Covaxin and 4 lakh Covishield doses so far to vaccinate people in the 18-44 age group.Till now, a total of 48.7 lakh doses of both the vaccines have been received for various categories of beneficiaries, it showed."I had already said exporting 6.5 crore doses to foreign countries was the biggest mistake. It would have been sufficient to vaccinate everyone in Delhi and Mumbai with two doses each," Sisodia added.During the online briefing, he read the letter received from Bharat Biotech, which said, "...we are making dispatches as per the directions of the government officials concerned. We therefore sincerely regret that we cannot make any additional supplies as required by you."The letter written by Bharat Biotech Chairman and Managing Director Dr Krishna Ella, on May 11, to the Delhi government's principal secretary (health and family welfare) also mentioned "unprecedented demand" of Covaxin.Bharat Biotech's letter referred to another note written to it by the Delhi government on May 7 regarding supply of Covaxin.Meanwhile, during a press briefing, AAP leader Atishi, an MLA from the Kalkaji constituency, said that Delhi received 2.67 lakh more doses of Covishield vaccine on May 11."Around 16,000 Covaxin doses, which were available in the morning, were administered at 44 centres. These centres will also be shut after Wednesday evening," the AAP MLA said.Atishi hoped that the central government would intervene and make Covaxin doses available for the 18-44 age category."Soon it will be time to give the second dose of Covaxin to beneficiaries in this category," she added.There are 4.18 lakh Covishield doses left for people in the 18-44 age group. These can last up to nine days, she added."However, there will be no Covaxin doses left for the 18-44 age group after Wednesday evening and all such centres will be temporarily shut," she said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said Bharat Biotech's letter cited by Sisodia has "exposed" his claim that the city government ordered 67 lakh Covaxin doses on April 26."The reality is they wrote letter of intent to Bharat Biotech on April 26. Sisodia should disclose what the Delhi government wrote to Bharat Biotech in its May 7 letter," he said.The deputy chief minister also said that the Centre should stop export of vaccines and share the vaccine formulae of the two manufacturers in the country with other companies for mass scale production.He also urged the Union government to approve vaccines available in the international market for use in India, and direct states to vaccinate everyone within three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-covaxin-doses-available-for-18-44-age-group-in-delhi-from-thursday-101620835691245.html

This venture is an extension of the ‘Right to Read’ initiative which was started in 2018 when the Government of Maharashtra, Schoolnet and EnglishHelper signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU). Under this MoU, the Right to Read program was implemented in 65,000 government schools in the state. This technology-driven method enables students to enhance their reading skills in English. Vikas Garad, SCERT deputy director said that this ‘Right to Read’ initiative has reached over 20,000 schools in Maharashtra. “Of the 65,000 government schools, we were successful in reaching over 20,000 schools in the state. Some schools had technical challenges and sometimes needed to sort them and reach the children. However, since 2020, schools have been shut and online education has begun,” said Garad. As a result, students could not reach out to schools for technical needs like computers and required software to take assistance from this initiative during the pandemic. “In order to address this issue, the NGO has come up with an app or application that every student can access. These will help the students access all the required things on their phone,” said Garad. SCERT is yet to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to start this. “We have all the required documents in place and soon we shall sign a MoU so that students across Maharashtra can access this application and learn to read English better. After signing the MoU, students can access this application free of cost,” said Garad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/scerts-new-venture-to-provide-students-with-app-for-reading-practice-101620835663634.html

The streets lights are non-functional on the patch until it connects to NDA Pashan road where all the streetlights are working. “Those who travel every day, they are getting use to this road but yesterday one of the food delivery services’ people hurt himself as he could not see the divider on the road. It’s been more than 10 days that the streetlights are not functional,” said Nishant Tupe, a daily commuter on the road. A blocked portion of the road for metro work is adding to the commuters’ problems. “The worst I feel is that only one patch is facing such problem; the lights at NDA Pashan road are completely functional. The common people are facing a lot of problem,” said Deepak Jadhav, a resident on Bavdhan-Pashan road. With restrictions in place, the road has become more prone to accidents. “At 9pm, when I return home there are no passing of vehicles and darkness brings uneasy feeling while commuting,” said Nisha Dutt, a nurse and a resident of Bavdhan. A pizza delivery boy said, “We don’t visit this location every day, our many delivery boys are facing problems to commute whenever we have orders from residents of this road.” An official from PMC electronic department said, “Due to ongoing metro work at Chandani chowk, street lights are not functional.

12-05-2021||Pune||10-year-old apprehended for killing eight-year-old brother||A 10-year-old boy was sent to observation home for juveniles in Satara on Tuesday for killing his eight-year-old brother in Naygaon village of Khandala area of Satara on Monday. The parents, both in their 30s of the children are natives of Bidar, Karnataka and had moved to Satara to work in the fruit gardens of a Pune-based farmer. While the elder child is in Class 5, the younger one was in Class 3, according to the police. The animosity between the two brothers was caused by preferential treatment meted out to them by their parents, according to the police. “The parents in general trusted the younger one more than the elder one. They would trust the younger one with household responsibilities like maintaining keys. This made the elder one mad, according to his statement to us. Some days before the incident, there was a fire in their house. While we do not know how the fire started, the younger one was threatening to tell their parents that the elder one had started it. That had led to a fight between them,” said police inspector UR Hajare of Shirval police station in Satara. The younger boy picked up an axe from the nearby papaya garden and was walking towards their house when the elder boy assumed that he was coming to hit him, according to the police. The 10-year-old rushed towards the younger one and in the resultant struggle, the elder one hit the 8-year-old’s head with the flat end of the axe, according to the police. “There were fractures on his skull. After the first blow, he hit him few more times during the struggle. The axe fell on the ground and the 8-year-old fell near it. The elder one then pulled at the axe, and it left a deep gash on the 8-year-old’s throat, which must have killed him,” said PI Hajaze. The series of events happened around 25-30 meter away from the house where they lived. When their parents returned in the evening, they looked for the younger one and found his body and the axe at a distance from his body. The body was at the edge of a fruit garden and the trees had not grown more than 3-4 feet long, according to the police. A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the child at Shirval police station of Satara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/10yearold-apprehended-for-killing-eight-year-old-brother-101620835123463.html

12-05-2021||Delhi||'Can't turn blind eye': HC rebukes Delhi govt as Covid-19 patients 'overcharged' by hospitals||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said the Delhi government cannot "turn a blind eye" to overcharging of COVID-19 patients by private hospitals in the city and directed it to hold a meeting of all stakeholders to arrive at a "realistic" amount so that people are not fleeced."We want this taken up on top priority," a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said and also asked the Delhi government why it had not done anything till now to address this "serious" issue."Merely because there were no complaints, the situation on the ground cannot be ignored. We agree (with the petitioner) that you cannot turn a blind eye to it."We had asked you to again speak to all stakeholders. That exercise should have been done. You could have seen the condition on the ground, spoken to all the stakeholders and then arrived at a reasonable figure so that people are not fleeced," the bench said.The court also said that once they arrive at a figure, then it has to be enforced by all means.It asked the Delhi government why it has not done anything till now despite the court "repeatedly" telling them to do something on this issue.It referred to a hospital bill, placed on record by petitioner and lawyer Abhay Gupta, in which the ICU package price was ₹30,000, but the charges for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machine, oxygen, monitors, etc were additional and to the tune of thousands of rupees per day.The bench said that prima facie the BiPAP machine, monitors, oxygen, etc all ought to have been part of the ICU package and therefore, the issue raised by Gupta of overcharging was "serious".It said that the Delhi government was right to say that the private hospitals have to be taken along, during the pandemic, "but that does not mean they can be so exorbitant".Senior advocate and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao told the court that according to his research, a whole bunch of private hospitals were refusing to admit patients, even if they had cashless insurance cover, unless they deposit ₹50,000."Some of these practices have to stop," he said.The court said that the government can have different slabs based on services offered so that there is transparency and each hospital does not charge whatever they feel like.It said it does not want to pass an order saying that all private hospitals and nursing homes have to adhere to the rates fixed by the Delhi government last year as then they would be "up in arms" and may not provide services."But then you should come up with a realistic figure," the bench said to the government.The court directed the Health Secretary to convene a meeting of a cross section of all hospitals and their associations as well as the amicus curiae to discuss the aspect of uniformity and rationalisation of charges levied by private hospitals and nursing homes.The bench said based on what transpired in the meeting, the Delhi government shall issue an order on the amounts to be charged by private healthcare institutions for treatment of COVID-19 patients.The Delhi government told the court that it will try to arrive at a formula which would satisfy all the stakeholders and would also benefit the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cant-turn-blind-eye-hc-rebukes-delhi-govt-as-covid-19-patients-overcharged-by-hospitals-101620834225881.html

The state government has identified 1.57 crore people under this group for inoculation.The state capital Ranchi, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic, has the maximum 13.9 lakh population of people between 18-44 years of age. Dhanbad, Giridih and East Singhbhum also have more than 10 lakh people under this group.Apart from the above 10 districts, the rest of them were allocated a total of 5,000 doses--2,000 doses of Covaxin and 3,000 doses Covishield.The state received 2.34 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin against its purchase orders for carrying out the third phase. After making the above allotment to the districts, the state is now left with a total of 64,000 doses--56,000 doses of Covaxin and 8,000 doses of Covishield.Meanwhile, health mandarins were sceptical about a hassle-free third phase, citing the meagre stock of vaccine doses. If proper supply chain of the vaccine is not maintained, the third phase may come to a halt, they said.Chief minister Hemant Soren, however, expressed dissatisfaction over the initial response of citizens desiring to take the jab. He said, “Only 30,000 people from across the state have registered themselves on CO-WIN app or other approved platforms to take the shot. Majority of them are from Ranchi, East Singhbhum and some other big districts.”The CM appealed to people to come forward and take the vaccine. Pre-registration is mandatory for vaccination for the 18-44 age group, and there walk-ins are not allowed for this category as of now.Though the third phase of the inoculation drive, under which citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years are eligible to take the jab, began across the country on May 1, the state could not start it due as the Centre banned the states from using its existing vaccine stock for inoculating this group.The central government asked the states to purchase the vaccine on their own directly from manufacturers for this phase. Following this, the state health department issued purchase orders (PO) to the two vaccine manufactures, demanding 25 lakh doses from each of them.Against the said orders, the state has so far received 1.34 lakh doses of Covaxin and 1 lakh doses of Covishield.Jharkhand till May 11 inoculated 2,762,184 beneficiaries, including health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens above the age of 45 with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 622,691 have also taken the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-allocates-vaccines-to-districts-for-inoculating-18-44-age-group-101620834163999.html

During the interaction with UP authorities, the DMs of Buxar and Kaimur, who also visited Balia and Ghajipur, were informed by the ‘Dom Raza’ (in-charge of cremation ghats) that 40 bodies were thrown in the river, as many people don’t perform formal cremation.

Due to spread of infection, sometimes lab staff and microbiologists also become infected, resulting in closure of labs for sanitization and fumigation. This leads to delay. Manpower has been increased at all labs for continuous work and instructions have been issued by the health department to update reports within 38 hours,” it said.Also Read| After Bihar, bodies found abandoned in Ganga in UPExperts’ committee The health department, the court was told, has constituted an experts’ committee of renowned medical professionals to revise treatment protocols from time to time, determine guidelines to be issued to reduce the infection spread and identify areas where more manpower needs to be deployed.

The patient was suffering from coronavirus and was admitted to the AIIMS Covid ward on Tuesday. “The patient suffered multi-system organ failure. Clinically, he was a suspected case of mucormycosis as his eyes were involved and nose had Mucor-like findings. However, given the patient’s serious condition, though we sent samples for fungal culture, we could not complete radiological investigations like MRI of brain to establish mucormycosis,” said Dr Kranti Bhawna, additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna, who evaluated the patient on Tuesday. Bihar has reported eight cases of mucormycosis in the last one week, seven of them at AIIMS-Patna and one at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). Among them, two are from Patna and one each from Nalanda, Saran, Gopalganj, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur. Two patients — one at AIIMS and another at IGIMS — are still battling Covid-19, while five have suffered post-Covid mucormycosis. “Most of these patients have severe diabetes and are immuno-compromised. In coronavirus, cases of mucormycosis get aggravated either because of indiscriminate use of steroids or thrombosis (clotting) of blood vessels, leading to decreased immunity. When such patients inhale the fungus present in the environment or through unclean oxygen pipeline and oxygen humidifiers, which use piped water supply, their problem gets accentuated because their capacity to fight the fungus is already reduced. The fungus enters through the nose, goes to the eye and then brain. The fatality in mucormycosis is 30%-80%,” said Dr Bhawna, currently treating five cases of mucormycosis. “I am planning to operate upon two such patients from Patna tomorrow,” she said. Dr Saurabh Karmakar, associate professor of the pulmonary medicine department at the AIIMS-Patna, is treating one such case. “We sampled the black fungus Mucor in a patient from Samastipur using fibreoptic bronchoscopy, a diagnostic modality. The patient was earlier admitted at AIIMS-Patna for 5-6 weeks and treated for coronavirus. The patient had poor diabetic control, persistent cough and was spitting blood with cough. He is now on oral medication. We have called him for follow-up in our outdoor patient department (OPD) after three weeks,” said Dr Karmakar. A 52-year-old woman from Muzaffarpur, having Covid-19 with diabetes, blood pressure and cellulitis with eye infection, admitted at IGIMS on May 6, was also diagnosed with mucormycosis. “She is being treated with anti-fungal drugs and has improved over the last three days. If required, our doctors will perform endoscopic nasal surgery, a facility we have at the institute,” said Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent of the IGIMS.Manoj Kumar, executive director of State health Society, Bihar, did not respond to phone calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-reports-first-covid-death-with-suspected-black-fungus-101620833803145.html

12-05-2021||Jaipur||Raj to float global tender for Covid vaccine, says Centre should have done this||A day before Rajasthan is expected to float a global tender to import Covid-19 vaccines, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday said it would have been much better if the Centre had procured the vaccines on behalf of the states.Rajasthan is among the 10-odd states to have announced a decision to float a global tender to procure the vaccines in view of the inability of the two vaccine manufacturers - Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India - to meet the growing demand for the vaccines.It is still unclear when vaccine manufacturers abroad would be able to supply the jabs since they are believed to be in the process of servicing orders placed by other countries much in advance.It was only last month that the Centre decided that it would only supply vaccines to states for older people and frontline workers and that states must directly procure its supplies to vaccinate people in the 18-44 age group.In two tweets on Wednesday, Gehlot renewed calls from non-NDA ruled states to review this new central policy.“Due to the lack of Covid-19 vaccine in the country, many states are taking out global tenders to get vaccines from other countries. It would have been better if the central government had taken out the global tender and bought the vaccine and distributed it in the states and later would have taken payment from the state governments,” he tweeted.Ashok Gehlot, however, underlined that people did want that the Covid vaccine, like other vaccines, should be provided free of cost by the central government. “This will lead to a system of one-stop procurement that would be better for all states”, he said.For now, the states can only try to import the three vaccines approved by the drug controller: Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik.A senior health department official said the Rajasthan government was aiming to issue the expression of interest on Thursday. The firms will be asked when at what rate, and how many vaccines they can provide. “Only those vaccines will be procured which are approved by the Drug Controller General of India, he said.He said the state has also procured oxygen concentrators through global tender. Around 62 companies in 13 countries were contacted before the government decided to source them from Russia, China, and Dubai.Recently, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had stated that there is a need to speed up vaccination to curb the spread of the virus and reduce fatality. All options should be considered for the availability of vaccines in the state. “The state will consider importing Covid-19 vaccine to ensure that the residents of Rajasthan are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said.Rajasthan officials said the shortage of vaccine has already slowed down the inoculation drive for the people in the 60-plus category. Over 52.20 lakh people in the 60-plus age group have received their first dose, of whichOnly 29% (15.07 lakh) of the 53.2 lakh people in the 60-plus age group who received their first dose have received the second dose. The remaining are running pillar to post to get vaccinated.In the 45-59 age group also, over 47.78 lakh people have been given the first dose. Of them, only 12% (5.66 lakh) have received the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/raj-to-float-global-tender-for-covid-vaccine-says-centre-should-have-done-this-101620831120593.html

12-05-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand elephant killed 9 people in five districts, faces threat to life||An elephant separated from its herd in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad forest division has allegedly killed nine people while moving across five districts since early April, said forest officials, before adding that most of the deaths were triggered by human misadventures such as chasing or pelting the animal with stones or while taking selfies with the elephant.The tusker is currently at Dumka district’s Kathikund forest where its life is in grave danger from fearful villagers, who attacked it on Tuesday with stones in an attempt to drive it away from the forest.Concerned over the situation, a wildlife lover Alok Sharma tagged a tweet to Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, requesting him to save the elephant from the villagers. Soren then directed the Dumka deputy commissioner to ensure that the elephant was released into a safe forest area.Jharkhand’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Rajiv Ranjan said, the elephant was currently in a good habitat in Dumka. “There is sufficient food and water in the forest. We hope that the elephant would cause no more damage,” Ranjan said.The forest department said it had been tracking the jumbo since the beginning of its journey from Dhanbad.“The animal has been on its migratory route. Most of the casualties that took place on its journey were due to human error. People are gathering in large numbers on its way, chasing it, taking selfies and pelting stones, which made the animal aggressive,” said a forest official, who didn’t wish to be named.He said forest department officials have been continuously appealing to people not to disturb the tusker’s movement.As per a forest department report, the elephant first killed one Ajmerun Bibi, 25, on April 8 in Dhanbad district, followed by Furkan Ansari on April 13 in Jamtara district. On May 21, it killed one Mela Soren followed by Nachon Murmu on May 23 in Dumka district. Then, it moved to Pakur district where it killed Kalu Pahariya on April 24 and Baburam Malto on May 2. Thereafter, it moved to Sahibganj district where it killed three people- Kabil Seikh on May 3, Som Murmu and Ishmatur Rahman on May 6. The elephant was again spotted in Pakur district on May 8 but caused no deaths before moving back to Dumka district.Divisional forest officer (DFO), Dumka, Sourav Chandra said villagers have been requested through loudspeakers not to go near the elephant or harass it. “Old people, women and children have been asked to remain at home, while young people have been asked to be alert,” Chandra said. “We are also asking people not to pelt stones on the animal,” he added.He said the elephant was currently happy in Kathikund forest due to availability of adequate food and water inside the forest.In 2017, a rogue elephant from Bihar killed 15 people including four in Bihar and 11 in Jharkhand. After the forest department failed to capture it, an order was issued to eliminate it, which was carried out by hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan on August 8 that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-elephant-killed-9-people-in-five-districts-faces-threat-to-life-101620816451839.html

12-05-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: Aniconic form assumes pride of place on Pune’s altar of faith||Did you know, the “numero uno” house in Pune belongs to a deity and not a person?The deity is the village guardian deity (now city guardian) of Pune, the Kasba Ganpati in Kasba peth. The inhabitants of most Indian villages and towns which have origins in a historical past practised establishing a guardian spirit or “sthan devata”. These tutelary deities act as patron, protector and guardian of the settlement and its inhabitants, and are revered by locals.The story of Kasba Ganpati starts with an allegory, in which Thakaar (one of the principal families of Pune in the 16th century) dreamed that the Lord is under the Shami tree alongside the Ambil Odha stream which originally flowed roughly along the present Bajirao road. Being a staunch devotee of Ganesha, this Brahmin searched the stream and rescued the anionic slab of stone which represented lord Ganesha.This aniconic form (tandala) of Ganesha was then established in a stone sanctum and worshipped started around the 15th-16th century CE.Traditionally, the management of the temple and priestly functions are looked after by the Thakaar family itself, even today. The earliest documentary reference to this temple is from 1613-14, and 1618. It was a part of the Ahmednangar Nizamshah territory. Haibatkhan and Malik Amber, the Nizamshahi ministers had granted Inam to Vinayak Bhat Thakaar for protection and “varshasan”, annual expenses, of the deity and temple. Pune was destroyed and abandoned after Rayarao’s attack under Murar Jagdeo’s orders in 1631 and the temple seems to have suffered a great loss. The idol, till 1637 CE, barely managed to survive in a modest temple of unbaked bricks. Revival and re-settlement of the settlement of Pune was undertaken by renovating and restoring the gram devata - Kasba Ganesha - before laying the foundations of the Lal Mahal - the residence of Rajmata Jijabai and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. They made a donation in the form of a Sanad (decree) on March 19, 1647, for this purpose to Vinayak Bhat Thakaar. The Sanad mentions the Kasba Ganpati as “Jayati Gajaanan”. There exists an older idol of Ganesha on the same premise which was in the private worship of the Thakaar family. It was buried in the niche of foundation of a house around the present temple at distance of 50ft from the sanctum.The present main idol is around 3.5-feet tall and has two diamonds decorating the eyes and a ruby in the navel of the aniconic form. The temple today is enclosed in a high-walled prakara with a wood-carved nagarkhana (drum house) acting as the entrance facade. The plan of temple has an octagonal sanctum or garbhagriha with a small rectangular pillared sabhamandapa in stone masonry. This is the oldest part of the temple. The smaller mandapa have peculiar pillars which retain the later yadava characteristic mouldings and inverted serpent capitals. The sanctum is the oldest part of the temple along with stone mandapa and houses minor modern sculptures of other deities, including nagas.It is followed by an open wooden two-storeyed mandapa with a balcony on the first floor which was typically reserved for women. Gajananrao Sadashiv Dikshit, a Dakkhani Sardar, added this typical Peshwa style sabhamandapa adorned with cusped arches, cypruss columns and banana flower motifs. The Lakde family added a pavement all around the temple and dharmshala which serves as a rest-house and place for dining and gatherings. The shikhara of the temple is done in typical Peshwa style (brick stucco) though the original painted motifs are lost. However, the changes over time, have made it difficult to distinguish other older structures.In 1877, a public cistern was built in the temple yard which was later covered. The brick prakara was built in later times along with the ornate wooden façade gateway at the entrance. During the Peshwa period, the temple enjoyed a monthly allowance of Rs10 from the Parvati temple revenues, and the expenses of the yearly celebration of the Ganpati festival on Ganesh Chaturthi were also paid from the Parvati grant.The public form of the Ganeshotsav celebration of Kasba Ganpati was started in 1896. Even today, it is the first to receive an invitation of marriage or any important function in the family life of Punekars. Various political party representatives flock to the temple during elections to kick-start their campaigns. The temple is abuzz with students seeking blessings during exam season. Throughout the day, it has a steady flow of devotees.From the Yadava period herostones depicting Ganesha as the tutelary deity, to the strong Ganpatya tradition in Chinchwad founded by Moraya Gosavi and his disciples, the history of Ganesha worship goes way back in time for Pune. No wonder, the Bhat Peshwa family too extended their patronage and became devout Ganesha followers when they made Pune their residence. Archives published by Dadasaheb Onkar inform us of a long tradition of Ganpatya (followers of Ganesha sect), which include Nanasahib Peshwa and Madhavrao Peshwa, the then prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. Kasba Ganpati is the most venerated deity for Punekars. It is called “Manacha Pahila Ganpati” (one which deserves the first respect). It, thus, has the honour of leading the Ganpati procession during the Pune Ganeshutsav every year.The Kasba Ganpati temple campus is of a modest stature, but has played significant role in the lives of Punekars. Pune suffered great crises over the centuries - droughts, political upheavals, attacks, epidemics and floods. Kasba Ganpati has stood with Punekars and boosted their morale through the high and lows of history.In an ever-expanding Pune city, things have not changed. The core of the city has been providing positivity in the face of adversity through the cultural identity of a collective space; symbolised by Kasba Ganpati. It is a perfect representation of a stable divine force existing on ancient grounds, for believers, yet an unassuming form in today’s changing, glittery world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-aniconic-form-assumes-pride-of-place-on-pune-s-altar-of-faith-101620815556212.html

We collect medicines from housing societies and provide them to those who can not afford them," Dr Marcus Ranney told ANI."The idea came when one of the family members of our staff got infected from Covid and they needed medication. As you know the medicines can be expensive. At that time there were a few people who had recovered from Covid, so we decided to take their medicines and donate them," said Dr Raina."After that, we took the help from 7-8 people of neighbouring buildings and set up a team and started this mission with the objective of helping those who can not go out to buy medicines or anyone who can't afford the Covid medicines," she added.The couple has collected 20 kilograms of unused Covid-19 medicines from recovered patients in just 10 days. These medicines will be donated to the primary health care centres in rural districts across India for the timely treatment of the underprivileged, who are infected Covid-19."We have now 100 buildings that are sending medicines to us. We are a team of eight people and of course, the volunteers in different buildings. Last week, we collected 20 kilograms of medicines, which have been packaged and given to our NGO partners," said Dr Marcus Ranney.Meds for More collects all kinds of unused medicines such as antibiotics, Fabiflu, pain relief, steroids, inhalers, vitamins, antacids, among others, that are being used to treat Covid-19 patients. Additionally, they are also collecting basic medicinal equipment like pulse oximeters and thermometers.With growing awareness about the initiative, residents from neighbouring buildings have started volunteering to collect medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctor-couple-in-mumbai-collects-unused-covid-19-meds-to-help-needy-patients-101620812311955.html

No case of mucormycosis has been reported in Himachal Pradesh so far. Also read: Foreign aid for Covid-19 swiftly cleared for states, says Centre“Such infections have been seen where steroids are used without indication or are being used in self-medication by home-isolated patients or due to the use of a higher dose for a long period,” state director, National Health Mission, Dr Nipun Jindal said on Wednesday. In this backdrop, the state clinical committee has issued a treatment protocol for the judicious use of steroids in Covid patients. The protocol includes defined doses for Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms and severe symptoms and for home-isolation patients. The committee has recommended that in home-isolated patients, inhaled steroids such as Budesonide may be taken via metered doses inhaler/dry powder inhalers at a dose of 800 mcg twice a day for five days. However, it should be taken only if fever or cough persists after five days of disease. 30 dedicated Covid health centres set up Dr Jindal said a total of 1,40,759 cases of Covid-19 infection have been reported in the state to date. To manage the upsurge of cases in the second wave, efforts have been made to increase treatment facilities in the state. As on May 11, Himachal Pradesh has 30 dedicated Covid health centres.

12-05-2021||Lucknow||Migrant worker dies at Covid counter in UP hospital battling ‘systemic failure’||A 35-year old migrant worker from Gorakhpur district, Rambadan Sahani died at the Covid patient registration counter at Lucknow’s BRD Medical College on Monday, triggering outrage at alleged apathy of the hospital staff.Narrating his unending ordeal leading to Rambadan’s death, his brother Vishnu Sahani said since no ambulance was available, he brought Rambadan to the medical college on a motorcycle. Once there, the medical college could not provide even a stretcher to carry him to the ward, he alleged.The video of Vishnu carrying Rambadan on his shoulder in the medical college went viral on social media.“I carried my ailing brother on shoulder from the gate of the medical college to the Covid patient registration counter. When I told the medical officers about the critical condition of my brother, they asked me to wait in the holding area of the hospital for admission. I told them to arrange oxygen as my brother was facing difficulty in breathing, but again, I was told to wait. My brother collapsed near the registration counter and breathed his last,” Vishnu said, summing up struggles of commoners, seeking access to the state healthcare system during the present Covid crisis.He said even his brother’s death didn’t change the hospital’s “insensitive” attitude. They took two hours to wrap the body according to Covid protocols after Vishnu and other attendants at the hospital protested against the administration. “We had to give ₹2,000 to the ambulance owners to transport the body home,” Vishnu said.BRD Medical College’s principal in charge Dr Pawan Pradhan said an inquiry has been ordered into alleged negligence apart from a notice served to the hospital staff for not providing a stretcher to the patient. “The employees have been told to be sensitive toward the patients brought to the hospital for admission,” he said.Rambadan Sahni worked as a daily wage labourer in Hyderabad. He returned home on May 6 and was suffering from fever as well as breathing problems.Under pressure from rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic since late March, hospitals in Uttar Pradesh have struggled with oxygen and medicine supplies and ICU beds among other logistical issues. The state government however claims that the situation was improving with several Covid level facilities being fitted with oxygenated beds and launch of a door to door survey in rural areas to identify Covid cases early. However, opposition parties have accused the state government of refusing to acknowledge the magnitude of the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/migrant-worker-dies-at-covid-patient-registration-counter-battling-systemic-failure-101620813631446.html
12-05-2021||Delhi||DU colleges conduct practical exams amid Covid’s second wave, students distraught||The Delhi University recently issued a notice announcing cancellation of online classes and postponement of examinations for all students. But, some students of the varsity have now claimed that their colleges have gone ahead and conducted practical exams, overlooking the mental and physical health of the youngsters and their families. So far, three colleges have conducted practicals, after the university issued the notice, and students from all three colleges have verified so with deep angst in their voices. Many students feel distraught since they claim that their teachers didn’t consult them before conducting the practical exams. “We weren’t even asked if we are in a situation to sit for virtual exams right now! When we told our teachers that we are not a position to give exams, she informed us that they don’t have a choice in the matter. The second wave of Covid has left many students scouring for basic health care; I was tending to my parents who were both Covid positive and that’s when I got to know that I had to appear for exams as well... I wasn’t in the right frame of mind, but what could have I done,” says a student of Daulat Ram College, on condition of anonymity. A student of Shri Ram College of Commerce rues: “When the teachers are turning a deaf ear to us, who do we go to? My whole family is Covid positive, and I have to take care of everyone. Shall I save lives of my family members or give practical exams?” At Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, students have been asked to submit proofs to the college, if they have tested Covid positive. This, students say isn’t possible since test results are delayed at labs across Delhi-NCR due to the sudden increase in number of new cases during the second wave of Covid. “Despite every student asking the teacher to cancel or postpone the practical exams, our college conducted them. Many students were affected by Covid in our batch, but our teachers asked them for reports to show that they were Covid positive. The students have themselves not received the reports, so how would they have showed them to the college authorities? There’s lack of trust from the authorities, and this lead to the stress of us having to appear for our practical exams even amid such gruelling time,” says a student from the college, on condition of anonymity. Many who have practical exam dates approaching, have tried to convince their teachers to postpone them, but to no avail. “I hope that everyone is safe in these times but the situation is very difficult in the whole country, and in Delhi everyone know what’s the scenario. It’s really difficult for us students to prepare for any test at this time. The practicals should therefore be postponed for at least a few days,” opines a student of Hansraj College. When contacted, the individual college authorities didn’t respond to our query. On the other hand, professor DS Rawat, Dean (Examinations) at DU, told us that the university has given the right to every college to postpone practical exams, taking into account their students and faculty’s situation. “Online exams have been postponed and not the practical exams. So colleges have been given the liberty to conduct and upload marks of practical examination and internal assessment, according to their convenience. We understand that these are challenging times for everyone. Therefore, if 70% of students in a college say that they are unable to give practical exams, then the principal of that college has the right to postpone the practical exams. We might extend the date for submission of these marks from colleges, as we have compassion for everyone’s situation. Students are welcome to reach out to the authorities and raise their concerns; we are here to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-colleges-conduct-practical-exams-amid-covid-s-second-wave-students-distraught-101620812915660.html

Within 12 hours of his arrival in the jail, Pappu Yadav sat on hunger strike demanding clean drinking water and hygienic conditions in the jail’s toilet and washroom. He also tweeted on Wednesday morning that jail authorities were not providing him with proper medical treatment for an old wound in one of his legs.Last night Yadav pleaded before the Madhepura court to send him to medical college and sadar hospital on medical grounds. He also cited his petition pending before the Patna high court challenging the non-bailable warrant issued against him in the kidnapping case. However, the court decided to send him to judicial custody.While he was pleading his case before the court through video conference, several of his supporters staged a protest outside the court in defiance of the lockdown norms. Earlier in the day, hundreds of his supporters had blocked the national highway in Vaishali when the police was escorting him through the district on the way to Madhepura. And a few hours before that, Patna police had to lathicharge workers of his JAP party at Gandhi Maidan, where they were protesting his arrest. Yadav is the president of a local political outfit named Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik).Patna police had arrested Yadav on Tuesday morning for violation of Covid-19 containment protocols during the state-wide lockdown. Hours later, he was given bail at Pirbahore police station on the condition that he will make himself available whenever required during the investigation of the case.Patna police then handed over his custody to Madhepura police, which had declared him absconding in the 1989 abduction case. Udakishunganj sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Satish Kumar said the Madhepura court had cancelled Yadav’s bail-bond and issued non-bailable warrant against him in September 2020 and on March 22, a property attachment warrant was issued against him by the court.Yadav’s wife Ranjit Ranjan, a former Congress MP from Supaul, said she “feared” for her husband’s life and alleged a “big conspiracy” behind his arrest. She said she will hold the state’s national democratic government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar responsible if anything untoward happened to Yadav in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pappu-yadav-starts-hunger-strike-in-bihar-s-supaul-jail-seeking-hygienic-conditions-101620809671155.html
12-05-2021||Patna||Bihar hospitals in trouble over sexual assault on woman, drug mismanagement||A ward boy of a private hospital in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district was arrested late Tuesday night over allegations of sexually harassing a Covid-19 patient’s wife. The said hospital has also been found guilty of mismanagement in a probe by district authorities, said police.Bhagalpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nitasha Gudiya confirmed the arrest of hospital’s ward boy Jyoti Kumar after taking cognisance of a video narrating the woman’s ordeal, which went viral on social media. The woman had also alleged medical negligence by the Bhagalpur hospital. That’s not all, she had also accused a doctor of a private hospital in Patna of sexually abusing her when her husband was shifted to the state capital for treatment.The SSP said following her complaint, a joint team of Bhagalpur administration and the state drug department started a probe into the conduct of the Bhagalpur hospital. The three-member team comprising senior ADM (additional district magistrate) Triloki Nath Singh, drug inspector Dayanand Prasad and assistant drug inspector Pradip Kumar found many irregularities and seized internal records of treatment of the woman’s husband. During their probe, they also found that the hospital’s drug store was illegally selling medicines given as samples to physicians apart from expired drugs.A scrutiny of the woman’s husband’s treatment record also revealed that the hospital procured three vials of Remdesivir injection for his treatment but administered only two vials on April 18 and 20.They also found another case of a missing vial of Remdesivir injection, procured for treatment of one Mamata Devi, who was admitted to the hospital on April 28 and died on May 3. The hospital’s claim that the remaining vials had been handed over to the patients’ kin were denied by the two families. The findings assume significance in the backdrop of rampant black marketing of Remdesivir injections, used for treating severe Covid cases.Senior ADM Triloki Nath Singh said the committee will recommend cancellation of the licence given to the hospital’s drug store.Meanwhile, the woman has said she will also lodge a formal complaint against a Patna hospital, where her husband died on May 8 after he was shifted from the Bhagalpur hospital following deterioration in his condition on April 26. She said a doctor at the hospital touched her inappropriately several times during his visits to the ICU. She said she didn’t raise her voice then fearing for her husband’s life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-hospitals-in-trouble-over-sexual-assault-on-woman-drug-mismanagement-101620805771000.html

Amid heightened stress and exhaustion, those on home nursing duty are burning the midnight oil as there are no fixed work hours; since most are booked for 24-hour care for patients. On International Nurses Day (May 12), some of the Delhi-NCR based home nurses share their tales of struggle. Often spending days with one patient, taking care of all their needs, can leave many worried about getting infected themselves. “But the day I joined this profession, I forgot the idea of fear,” says Imran Khan, a home nurse on duty in Faridabad. He adds, “Some patients recover in a few days; some take 15 days, or even more. It does get tiring; taking care of another person is a tough job, and it gets hard when someone’s health takes a turn for the worst. I have to manage everything - keeping their vitals stable, getting them hospitalised. But the time is such, I don’t want to say no to helping people,” says Khan, from Tejas Care24, as he tends to Covid positive patients while staying away from his family for days together. Their dedication and individualised care is making home nurses a preferred choice among many Delhiites, especially for the elderly in the house. “On an average, we get 20-25 calls every day, from people looking for nurses to take care of their family members,” says Fahimuddin, a resident of Uttam Nagar, who is helping provide nursing staff services to Delhiites. “We administer IV drips and medication as per the prescription, assist in pain management and keep an eye on the vitals of the patients. Nurses on home duty have to take care of it all! And people are preferring to isolate at home, especially during this time, since the hospitals are not only charging a lot but also have limited staff, whereas the services provided by home care nursing staff are available at comparatively subsidised prices and personalised attention.”Staying in close proximity to coronavirus patients is risky, but that hasn’t deterred many of the nurses for their emotion to serve the humanity has been their guarding angel. Ashley, a home nurse in Delhi, who is currently caring for a Covid patient, says, “During my first duty as a home nurse, I got fever, and remained scared for a few days until my health improved. The constant fear of getting infected is both emotionally and physically draining. While we do our best to take care of the patients, the risk of going home and infecting our families is ever present!” Many a times, the risk becomes reality, posing gruelling challenges to these nurses. A home nurse shares that she tested positive soon after visiting a Covid positive patient in Gurugram. “I was with the patient for an hour, and caught the virus in spite of following all the safety measures. I tested positive and soon after my husband too got Covid, and we immediately isolated ourselves at home. We’ve made full recovery, but this hasn’t been the case for quite a few in the health care industry. I’m, even today, constantly afraid of infecting my family, now that I know that people can get reinfected. But, I continue to be on duty because that comes first,” says the nurse on condition of anonymity. The magnitude of the risk factor increases manifold when people lie about their Covid status to book a home nurse. Dr Mukesh Kumar, who runs nursing bureau, Om Nursing Home, in the Capital, says, “We follow all safety measures — PPE Kits, masks, gloves, and sanitisers are provided to all the nurses who are on duty. We’re extremely professional when providing services, with no exploitation of those in need. But, we’ve had instances where people didn’t inform us that the request was for a Covid patient! They make excuses that the patient only had fever and hence they don’t have a report either. This puts our staff and us at peril, even when we are doing all that we can, and at great personal cost... People should spare a thought about nurses as well.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/international-nurses-day-going-strong-to-take-care-of-those-in-need-101620804758473.html

A day after saying the city's Covaxin stock was about to get over in one day Covishield's in another four days, the Delhi government said it had to shut down 125 vaccination centres catering to citizens in the 18-44 age group on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bharat-biotech-says-no-extra-covaxin-for-delhi-cites-govt-directive-sisodia-101620802873318.html

12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Blood donation dips amid Covid lockdown in Himachal||Amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals in Himachal Pradesh are facing a shortage of blood. Blood donation camps that were slated for the coming weeks have been deferred due to the lockdown and the suspension of public transport to contain the spread of coronavirus. Nine such camps were to be held in Shimla by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), students and welfare groups to meet the requirement of the three main hospitals, namely the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC), Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Kamla Nehru Hospital. Also read: 348,421 fresh Covid-19 cases, 4,205 deaths reported in India in 24 hours“As of now, there are 300 units of the blood available with us. It’s enough for a week as the demand has also dropped to 50 units a day with elective surgeries on hold. But we fear that in the coming days, there may be a shortage,” says Sandeep Malhotra, the head of transfusion medicine at IGMC. Camps to be held in rural areas With blood donation camps being cancelled in towns, the NGOs are trying to motivate youngsters from the rural areas to volunteer for the cause. “We are organising a camp at Sairi near Jutogh,” says Ajay Srivastva, the founder of Umang Foundation that collected 800 blood units despite the lockdown last year. Sarabjeet Singh Bobby, the founder of Almighty Blessing, that runs free langars and ambulance services in Shimla, says: “We offer free pick-up and drop facility to people keen on donating blood.” Gap post-vaccination down to 14 days Besides the lockdown, the misconception related to abstaining from blood donation for 28 days post-vaccination is also being seen as a reason for reluctance among donors. Governor Bandaru Dattatreya had earlier notified that a person can’t donate blood till 28 days after vaccination but now he has reduced the period to 14 days. Red Cross appeals to people to donate blood Himachal Pradesh State Red Cross Hospital welfare section chairperson Dr Sadhna Thakur has appealed to people, particularly youngsters, going for the Covid vaccination to come forward for blood donation. “Blood donation before vaccination will help save many precious lives. During the pandemic, vaccination is proving to be effective. The vaccination of youngsters aged between 18 and 44 years will be rolled out soon and stocking blood before it would help in saving lives in future,” she said. Interested blood donors can contact the state Red Cross on phone numbers 0177-2621868 and 2629969.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/blood-donation-dips-amid-covid-lockdown-in-himachal-101620799650555.html

12-05-2021||Lucknow||To tackle third wave, we are doing whatever is possible, says UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh||As Uttar Pradesh (UP) battles the devastating second wave of Covid-19 infection, cabinet minister and state government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh, speaks to Hindustan Times on a variety of issues, including party lawmakers writing letters on inept handling of crisis, challenge of testing in villages, vaccinating rural population and state’s preparation to handle imminent third wave.Excerpts: There is a feeling that had we been alert, death and scale of disease could have been minimised. Experts had been predicting that the Covid first wave would be followed by a second wave and yet the warning appeared to have been drowned in a false sense of victory over the virus? The second wave was known but its impact or severity wasn’t. So, drawing from the first wave, we augmented the health infrastructure, scaled it up three times. We thought it would be enough. But as it turned out, the severity was many times more than what we had anticipated. This caused problems but as I said, there weren’t any predictive patterns to the severity of the wave. So, is the view that UP could have minimised death and spread of disease misplaced? How do you answer this? I can only say that the government has been doing its best. The chief minister tested positive and continued to work despite being in isolation. Yet, your own party lawmakers have been posting letters, videos and posts that showcase how they have been helpless against the system. Some didn’t get bed, some flagged faulty Covid testing? They are showing the mirror to their government, isn’t it? In a democracy, constructive criticism is always welcome. No harm in writing letters or making suggestions. But let us remember that the ruling lawmakers are part of the government. They should contribute to resolving the problem rather than creating one. There is a view that the panchayat polls contributed in a big way in the spread of infection in villages. The government claims that it was the court’s decision. However, when the court ordered lockdown, the government moved Supreme Court arguing a complete lockdown would affect livelihoods. It’s a fact that the matter went to the court twice. But I wouldn’t confuse between the two. One, is a constitutional aspect, the other is an administrative matter. Our role was to follow two Constitutional authorities – the court and the election commission. We alone didn’t contest those polls. All the parties did. As far as lockdown matter was concerned, that was the administrative part, and we were clear that we wanted to save both lives and livelihood. But now, that the virus has arrived in villages and is turning aggressive, don’t you think this is the government’s biggest challenge yet, that of saving villages? We have 97,000 revenue villages and over 70,000 nigrani samitis and through them we are aggressively testing, tracing and treating patients in rural UP. We have provided the test teams 10 lakh medical kits; 10 lakh antigen test kits and all 822 community health centres are being given 20 oxygen concentrators. To maintain proper oxygen supply chain, 60 tankers have been added to the 30 existing tankers and keeping Covid’s third wave prediction in mind we have also floated a global tender for tankers. How do you inoculate the villages even as vaccine shortage has hit urban centres? To maintain steady flow of inoculation we have floated global tender for four crore vials and also placed orders of 1 crore vials with Indian manufacturers. But why did the government stop private hospitals and centres from vaccinating people? Surely government centres alone won’t be able to inoculate the whole of UP. We didn’t stop anyone. The government of India has come up with a guideline as it has given nearly 50% quota to the state. The state now has to cater to the people through government centres while private centres would be free to purchase vaccines either through open market or directly through manufacturers. We are seeing air force planes taking off with oxygen tankers to fast-track oxygen supply to the state. There are trains that are regularly coming to the state with liquid oxygen. But where is this oxygen going as the crisis still continues? All these oxygen tankers have to be off loaded at the right place. Not in Hazratganj, right? In the last 10 to 15 days things have improved. About two weeks back, the oxygen intake was about 300 metric tonnes. Since then, 900 to 1000 metric tonnes of oxygen have been supplied. There is an oxygen audit happening which is assessing oxygen requirement of hospitals because oxygen requirement continues to vary on a patient. If someone wants audit details, we will share that also, once the exercise is over. Are we better prepared for the speculative third Covid wave? Well, between Covid I to Covid II, our health infrastructure, including beds, were scaled up by three times across all three hospitals – from Covid level 1 to level 2 and level 3 facilities. In that period also, we also set up an oxygen manufacturing plant by Inox in western UP. There is no mathematical calculation about the challenge that speculative Covid third wave would bring. We are doing whatever is possible. The chief minister has appointed a committee of medical experts to advise the government. The CM has spoken of need to scale up paediatric ICUs ahead of the speculative third wave. Certainly, we are doing everything. From paediatric beds to nursing staff, attendants and ward boys. Even as we speak, 25,000 level 1 beds are being converted into oxygen beds. We are creating stronger cold storage facility. So, you think your government would be able to save our kids from Covid 3? Well, if you remember how the situation was with the JE and AES. For nearly 40 years, you well know the number of children who were dying in 38 districts of the state. So, we protected our children, didn’t we? We are adding more oxygen plants. Soon we will reveal our oxygen manufacturing policy. What is this policy going to be like? Details would come later but there would be incentives for the investors wanting to help set up oxygen plants in the state. Already 54 investors have announced intent, more are coming. The chief minister has now tasked the lawmakers with keeping track of Covid positive people in their constituencies No, the lawmakers won’t track Covid patients. They will stay connected with them as after all the patients are people of their constituencies too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/to-tackle-third-wave-we-are-doing-whatever-is-possible-says-up-minister-sidharth-nath-singh-101620796590190.html
12-05-2021||Patna||Bihar farmers crush their produce to protest against low tomato prices||A group of farmers in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district destroyed their harvest of tomatoes and other green vegetables for the second consecutive day on Tuesday to register their protest against low prices, not covering even their costs. They claimed to have destroyed crops worth lakhs of rupees grown over an area of 50 ‘bighas’ of land. One ‘bigha’ is equal to around 35,000 square feet of land in the district.The farmers of Ganj Bazaar and its adjoining areas in the district claimed their tomato crops were not even fetching the wholesale rate of ₹1 per kilogram and some other green vegetables were selling for less than ₹2/kg. They claimed the cost of bringing tomatoes to the market alone is ₹4 to 5/kg.“I spent ₹15,000 per bigha to produce tomatoes and now I am not even getting ₹5000 for my produce per bigha. We have been forced to sell our produce for less than ₹1 per kg. Hence, we don’t have any other option left but to destroy our produce,” said Shambhu Prasad, a farmer, who claimed to have destroyed tomatoes worth ₹2 lakh.The drop in demand of tomatoes and vegetables in Muzaffarpur is primarily due to poor off take of stocks by traders from different states due to movement restrictions and lockdowns clamped to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Rajendra Prasad, another farmer from the Minapur block said Ganj Bazar was one of the biggest vegetable-producers and marketing venues in north Bihar. “We used to send 20 to 25 trucks of tomatoes to other places every day from here. But the numbers have now been limited to two to three trucks a day.”He added that the estimated cost of growing tomatoes on 10 bigha land is around ₹2 lakh. Another farmer Sanjay Sah said he was also thinking of destroying his produce of tomatoes grown on around 10 bighas of land. “I had never imagined in my dreams that I would ever destroy my produce with my own hands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-farmers-crush-their-produce-to-protest-against-low-tomato-prices-101620794490817.html

12-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The lockdown Ramzan||The forever-optimistic Nashir Ahmed Khan in gloom? Impossible, you would think. But the second surge in the coronavirus pandemic has changed everything.“I’m badhal (in bad shape),” he says, “everyone here is badhal, everything is down.” A biscuit seller outside the imposing Jama Masjid in Gurugram’s Sadar Bazaar, Mr Khan, 71, is talking on phone. This late morning he is standing by his two carts, he says, waiting for the few customers who might drop by. During the ongoing lockdown in the Millennium City, shops in this part of Sadar Bazaar are allowed to function from 6am to 11am, he informs.In the final week of the fasting month of Ramzan, the area around the mosque traditionally teems with shoppers. But this ain’t a normal year, and Mr Khan agrees to give a sense of the place.His on-the-ground survey starts with the stairs of the Jama Masjid, that in previous Ramzans (not last year’s though, because of the first lockdown) would be taken over by fasting people sitting there in lethargy, waiting for the iftari hour to break the fast. (The pic above dates from early last year.)“Nobody’s on the Masjid’s stairs, not even a cat,” Mr Khan reports curtly. Even Raja bhai isn’t there—the elderly man would usually be heard before he was seen, always sitting on the same side of the stairs, regularly breaking into most heartfelt devotional songs.Khurshid Ahmad’s kebab stall, though, is open. “But it’s only stocked with feni,” says Mr Khan, referring to a milk-based dish often consumed in this sacred month.All the mosque-facing stalls that would sell trinkets, dates, caps and scarves throughout the year are closed. “Except for one man who, as I see, is selling kurta pyjamas.”The area’s public park—the Masjid Udayan—that would be dotted with resting labourers is empty, reports Mr Khan.“After one hour, at 11, I’ll also go back to my room (in nearby Yaseen Plaza),” he says. “Nobody is earning much... I’m able to afford only dal and chawal.”Even so, one thing hasn’t changed. No matter how hot or freezing it might get, Mr Khan always dresses up in a safari suit. “Yes, I’m wearing my safari,” he confirms, breaking into his trademark laughter, infectious even on mobile.And is he holding a cup of that milky sweet bazaar chai, as he always does?“What are you saying,” exclaims the biscuit seller. “All the chai shops are closed.”He concludes the eye-witness account with his customary farewell salutation—“God bless you too much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-lockdown-ramzan-101620773488092.html
12-05-2021||Delhi||Nehru Planetarium director Dr Nandivada Rathnasree dies of Covid-19||Notable astronomy communicator and director of the Nehru Planetarium, Nandivada Rathnasree, 57, died on Sunday after being infected with Covid. Rathnasree, who joined the planetarium in 1996 as a senior educator and became its director in 1999, has been credited with several new initiatives and projects during her long stint.Anuj Sinha, former director of the National Council for Science and Technology Communication said that she was devoted to her role. “She ensured that the number of outreach events multiplied by several times. She would work on weekends, day and night to ensure astronomy reached people. She brought a lot of life to the subject. I was also in science outreach so she was a great ally to work with. She tried to make sure that the wonders of the sky are seen, appreciated and understood,” he said.Her husband Patrick Dasgupta is a faculty member at the Department of Physics and Astrophysics at Delhi University.Rathnasree was also a member of the Astronomical Society of India, which expressed its condolences Tuesday.“An avid astronomy communicator and accomplished pulsar astronomer, she was pivotal in most astronomy outreach projects of ASI in the last two decades. When ASI formally set up its Public Outreach and Education Committee (POEC) in 2014, Rathnasree was the unanimous choice to be its first chair and she has been a part of the POEC ever since,” the body said in its statement.The society also remembered Ratnasree’s notable contributions during her career. “Till just a fortnight ago, she was involved in organising ‘Astro Adda’ a fortnightly online discussion session with the students. In early May, she caught the infection, which quickly overwhelmed her,” the statement said.During her years in Delhi, she was a focal point for the amateur astronomy community in and around the Capital.Union minister of culture sent condolences to her family. “Extremely saddened to learn about the unfortunate demise of Dr N. Rathnasree, Director of Nehru Planetarium under @_NMML_ passed away on sunday. Heartfelt condolences to the family & prayers for the departed soul & God to provide strength to the bereaved family,” the ministry tweeted.Ramdas Iyer, curator, National Science Centre, said her death was a huge loss for students and the scientific community. “Rathnashree was one of the best in positional astronomy.

12-05-2021||Delhi||Black marketing: Court rap for no price cap, shoddy probe||A Delhi court on Tuesday questioned the authorities for arresting people importing and selling oxygen concentrators at a rate higher than the MRP, saying that the government had itself not capped the prices of these products.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Arun Kumar Garg, while hearing the bail pleas of Matrix Cellular’s CEO Gaurav Khanna and its vice president Gaurav Suri, also came down heavily on the police for arresting the accused without any evidence.“Why should the forces of demand-supply not apply where the government has left it... government has not regulated. Is doing business an offence?” the court remarked. The magistrate said the maximum charge that can be levelled was of unfair trade practices.Also read | HC: Take steps to stop hoarding, black marketingThe judge said that arrests should not be made to appease the high court, which ordered action. He noted that the “state has yet not regulated” the price despite a direction by the high court to cap the prices.The court pulled up police for “a pathetic” investigation. “First you (police) arrest and then start investigation. It’s a pathetic situation…We will not be instrumental in harassing somebody,” it remarked.Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, appearing for the state, told the court that the accused “hatched a conspiracy” to illegally make money. The accused’s counsels, meanwhile , argued that the prices were fixed after considering costs incurred. They said that all duties were paid in the import of the concentrators. The court reserved its order for Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/black-marketing-court-rap-for-no-price-cap-shoddy-probe-101620772156236.html

Additional sessions judge Sumit Dass said that Kalra’s anticipatory bail will be placed before the district and sessions judge who will decide which court will hear the plea.“Bail application placed before the district judge south east at 10am tomorrow; they will send it to the concerned court.

12-05-2021||Delhi||Of 91 held for cyber frauds, most from outside Delhi||A grocer from Rajasthan’s Bharatpur, an unemployed man from Jharkhand’s capital Ranchi, and a cellphone dealer from West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas were among 91 people arrested by Delhi Police for allegedly duping Delhi-NCR residents by promising to supply Covid-19 medicines or medical essentials such as oxygen cylinders and concentrators.The Delhi Police on Tuesday said several cyber fraudsters from outside Delhi were involved in duping city residents online, taking advantage of the panic triggered by the rise in cases and the shortage of medical essentials.At a press conference on Tuesday, police said that they found that some of the SIM cards used by the alleged fraudsters to receive payments were registered in states other than Delhi.In most cases, such fraudsters contacted their intended victims after seeing SOS messages on social media for medicines and other supplies. Promising to deliver these essentials, the fraudsters would demand an online payment, and once the money was transferred, would switch off their phones, police said.Police have so far blocked 810 SIM cards used in such crimes.Also read | Covid-19 in Delhi: Dip in cases continues, deaths cross 20,000Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said most of the SIM cards were registered in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Bihar.Separately, police have also frozen 214 bank accounts, a majority of them in the states mentioned above, which collectively had ₹53.6 lakh in them. Through a tie-up with caller identification app, True Caller, police also identified 168 cellphones numbers and tagged them as “Covid spam numbers”.“Till date, we received 910 such complaints on our helpline, email and the national cyber crime portal. A total of 372 FIRs have been registered and 91 people arrested. The analysis of the cases indicated that the frauds were being committed by people from different states. The police chiefs of those states were contacted and the cyber teams have started work. Our investigation has revealed that while a SIM card is registered in one state, the fraud is being perpetrated in another state. The bank accounts of these fraudsters are also spread across the country,” said Biswal.Police officers,who were part of cases in which the arrests were made, said that while cyber criminals are seeking out people who seek help on social media, some of the fraudsters are out-of-job con men who have found a lucrative way to exploit people.One officer said most of the people in whose names the bank accounts were opened had no idea about the frauds.“The complaints on our helpline have reduced of late. There are 20 teams on the ground in several states, and a substantial number of arrests are likely in the coming days,” Biswal said.Records seen by HT show that in the last few days, police have received fewer than 20 calls reporting such frauds.On Monday, the control room received six calls, while on Sunday, there were 17. Distress calls peaked in the first four days of May -- 59 on May 1, 104 on May 2, 85 on May 3, and 69 on May 4.“We have also released an advisory on our social media handles, urging people not to fall victim to such fraudsters... We urge people to call on 112, 011-23469900 or 155260 in case any such person approaches them with promises of help,” Biswal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/of-91-held-for-cyber-frauds-most-from-outside-delhi-101620771550852.html

Of the total doses received, 330,000 doses have been used. Currently, we have around 219,000 doses in stock and all of them are Covishield. Going by the current rate of beneficiary turnout, the Covishield stock should last three more days. Also, 266,690 doses of Covishield are likely to arrive in Delhi today (Tuesday). That should last for another six days,” said AAP MLA Atishi, in the government’s live-streamed bulletin on vaccination, adding: “However, more than 125 centres that offer Covaxin will be closed now.

12-05-2021||Delhi||Ensure controlled opening of city: HC to Delhi govt||Observing that the government encouraged people to lower their guard by holding “elections and melas”, the Delhi high court on Tuesday said there should be a “controlled opening” of the lockdown in the national capital whenever it happens so that the state is in a position to deal with the rising number of Covid cases.“We can’t open up only to let people die due to lack of facilities,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli suggested.“The state has also encouraged it (letting down of guard by citizens). We have had elections..We have had melas,” the bench remarked after advocate Gautam Narayan, additional public prosecutor for the Delhi government, said that state (in general) is equally responsible for the current situation as they let their guard down.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with many hospitals, had sought directions to the Centre and Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in hospitals and nursing homes.The observation ensued from the submission of senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for the Delhi government, who said that he cannot imagine a situation when lockdown restrictions are lifted and the city returns to normal.The number of infections and positivity rate has been declining for 10 days now, with Delhi reporting 12,481 cases on Tuesday. This is the lowest daily tally the city has recorded in almost a month since April 12, Delhi government data shows.Also read | Govt strengthens 1031 helpline with more staffDuring the hearing, the court expressed its displeasure over the Delhi government’s incorrect statement on May 10 that 250 beds in the new dedicated Covid facility in Dwarka -- Indira Gandhi Hospital -- were already operational. “It was not fair...to give incorrect facts,” the bench said, adding that “the newspapers of Saturday said 250 beds in the hospital were operationalised, “but not a single bed has been occupied till date”.The remarks were made after the Delhi government apologised for making an incorrect statement on May 10 about the Covid facility in the hospital.The bench was informed by senior advocate Mehra that for want of oxygen cylinders and concentrators the beds have not yet been operationalised. He submitted that 150 beds will be operationalised during the day and another 100 will be ready by Wednesday.During the hearing, the court also suggested augmenting the plasma bank and said that the Delhi government should encourage people to donate.Mehra said that time and again requests have been made by the highest level but people have been apprehensive.Amicus curiae senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao informed the court that the response from the plasma registration sometimes takes hours.He also alleged that sometimes phone numbers get leaked and the person gets fake messages.The matter will be heard on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ensure-controlled-opening-of-city-hc-to-delhi-govt-101620770776010.html
12-05-2021||City||Govt strengthens 1031 helpline with more staff||The Delhi government has carried out a revamp of its Covid-19 grievance redressal system, and released a centralised helpline number - 1031 - for those in need of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines, among other things.Though this number was already in use, the services associated with it have been increased, officials said.“Over the last one year of the pandemic, there were more than 20 government helpline numbers issued from time to time. Instead of releasing a new number, it was decided to strengthen the number 1031, publicise it, and ensure no call goes unattended,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.On Monday, the Delhi government doubled the number of lines on the helpline from 100 to 200, and increased the call centre executives running these lines from 30 to 60.To ensure all calls are answered and the correct information is disseminated, the Delhi government has also deployed senior officers at the call centre located in Noida.The officers have been stationed in three shifts to ensure round-the-clock monitoring.Also read | Will float global tenders for vaccines soon: Manish SisodiaWhile officials did not detail the average number of calls the helpline received earlier, they said the revamp paid off almost instantly as the helpline received 2,004 calls on Monday.“Some people had stopped calling at this number because it was hard to get through. So, this is the highest number of calls 1031 has received in recent times,” a second official said.Of the 2,004 calls, 721 were related to Covid-19 vaccination, 225 were for hospital bed availability, 195 callers enquired about oxygen cylinder refilling or procurement, 135 sought tele-consultation with doctors, 93 were for last rites of deceased patients, and about 635 fell in the “others” category.Apart from 1031, people can also directly call the control rooms of the 11 districts of Delhi. Delhi government’s ambulance services can availed by dialling 102 or 1099, and the authorities have also set up a dedicated helpline -- 011-22304568 -- for pregnant and lactating women suffering from Covid-19.“The entire staff has been trained and shifts of eight hours each have been scheduled for 24x7 operation. A number of calls also come from people seeking doctors for medical advice. For that, we have sourced the time table of government doctors for tele-consultation from each district and we direct the caller directly to these doctors. Our new team is fully geared up and we hope that no caller is dissatisfied with the call experience,” said the first officer quote above.Inside the privately owned call centre in Noida, each executive has been given a common set of frequently asked questions (FAQ) to answer callers.“The FAQ list is constantly evolving, we are adding new things and making it more relevant as more calls come in. If some information is sought which is not in the FAQ, then our officers stationed there directly have been given the right to call the nodal officer concerned and address the grievance,” the official said, explaining the evolving process to improve grievance redressal.Over the past few weeks, especially between April 18 and May 5, when Covid-19 cases had peaked in the city and people were running from pillar to post for oxygen beds and cylinders, HT had repeatedly pointed out the need for a helpline number and how the government had several numbers which were either not publicised or were unresponsive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-strengthens-1031-helpline-with-more-staff-101620770326095.html
12-05-2021||Delhi||IGI airport’s terminal 2 to shut from May 17||The Delhi airport’s Terminal 2, or T2, will be shut for flight operations from May 18 in the wake of falling passenger footfall and fewer flights due to the ongoing second national wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, officials aware of the development said on Tuesday.All flight operations will now shift to Terminal 3 (T3), which will remain the only operational terminal at Delhi’s airport, the officials said.The recent suspension of international flights between India and some countries has also led to a fall in the number of passengers at the airport, forcing the authorities to take the decision, the officials added.After last year’s lockdown, when the Indira Gandhi International airport resumed operations after two months of complete closure between March 25 and May 25, passenger footfall at the airport gradually began rising, and went up to more than 100,000 per day by the end of March 2021. Before the pandemic broke out, the average footfall was 150,000, officials said.“However, as cases of coronavirus rapidly rose in the country, a drastic fall in passenger footfall was noticed. Some countries have also suspended international flights to India, leading to an overall drop in the number of passengers by 65% to 70%. In the past one week, the passenger footfall has been as low as 32,000 to 35,000 per day,” said a senior airport official who asked not to be named.The officer said T2 will be closed starting midnight on May 17.“All the flights scheduled from T2 beyond May 18 will be shifted to T3. The airlines have been informed to alert flyers,” the officer said.An official from the Delhi air traffic control (ATC) said the air traffic movements (ATM) in the country recovered to almost 1,000 per day since last year from being as low as 300.“Recently, there has been a fall in the number of flights. The daily ATM has once again slipped to approximately 250-300 flights a day. Before Covid-19 struck, the daily ATM was around 1,300. With such low ATMs, T3 should be sufficient to handle the operations,” the officer said.After the two months of a complete ban on air traffic in India last year, while Terminal 3 started functioning May 25 onwards, Terminal 2 resumed operations on October 1.Terminal 1 has remained shut since March 25 due to expansion work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/igi-airport-s-terminal-2-to-shut-from-may-17-101620766895830.html
12-05-2021||Delhi||Young docs in Covid fight stay afloat in the deep end||When the national capital was reeling from the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, 22-year-old Dr Shefali Manchanda had just started her internship, immediately after completing her MBBS, at the Covid designated Smt Sucheta Kriplani Hospital near Connaught Place.On May 1, her first day at the hospital, she witnessed three people succumbing to the deadly virus within a few hours.“I remember that I called my mother and cried a lot that night. Not just deaths, but over the days, I also had to turn away people who were begging and crying for help because there was a shortage of beds and oxygen. The initial few days were really tough, but now things are getting better,” said Manchanda, who hails from Sonepat, and completed her MBBS from Delhi’s Lady Hardinge College.Hundreds of young doctors such as Manchanda, who are pursuing their last year of MBBS or mandatory internship year have been roped in at Covid hospitals across the city in the last two weeks to help in the fight against the pandemic. Their careers have begun with rounds of Covid wards and ICUs -- from monitoring oxygen levels to checking pulse rates, and doing all the paperwork, including issuing death certificates.Dr Noor Dhaliwal (23), who recently completed her MBBS from Maulana Azad Medical College recently, is currently interning at the Lok Nayak Hospital -- the biggest Covid center of the Capital. She had joined the hospital on April 20, and within a few days of starting work, she said she was witness to several “heathreaking events”.“It’s so heartbreaking to see some really young patients who were just a few years older than me struggling and succumbing to the virus. We had to do a lot of paperwork and also prepared some death certificates. I can never forget an instance when, within five minutes of someone passing away, the bed was occupied by another patient,” she said. “It makes me really respect my seniors who continue their work despite being enveloped by sadness,” said Dhaliwal, who is from Chandigarh.For Dr Diksha Malhotra (22), an intern doctor with Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital since May 1, work has been even more challenging because she is in charge of looking after Covid-19 positive babies, many of whom are on ventilator.“It gets difficult at times but that is why we chose this,” she said. Malhotra, from Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur, who did her MBBS at Lady Hardinge College.Several young doctors said witnessing deaths is always difficult. “A few days ago, a colleague of mine went to check the oxygen saturation of a patient early in the morning. She found that the saturation was zero and the pulse was not palpable. She uncovered the patient’s face and he was found to be dead. It’s a shock for her. Most of us are in our early 20s and we are yet to become used to it,” said Dr Reyan Najmi (25), who joined as an intern doctor at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences & Research after completing MBBS from a college in the same institute.Najmi, who is from Ranchi, said that there was fear and apprehension among family members of most of the young doctors.“The fear of parents sending their children for Covid duty in hospitals is akin to how movies portray the pain of parents of soldiers in the front lines of war. But my parents understand now and they are proud of me,” he added.Dr Kartik Yadav (23) said he was assigned internship at Lok Nayak hospital even before his final exam results were officially declared. “Many interns are now being assigned straightway into the ‘red zone’, where they get intense training. It is difficult but we are managing it. You have to be prepared for the worst in this profession,” he said.Meanwhile, several young doctors expressed apprehensions over the possible long-term impact of the pandemic on their careers.Dr Chetna Dengri (24), who completed her MBBS from UCMS and joined as intern at GTB hospital, said, “When we start our internship after MBBS, we work for one month in every department to learn the basics... It’s the only time when we actually get hands-on experience. But there have been no such opportunities for us and our junior batch since we all are engaged in Covid-related work.”Medical college professors said it was hard for these young doctors. “Unlike previous years, these students are not getting a chance to get the experience of working in different departments, which is required during internship and before deciding what they want to do in masters… Once things get better, we will have to work closely with these students,” said Manish Narang, professor of pediatrics at UCMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/young-docs-in-covid-fight-stay-afloat-in-the-deep-end-101620766349809.html

The court acted on the plea from these two students, who had told the court that they have completed the entire MBBS course. However, their final-year result has not been declared and therefore, they are unable to do their internship, which is a part of curriculum, as mandated by the Medical Council of India. The students were enrolled into MBBS course in 2015 under physically handicapped category, but subsequently declared ineligible by the varsity. The duo approached the high court against the decision, but lost their appeals before a single judge bench in 2016. Against that order, they had approached division bench and that appeal is still pending while both the students have completed their MBBS course. “Considering the pandemic crises, wherein even the final-year students of MBBS have been attending to the patients in general and particularly infected with Covid-19, we direct the university to declare the result and facilitate the admission of the applicants /appellants in the internship. The same shall be subject to final outcome of the appeals,” the court said, further ordering that matter be listed again within three months of physical resumption of hearings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-hc-asks-bfuhs-to-declare-results-withheld-due-to-litigation-101620765148775.html

Not even a single labourer has got such benefit in the state so far.The state government had announced compensation of ₹1,500 to registered labourers and up to ₹3,000 to a family. Ironically, no beneficiary has approached the department to get compensation as they are not aware of the scheme. According to the labour department, there are around 3.76 lakh registered workers in Punjab. In January this year, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had announced this financial aid for unprivileged labourers registered with the board. However, no efforts have been made by the labour department to make beneficiaries aware of the compensation. Initially, the last date of availing compensation was March 31 and later, the department has extended the date up to September 30. The purpose of the scheme is to provide financial assistance to labourers to run their household when they have to be isolated due to Covid-19.A senior official of the department said, “Unfortunately, the beneficiaries, who were supposed to get benefit of the compensation, didn’t know about it. Consequently, they were not applying for it. The department needs to create awareness among labourers to extend the benefits.”The latest report of comptroller and auditor general of India released in March this year revealed that against the available cess collection of ₹1,715.03 crore, the board could utilise only ₹696.2 crore and unspent amount of ₹1.018.7 crore was lying with the board.JP Singh, deputy labour commissioner, said, “We did not receive any application from beneficiaries to avail compensation after testing Covid positive.”Principal secretary of labour department, Vijay Kumar Janjua, said, “No amount of money has been released to labourers as compensation after getting infected with Covid-19. We have extended the date for six more months for beneficiaries so they can avail this benefit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/relief-eludes-covid-infected-labourers-punjab-govt-extends-date-to-avail-benefit-101620764488454.html

In a statement, Mann said the state government’s decree to occupy the farmers’ land should be cancelled immediately. “The Amarinder government had issued a notice to forcibly put the amount of the land being acquired for the expressway project in farmers’ accounts. At the same time, the farmers have been warned that if they do not take the government price of the land within 60 days and do not give possession of the land, then the land will be occupied with the help of Punjab Police,” he alleged. The AAP leader said the party was against the decree and would not allow the land to be taken away forcibly as the farmers were opposed to the collector rates.

Since Monday, the mandi has been seeing a mad rush of people – comprising vegetables vendors and buyers—during relaxation hours. The situation goes completely out of control around 10am when the crowd density peaks. Residents can be seen pushing and shoving each other while they make a dash to stock up on reinforcements, with scant regard for social distancing or mask norms. Though the authorities had put in place stringent measures to ensure crowd control last year during the lockdown, no such measures have been introduced this time. Odd hours to be blamed Darshan Lal Baweja (Laddo), president of the New Sabzi Mandi market committee, said the relaxation window is to be blamed. “The odd hours at which the relaxation is being offered is the reason behind the crowding at mandi. Due to the limited window, vendors and residents gather here in large numbers, which leads to chaos. Authorities should rework the relaxation timings.” Curbs have triggered bulk-buying frenzy Rachin Arora, vice-president of Sabzi Mandi vegetable arthiya association, said the curfew announcement seems to have triggered a bulk-buying frenzy among the residents. “People live in constant fear that the government may bring in more restrictions or announce a complete lockdown. So they rush to the market to stock up at every chance they get,” he said, adding that the existent weekend lockdown is also to be blamed. “Most vegetable and fruit vendors run of stock by the end of the week. So they rush to the mandi to replenish their stocks on the first and second days of the week,” he said. He added that this problem can be eased if the administration allows the vendors to make sales even during curfew hours. He added that a change in relaxation timings may also help ease the rush. Perishable items Sanjay Kumar, a vegetable vendor, said, “We have to buy and sell the produce within a limited time frame of seven hours. We start our day at 4am, but it is difficult to sell the product by noon.” Rajinder Singh, a local fruit vendor, said, “As vegetables and fruits are perishable items, we can’t store these for long. We try to sell as much as possible, but we hardly have any buyers in the early morning hours. The crowds swell up after 9am and by noon everyone is in a hurry to get back home. We also don’t want to be caught by the police, so we pack up and leave quickly,” said Singh. No lessons learnt The vegetable mandi had remained the epicenter of the virus spread in Ludhiana last year. At least four out of the 93 cops deployed here for crowd control had tested positive in the initial months following which the infection spread further. In April, the city lost an ACP, Anil Kumar Kohli, who was deployed at Sabzi Mandi, to the deadly disease. The ACP’s wife and gunman had also tested positive. Further, the district mandi officer, who had come in contact with the ACP, also tested positive, and subsequently, her family members had also caught the infection. Following this, the sabzi mandi had remained closed for over a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-mad-dash-to-stock-up-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-at-ludhiana-vegetable-mandi-101620763349285.html

Interestingly, the district education officer (DEO) is a member of the school’s managing committee.As per information, the school authorities have made it mandatory for teachers of all classes – LKG to Class 12 –to come to the school to conduct online classes for students. Each class has six sections. The teachers are expected to stay in school till 3.30pm, three-and-a-half hours into the curfew. The fresh curfew orders by the district administration permits only government school teachers to come to school and that too from 8am to 11.15am. All other schools are forbidden from opening. However, in addition to circumventing the rules, RS Model School continues to be open despite the fact that a number of its teachers have isolated themselves as their close relatives tested positive for Covid-19.While the school’s staff is understandably apprehensive to come to campus amid the rapid spread of infections, they face the additional problem of returning home during curfew hours. “In school, we are scared of sitting in the staff room as pens, books and furniture could be infected. While we maintain social distancing, the staff eats lunch together. All this has created a lot of panic as we have children and elderly parents at home. Moreover, on our way back home, we are constantly worried that the police may catch us for curfew violations,” said a teacher of the school while requesting anonymity.When contacted, school principal Suneeta Devgan abruptly disconnected the phone saying the school’s director Mohan Lal Kalra should be contacted as he was responsible for calling the staff. “Don’t contact me,” she said and immediately disconnected. When contacted for his comment, Kalra offered his justification by asking why the administration had allowed government schools to call their staff during relaxation hours in morning. “Why have they closed all other educational institutions?” he asked while claiming that his too was “a government school”.When pointed out that RS Model School was not a government entity but only a recipient of government aid and therefore was not allowed to open, Kalra then remarked that the curfew orders imposed by the administration were irrational and there should not be any difference between government and private schools. “Only some family members of the teachers have tested positive, but not the teachers,” he said.“We will be taking strict action against the school and ensure such violations do not occur,” said Lakhvir Singh, district education officer.“All educational institutions are ordered to be closed during curfew hours. There is no question of any private or government-aided private school opening. Only govt schools can open at 50% strength from 8am to 11.15am. If any violation comes to light, the erring school will be ordered to immediately shut down,” said Varinder Kumar Sharma, deputy commissioner.“We will be asking education department to look into the matter,” said police commisioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govtaided-school-in-ludhiana-opens-for-teachers-in-violation-of-curfew-orders-101620763108536.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||With 65 fatalities, J&K grimmest day so far||Jammu and Kashmir clocked a record 65 fatalities on Tuesday, pushing the UT’s toll to 2,847, making it the grimmest day so far. J&K also witnessed 4,352 fresh infections, taking the total cases to 2,24,898.The number of active cases has crossed 50,000 to reach 50,701, officials said. Most of these cases have been detected after February 9 when the UT had the lowest active case tally of 593.So far, 565 people have succumbed to the disease this month, making it the highest monthly death toll since the pandemic began in March 2020. In September,when the first wave had peaked, as many as 478 persons had lost their lives to the virus.Of the 65 deaths reported in the UT, 41 were reported in Jammu division and 24 in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 2,644 are from Kashmir while 1,708 are from Jammu, besides 84 were travellers. “Covid-appropriate behaviour, exercise, healthy and hygienic diet are multiple lines of defence against the infection, said medical superintendent, Mother and Childcare Hospital Gandhi Nagar, Dr Arun Sharma.“It is not limited to wearing a face mask in public and frequent hand-washing, it also includes sanitisation of objects one comes in contact with and social distancing while in publics space,” he said. Officials said with 846 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 602 in Jammu district, 361 in Baramulla, 322 in Budgam, 282 in Pulwama and 251 in Kathua.Dr Sharma further said that the first line of defence against Covid-19 is intake of nutritious diet which must include all essential nutrients, namely carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals. He suggested that people should take fiber rich food, brown bread, oats, cereals and sprouts as part of a healthy diet. “One must also drink one litre water per 20 kg body weight, that is to say 3 litres of water for a healthy 60kg person’, he advised. Physical exercise for half an hour daily or walking 15,000 steps must be done to maintain a healthy body with good immune system,” advised Dr Arun Sharma. Around 3,537 patients have recovered of the disease, including 2,262 from Kashmir and 1275 from Jammu.As many as 1,71,350 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 76.19 % against 98% in the first fortnight of February.

Even though state health minister Rajesh Tope stopped short of suspending the inoculation drive for the 18-44 age group, officials feel it is likely to be halted owing to limited sessions.Maharashtra has more than 2.1 million people above 45 years whose second dose is due, of which more than 500,000 are awaiting the second Covaxin dose. Tope on Tuesday said the decision to divert the stock was taken after the central government asked states to use the stock procured by them for the third phase of the drive — the 18-44 age group. He said all vaccination centres in the state have been directed to divert the stock meant for the 18-44 age group.The state has 600,000 doses of Covishield and 36,000 of Covaxin, received this week. Of them, 350,000 doses of Covishield were for the 18-44 age group, while the remaining stock was for 45+.Also read | Maharashtra adds 40,956 new Covid cases; Mumbai’s daily caseload down to 1,717“I spoke to union heath minister Dr Harsh Vardhanji, requesting him for additional stock for the second doses of people above 45 years. He, however, informed us about the unavailability of doses and asked us to utilise the stock procured for the 18-44 age group. After talking with chief minister Uddhav Thackerayji, we have decided to divert the stock of 310,000 doses of Covaxin, which will now be made available for the second dose [for 45+]. This includes 275,000 doses of Covaxin procured by the state for 18-44 years and 35,000 supplied by the Centre,” said Tope.“More than 500,000 people are waiting for second dose of Covaxin, while 1.6 million people are due for their second dose of Covishield. The diversion of the stock is expected to slow down the vaccination drive for the age group of 18-44 years. We will take a call how to go about the drive for this age group by talking to the task force,” he said.Maharashtra has vaccinated 15,140,471 people with 18,787,531 doses, with 375,713 administered on Tuesday.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, however, said state governments should reserve at least 70% of stock supplied to them for the second dose. He said the states should prioritise the administration of second doses to address the issue of the large number of people waiting for their second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-divert-310-000-covid-19-jabs-to-45-group-amid-crunch-101620762723750.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Virus cases in Srinagar on the decline for 4 days||The last four days have given people and officials in Srinagar, the district worst-affected by the Covid pandemic, a glimmer of hope as the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir has consistently recorded less than 1,000 cases after a record spike in daily infections from May 1 to 7.On the first week of May, Srinagar had seen 7,930 cases (an average 1,130 cases per day) while the district saw a total 3,320 cases between May 8 and 11 (an average 830 cases per day). On May 4, the capital had witnessed the highest 1,311 infections which had plunged to 853 on Saturday, 920 on Sunday and 701 on Monday, the lowest in the past two weeks.Srinagar deputy commissioner Aijaz Asad had tweeted, “701 positive cases in Srinagar (on Monday) is the lowest figure in the last 2 weeks at the same/ higher testing rate. Still not a good data for a good conclusion. The virus is preying on all atoms of the human body. Please adhere to SOPs.”The slight relative decline in Covid cases in Srinagar came after 10 days of a lockdown which was imposed in the worst affected districts of the UT on April 29 and has now been extended to all the 20 districts till May 17.Dr M Salim Khan, head of community medicine and nodal officer Covid at Government Medical College, Srinagar, said that he did not believe that the actual cases were reducing. “The low cases in these three days is due to low testing. Also, there were three official holidays prompting people to stay at home. When few patients approach hospitals only then can we say that cases have reduced,” he said. HT could not get the data on the number of tests conducted in the district during this period. However the number of tests across the UT remained more or less same in the past week, except on Monday, which saw an around 15 % reduction in the number of tests against the average 44,000-45000 tests being conducted per day over the week. Srinagar is J&K’s worst-affected district with 53,800 cases, of which 11,150 are active and 622 fatalities. Jammu comes at a close second with 40,600 cases, of which 7,600 are active and 686 fatalities. The UT will be celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr on Friday, subject to the appearance of the moon, amid the Covid curfew. This will be for the third year in a row that the people of Kashmir will be celebrating Eid under restrictions. The district administration in Srinagar has allowed bakery, vegetable, meat and chicken outlets to operate from 8am to 12pm from Tuesday ahead of the festival. But it has vowed to enforce the restrictions strictly to avoid crowding.“Coronavirus is illiterate, unlettered, visually impaired, hard of hearing (and) unimpassioned. It doesn’t differentiate between festive and non-festive days,” Asad said.The government officials in the district have also been asked to acquire curfew passes. “Movement of government officials shall be facilitated through a pass system from tomorrow. All heads of departments are requested to kindly place requisition for passes immediately,” a spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-cases-in-srinagar-on-the-decline-for-4-days-101620762868314.html

Senior citizens who have lost only earning member of the family will be provided special pension for life. Children who have lost their parents to the pandemic will be provided with special scholarship by the government,” Sinha’s office announced on Twitter.The government said it has decided to reach out to each and every such family and they will be provided with financial assistance for self-employment.“At a time when this global pandemic has rendered daily workers jobless, the government has decided to provide ₹1,000 per month to all registered construction workers, ponywalas, palkiwalas, pithuwalas for the next two months,” it added.The government has directed all officers concerned to ensure the supply of ration to all ration card holders on priority.Instalments of social welfare schemes such as old-age pension, Laadli Beti and PMAY, MGNREGA and other welfare schemes will be released immediately, it added.In these challenging times, the old-age homes and orphanages will be extended all the support from the government including rations, the government said.“Our biggest priority is to defeat this pandemic. I urge all of you to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated. We will soon prevail together over this pandemic,” it added. Sinha said all deputy commissioners will be asked to issue death certificates to the people who died due to Covid on priority and ₹55 crore will be released, of which ₹2 crore will be released to all 20 DCs , ₹5 crore to both divisional commissioners and ₹5 crore to the Jammu and Kashmir Police for emergency use under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-govt-extends-help-to-senior-citizens-orphans-daily-wage-workers-hit-by-pandemic-101620762689333.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Hailed as heroes, but plaints of doctors, nurses ignored||Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, around 11,000 doctors and nurses in Maharashtra have contracted Covid-19 infection. Of them, 62 have succumbed to the deadly infection in the line of duty, as per data provided by the state health department. The tributes on various platforms notwithstanding, on ground, these pillars of the public health system feel “discouraged”, claiming the authorities largely ignore their well-being. Numberspeak As doctors and nurses work in close proximity to Covid-19 patients, they are the most vulnerable to contracting Sars-Cov-2—the virus that causes novel coronavirus. Till May 10, a total of 3,473 and 2,914 government and private doctors have been infected. Of the total 6,387 infected doctors, 62 succumbed —16 of whom were government doctors. Data shows, in the same period, as many as 4,497 nurses got infected—2,909 serving patients in government medical setups, while the remaining at private hospitals. A total of 12 deaths have been recorded – nine from government facilities, while three from private facilities. “Most infections were recorded in the first wave when the hospitals didn’t have adequate number of personal protective equipment (PPE) and standard operating procedures (SOP) were not in place. In the second wave, we have seen fewer infections and lower fatality rate,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Doctors’ plaintsAfter 14 months of Covid-19 duty, healthcare workers are feeling mentally and physically exhausted. Resident doctors, however, allege that instead of appreciation, they often face discrimination and dejection from the authorities. For instance, a 28-year-old resident doctor, who is pursuing his post-graduation at a government medical college in a rural district of Maharashtra, contracted the virus last year while serving Covid-19 patients. After his recovery, the doctor developed post-Covid complications that obstructed his movements. His doctor advised him to take complete bed rest. After recovery, he joined Covid duty at the hospital in January. To his surprise, in March, the doctor was served a notice informing him that his post-graduation term has been extended by two terms, which means 12 months, as he was on leave during recovery. “This is injustice and unethical. I contracted the infection on duty. I wasn’t even called to provide an explanation and submit documents,” said the doctor. HT is in possession of the complaint letter filed by the doctor, who is not named to protect his identity. At Sion Hospital, 262 resident doctors have contracted Covid-19 so far. Although they are being provided with nutritious food, their hostel walls have moss and fungus, which can cause infection among recovered patients as they have low immunity. “Many recovered patients are now developing mucormycosis in which a person can lose eyesight, palate, tongue and can even die. In such a situation, it is risky for those with low immunity to live in such unhygienic conditions,” said a member of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) from the hospital. HT has photos and videos of the hotels. Last year, students of BYL Nair, King Edward Memorial and Lokmanya Tilak General hospitals were receiving a daily stipend of ₹300 as an incentive for their Covid-19 duty. In January, when the number of Covid-19 cases dipped, the incentive was stopped. “In the second wave, where one doctor has to handle over 30 patients at a time, we deserve the incentive. Other than civic-run medical colleges, it should also be given to doctors from government-run medical colleges,” said a member of the central MARD. Due to the ongoing pandemic, students who had sought admission to post-graduation for specialised courses are facing academic loss, as they couldn’t study properly due to their Covid-19 duty. Despite this, the students alleged the medical colleges are charging ₹1 lakh as tuition fees. “We have not learned anything on the specialities we opted for, which has created a sense of insecurity about our future. Deploying resident doctors for Covid duties is understandable, but what about their medical education? Instead of giving relief and uplifting the morale, they’ve been forced to pay academic fees for classes which were never conducted,” said Dr Deepak Munde, a post-graduation resident at KEM hospital, who was the former president of MARD. He didn’t have the money to pay the fees so, had to sign a bond declaring that he will pay the money later. Doctors also often have to face assaults by the hands of patients’ relatives over unavailability of beds or oxygen. In the latest incident, last week, a first-year post-graduate student from the department of medicine, who was on Covid-19 duty at the Grant Medical College, Latur, was assaulted by a relative of a coronavirus patient over unavailability of an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. “The patient was serious with oxygen level below 85% and required an ICU bed, but we didn’t have one. It is not our fault that beds aren’t available in hospitals. The patients’ relatives thrashed us. For years, we have been asking the department to increase security. With the rise in cases, such incidents have also increased,” said a doctor from the hospital. Later, an first investigation report (FIR) was filed against the family members, but they weren’t arrested on humanitarian grounds. Nurses’ issues Nurses also complain of lack of basic facilities. Most nurses are working under tremendous stress due to the manpower shortage. Jibin TC, president, United Nurses Association (UNA), Maharashtra, said that since 2019, the health department hasn’t filled up 59,000 posts of nurses. “In February 2019, the public health department advertised for 59,000 posts. But the examination was held only in February of this year. So far, the recruitment process hasn’t been completed,” he said. At rural hospitals like Kuwar Tilak Singh Hospital, Gondia, staffers allege contractors, who are given the responsibility to hire nurses, recruit only inexperienced nurses over qualified ones to save money. “At present, seven nurses in the hospital have Covid-19 infection, which brings down the staff strength. In addition, we have to train these inexperienced nurses who fail to provide proper care to patients,” said a nurse from the hospital over the phone. Dr TP Lahane, director of DMER refuted the claims, stating, “These are just allegations. Everything has been taken care of.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hailed-as-heroes-but-plaints-of-doctors-nurses-ignored-101620762687936.html

The positivity rate also came down to 17.76%, the lowest since April 14 this year when it was 15.92%. On April 22, a positivity rate of 36.2%, the highest so far, was recorded.The Capital reported 12,651 cases of the infection on Monday, 13,336 on Sunday and 17,364 cases on Saturday, according to the government’s daily bulletin.“The positivity rate has been reducing from the highest 36%... this is a positive sign but we cannot get comfortable. We can’t rest till the positivity rate drops below 5% and the number of new cases below three or four thousand. The reversal of the trend began in April last week, but now it is confirm that Delhi has crossed the peak,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a press briefing on Tuesday.Also read | Will float global tenders for vaccines soon: Manish Sisodia“At the moment, there is no problem relating to oxygen and the demand for oxygen is also slowly going down. However, the demand for hospital beds is still quite high; nearly 20,000 people are admitted in the hospitals. At the peak, it was about 22 thousand hospitalisation. In comparison, the highest number of hospitalisation during November was 9,500,” said Jain.With 347 deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported on Tuesday, Delhi’s total toll crossed 20,000 mark.

During this wave, we have seen that people have fever for about 10 to 14 days and requiring respiratory support for about two to three weeks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-dip-in-cases-continues-deaths-cross-20000-101620762084676.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Tarn Taran police rope in sarpanches to boost testing, vaccination||As Covid continues to spread its tentacles in villages of Punjab, Tarn Taran police have decided to rope in sarpanches and councillors of nagar panchayats to boost testing and vaccination in the rural areas where people have been showing reluctance to adhere to the health department’s guidelines.The police of the district, 87% population of which lives in rural areas, have also identified 80 villages with 300+ population to start special drives with the help of local administration and health department for vaccinating all those aged above 45 years.According to the Punjab health department, the current case fatality rate in Punjab’s rural areas is 2.7% against less than 1% in urban areas. Out of the total 6,416 positive cases in the district, 4,992 were reported from the rural areas. The district has reported 246 deaths in total.The initiative of the Punjab Police comes after it was brought to the fore that most of the people living in the rural areas of Tarn Taran showed reluctance in complying with the mandatory restrictions of the health department. The health officials in Tarn Taran were also “astonished” to find that “deaths in some villages were being underreported” due to the “Covid conspiracy” agenda on social media and an alleged campaign of the farm leaders refusing to accept the severity of the virus. The farmer leaders in Tarn Taran have been mobilising support for organising a huge procession from Harike Pattan town to the national capital against the three farm laws.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale himself has been holding meetings with 20-25 sarpanches on a daily basis. He has also directed all SPs and DSPs to continue such meetings with all village heads, representatives of panchayati raj and councillors of the nagar panchayats to ensure building of trust for the health department and the government’s efforts to contain the virus.“We are making the sarpanches aware so that they can further ensure proper testing and vaccination in their respective villages. There has been a spread of misinformation about the vaccine on social media. The sarpanches are being told not to believe any misinformation,” said the SSP.A senior medical officer (SMO) said, “Our recently conducted survey showed that people living in rural areas had been preferring quacks instead of approaching hospitals. There have also been reports that many deaths in the district’s villages are being underreported. Police’s action is appreciable, but large scale campaigns are needed to spread the awareness about the severity of Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tarn-taran-police-rope-in-sarpanches-to-boost-testing-vaccination-101620762388444.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||J&K to weave a brand for Kashmir silk||To capitalise on its centuries-old association with silk and sericulture, the Jammu and Kashmir administration is planning to promote Kashmir silk under the Union Territory’s overall brand. The plan is part of J&K industries’ initiative to promote a few selected products that are part of the cultural legacy. “Many people don’t know that Kashmir is famous for silk as well. That is why, we are striving to brand silk under the overall brand of Jammu and Kashmir,” said Sajid Nazir, deputy general manager, J&K industries. “Kashmir has been historically into silk production and trade. Since 1890s, silk was produced in an organised manner and exported to the UK. In the second world war, silk fabric for parachutes was exported from Kashmir,” he said, adding, “Given the history and legacy of Kashmir silk, there is imminent spoken potential for this industry to develop.” Tracing the past Kashmir’s association with silk and sericulture has been an old story to the extent that Rajtarangini – the oldest written chronicle of Kashmir – mentions it, besides the accounts in 7th century AD in Xuang Zang’s travelogue. Kashmir’s first silk reeling factory was started at Solina in Srinagar in 1897 under the patronage of British. In 1937, a silk-weaving factory was established at Rajbagh. By 1961-62, the production of silk in the state went to around 98,000 kg. The decline in silk production started in the late 1980s and with the eruption of militancy in 1990s, the silk reeling and weaving factories became obsolete and defunct. “Whatever was left of the factories, the flood of 2014 destroyed everything,” said Nazir. However, the reeling at Solina filatures and weaving at Rajbagh factory was restarted after the floods when new machines were procured owing to a World Bank-funded Jhelum Tawi Flood Recovery Project (JTFRP). “The World Bank is primarily supporting this initiative to help the cocoon rearers. As per the sericulture department, 30,000 families in J&K are producing cocoons,” said Nazir, who coordinates the industries-commerce component of the World Bank project. Not long ago, Jammu and Kashmir had been producing one of the finest silk qualities in the world with high-end varieties like ‘lotus’, ‘iris’, ‘tulip’, and ‘neel’. Nazir said that the approximate annual production of cocoon in J&K is 900 metric tons (MT) or 9 lakh kgs. “Maximum of these cocoons go to West Bengal and Karnataka and a very small portion of cocoons are turned into silk or fabric in Srinagar’s reeling and weaving factories,” said Nazir. He said that now silk reeling and weaving units have also been established in Jammu. Nazir said that last year, cocoons worth ₹5.5 crore were procured from the farmers which produced 23, 000 kg of yarn or 4 lakh metres of silk fabric. “This year, we intend to procure double the quantity worth ₹11 crore, which will be around 130-150 metric tonnes,” he said. “Promoting Kashmir silk as a brand is important for helping the local industry and safeguarding of the livelihood of the farmers, ” Nazir added. “Young people only know that Kashmir is known for handicrafts or horticulture. Silk is also an important part of Kashmir. To encourage this, we want the brand promotion of silk as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-to-weave-a-brand-for-kashmir-silk-101620762328548.html

12-05-2021||Delhi||Will float global tenders for vaccines soon: Manish Sisodia||The Delhi government will float global tenders for Covid-19 vaccines soon, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday, even as he criticised the Centre for exporting vaccines to other countries and “pitting states against each other” for procurement of doses in the international market due to a shortage of doses.The Delhi government has repeatedly flagged dwindling stocks of vaccine doses in the Capital, saying that manufacturers were not supplying enough stocks to meet the target of inoculating the city’s entire adult population in the next three months.Addressing a news briefing, Sisodia said the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled central government was “forcing” state governments to invite global tenders for vaccine procurement. He said Delhi was faced with a situation where people aged between 18 and 44 were eager to get their Covid-19 vaccine jabs, but they were unable to do so because of a shortage of vaccines.“We will also float global tenders for vaccines. If state governments only have to fight with each other in the international market for vaccines and that is the only way left, then the Delhi government will also go that way. But, why is it that states have to buy vaccines from outside India? It was the Centre’s job to procure Covid-19 vaccines well in time from the international market and give it to states. Instead, the Centre was busy exporting vaccines for image-building exercise. Scores of lives could have been saved in our country had the central government not distributed 6.5 crore doses to other countries, and given it to its own citizens,” the deputy CM said.He gave the examples of how the US and the European nations focused on ensuring the vaccination of all their citizens first.A BJP spokesperson was unavailable for comment, despite repeated attempts. Earlier on Monday, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra had accused AAP of playing politics over the vaccine issue.Also read | Allow more pharma firms to make vaccines: Delhi CM Kejriwal to CentreSisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19 management, blamed the central government for the “mess” created over the stocks of vaccinations.He said the Centre was “shirking from its responsibility” by asking states to directly procure vaccines through global tenders – a step which he said should have been taken by the Centre in March this year.He said it had never happened in the last 70 years that a central government left the states to fend for themselves at the global stage.The deputy chief minister said that if states were asked to purchase vaccines internationally through global tenders, then the state with the largest coffers would unfairly procure the most doses.“This will lead to fights among states, and further bashing and criticism of the country in international communities,” he said.Sisodia’s remarks came on a day the Delhi government said it will have to temporarily shut around 125 of its vaccine centres meant for those from the 18-44 age group due to the shortage of Covaxin vaccine doses.Sisodia reiterated that Delhi needed 300,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines every day, of which 150,000 were for those below 45 years of age.“I appeal to the central government to take cognisance of the crisis at hand and immediately begin a vaccine programme along the lines of the Pulse Polio Programme. If Delhi receives sufficient number of vaccines from the central government, we will ensure that all are vaccinated in a matter of three months,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-float-global-tenders-for-vaccines-soon-manish-sisodia-101620761668371.html

Another four accused, who have been identified as residents of Thane and Raigad districts, are currently absconding, said a forest department staffer who is a part of the investigation.The wildlife department also recovered an undisclosed quantity of wild boar meat from the home of one of the accused, in addition to various nets which were allegedly used to trap boar and possibly other small animals, said officials. Samples of the meat have been sent to a laboratory for testing.The matter came to light on the morning of May 3 when department officials in the Rajur forest range of Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary received a tip-off that wild pigs were being hunted with rifles in the area.As these animals are protected under Schedule 3 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, two response teams, one from Rajur forest range and another from Bhandardara forest range, were roped in to investigate. “We got some credible information that a man in Somalvadi village was hunting pigs. After getting a search warrant and finding the evidence, the accused was remanded to police custody for three days, during which we also recovered photos and videos of him in the act [hunting], using a small bore rifle,” said Girish Ranadive, assistant forest conservator, Akole.During the interrogation, officials learnt of the involvement of at least 12 more individuals – four of whom were residents of Thane and Raigad and another nine who are Akole residents. “The locals have been arrested and they admitted to have engaged in hunting frequently. However, the primary weapon used was a rifle which is not in their possession. We have informed teams in Thane and Raigad as well, but the four main accused are still at large,” Ranadive said. Those arrested have all been booked under the relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Officials said a maximum penalty in the given scenario could extent up to seven years in prison with a fine of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/9-arrested-for-poaching-in-maharashtra-s-wildlife-sanctuary-101620761547760.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Month on, SIT probing Behbal Kalan incident remains headless||Almost a month after Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh proceeded on voluntary retirement, no one has replaced him to lead the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing case in which two Sikh protestors were killed. Kunwar Vijay was reportedly upset after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the probe reports submitted by the SIT probing the Kotkapura firing case, and ordered the government to form a new probe team. Kunwar Vijay’s voluntary retirement request was accepted with effect from April 15.Acting on the HC orders, the state government constituted the new three-member SIT headed by ADGP (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav to probe the Kotkapura firing case.But the Behbal Kalan case is still under the first SIT formed by the Congress government in 2018. In June 2020, the investigation of the case was entrusted to Kunwar Vijay after a rift between the SIT members. But now after his retirement, the fate of the Behbal Kalan case hangs in the balance.The investigation team is facing an uphill task to defend the chargesheets filled in Behbal Kalan case after HC had quashed reports in the Kotkapura case. Hearing in the Behbal Kalan firing case on pleas of the accused cops, who claim they were falsely implicated, is scheduled for May 13 in the HC. The Faridkot court has fixed the next date of hearing on framing of charges against the accused on May 18. A senior police official said at present three SIT’s are probing 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases. “The SIT led by inspector general SPS Parmar is probing three FIRs related to Bargari sacrilege, while newly constituted SIT led by ADGP LK Yadav is investigating he Kotkapura firing case. But the Behbal Kalan firing case is still with the first SIT and there is confusion on who is leading it as no one has replaced Kunwar Vijay,” the official added. District attorney Rajnish Goyal said only some junior team members appeared for the hearings ever since Kunwar Vijay’s retirement. An SIT member said the probe in the Behbal Kalan case is complete and a six-member team was constituted by Kunwar Vijay on March 15 to assist the prosecution in the court. However, the district attorney said they have not received any communication in this regard. In a letter dated March 15 to DGP Dinkar Gupta, Kunwar Vijay mentioned that one challan is required to be filed in FIR no. 130, which was registered at Bajakhan police station in connection with the Behbal Kalan firing incident on October 21, 2015. He also said a closure report has to be filed in FIR 129 (another case registered by police against protesters in connection with this case on October 14, 2015).Sacrilege SIT yet to get new memberMore than a month after the retirement of IGP Ranbir Singh Khatra, Punjab Police are yet to appoint a new member of the SIT probing 2015 sacrilege cases of Guru Granth Sahib. SIT chairman, IGP (border range), Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, in a letter to the director, bureau of investigation, Arpit Shukla recommended that Jalandhar police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar may be nominated as a member of the SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/month-on-sit-probing-behbal-kalan-incident-remains-headless-101620761428801.html

The report also recommended action against the owner/management of the mall and the hospital inside it, and a criminal case against the safety audit agency. The inquiry report into March 25 level-4 fire at Bhandup’s Dream Mall, which had killed nine Covid-19 patients at Sunrise Hospital housed inside the mall, has recommended a full-fledged departmental enquiry (FFDE) against Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB)’s assistant divisional fire officer Rajendra Ghadge and the then chief fire officer SA Kale for “not following the rules and carrying out a proper inspection” of the mall last November. The report has also stated that a criminal case be filed against the owners/management of Dreams Mall and Sunrise Hospital, holding them responsible for the incident.The report, which was submitted and approved by municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Tuesday, has blamed the hospital and mall management for non-compliance of several norms and stated that both failed to take proper precautions as per the Maharashtra Fire Safety Act, 2006. The report has also asked the civic body to have MFB follow up with the police on the criminal cases filed against the hospital and mall’s owner/management for lapses in complying with fire safety norms. The probe report prepared by disaster management cell’s deputy municipal commissioner Prabhat Rahangdale has stated that a private firm – a licenced agency tasked with ensuring the mall’s fire safety compliance – had submitted a report that the firefighting equipment of the mall was working and all compliances were looked into for the period between July 1 and December 31, 2020. However, the preliminary report stated that on the day of the fire, none of the firefighting equipment was working.The report has recommended that the private agency’s licence be cancelled by the director of the Maharashtra Fire Services, and asked the chief fire officer to file a criminal case against the company. The report has also asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take action against the banquet owner on the malls’ second floor for storing 45 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinders, despite having permission to only store two.According to the report submitted to Chahal, BMC had asked for an audit of all malls after the blaze at City Central mall in south Mumbai last October. “As per the circular issued by BMC chief in 2018, the J fire compliance form issued by assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) Rajendra Ghadge was to be given with signature of chief fire officer, but Gadge gave it without the CFO’s sign. On asking the reason, Ghadge said he did the same on oral instructions from the then CFO SA Kale. This was in violation of rules. Kale was the deputy CFO of that region and holding charge of CFO. It was expected that he should have followed the circular issued by the municipal commissioner in 2018. An FFDE is recommended against the two,” the report stated. Kale was not available for a comment despite repeated attempts. It further added that after carrying out the mall’s inspection in November 2020, Ghadge had given 60 days to submit a compliance report that was submitted in February 2021, as he was down with Covid-19 in January. According to MFB officials, instead of taking further action on the compliance report by visiting and checking the compliance, Ghadge submitted the report to BMC. When contacted, Ghadge said, “I forwarded the compliance report because I was told via control message to do without CFO’s sign. More than 700 forms by fire officials were submitted without the signature of CFO. Also, I did not go for inspection because the mall did not come under my purview directly. Hence, I forwarded the report to the fire station concerned for further compliance.” The report has blamed the mall and hospital management for ignoring warnings from the fire brigade and BMC and not taking any corrective action. “It is recommended to cut off the water and electric supply of the mall and file a criminal case against the owners and directors of Dreams Mall, and Sunrise Hospital’s owners Ms Privilege Healthcare, as they are to be blamed for the incident,” Rahangdale said in his report.When contacted, Sunrise Hospital in a statement, said, “The fire report clearly stated that no fire incident occurred at Sunrise Hospital. The hospital is delinked from the mall and had all compliance in place. The report prepared by BMC and fire brigade dept clearly states that the fire was due to faulty electric circuit in shop No 140 on the upper ground floor of the mall. The spread of the fire is attributed to the lack of functioning sprinkler system of the entire mall. It must be noted that the said lapses are attributable to the administrator of the mall Rahul P Sahasrabuddhe, who was appointed by NCLT Mumbai vide order dated 31.08.2019 with the specific mandate to look after the mall premises and ensure that the same is not hazardous to its occupants.”However, Sahasrabuddhe said, “The said report holds up all the irregularities at Dreams Mall which was brought up by the administrator time and again before various authorities including MCGM (BMC). All my complaints filed with the government authorities about non-availability of water and electricity in the mall, leakage by the hospital and banquet hall, use of cylinders by the banquet hall was never redressed. I have protested about giving permission to the hospital without following any safety measures to MCGM and fire brigade, time and again, but no action has been taken. Had my complaints been heard by authorities in time, the tragedy would have certainly been avoided.”As part of its recommendations, the report has said that the existing standard operating procedure (SOP) be tweaked to adjust to Covid-19 pandemic situation. The report has also recommended that a new fire hazard response and mitigation plan be created for Mumbai. The report has recommended that it is not possible to follow conventional fire safety norms in all old hospitals. There should be water mist systems installed in all ICU wards urgently and two firefighters from licenced agencies must be deployed at all times at these wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-mall-fire-report-blames-2-fire-officers-mall-and-hospital-management-101620761187721.html

We will soon be meeting the PM in this regard and request him to take a decision,” he added.In his five-page letter, Thackeray requested the President to taking appropriate steps to grant 12% and 13% reservation to the Marathas in education and government jobs, respectively, by referring to the Apex court’s May 5 decision that the authority of identifying a community as ‘Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC)’ and providing them reservation lies only with the President and the Central government since August 2018 following the 102nd Amendment in Constitution.It also narrated the ways the state government had adopted for providing reservation to the Maratha community – from promulgating an ordinance in 2014 to holding legal battles in the Bombay high court and subsequently in the Apex court till May 5 – till the quota was quashed. SC had observed that people from a community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category.“Resultantly, the aforesaid statute (SEBC Act) passed unanimously by both the Houses of the state legislature of my state on November 30 after the 102nd Constitutional Amendment has been held unsustainable. In term of the aforesaid majority of the SC on and from August 15, 2018, the day on which the Constitutional Amendment has been brought into force, the President alone (i.e. the Central Government) under Article 342 (I) by reason of Article 367 read with section 3(8) (b) of General Clauses Act, has jurisdiction, authority and power to identify and declare Maratha community of my state to be a SEBC. Also, it is held that an appropriate exercise in this regard is to be conducted by the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), in consultation with our state (sic),” stated the letter, dated May 10, to the President.“As a consequence of the aforesaid majority view of the Supreme Court, it is the President i.e. the Union government alone, which can identify and notify the Maratha community of my state as SEBC, enabling it to enjoy reservation in education and public employment. This is therefore, to earnestly request you that appropriate steps be taken, albeit in accordance with law, declared by the SC to identify and declare Maratha community of my state as SEBC to enable them to claim reservation in education and public employment at least to extent of 12% and 13% respectively (sic),” it added.Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday also constituted an eight-member panel headed by Dilip Bhosale, retired chief justice of Allahabad HC, to examine the Apex court judgment in detail and prepare a comprehensive guidance and analysis till May 31 which will help the state in taking the next course of action. The panel comprises of senior law expert Rafique Dada, former advocate general of Maharashtra Darius Khambata, retired bureaucrat Sudhir Thakre, senior law advisor of law and judiciary department Sanjay Deshmukh, secretary (legislation) law and judiciary department Bhupendra Gurav, advocate Ashish Raje Gaikwad and joint secretary BZ Sayyad. The government has also appointed two more advocates — Akshay Shinde and Vaibhav Sugdare — who will assist the committee over the matter.The demand for reservation in government jobs and education has been a long-standing demand of the Maratha community since the 1980s and there have several agitations for it. It culminated in SEBC Act, 2018, which introduced 16% reservation for the community. The law was challenged in Bombay HC, which brought down the reservation to 12% and 13% in education and jobs, respectively.The CM made it clear that states should not be deprived with their authority and power to provide reservation to a particular community. “The authority to grant reservation to a community shall remain with the states. The matter is not related to just one state [Maharashtra in this case] but involves many others. We are expecting deliberation and decision on the same,” said Thackeray.He also praised the Maratha community for showing ‘self-restraint” and not holding any agitation against the Apex court verdict or the state government. “We are expecting a reply on the letter and also a decision, as granting the reservation to the Maratha community was a unanimous move. Even BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) may not have any objection on this,” he said.The CM also took a dig at his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis over the latter’s claim that SEBC Act was “fool proof”. “Had it been true, we would have not come here to meet the Governor in this regard,” Thackeray said responding to a question.Thackeray’s visit to Raj Bhavan comes after a year amid an ongoing a tussle between his Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Governor. The last time the CM had called on Koshyari was after being elected as the member of the legislative Council on May 18, 2020. He was accompanied by his wife Rashmi and son Aaditya, who is also the state environment minister.Meanwhile, many organisations are planning to hold state-wide virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders of the political parties in Maharashtra as a mark of protest and to create pressure for taking decisions to bring back reservation for the community.Ex-Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan to evaluate Congress’s poll debacle in 5 states A day after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) decided to form a leaders’ group to evaluate the party’s debacle in the recently-concluded Assembly polls in five states, Maharashtra’s former chief minister (CM) Ashok Chavan has been appointed to lead it. Senior Congress leaders Salman Khurshid, Manish Tewari, Vincent H Pala and Jothi Mani are the other members of the group.In the CWC meeting at New Delhi on Monday, party chief Sonia Gandhi had proposed to form a group to evaluate the party’s performance in Kerala, Assam, West Bengal, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu polls. Gandhi had said the party has to put its house in order by “facing reality and drawing lessons” from the setback it received in the polls.“Honourable Congress president has constituted a group to evaluate the results of the recently-concluded Assembly elections with immediate effect. The group will submit the report within two weeks,” a press statement signed by party general secretary KC Venugopal read.Chavan’s appointment is seen to be significant for the leader, known to be a party loyalist. “I’m thankful to the party president for the responsibility. We’ll present the report on party’s performance in the elections by speaking to the candidates, officer bearers and key workers from the respective states,” Chavan, who is the state public works department minister, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-reservation-maharashtra-cm-writes-to-president-pm-101620761007756.html

12-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hindmata to get relief this monsoon?||Under its two-part plan to ease traffic flow on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road at Hindmata junction, which witnesses waterlogging during the monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is constructing underground water tanks at the junction below the flyover, and a three-meter-high elevation connecting Hindmata bridge with Parel TT flyover. While the first will abate waterlogging, the second will help ease traffic movement. Every year, during the monsoon, the Hindmata junction in Dadar East, ahead of Dadar TT, is inundated in two- or three-ft deep rainwater. In the past two years, it took the BMC several hours to drain the water and clear the route for traffic. During this time, vehicles can either take two flyovers, or the traffic is completely diverted from BA Road, as the distance between these two flyovers is about 100m, which is at road level. This area also gets submerged in rainwater. A senior civic officer from the bridges department said, “The waterlogging at Hindmata leads to traffic jams on the flyovers, or traffic diversions off Babasaheb Ambedkar road. We want to complete this elevation work on priority, before the monsoon.” The elevation will connect the two flyovers at a height of three feet and its length is 100m. The work is being carried out by two departments - the stormwater drains department and bridges department. Officers from the stormwater drains department were unavailable for a comment on Tuesday. The plan to construct underground water holding silos across the city to abate flooding was first mooted two years ago. At least two tanks were planned to be constructed in the eastern suburbs. However, the project did not take off due to lockdown. The water from the tanks constructed under the Hindmata flyover will be supplied for non-potable purposes to nearby gardens and clubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hindmata-to-get-relief-this-monsoon-101620760347667.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Unit in Pune to be used to produce Covaxin; to be handed over in 3 days||After the Bombay high court (HC) directed the state government to hand over a vaccine manufacturing unit locate in Pune district to an associate of Bharat Biotech for vaccine production, the forest department said it will complete the process within the next three days. The HC has directed the Pune district collector to hand over possession of an idle vaccine manufacturing unit at village Manjari Khurd, in Haveli Taluka, to Biovet Pvt. Ltd, an associate of Bharat Biotech, to manufacture ‘Covaxin’ and other vaccines. The unit is situated on land admeasuring 11.58 hectares. A division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Nitin Borkar, while hearing an interim application by ‘Biovet’ which sought possession of the vaccine manufacturing unit being used by Intervet India Pvt Ltd, a multinational subsidiary of Merck & Co which was granted the land in 1973 to manufacture vaccine for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). The company which was shutting down its operations in India had agreed to transfer the land and unit to Biovet, however, the government through the forest department refused the transfer, on the grounds that the transfer in 1973 was bad. Deputy conservator of forest (Pune division) Rahul Patil said his department, which owns the land, will cooperate with the procedure while formalities related to handover will be completed in two-three days following which the pharma company can take make arrangements required for the vaccine production.On May 6, advocate RD Soni for Biovet informed the bench that the company had filed a petition challenging the July 2020 order of the deputy conservator of forest, Pune, who had rejected their application to re-examine and review the refusal order passed by the assistant conservator in June 2018. Soni submitted that if the unit was handed over to Biovet it could start manufacturing Foot and Mouth Disease and Covid-19 vaccine.Soni also submitted that due to the dispute between the company and the state government, the plant and machinery, which could start manufacturing of Covaxin, was lying idle, hence the court should direct the government to transfer the land to Biovet and also permit them to carry out structural changes to maximise the manufacturing capacity of the unit. The company also assured the court that they would not claim any equity in their favour and would use the unit for manufacturing life-saving vaccines including Covaxin.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state government submitted that it did not have an objection if an interim application was allowed to the extent that applicants would use the premises only for manufacturing Covaxin and other life-saving vaccines without claiming any right, title and interest on the said property. The AG also informed the court that the concerned officer would cooperate with Biovet for grant of any permission required to start the manufacturing process for Covid-19 vaccine.After hearing the submissions, the bench accepted the undertaking by Biovet and directed the state government to grant appropriate licenses, permissions or NOCs to Biovet in a ‘time-bound manner’ to enable manufacturing of FMD vaccine and Covaxin along with other life-saving vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/unit-in-pune-to-be-used-to-produce-covaxin-to-be-handed-over-in-3-days-101620760287718.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Vaccine shortage in Mumbai: BMC may reserve 2-3 days for those seeking second dose||To administer on-time vaccination to beneficiaries taking their second dose, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is likely to reserve two or three days of the vaccination drive in the coming week, exclusively for those taking their second dose. This will depend on the availability of vaccine stock. Concerns over delay in beneficiaries taking their second shot were discussed in a meeting between Mumbai suburbs guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, and Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department on Tuesday. Senior civic officials said detailed guidelines will be published by BMC on Wednesday based on Tuesday’s discussions. Guidelines will be on how to administer on-time second dose for beneficiaries, and measures BMC can take to reach those who are not on social media.Other concerns regarding over-crowding at vaccination centres, technical glitches experienced by users while registering on the Co-WIN application, and catering to beneficiaries who are not tech-savvy and are unable to effectively register on the Cowin application on time to receive a slot were also discussed at the meeting.Meanwhile, the vaccination drive will continue as it is at present, for all age groups only after registration and receiving a slot online. Beneficiaries who are to get their second dose can walk in and show their certificates from the first dose and will receive their second shot after verification. Aaditya Thackeray told HT on Tuesday evening, “There are several beneficiaries who received their first shot five or six weeks ago. They are due for their second vaccine shot, who have not received it. Concerns were raised about these beneficiaries receiving their second dose on time. We have discussed some measures BMC can roll-out subject to availability of vaccine doses.”Thackeray said, “A lot of people are not on social media. Many have experienced problems while registering on the Co-WIN application. So we can look at long term measures making it easier for beneficiaries to register, such as the token system, which is issued for the second dose, at the time of vaccinating for the first dose itself.” Thackeray tweeted after the meeting, “This afternoon I met with MC Chahal ji and AMC Kakani ji to discuss and work out a strategy for 1) Ensuring second shot is administered on time 2 Communication and slots for those not tech savvy or on social media 3) activation of 227 vaccination centres 4 preps for possible third wave.” Thackeray also tweeted, “While we explore possibilities of globally procuring vaccines and also increasing vaccination centres to have 1 in every municipal ward, the road map for administering second shot for every age group will be published soon.” He later said, “If centres are set up at every municipal ward, we will be able to tackle the problem of overcrowding, even though vaccines will have to be dispatched in small quantities.” BMC will also make arrangements for mothers of kids who have Covid-19 and are hospitalised, to stay with their child, without catching covid. A separate area in pediatric wards is likely to be set up for mothers as well. Creches will be set up for children whose parents have tested Covid-19 positive, but the child has not tested positive, Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccine-shortage-in-mumbai-bmc-may-reserve-2-3-days-for-those-seeking-second-dose-101620760167662.html
12-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s non-Covid private hospitals rue inadequate oxygen quota||Around 25 non-Covid private health centres in the city have flagged the issue of inadequate supply of oxygen at a time when more patients are rushing to them for health services.The UT administration on Tuesday fixed the quota of 30 cylinders for the private hospitals with ICU facilities for primarily non-Covid patients, but the hospital administrators have said that it was “grossly inadequate”.The local chapter of the Indian Medical Association had also presented the requirement to the authorities according to the bed occupancy. After the quota was fixed, the local chapter of IMA again wrote to the UT health authorities, asking them to reconsider the decision.Requirement of 100 cylinders in hospitals“There is a requirement of around 100 cylinders in the hospitals catering to non-Covid services. We appeal to the administration to supply us more oxygen,” said Dr V Kappall, the president of IMA Chandigarh.“They (administration) have promised to augment supply as soon as they are in a position to do so. Let’s hope they at least allot 60 cylinders to non-Covid hospitals, who are taking emergencies, refused by the PGIMER, GMCH, GMSH and other Covid centres,”said Dr RS Bedi, owner of a hospital in Sector 33.Dr Neeraj Kumar, who also runs a private hospital, said that several emergency procedures were also conducted at private facilities and since suppliers were overburdened with Covid management, emphasis should be on equal distribution.“We run paediatric ICUs and currently we are running on 3-4 hour supply. It takes around 7-8 hours to refill the cylinders. If the current situation persists, we may have to tell the patients to find some other facility, but we do not want to create panic,” said Dr Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-non-covid-private-hospitals-rue-inadequate-oxygen-quota-101620760108886.html

While one will become operational at the District Sports Complex near the Sohana gurdwara on Airport Road in Sector 78, the other is at Piccadilia The Theatre Cafe in Mullanpur, New Chandigarh.Subdivisional magistrate Jagdeep Sehgal said the initiative was planned keeping in mind the increasing number of Covid-19 cases and the need to maintain social distancing.Though the administration is organising special vaccination camps at various residential and commercial complexes, maintaining social distancing has remained a challenge. Dr Rajendra Bhooshan, vaccine in-charge in Mohali, said that though the drive is picking the pace, there is fear among people to venture out of their homes amid the second wave. The drive-through facility is only for those aged above 45 years, and registration will be done on the spot. The person has to carry the Aadhaar card or any other identity card. The SDM said the facility will remain open from 10am to 3pm daily. Citizens will have to remain in their vehicle for around 30 minutes after receiving the injection, he said.Even though Mohali has the highest number of active cases in the tricity, it is leading on the vaccination front, with around 10,000 people being jabbed daily. The drive is being carried out at 118 centres in the district, including 104 government sites and 14 private hospitals. According to data available on the Co-WIN app, till May 11, Mohali has administered 3.22 lakh doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-launches-two-drive-through-vaccine-facilities-101620760048180.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s positivity rate falls to 6.06%, deaths remain a concern||Despite the number of cases and daily positivity rate going down to as low as around 6% in the city on Tuesday, followed by an increase in bed availability, the number of deaths has not gone down, reveals data of the state health department.On Tuesday, city recorded 1,717 cases, followed by 51 deaths. This took the total case tally to 679,129 and toll to 13,906. Around 28,258 tests were conducted on Tuesday. The recovery rate in the city is 91% with 679,129 recoveries, and mortality is 2.04%. The positivity rate of 6.06% was recorded. Dharavi has 692 active cases and 5,605 have been discharged.According to state health department data, between April 4 and May 8, the number of cases being reported has steadily gone down on a week-on-week basis from around 60,000 cases to 20,000. However, the death count on a week-on-week basis has only increased but has stagnated in the past one week.As per the data, between April 4 and April 10, 69,037 cases were reported followed by 190 deaths, while between April 11 and April 17, 60,506 cases were reported followed by 357 deaths and between April 18 to April 24, 51,128 cases were reported followed by 425 deaths.In the next two weeks, the weekly cases went down to 30,222 cases between April 25 and May 1, however, the deaths in the same period went up to 533. Lastly, in the week between May 2 to May 8, 21,421 cases were reported followed by 498 deaths. The fatality rate also in this period has almost remained the same, that was 2.41% on April 4, 2.06% on April 22 and 2.03% on May 8.In this period, the bed availability has also improved, and the overall capacity of beds has increased in the same period from around 16,000 beds to around 22,000, as of May 11.The state task force on the other hand claims the fatality rate in the second wave has been much lesser when compared to that of the first wave. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Task Force said, “The deaths will go down in the coming days. The deaths recorded in the second wave’s peak is much lesser than the peak of the first wave. The deaths generally go down in a period of three to six weeks after the peak is over. The death rate increasing has nothing to do with the new strain considering this strain spreads easily, but is less deadly. The deaths are also increasing due to delayed treatment.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are witnessing that the deaths are going down slowly, and they will not go up for now, until we control the number of cases. The deaths are due to the piled up cases of the earlier days. These are referred late to the hospitals from nursing homes or due to delayed treatment or diagnosis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-positivity-rate-falls-to-6-06-deaths-remain-a-concern-101620759987644.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Deaths from Mumbai, MMR dip in 3 months||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded lower daily positivity rate for the third consecutive day, as it saw 40,956 fresh Covid-19 cases. The state tested 217,664 samples in the past 24 hours with a positivity rate of 18.82%. On Monday, the state had a positivity rate of 19.36%, while on Sunday it was 19.56%. However, the state saw a jump in deaths from Monday, as it reported 793 deaths, taking the toll to 77,191. The active caseload in the state declined to 558,996 on Tuesday. Since mid-February, the state has seen nearly 25,000 fatalities with rural and semi-urban areas showing a higher death count compared to the urban areas of Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and Pune district. In the past three months, the share of fatalities from Mumbai, MMR and Pune district has reduced from 51.94% to 43.91%, indicating that deaths are from rural and semi-urban centres in the state spread across 31 districts. Between February 11 and May 11, the state recorded 24,983 fatalities. Till February 11, Mumbai, MMR (which includes Thane district, Navi Mumbai and urban as well as rural areas of Palghar and Raigad districts) and Pune district had 24,707 of the 51,415 deaths. On May 10, of the total deaths, 42,844 came from the 31 districts, while 33,554 were from Mumbai, the MMR and Pune district. Of the 31 districts, 13 districts have reported over 100% increase in deaths between February 11 and May 11. Nandurbar district recorded the highest increase with 222.54% jump in deaths, from 213 to 687. Nanded, Amravati, Washim, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Parbhani and Sindhudurg districts recorded between 179% and 145% jump in deaths in the three-month period. Hingoli, Gondia, Wardha, Chandrapur, Beed, Jalna, Ahmednagar and Latur districts recorded a jump in deaths between 127% and 103.19% during the same period. Health experts and state officials attribute the rise in deaths in the rural and semi-urban areas to higher viral activity in these areas in the second wave and poor health infrastructure that was strained after the sheer caseload. “Compared to the previous wave, the rural and semi-urban areas saw more viral activity. Local body election in January, weddings, public gathering and increased movement of people led to more cases. The public health facilities do not have quality infrastructure. There aren’t enough private hospitals in rural areas, tier-two cities have them, but they are not as good as Mumbai or Pune,” a health department official, who did not wish to be named, said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director-general of health services (Maharashtra) and advisor to the state on Covid-19, said there are multiple factors leading to higher deaths in rural and semi-urban areas, including poor health infrastructure, mutating virus and inadequate quantity of drug and oxygen. “The sheer number of cases that are recorded in the second wave has put pressure on health infrastructure in many districts. One nurse is minding 30 patients, including critical ones, on one night shift. How can one manage? There was a shortage of drugs, oxygen, etc too. Besides, earlier, patients used to be fine within seven days. Now, they become critical after eight to nine days in some cases, leading to deaths,” he said. Dr Salunkhe added that the case fatality rate (CFR) and overall death rate in these districts have not increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deaths-from-mumbai-mmr-dip-in-3-months-101620759927673.html

12-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Poor planning leaves board students stuck||Confusion and lack of coordination within the state education department has left nearly 33 lakh Class 10 and 12 aspirants in the state board in a lurch this year.With the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra and the resultant lockdown, the state government decided to cancel Class 10 SSC exams that was earlier scheduled to be held in June. While the education department declared in April that it will mark Class 10 students based on internal assessments, it later came up with a survey asking schools if considering such assessments to mark students is feasible. The survey brief stated that internal assessment will be based on online classes, WhatsApp-based teaching and assessment, online tests, term examinations, practice tests. “Schools which didn’t undergo these processes will assess their students’ performance based on their Class 9 progress,” as per the survey.The education department also released another survey asking students if they would be willing to take an entrance exam for first-year junior college admissions. Both these surveys, however, exposed the education department’s poor handling of the issue and a lack of coordination between its various wings such as the state board, the MSCERT and its administrative and bureaucratic officials. While the government had formed a committee of experts to provide inputs on the conduct of exams and assessments for the year, members of the group said they were not kept in the loop about the surveys. “We also saw them in some groups and have no idea where it came from. The surveys are not just unscientific but are poorly worded and thus create confusion. While decisions on calculating assessments and conducting entrance tests are yet to be taken, the survey brief almost mentions this as a matter of fact which has confused schools too,” said a member of the expert committee. While the education department had said in April that exams for HSC (Class 12) will be conducted as per the earlier plan in May end, the state board has neither released a timetable nor come up with a notification stating whether or not these exams can be conducted. “Right now, students are just kept in the dark. They don’t know whom to ask. Students need to be told about the status of their exams at least a month in advance. The current situation is just too stressful,” said Ranjana Mahajan, a city-based parent.Officials at the department did not respond to calls and messages.Experts are now calling for better coordination and communication between various wings of the government and the education department. “Communication made to students should be consistent and timely,” added a senior academician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-poor-planning-leaves-board-students-stuck-101620759808208.html

The boy was identified as Vicky Gupta, a commerce student and a resident of Ganesh Nagar.On questioning, the mother of the deceased said that the victim had left his house at 8.30am on Monday and he was to return in an hour.“The boy did not own a mobile phone so the parents could not find out where he was,” said an officer. At 2am on Tuesday when the boy failed to return home, they reported his disappearance.A few hours later the body was found with injury marks pointing to murder. Police are awaiting the autopsy report to find out his cause of death.The officers investigating the case said that a few months ago the deceased had an affair with the daughter of a neighbour who had threatened Gupta that he would kill him if he continued meeting his daughter. “We have detained him, however, we are also investigating other angles which could lead to Gupta’s killer,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-teen-murdered-body-found-near-temple-101620759747753.html

How is one supposed to travel if the fuel prices are increasing every day and local trains shut? Taxes on petrol should be reduced immediately.” said Nitin Rathore, a Bandra resident.“Lakhs and crores of rupees, as well as lives, were wasted in recent elections and nobody questioned their source, perhaps money recovered from excess taxation is siphoned for that purpose only as it does not reflect in any tangible benefit to the common man. Instead of providing any relief or facility to the people, the government is trying to squeeze the last drop of blood from them,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-price-hike-1l-of-petrol-costs-98-12-diesel-8948-101620759687670.html
12-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra diverts jabs for 18+ to keep 2nd shots for 45+ moving||Amid the shortage of vaccine doses against the rising number of beneficiaries above the age of 45 waiting for their second shots, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday decided to divert 310,000 Covaxin doses meant for those aged between 18 and 44 to the 45+ age group. Even though state health minister Rajesh Tope stopped short of suspending the inoculation drive for the 18-44 age group, officials feel it is likely to be halted owing to limited sessions. Maharashtra has more than 2.1 million people above 45 years whose second dose is due, of which more than 500,000 are awaiting the second Covaxin shot. Tope said the decision to divert the stock was taken after the Centre asked states to use the stock procured for the third phase of the drive — the 18-44 age group. He said all vaccination centres have been directed to divert the stock . The state has received 600,000 doses of Covishield and 36,000 of Covaxin this week. Of them, 350,000 doses of Covishield were for the 18-44 age group, while the remaining stock was for 45+. Covishield is an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Indian Council of Medical Research.“I spoke to union heath minister Dr Harsh Vardhanji, requesting him for additional stock for the second doses of people above 45 years. He, however, informed us about the unavailability of doses and asked us to utilise the stock procured for the 18-44 age group. After talking with chief minister Uddhav Thackerayji, we have decided to divert the stock of 310,000 doses of Covaxin, which will now be made available for the second dose [for 45+]. This includes 275,000 doses of Covaxin procured by the state for 18-44 years and 35,000 supplied by the Centre,” said Tope.“More than 500,000 people are waiting for second dose of Covaxin, while 1.6 million people are due for their second dose of Covishield. The diversion of the stock is expected to slow down the vaccination drive for the age group of 18-44 years. We will take a call how to go about the drive for this age group by talking to the task force,” he said.“There is unrest among the people whose second dose is due as the uncertainty over the availability of the doses looms large. There was no other option, but to divert the stock procured by us from SII and Bharat Biotech. We can begin the vaccination of age group of 18-44 years with the stock of Covishield as and when we receive it,” said an official from the health department.Maharashtra has vaccinated 15,140,471 people with 18,787,531 doses, with 375,713 administered on Tuesday.“It is the responsibility of the Centre to provide the vaccines to the state for the vaccination of those above 45 years, but it is not being fulfilled by them. There will be no desired effect achieved if the second dose is not administered within a stipulated period. We have written to both SII and Bharat Biotech but there is no positive response from them. Perhaps the demand raised by us is huge in quantity,” Tope said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has, however, said state governments should reserve at least 70% of stock supplied to them by the Centre for the second does. He said the states should prioritise the administration of second doses to address the issue of the large number of people waiting for their second doses.Maharashtra’s BJP unit has, however, slammed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, saying the shortage was because of mismanagement. “Tope has announced to suspend the drive for the age group of 18-44 by blaming the Centre. In fact, the shortage is because of the mismanagement and failure to procure the vaccine. The MVA government did not pay the manufacturers within the stipulated time and hence they have not been responding to the government positively. After the decision of procuring doses from two manufacturers was taken on April 28, the payment was done only on May 7,” he accused.Tope also said the Centre should give nod to other international companies for the supply of their vaccines in India. “The Centre should give the approvals to other vaccines, like they have given it to Sputnik V. We are ready to import them through global tenders. The Central authorities should act on this, so that state can directly procure them through global tenders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-diverts-jabs-for-18-to-keep-2nd-shots-for-45-moving-101620758967648.html

She confessed that she along with others made a video of the victim in which she alleged that Anil Malik, who is associated with Kisan Social Army had misbehaved with her when they were coming to Tikri from West Bengal in a train,” the DSP said.“We have formed three teams to arrest them. Four persons were booked apart from the two accused as the victim’s father had mentioned the role of these six persons in the case. If any of them is found to be innocent, we will give them a clean chit,” the DSP said.The SIT also interrogated Yogendra Yadav . “Police recorded my statement. I shared information about the case and assured full cooperation as the truth should come out,“ said Yadav.The DSP added that they have searched the farmers’ tents at Tikri border after co-accused Anup Singh’s video came to fore in which he was seen sitting in a tent.Meanwhile, co-accused Anup has said that they were sleeping in the train when Malik misbehaved with the victim.“The woman had narrated the incident to her father once we reached Tikri. Her health started deteriorating and the farm leaders decided to send her back with Malik and me. When we reached Hansi, Yogendra Yadav asked us to come back and start her treatment at any hospital in Delhi so we returned. There was no abduction.

12-05-2021||Chandigarh||This is war and there’s no time to cry for our losses: PGI Covid panel head||Dr GD Puri, a noted name in the field of anaesthesia, has been at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19 in the region.Head of the department of anaesthesiology and intensive care at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, he also heads the Covid-19 management committee of the premier tertiary care institute. Having closely monitored patients requiring critical care at the institute’s Covid-19 dedicated block, he shares with Hindustan Times what it is like to deal with the unprecedented second wave, when resources run short and tough decisions are to be taken in the nick of time:Q. What are the challenges in dealing with the new virus strains?A. The main issue is the manifold rise in infection numbers and subsequent need for hospitalisation, which has overwhelmed our Covid-19 facility. In the last week of April, there was a tsunami of patients at our Emergency, and our resources got exhausted. Important medications went out of stock, we had to open new wards for patients, and all this sapped out our energy and motivation. We are even seeing young patients from Chandigarh coming with 70% oxygen saturation, as they could not arrange a bed or did not report on time.Q. How is the patient load being managed? What are the criteria for admissions in critical care wards?A. I carry guilt in my heart when I say this, but it is very difficult for us to choose between two patients for giving intensive care. You have to make this decision that if a patient is young and has no comorbidities, they will be shifted to the ICU at the cost of an old person, who let us say has kidney or liver failure. It is not like that we abandon the old patients, but we could have given them more intensive care. We could have pushed a little more. This is sad for us too, but you have to move on. This is war and there is no time to cry for our losses. Q. Are you getting enough oxygen supply for Covid, non-Covid and surgical patients?A. I can tell you with authority that we can increase our critical care beds, but the oxygen supply is limited. There has to be a holistic approach for distributing the resources, and it should be strictly as per the requirements. We are saving every unit of oxygen. Wherever there is a possibility of oxygen wastage, we have plugged it, and new guidelines have been provided to all departments on its judicious use.Q. The fatality rate in the region is going up exponentially? What could be the reasons?A. Since the infection number is increasing, deaths are bound to increase, but there can be other reasons as well. There is a need to ensure uniformity in treatment being given by smaller nursing homes. There is a lot of irrational use of drugs, steroids, and antibiotics, which results in deterioration of condition of such patients and decreases their chance of survival.Q. When is the situation expected to improve?A. From the example of Delhi, we can expect that after four to six weeks of restrictions, the cases plateau and start to decline. So, we can soon expect the outcomes of restrictions imposed in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-is-war-and-there-s-no-time-to-cry-for-our-losses-pgi-covid-panel-head-101620758608230.html

Of this, 80 MT is being supplied to Haryana, 20 MT to Punjab and the rest is left for Delhi.“Soon after the second wave of Covid hit the country last month, there was a huge pressure to meet the demand of liquid medical oxygen in multiple states, we have never faced such a situation but are working hard to ensure that no patient dies due to lack of oxygen,” said a senior official of the refinery.He said in the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen, Indian Oil has diverted high-purity oxygen used in its mono ethylene glycol unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at the Panipat refinery.K John Prasad, chief general manager (corporate Communications) IOC, said that the throughput of the unit has been scaled down to serve the more critical cause and the Indian Oil is converting 14 LNG tankers of 17 MT each into medical grade oxygen carriers to strengthen the medical oxygen logistics in country.“By next week, over 20 road tankers and 25 ISO containers of about 820 MT combined capacity will be pressed into action by the corporation,” he said, adding that over the next six months, they will manufacture 10 cryogenic road tankers at heir cryogenic plant in Nasik.To further streamline the medical oxygen supply scenario, they have launched a single-window app, Sanjeevani Express, to enable real-time monitoring of liquid oxygen supply.On whether the supply will be increased as a 500-bed Covid hospital is being set up near the plant, he said, “We are producing as per capacity and since the hospital is being set up in Haryana it will have oxygen supply from Haryana’s allocation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panipat-plant-per-day-production-reaches-over-270-mt-to-meet-o2-need-in-country-101620758433710.html

12-05-2021||Kolkata||BJP’s Bengal poll tally to go down to 75; two MPs who contested to resign||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) tally in the West Bengal assembly will go down to 75 from the existing 77 as two Lok Sabha members who contested the polls will resign to remain in the Parliament, HT has learnt.The MPs are Nisith Pramanik from Cooch Behar Lok Sabha constituency in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district and Jagannath Sarkar, the MP from Ranaghat in south Bengal’s Nadia district. While Pramanik contested the Dinhata seat in Cooch Behar, Sarkar was fielded from Shantipur in Nadia.The BJP did exceptionally well in the north Bengal region, winning 30 of the 54 assembly seats. It suffered in south Bengal where 240 seats helped the TMC win the polls.Although the BJP’s other newly-elected MLAs took oath alongside the 213 TMC legislators last week, Pramanik and Sarkar did not come to Kolkata. The BJP state leadership said some MLAs had to stay in their constituencies in the wake of post-poll violence but the absence of the two MPs triggered speculations that they might not resign from Parliament since holding on to two Lok Sabha seats in Bengal is more important for the BJP in view of the assembly poll results.In 2019, the BJP bagged 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats and created a record.The saffron camp had vowed to oust the TMC government by winning more than 200 seats. The final verdict, however, came as a setback although the party’s star candidate and former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari defeated Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee in East Midnapore district’s Nandigram by 1,900 votes.The assembly elections were held in 292 of the state’s 294 seats as two candidates at two seats in Murshidabad district died of Covid-19 during the unprecedented eight-phase polling. Polls in these constituencies will be held later. Once Pramanik and Sarkar resign as MLAs, fresh polls will have to be conducted in their constituencies as well. Mamata Banerjee, too, has to get elected to the assembly to remain a chief minister. The same rule applies to finance minister Amit Mitra who did not contest the polls. He virtually took oath on Monday.“We have to follow the decisions of our party,” Pramaik said on Tuesday.“Staying in Parliament is more important, feels the leadership,” added Sarkar.In the assembly polls, BJP sprang a surprise by naming Union minister Babul Supriyo, three other sitting Lok Sabha members and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta alongside several actors and former TMC leaders in its list of candidates. Two Lok Sabha MPs, Supriyo and Locket Chatterjee lost the polls. Dasgupta, who had to resign from the Rajya Sabha to contest, was defeated too.While Supriyo is a two-time MP, Chatterjee, Pramanik and Sarkar went to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 2019.Pramanik contested from Dinhata against the TMC’s Udayan Guha, who was a minister during the Left Front era and left his party, the Forward Bloc, to join the ruling party after 2011. After the polls, Guha was injured in an assault, allegedly carried out by BJP workers, in Dinhata town. His right arm got fractured.“Given the wave it is riding right now, the TMC is likely to win all the seats where fresh polls will be held,” said Kolkata-based political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay.Meanwhile, in a tweet, TMC MP Derek O'Brien wrote, "BJP fielded 4 sitting LS MPs, incl a Union Min & 1 RS MP for #BengalPolls. 3 lost. 2 won. Now these 2 to quit as MLAs😜They were elected last week! World’s largest (sic) party have set a world record for electoral egg on face."One Nation One Election!

Those who have recovered from Covid-19 should be vigilant as post-Covid Mucormycosis has become a cause of concern in the second wave. The mortality rate is almost 50% where the brain is involved and about 20% in nasal and orbital involvement. Judicious use of steroids in treatment of Covid-19 and strict control over blood glucose levels can bring down the risk of Mucormycosis.”Doctors at Noble, where a patient underwent reconstructive surgery after losing his eye two weeks ago, said hospital has seen about 40 cases in the last one month alone.Dr Abhishek Ghosh, a microvascular reconstructive surgeon from Noble hospital who treated the patient, said, “From mid-March to mid-April, we saw six to seven cases. Recently, in the last 30 days we have seen 30 to 40 cases of Mucormycosis. Around 80 per cent of people do well post treatment. Because of increased awareness, we are able to save a patient’s eyesight, as they are coming at early stages. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in saving vision and life in such patients.”Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble hospital said, “We are not able to admit more non-Covid19 patients due to unavailability of beds, but we are seeing a rising number of such patients.”Ruby hall has about 15 such patients currently undergoing treatment. Also Rising Medicare hospital, Symbiosis Lavale hospital, Rao Nursing home and Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital are all treating black fungus cases.Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said, “Currently there are three cases of Mucormycosis under treatment and we have seen 10 cases which came in in just the last two months. We also saw two deaths due to the infection.”District administration does not have a count on how many such cases have been reported in the city. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said, “We do not have any such number on how many reported cases of Mucormycosis. However, the district task force has sent out an advisory to government hospitals to take all necessary precautions and seek administrative help when required.”Free treatment for Mucormycosis: Tope In view of the costly treatment, the state government has decided to include expenses under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. “The treatment for Mucormycosis is costly. So the government has decided that Mucormycosis patients will be treated for free under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana,” said Maharashtra health Minister Rajesh Tope speaking to reporters in Mumbai.According to the health minister, 2,000 cases have been reported and eight people have died of this infection in the state so far. “We are making special wards for these patients. An awareness campaign to educate people about the infection will also be organised while government is planning to procure drugs to treat the infection,” Tope said.“The incidence of Mucormycosis among corona patients with uncontrolled diabetes is on the rise and the state government has decided to procure 0.1 million injectable vials effective against the disease. A request has been made to Haffkine Institute for the same and the procurement process will be carried out by issuing a tender,” he said.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter welcomed the government decision to offer free treatment for Mucormycosis.“It is known that this fungal infection of Mucormycosis is common in diabetics and in cases of Covid-19 treated by injudicious use of steroids. We, at IMA are making our members aware of the above facts and training them in proper treatment. We are sure that the government will show a similar proactive approach,” stated IMA in a press release issues on Tuesday.Mucormycosis – keep black fungus at bayInfection mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness, commonly known as low-immunity status or immune compromised individuals.Early signs include headache, facial numbness, nasal stuffiness, reduced vision, vision loss, inability to open the eye and redness in the eye.If you notice any symptoms, immediately visit doctor for diagnostic nasal endoscopy examination. Mucormycosis is seen in the deep areas of the nose and sinuses (as blackish discoloured mucosa), which may not be visualised by conventional methods of nose examination.Early diagnosis with MRI &CT scan of nose, sinuses, jaw bones, orbit and brain will formulate treatment protocol.This will include early administration of antifungal drugs, tight control of blood sugar level , plus timely intervention by endoscopic radical debridement surgery to reduce fungal load from sinuses.Treatment consists of tight control of blood sugar levels (daily basis) and maintaining normal function of kidneys and other organs.However in instances where the disease is detected late and involves eye/ jaw bones, extensive surgery may be the only choice and can result in disfigurement of face.In some cases the treatment may involve a multidisciplinary approach and involve a physician, diabetologist, infectious disease expert, microbiologist, ENT endoscopy surgeon, eye surgeon, oral surgeon, neuro physician, nephrologist and neurosurgeon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-hospitals-claiming-rise-in-number-of-black-fungus-cases-state-to-give-free-treatment-for-mucormycosis-condition-101620744686687.html
