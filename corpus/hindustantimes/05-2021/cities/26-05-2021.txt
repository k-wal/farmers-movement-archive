The victim, Dr Sandeep Jaiswal, a resident of Balajipuram colony in Matiyari runs a private hospital Harshit hospital and trauma centre at Sarvodaya Nagar. “He suffered bullet injury in his jaw and the bullet is stuck somewhere between his jawline and back of the head. He has been admitted to trauma centre of KGMU in a critical condition. Doctors have kept him under observation for 24 hours before operating him to remove the bullet,” said Lucknow deputy commissioner of police (DCP), east, Sanjiv Suman.The DCP said the incident took place when Dr Jaiswal was returning home in his SUV. The assailants in another SUV intercepted his vehicle nearly 200 metres before his house and first attacked with a brick to break the wind shield of the doctor’s SUV and then opened fire on him. “The police have found CCTV footages of the incident in which the assailants are seen fleeing from the spot in a white SUV towards Barabanki,” he said adding that a bullet shell has also been recovered from the scene.Suman further said the locals, who claimed to have heard sound of two shots, rushed Dr Jaiswal to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital from where he was later shifted to trauma centre.The DCP said the assailants were following the doctor’s vehicle from Sarvodaya Nagar when he left for home from his hospital. He said the police were trying to recreate the crime sequence and efforts were on to nab the assailants.The officer added that the assailants’ modus operandi suggested that the crime was committed in a fit of rage. The hired shooters would not take risk to ride on SUV while executing the crime and would have opted for bike for this purpose, he said.Suman said the initial probe hints towards some disputes related to his hospital and personal life but the doctor’s family has so far not levelled allegations against anyone.Another senior official privy to the probe said “We are investigating on both the lines and trying to ascertain the exact reason behind the attack. It would be easy to trace the assailants after the exact motive is clear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknowbased-doctor-shot-at-by-suv-borne-assailants-critical-101622053634118.html
26-05-2021||Noida||Illegal international telephone exchange busted in Noida, three nabbed||Noida: Three people were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly running an unauthorised international telephone exchange in Sector 62. Police said that the illegal operation was causing revenue losses to the department of telecommunications and posing a threat to national security.The suspects were identified as Owais Alam, a resident of Moradabad and Pushpendra Kumar and Pawan Kumar, residents of Ghaziabad. According to police, Alam had purchased an office space for ₹50 lakh in a business park in Sector 62 in December last year. In addition, he also purchased licences for 12 PRI (primary rate interface) lines, which is used for internet voice calls, from a private company, police said.“An abnormality was discovered by the company when it was found that instead of receiving or making the calls, the lines were being used to transfer them. A complaint was made with us. Then a probe in the matter was initiated, following which a raid was conducted today and the three suspects were apprehended,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police officials said that the suspects were routing the calls through the lines to their own server. Police also recovered a car, several laptops, desktops, technical gadgets, and several SIM cards, among others, from the suspects.“The revenue which would have gone to the telecom companies was instead going to the suspects creating losses for the telecom department. And the caller identities were not showing in the call detail records, which was a threat to national security. We have alerted the agencies concerned as well about the matter,” said Singh.Most of these calls were being generated from the Middle East, said police.Police officials said that the operation mastermind is a Mumbai-based man who had designed the proxy server. He had prior experience in web development projects. He has an M.Sc in IT and a work experience with calling software at a US-based MNC, the officials said, adding that the man is yet to be arrested. According to police, in 2017, Alam started an exchange from Sector 63 before moving to Sector 62. He was also running another such exchange from his house in Moradabad where a raid was conducted as well, said police, adding that at least three more named suspects are wanted in the case. Police are also working to trace the foreign IP address to see if an illegal exchange had also been set up on the other end. They have identified five bank accounts of the suspects to trace money. Alam owned property worth ₹1 crore in Noida which is also being looked at, said police. The suspects were booked at Sector 58 police station under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Indian Telegraph Act, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/illegal-international-telephone-exchange-busted-in-noida-three-nabbed-101622053394112.html

The BSP government had planned to equip the villages with basic facilities. After grabbing power, the rival political parties dumped the village development schemes.

Wishing the people good health and life on the occasion of ‘Buddha Purnima’, the BSP chief said Gautam Buddha gave the message of universal peace, non-violence and brotherhood. Buddha devoted his life to the service of humanity. Today when the people were facing crisis due to the Covid pandemic, the message and teachings of Buddha could provide them solace and courage, she said. Mayawati said the four BSP governments launched several development projects and welfare schemes to highlight contribution of Gautam Buddha, including Gautam Buddha University, Gautam Buddha highways, airstrip in Kapilvastu, guest houses and Gautam Buddha parks.

Patients’ details have been uploaded on the portal but we got only two vials in four days. Doctors said that if they get four vials per day, they will scrape off the fungus,” he added.Rohit Kumar, of Hisar, said his uncle is admitted at Maharaja Agrasen Medical College, Agroha (MAMC) in Hisar and his health is deteriorating as he could not get vials as his UHID and prescribing doctor’s sign were missing.“We are hoping to get the vials on Thursday but two vials are not enough,” he added.Union minister for chemicals and fertilizer Sadanand Gowda tweeted that Haryana had 436 black fungus patients till May 25 and 1,110 vials of amphotericin-B drug, used in treatment of mucormycosis, were allocated to Haryana.Dr Aditya Bhargava, head of ENT department at PGIMS, said 60 vials are averagely required to treat a black fungus patient.PGIMS, Rohtak medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya said 104 black fungus patients are undergoing treatment at the institution and they had received over 100 vials on Tuesday, and all of these were used.“I have talked to the expert committee and asked them to provide us more vials so that we can treat patients effectively and aggressively. We can start with liposomal amphotericin injection, and switch to other drugs if that is not available. Amphotericin-B deoxycholate is also effective, but can cause kidney damage,” she said.“We are exploring other drugs that can be used to treat black fungus patients in shortage of liposomal amphotericin. I told the doctors to share details of new confirmed cases with the expert committee so that they can provide us vials after accessing a patient’s case,” she added.Dr Jasneet, nodal officer at World Medical College, Jhajjar said they got only 10 drugs and eight patients are undergoing treatment at the institution.One of the state expert committee members, Dr RS Chauhan, head of ophthalmology at PGIMS, said they are equally distributing anti-fungal drugs to the patients.“Once we get new supply, we again distribute it equally to all patients undergoing treatment,” he added.“We had already sent the prescription of 60 vials per patient. Some patients need 2-3 vials per day and some need more. We have to see the severity of the patients. We are receiving two vials per patient in two to three days of time because of shortage of drugs. We are giving the allocated drug to patients for whom it is approved,” Dr Bhargava added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expert-committee-approving-only-2-vials-per-day-for-black-fungus-patient-in-haryana-101622051174641.html
26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s global vaccine bid may get response from Sputnik||The global tender floated by the Haryana government on Wednesday to purchase 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses is more likely to get a response from Russian manufactured Sputnik V than any other global manufacturer.This is because Sputnik V is the only vaccine besides Covishield of Serum Institute of India and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech which has been granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), officials said.The two dose Gam-Covid-Vac combined vector vaccine, popularly known as Sputnik-V, has been developed by M/s Gamaleya Institute, Russia and is approved in 30 countries across the globe. US manufactured Pfizer BioNTech Covid vaccine which had also applied for EUA had withdrawn after the DCGI decided not to approve it.Haryana’s tender document though has allowed manufacturers who have applied for DCGI approval to bid for the Covid vaccine though their purchase orders will be issued only after an approval by the DCGI. The Covid vaccine storage condition of 2-8°C stipulated in the bid document also covers all available vaccines.While Dr Reddy’s Lab has an agreement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to sell 250 million doses of Sputnik V, the RDIF has entered into partnership with six companies to collectively contract manufacture more than 850 million doses.CHINA STANDS DEBARRED FROM BIDDINGChina which manufactures Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines stands debarred from participating in the global tender.“Bidder or manufacturers of Covid vaccine should not belong to countries sharing borders with India,” said a clause in the tender document for the Covid vaccine.Officials said the clause debarring China is in line with the restrictions imposed by central government in public procurement from bidders of certain countries on grounds of defence or national security.As per the notice inviting online bids floated by the Haryana Medical Services Corporation Ltd (HMSCL), Covid vaccine manufacturers, their Indian partners or direct importers are eligible to participate in the tender.The bidding will be conducted through open competitive bidding following a two-bid process - technical and financial bid. The bids close on June 4 and technical bids will be opened the same day.The bidder should have a valid license to manufacture and export the vaccine to India as per specifications mentioned in the tender from the competent authority or the food and drugs administration.PRICE FALL CLAUSEA price fall clause in the tender document said that if at any time during execution of the contract, the controlled price becomes lower or the contractor reduces the sale price or sells or offer to sell vaccine at a price lower than the price chargeable under the contract, then the price payable under the contract for the vaccine supplied will stand correspondingly reduced.“The quantity mentioned is only indicative and may be increased or decreased as per requirement. Bidders can also quote items under any of Indian, British or United States or European Pharmacopoeia but should clearly mention the same at the time of bidding the same,” the tender said.The bidder should have manufactured and supplied satisfactorily vaccines either directly or through authorised dealer to any national government of which at least 30 million doses should have been supplied in the last one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-global-vaccine-bid-may-get-response-from-sputnik-101622051118343.html

The members who are doing this volunteer service have their private businesses and are in the age group of 40 to 60 years.JSD member Chaman Lal Gulati says they attend to all bodies irrespective of their religion. “We arranged burial for six Muslims even,” he said.“We have been cremating unclaimed bodies for the past ten years, but I never saw such a large number of deaths as we even cremated 35 bodies in a day,” said another member Kapil Malhotra. At the peak of the pandemic earlier this month they were cremating bodies round the clock, having their food in the cremation ground itself, he added.“Kin of most of the victims didn’t even stay to witness the cremation, and nobody came to collect the ashes of 35 victims. We had to take them to Haridwar for immersion,” said Gulati.They said since March last year, they have spent most of the time with the Covid victims but not even a single member of the team got infected. Each member of the team gets himself tested for Covid every fourth day.According to them, the second wave is now receding and the number of daily Covid deaths has come down to four-five from 15-20 earlier. The JSD has hundreds of regular donors and it also provide free ambulance service, free food and medical assistance to the poor Covid patients.However, there is big difference in number of deaths claimed by the district health authorities and the number of bodies cremated by the JSD. The state health department records only 406 Covid victims in Panipat district. The officials said that several patients from NCR districts especially from Delhi also died in different hospitals.Panipat chief medical officer Dr Jitender Kadyan said, “In our record, we have reported the deaths of people, who belonged to the district and they (JSD) might have also cremated bodies of people who do not belong to Panipat.”Panipat’s nodal officer for Covid Ravinder Malik also gave the same explanation. Panipat deputy commissioner Dharmender Singh did not respond to the phone calls and text messages sent to him for his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/never-saw-such-rush-of-bodies-before-say-panipat-volunteers-101622050694718.html

They cannot even justify that the wave will affect children at large,” he said.On preparations and infrastructure in Haryana, Vij said the state is ready for any eventuality and there are dedicated paediatric facilities in hospitals (Nikoo ward) for this.Vij said the wastage data of Covid vaccine has also been rectified after compiling all figures and there is currently 2-2.5% vaccine wastage in state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-force-anyone-but-people-believe-in-ayurveda-vij-on-coronil-distribution-101622050575155.html

He has instituted proactive measures to enable early completion of the investigations,” read a statement from the defence spokesperson. The statement also pointed out that the investigation began due to an initial tip-off by the sources inside the Indian Army about the leak of question paper for soldier recruitment entrance test that was to be held at 40 centres across the country for 30,000 aspirants on February 28. “Timely actions and wholehearted support by Army to the police is reflective of Army’s resolve to weed out mal practices and make the existing recruitment system fool proof and robust. The interest in the youth to join Armed forces needs no reiteration. The Army therefore continues to implement strict checks and balances to ensure a transparent recruitment process,” reads a part of the statement. In a statement in the early days of the investigation, the Army officials had stated a joint investigation in the paper leak.

In three different duffle bags, the men were carrying 279 African spurred tortoise, 1,207 iguanas, and 230 beta fish, according to a statement issued by GRP. The duo was caught by the GRP team led by police inspector Maula Sayyed during a routine patrol of Chennai express on Tuesday.

Both the arrested men delivered packaged fish for a living. The two have been handed over to the customs department officials for further investigation as they had no proof of having paid the custom fee for transport of the animals. “When they seized these animals, we were informed, and a team of forest officials went there. We realised immediately that these are not Indian origin animals. So, we did not think it was appropriate to book them under the Wildlife Protection Act,” said Rahul Patil, district forest officer, Pune.

According to the police, the accused promised the victim that he would pay handsome commission on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which he would transfer in his company account on the condition that he would share 50 per cent of that amount. The victim identified as Anil Mhaske (47) agreed to the deal and asked his friend who had a company account to deposit the money with Wani. The accused then prepared a bogus Demand Draft (DD) of ₹7 crore and showed it to him and said that he will deposit the same in the account for credit but did not do as promised. In the meantime, Mhaske had credited the amount in his account and thereafter Wani became evasive and avoided the victim, police said. Mhaske sensed something fishy and lodged a complaint with the cyber cell. Police inspector Dagadu Hake said that Wani showed as if he was a very big person and promised him the money through giving CSR funds. “The victim fell prey to his machinations and informed his friend about the account in which the money will come. Accordingly, they transferred ₹7.25 lakh to the accused. In the meantime, they got alerted due to his behaviour and a complaint was lodged. We are in search of two persons who were in the know of the entire thing and we are closing on the accused who had prepared a bogus DD to assist the accused in the crime. It seems that there are many other angles in the crime, and they will be unraveled soon.

The national average of wastage of doses is 6.3%.

The data came at a time when the Covid-19 vaccination drive has slowed down or halted across the country amid repeated complaints by many states regarding vaccine shortage.“The government of Jharkhand is fully focused on utilising it’s available vaccine doses in the most prudent manner possible, ensuring minimal wastage. We hope to minimise it further with more focused vaccination awareness campaigns in deep forested and other rural areas of the state,” the CM’s office statement said.

On Tuesday, 23 private hospitals could get only 50 doses of Amphotericin-B for 221 patients admitted there. “Usually, four to six doses of Amphotericin-B are to be administered on the first day of treatment to black fungus patients. After that, three to four doses are needed every day for the next 10-days,” said Dr Ravi Dosi, head, Chest Diseases Department in Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS). A doctor working with a private hospital said the shortage of Amphotericin-B has been adversely affecting the treatment of black fungus patients. Officials said city's four stockists are currently providing Amphotericin-B injections but its supply remains extremely low against the huge demand forcing the distressed family members of the patients to do rounds of medicine stores. Some of the needy have started seeking help on social media, they added. According to officials, more than 350 patients of black fungus remain admitted in local government and private health institutions. These include patients from other districts of the state in addition to those from Indore. Cases of mucormycosis, a serious infection, have been found in Covid-19 patients in various states. Black fungus infection is found in some of the patients recovering from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/shortage-of-amphotericin-b-in-indore-as-black-fungus-cases-rise-101622038367203.html

District officials and officials of the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (Maharail) have started the land measurement process. In Khed tehsil, however, they is a strong resistance from four villages. Land owners from these villages have sought clarity on the proposed construction plan as agricultural lands are going to be divided. The issue of low monetary returns in exchange for fertile agricultural land, has also been raised. The proposed length of the semi-high-speed railway line is 235 km. There are 24 stations and 18 tunnels planned on the route. The speed of the train will be 200 km per hour and the expected cost of the project is ₹16,039 crore. This railway line is expected to reduce travelling time between Pune and Nashik to two hours. A total of 1,458 hectares in 107 villages across three districts will be acquired for this project. Land owners in villages such as Holewadi, Manjarewadi, Rase and Kelgaon in Khed tehsil have also raised objections. “I have three acres in Holewadi and one acre is going to be affected by this project. There is no clarity from the rail officers about planning. My land is going to be divided in two parts. How am I supposed to access the other part? They haven’t said anything about a red- zone area that land is going to remain empty and inaccessible. We should get returns on that also. We repeatedly have conveyed our objections to the officers. They have come for land measurement, so we had to take a stand to clarify the doubts,” said Jaysing Manjare, a resident of Manjarewadi. Another villager who will be losing his land in this project claimed that the rates offered for the acquisition are less than the current market price. “They are saying Takarkdwadi will be a station. If it is a junction, then more land will be needed. Also the rates which they have offered are low. If a farmer is losing his substantial means of livelihood, he should get good returns,” said Satish Rakshe, resident of Rase. In March 2021, Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister, okayed the pending Pune-Nashik railway project in his annual budget for 2021-22. The rail line will pass through Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. Land acquisition has begun in these three districts. Vikrant Chavhan, sub-divisional officer of Khed tehsil, said that all efforts are being made to convince the land owners. “We have held meetings in four villages in Khed tehsil. Residents of Holewadi did not let us measure the land. It is understandable that people have apprehensions. Holewadi and Manjarewadi are near Khed, and have irrigation. The rate for land is higher there. We are trying to address problems and resolve doubts,” said Chavhan. An officer of the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation admitted resistance from these villages in Khed. “The land acquisition process began in April. Resistance is there in some pockets. We are trying to address their issues. We have been trying to resolve the issues of the land owners in Khed,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.Pune Nashik semi-high-speed railway lineLine will pass through main districts of Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik, and offer connectivity to industrial zones like Chakan, Khed and NarayangaonLength: 235.15km Speed potential: 200kmph Travel time from Pune to Nashik: two hoursStations proposed: 24Tunnels: 18Project cost: ₹16,039 crore (approx.)(Source: MAHARAIL website)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punenashik-railway-line-runs-into-objections-from-villagers-in-khed-101622039173341.html

Shivaji Lanke, superintendent engineer of the construction department of the PMC, said, “As of date, PMC has spent ₹2 crore on restoration of the wada structure. Now we will restore this Meghdambari which is made of wood. We have been given six months to complete the work.”Vishrambaug wada, influenced by the Peshwa style of architecture, was built in 1807 AD, designed by Mansaram Laxman and Daji Suthar. “In the late 1950s, when Pune was a municipal council, it was used as an administrative building,” Lanke added. The wada is primarily built out of wood and decorated with cypress tree-shaped columns. Each of these columns is built from a single teak tree, a traditional residential form of Maratha architecture. The wada sits on an acre-and-a-half of land.Meanwhile, the PMC will audit all dilapidated buildings, including wadas, before the monsoon. The PMC has also started a structural audit of its employee residential complexes, located at Wakdewadi, Pandav Nagar (Ghorpade peth), Rajewadi (Nana peth), Sane Gurujinagar and Rajendranagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/standing-committee-sanctions-150-crore-for-restoration-project-at-vishrambaug-wada-101622037913342.html
26-05-2021||Bangalore||City juice shop helps make soaps, candles from fruit waste||Famous all across Bengaluru, juice shop Eat Raja is known for its zero-waste policy. It doesn’t provide plastic glasses, straws or even tissues. Instead, everything in the shop is either reusable or a fruit product. Making the initiative truly zero waste, the juice counter also uses its fruit waste to make products such as candles and soaps and artworks such as rangoli.Anand Raaj, the owner, takes immense pride in describing his methods. “We only generate fruit waste and have a 7 x 11 segregation method. We have seven bins, out of which two are for paper and plastic that may have come from chilli powder wrappers or strawberry containers, etc. The rest of the five bins are for specific wet wastes,” says Raaj.This separated waste is used as a multipurpose tool by Raaj. He feeds the non-citrus waste to cows and uses the citrus ones to make bio enzymes. Even the seeds that are procured after making the juice are dried, filtered and used by his mother to make rangoli back at home. “After the segregation, we use the fruit pulp to make soaps, such as cucumber or strawberry soaps. It is also used to make candles by mixing the juice with wax. These are mainly fruit-infused candles and soaps. The leftover peels are turned into a powdered substance that can be used in beauty masks, facial products,” he adds.Eat Raja is also working on a 100% zero-waste delivery initiative with Zomato, which will roll out soon. Passionate about environmental protection since his college days, Raaj shares, “In college, I was a part of a club which would conduct green drives to ensure the safety of the environment. Now that I have a shop, I ensure that those principles are followed here. My mother comes from a village where these practices are a day-to-day routine. It’s just that urbanisation has made it easier for us to waste things. It’s time for us to educate the next generation about such methods and their importance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/city-juice-shop-helps-make-soaps-candles-from-fruit-waste-101622037673978.html

Though the administration has assured people of easing Covid curbs if the number of coronavirus cases shows a steady decline over the next few days, the growers of these cash crops are keeping their fingers crossed. Also read: ‘A new weapon’: Dr Naresh Trehan on Covid-19 antibody cocktail“We had a good crop this year but if we aren’t able to sell the produce in the market, it is worrying. Last year, we suffered losses due to the stringent lockdown,” says Irfan Khan, who grows strawberries on six kanals at Gussu on the outskirts of Srinagar. “We used to sell most of our crop to local dealers as the consumption is good here itself,” he says. Relaxation sought for selling strawberries Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat has written to the divisional administration, seeking marketing facilities for the strawberry growers during the lockdown. “Being a perishable fruit, strawberry needs immediate marketing. The fruit lasts only for 15 to 20 days after plucking,” Bhat wrote in his letter to the Kashmir divisional commissioner recently. He sought relaxation of a few hours for street vendors to sell strawberries. “Strawberry are full of antioxidants and rich in Vitamin C so they are good for immunity-boosting, especially for Covid-19 patients,” he said, adding that due to non-relaxation of the pandemic restrictions the growers could suffer losses. Shift to strawberries recent Strawberry farming is a recent practice in Kashmir. Most farmers in Srinagar and parts of Ganderbal who shifted to strawberry farming used to grow vegetables earlier. Gussu has the highest number of people growing strawberries and it was a profitable venture till the pandemic struck. Some farmers grow other fruits on their land to make more profit. Bhat said that due to less production, almost all the strawberries get sold in the local markets itself. “Due to the lockdown, we are looking to open sales points so that the growers won’t suffer losses,” he said. Inter-cropping, high-density apple advised Bhat visited Gussu village and interacted with strawberry growers and advised them to adopt inter-cropping and to go for high-density apple as well. “This will help growers earn even better,” he said. Officials said that strawberries are grown on more than 250 hectares in Kashmir and most of the cash crop is grown in villages of central Kashmir, especially on Srinagar’s outskirts. “The annual strawberry production is more than 2,000 to 2,500 metric tonnes and the growers earn more than ₹15 to 20 crore,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/strawberry-growers-worried-covid-could-upset-applecart-in-jk-101622030053695.html

He added if Indians were inoculated on time, the impact of the second wave of the pandemic could have been less and so many people would not have to die.Addressing a press conference over Covid situation in the national capital, Kejriwal said, “India delayed vaccination by six months. Six months ago, several countries started inoculating their citizens at a mass level. We committed a big mistake. Rather than inoculating our own people, we started sending doses to other countries.”Kejriwal added that the world’s first vaccine against Covid-19 was created by Indian scientists and the Centre should have vaccinated all people on war footing. “We could have started this in December itself. But we didn't,” he further said.Also Read| Delhi has 620 cases of ‘black fungus’, facing shortage of drugs, says KejriwalThe Delhi chief minister pointed out that the Centre should have ordered doses from abroad when the second wave started in March and alleged that states were told to make arrangements by themselves.“I am in touch with several chief ministers who have been running here and there to get vaccines. From the past two months, every state is trying to arrange doses. And as per my information, no state has been able to procure an extra single shot of the vaccine from manufacturers. Exclude those which have been given by the Centre.

But how can we do something which is not under our purview. Centre has to fulfill its own responsibilities. You (Centre) provide vaccine doses as per the requirement of the states, we will inoculate our people,” Kejriwal said at the end of the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-lives-would-ve-been-saved-if-kejriwal-slams-centre-on-vaccine-exports-101622029580661.html

26-05-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand slammed for Van Gujjar community living ‘below animal existence’||Uttarakhand high court has slammed the state government for “callousness” and for forcing families of Van Gujjars—a nomadic tribe of pastoralists who dwell in the Himalayan region-- to survive in conditions “below animal existence”. The court also ordered the government to provide them accommodation, food, water, medicines and get them tested for Covid-19 before letting them enter Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarkashi district.The state government reasoned before the court that letting the tribe enter the national park, may endanger the wildlife as the Sars-Cov-2 virus may spread from humans to animals.The directions were issued by the division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma during the hearing on a public interest litigation (PIL) on Tuesday. HT has a copy of the order.The PIL was filed by a Delhi based NGO, Think Act Rise Foundation in 2019 to highlight the plight of Van Gujjars, who continue to occupy certain areas of the forests in the state. The PIL pleads for the community to be made a beneficiary under the Forest Right Act, giving them land rights and quashing petty cases against them.The HC noted that some migrating Van Gujjars were forced to live under open skies in tough conditions after they were denied entry to Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarkashi by the deputy director of the park, Komal Singh, despite holding permits.The HC order also cited the petition to note that since these families cannot sell the milk produced by their cattle due to the Covid-induced lockdown, their life was reduced to “below animal existence” for they have neither shelter, nor economic means to survive.Uttarakhand advocate general, SN Babulkar, said unless the families are declared to be Covid negative they cannot be allowed to enter the park as their migration may endanger the wildlife, the court order noted.The HC order cited photographs submitted by the petitioner to note that families are forced to live in open tents and fields under the open sky. “The photographs also show small children, and new born babies, being wrapped in blankets, and sleeping on the ground…It is, indeed, trite to state that Article 21 of the Constitution of India forbids the State from reducing the lives of its people below the animal existence,” the court order said.The court further underlined the right of every citizen to live with dignity and said, “However, it seems that the callous attitude of the deputy director of the park, and of the civil administration has forced these families to survive in conditions, which are below animal existence. Therefore, prima facie, the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India is being violated by the respondents.”The HC then directed Uttarkashi district magistrate and the deputy director of the park to submit their compliance reports by June 15. The next hearing in the case will be on June 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-slammed-for-van-gujjar-community-living-below-the-animal-existence-101622028313488.html
26-05-2021||Chandigarh||SIT of women cops to probe Bathinda rape, extortion case against ASI||The Punjab and Haryana high court has constituted a three-member special investigation team (SIT), comprising women officials led by additional director general of police (ADGP) Gurpreet Kaur Deo, to probe the role of staff of the crime investigation agency-1 (CIA) of Bathinda police in two criminal cases. Justice Arun Monga pulled up the Bathinda police administration for forming an all-men’s team to investigate charges of rape and extortion against cops by a 38-year-old woman. Also read: In a pandemic, the power of the rumourHe directed Prabhjot Kaur, the deputy superintendent of police, Budhlada, Mansa, to investigate two cases of rape and extortion by cops to absolve the woman’s son in a Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) case. Prabhjot will report to Muktsar SSP D Sudarvizhi, while Deo will head the investigation, the court ordered on Tuesday. An assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Gurvinder Singh, was caught on camera while allegedly raping a widow at her house on May 11. The woman petitioner alleged that her ailing son was implicated in a criminal case after she turned down sexual favours sought by Gurvinder, posted in CIA-1. The ASI arrested the woman’s son, who she claims is suffering from Covid-19, with 400gm of opium and booked him on May 6. After the son’s arrest, the woman was sexually assaulted by the accused cop twice. The accused cop was caught on camera in a compromising position with the woman at her house at a village under the Nathana police station area. After the matter was reported to the police, Gurvinder was arrested and dismissed from service on May 12. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk formed a three-member SIT under SP (headquarters) SP Singh. After dismissing the ASI, Virk said that the SIT will look into allegations that the woman’s son was implicated, and money was demanded. Alleging a shoddy probe, the aggrieved woman approached the court on May 18, demanding a probe against the other seven members of the CIA-1, who allegedly planted the contraband at her home after which the police personnel demanded sexual favours. In her petition, she alleged that CIA team extorted ₹1.6 lakh on two occasions after her son’s arrest. But the Bathinda police avoided recorded statements on these charges and thus refrained from collecting evidence, she said in her petition. The court observed: “It is deplorable to see the insensitiveness with which the (Bathinda) district police officials have acted in constituting the SIT having all male members.” Accepting the plea, the court ordered the Bathinda chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to get the forensic science laboratory (FSL) report with regard to the audio and video recordings made by the petitioner from her cell phone. It shall be treated as part of the case property, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-of-women-cops-to-probe-bathinda-rape-extortion-case-against-asi-101622027653318.html
26-05-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: A tale of Pune’s other village deities; steeped in tradition alive today||Have you ever noticed the boards welcoming you, or bidding you farewell, as you travel in and out of a city, district or state? These boards often mark the political boundary of the city, district, state, or even nation. Our ancestors, however, were way more creative. They used cultural and religious markers to mark the spaces through certain etymologically derived names, cultural associations, and symbolisms unique and tailor-made for each kind of cultural landscape. What’s more, these were organically evolved, accepted and used by the community. These markers had multiple layered meanings and served a primary function of being cultural spots and also proved to be utilitarian by defining these spaces. Do you know the other two village tutelary deities of Pune, besides the Kasba Ganpati we talked about in the last column? If you visit the bustling streets of Appa Balwant chowk (aka Pune’s bookshop hub), tucked in a narrow lane at the corner is dainty little temple of Tambadi Jogeshwari Devi, the “gram-devi” of Pune.Jogeshwari Devi is considered a Shakti of Shiva, consort of Bhairava and a yogini, in the folk form. The particular name Tambdi (carmine coloured) Jogeshwari is derived from the slaying of the Tamrasur demon, a commander of the Mahishasura by goddess Jogeshwari, as per the Puranas. Pune, known for its whimsical names, also has shrines of “Kali (dark) Jogeshwari” and “Piwali (yellow) Jogeshwari”, established in later times.The Ambil odha (stream) was once the physical limit to Pune’s extent. This Jogeshwari, believed to be self-emanated and protective in nature, marked the boundary of the then Pune, established by Trimbak Bendre in 1545. Even today, the main gurav priesthood of the goddess belongs to Bendre family.The temple is a medieval temple built in 1750 in brick mortar and followed the standard plan of square garbhagriha (sanctum) and sabha mandapa. The entire complex was much larger once, but it was divided into half due to a road widening and one of the Deepamalas was removed. Thus, the other votive Deepmala of the temple survives on the other side of road. It is believed that the Deepamalas were erected when Jijabai and Shivaji started a new beginning for Pune through a symbolic ploughing of land with a golden plough. The main idol of Tambdi Jogeshwari was heavily covered in vermilion until recently, then it came off to reveal the original sculpture. The four-armed standing sculpture of Jogeshwari, with trishula (trident), skull (panpatra), and damru as attributes, symbolises a fierce form.During the freedom movement, Prabhat pheri - the morning marches - would commence from the temple of Jogeshwari. Marriage invitations are extended to Tambdi Jogeshwari regularly and devotees particularly flock o the temple during the Navratri Dasserah festival and Ganeshotsav. The third Gram devata of Pune, the most obscure and as old as other two, is Nava (new, ironically!) Kalbhairava in Kasba peth. There existed an older - Juna Kalbhairava temple near Kumbharwada, which was later demolished during the building of the Dhakta Sheikh Salla Dargah. Today, the management of the old Kalbhairav temple is with the Devarkar family.A very common explanatory myth employed to explain shifting or creation of new religious cult site applies here and relates to the Ladkat family, original settlers of Pune from the Mali area. A particular member from the Ladkat family used to visit the old Bhairoba at Kumbharwada from his residence at Janaicha Thal in Bhavani peth. As he grew older it proved difficult to continue this ritual. Hence, Bhairoba came to him in a dream and suggested that God will follow behind him and relocate somewhere near the Ladkat residence to make it easy for him. The only condition was that Ladkat should not look behind. Ladkat could not control his excitement and turned his back to check. The Bhairoba disappeared on the spot, near the Kasba peth boundary area. Ladkat then dug the area to find the idol of Kal Bhairav which was subsequently established and consecrated at the new spot - God and temple - Nava Kalbhiarav.. The management of the temple has continued to be with Ladkat family. The location of Navin Kalbhairav temple is quite strategic. It is placed near what once was the city wall. It is strategically placed at the crossroads of small lanes, full of old wadas and meandering lanes. The temple itself is renovated, but still bears the mark of old architecture in the domical garbhagriha with facets in corners. The chain hung in the garbhagriha is known to relieve people of chromic body aches and back pains. Though monuments undergo changes, traditions die hard. Pune exhibits its rural origins in the practice of Bagad, prevalent in eastern Maharashtra even today. Just outside the Kalbhairav temple is a tall wooden pole which is used to erect the “Bagad” and is under worship. “Bagad” is a traditional ritual in which devotees fulfil their vows to the local deity by whirling themselves on a wooden pole. Sometimes the devotees pierce and hang from hooks. This takes place sometime around the Rangpanchami festival or Chaitra poornima. A similar Bagad ritual takes place in the older village of Hinjewadi, the IT township on outskirts of Pune. Annually, on Chaitra poornima, the procession takes the palkhi of Bhairavnath to the Bolhai temple near the Zilla Parishad. Bolhai devi is the sister of Kalbhairavnath whom he pays annual visits to and offers gifts. Road widening has pushed the Jogeshwar temple aside and the Metro threatens the Nava Kalbhairav, but the village deities still continue to guard the interests of Pune’s inhabitants as they firmly stand on their humble grounds.

In his directives to the ‘Team 9’, group of nine officials tasked with handling the coronavirus pandemic in the state, Adityanath said the ‘Test, Trace and Treat’ mantra has been working well.“In comparison to the peak condition of April 30, the number of patients has dropped to just 20 percent within 26 days. The recovery rate of the state is getting better every day and has now reached 95.1%. There have been 3371 cases of Covid infection in the last 24 hours, while 10,540 people have regained health and were discharged during the same period,” he added.Also read | How Uttar Pradesh turned the tide in fight against Covid-19Adityanath also said that the Covid-19 vaccination drive for people between 18 and 44 years of age would begin in all 75 districts of the state from next month. “Vaccination in the age group of 18 to 44 is progressing rapidly. Yesterday, 147,048 people received vaccine cover. Thus, 13,61,550 people in this age group have received vaccine cover so far. From June 1, the program of Covid vaccination of people in the age group of 18 to 44 is being started in all 75 districts,” the chief minister said. He also said that parents should be vaccinated on priority amid rising concerns that children would be primarily affected during the third wave of the coronavirus disease.The chief minister emphasised the need to strengthen the health and medical system in the state and also announced that a special team and a nodal officer should be created to monitor the construction of new public health centres (PHC) and community health centres (CHC). He also said that a complete database of all medical facilities and a mobile application to divulge this information to the public should be developed.Talking about the rising cases of mucormycosis or black fungus in the state, Adityanath said that experts from the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) will monitor the treatment of patients at hospitals across various districts and cities. The CM also asked the officials to increase surveillance to effectively tackle the encephalitis cases and said that he would personally inspect districts affected by the disease on Wednesday and Thursday.Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday reported 3957 new Covid-19 cases and 163 fatalities and so far, 1,677,508 people have tested positive and 19,519 patients have lost their lives in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-strategy-working-well-vaccination-for-18-in-all-districts-soon-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-101622024788524.html

Now, all the marriages, which were conducted secretly, will be declared illegal. Action will be taken against the couple, family members and even priests.”Gwalior collector KV Singh said though the district administration had not issued a separate order in this regard, yet no marriages will be validated with a certificate in May. “The decision was taken after 20% of villagers in Dabra were infected in a marriage. The motive was not to create trouble for people but to contain the spread,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/marriages-conducted-secretly-despite-a-ban-in-lockdown-declared-illegal-in-mp-101622025133562.html
26-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi has 620 cases of ‘black fungus’, facing shortage of drugs, says Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said there is a severe shortage of the medicine needed to treat at least 620 people undergoing treatment for mucormycosis, or black fungus, in Delhi’s hospitals.He added Delhi is receiving about 400 vials of anti-fungal amphotericin B needed to treat the fungal infection from the central quota even as it needs nearly 4,000 vials daily. “This is delaying the treatment in patients,” he said.Black fungus has emerged as a potentially life-threatening Covid-19 complication that prompted the Centre last week to ask states to declare the disease notifiable under the Epidemic Diseases Act. A rare disease, experts and doctors say thousands have now contracted it because of an overuse of steroids or due to suppression of their immune system, which is often a fallout of attempts to stop the life-threatening immune overreaction due to Covid-19.Also Read: Scientifically Speaking | Decoding the evolution of coronavirusesThe actual spread of the disease is likely wider, and authorities in several states have sounded the alarm on the disease. It mainly impacts the mouth, nose, eye and then spreads to the brain. There have been cases of infection in the lungs as well as the gastrointestinal tract. The treatment involves surgically removing the dead tissues caused by the fungus, which results in loss of the eyes and facial disfigurement in some.Black fungus cases went up 2.5 times last year between September and December across 16 centres in the country, according to Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh.

The lockdown was first imposed by the Delhi government on April 19, when daily Covid-19 cases hovered from 20,000-29,000. It has been extended multiple times and is currently in place till May 31.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Jain said, “Delhi saw 1568 Covid-19 cases yesterday and the positivity rate was at 2.14%. At one period of time, the positivity surged to 36%. But it has been declining since and has come to around 2%. The fall in cases and the positivity rate can be directly attributed to the lockdown.”Also Read| Sputnik V-makers have agreed to supply vaccine to Delhi: KejriwalJain added there are more beds available in hospitals at present and one-third of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are also vacant. “It seems that the Covid-19 situation is in control in Delhi,” the health minister told reporters.In April, amid a massive surge in cases and death, the entire health infrastructure of Delhi witnessed a near collapse as hospitals grappled with a severe shortage of medical oxygen and they only managed to procure very limited supplies. Hospitals were also unable to accommodate the increasing number of patients on time. Many serious Covid-19 patients lost the battle to the viral disease due to the unavailability of beds and the life-saving gas.

In total, there are 600 cases which include patients from outside as well. However, on May 24 and May 25, the cases have remained below the 100-mark,” Jain said, adding there is a shortage of Amphotericin-B injections and urged the central government to increase its supply.The Aam-Aadmi Party-led government has designated three hospitals for treating patients of mucormysosis.

26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Six months on, farmers in Punjab, Haryana hold black flag protest||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana put up black flags on their houses on Wednesday, joining a black day call given by protesting farmer unions to mark six months of their agitation at Delhi borders against the Centre’s three farm laws. Opposition parties, including the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party, have extended support to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s call of observing the day as a black day. The morcha is an umbrella body of protesting unions. Also read: Black Day: Farmers mark 6 months of stir, Tikait says protest will be peacefulShiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal raised a black flag at his house in Badal village in Muktsar district and urged the Centre to accept the demand of protesting farmers. INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala followed suit at his Teja Khera farmhouse in neighbouring Sirsa district in Haryana. Former Haryana chief minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda had on Tuesday urged the Centre to restart the dialogue with protesting farmers. Effigies burnt at protest sites At some places in Punjab, farmers took out a protest march, raising slogans against the Centre and burning its effigy. Carrying black flags, hundreds of protesters burnt effigies of the central government. BKU (Ugrahan) Sangrur block chief Gobinder Singh asked farmers to join the three-day dharna in Patiala against the Punjab government from May 28. Farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders, demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops. However, the government has maintained the laws are pro-farmer. Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three laws. A government panel had met farmer leaders on January 22. There have been no talks between the two sides since January 26 when the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital turned violent.

26-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan to audit Covid-19 deaths following allegations of under reporting||The Rajasthan government has ordered an audit of deaths caused by Covid-19 amid opposition allegations that the official death toll discounted several unreported deaths in the rural areas of the state.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, said, “We are worried about the lives of people, not figures. Our government is fighting the war against Corona with the cooperation of all sections of the society [and] with complete transparency,” he said.The Gehlot government has also indicated the audit will also help in targeted welfare measures for families that have lost earning members due to Covid-19, which has profoundly impacted people’s mental, social and economic conditions.According to the health department, 7,911 people have succumbed to Covid-19 in Rajasthan till date. However, a news daily claimed its survey listed 14,482 deaths in the state’s 25 rural districts between April 1 and May 20 this year alone, while the government’s record puts the number of deaths in this period to 3,918. Rajasthan has 33 districts in all.While the Bharatiaya Janata Party (BJP) leaders alleged that the state government was hiding the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in Rajasthan, health minister Raghu Sharma ruled it out claiming every Covid-19 related death was being recorded meticulously in Covid hospitals.“There is no possibility of any kind of irregularity. Strict instructions have been given against any manipulation at any level. We are worried about the lives of the people, not the figures,” he said, towing the chief minister’s line. He also credited the government for a relatively lower death rate in the state due to disease.Dr. Sharma said that the highest Covid death rate was seen in the two months of April and May this year when a total of 5,093 patients succumbed to the disease. In the previous 13 months, the state registered only 2,818 Covid-related deaths including 1,632 deaths between August, September, October and November 2020 and 1,186 deaths in the remaining 9 months.Dr. Sharma said that it was natural for a big state like Rajasthan, with a population of about 8 crores, to register many deaths owing to diseases, accidents, age and other reasons apart from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-orders-audit-of-covid-19-deaths-following-allegations-of-under-reporting-101622021953410.html

During the peak of the wave, many out there struggled for life-saving medicines, hospital admission and oxygen. Several Lucknowites and techies from various regions extended a helping hand and came up with bots, websites and handles to provide verified information that helped people in need. We feature some of them who rose to the occasion and did their bit for the society. Lucknowite and software engineer Bhavya Chandra with her flat-mate Noopur Jain came up with a bot that works with Telegram chat app @Info_covid_lko_bot. “Instead of website we came up with bot as nowadays people are more chat friendly. We started with Lucknow but now it has presence throughout the country with help of group of volunteers with updated verified information about beds, medicines, oxygen and other requirements. Users too can update information on bot and people have made good use of it during the tough times,” informed the young engineer from Singapore. IIM-Lucknow final year student Amrita Singh developed a website Compiledcovidresources which contains information of initiatives by government, private and social organisations that can be of help to Covid-19 patients. “Since I study in Lucknow but currently based in Delhi, so I thought to pool of information of both cities and updated it pan-India which is now available in 10 languages. During the peak, the focus was on real-time availability of testing, beds, medicines, oxygen and meals. Now, the thrust is more on relief and rehabilitation — like adoption of kids who have orphaned, help to widows, financial aid to families,” said Amrita who ensures every information is verified and update with proper links. Lucknow-resident Shrishti Sahu, couldn’t find hospital admission in the city and had to travel all the way to Delhi to get proper treatment, developed verified Covid leads. “Siddhant Nahta from Mumbai joined hand us along with our 200 volunteers we add, and update verified as well as trustworthy leads. Resources available on the platform are for oxygen, ICU beds, medicine, nursing/doctor consults and food delivery service,” she said. Not just them but several other social media groups have come as saviours when Covid patients and their family members needed them most. “I am far from my city and country but through technology and applying my knowledge this is little what I can do for my people. Who knows what information can save someone’s life,” added Bhavya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/how-young-techies-rose-to-the-covid-challenges-101622019433792.html

More people were being evacuated till reports last came in as sea and river water gushed into the low-lying areas, flooding villages.“Because of the cyclone and the spring tide, the storm surge has caused extensive damage in the state. Several embankments have been breached. Water has gushed into many places at Digha, Shankharpur, Sagar, and Gosaba. Low lying areas have been flooded,” said Banerjee.Also Read | Cyclone Yaas pounds Odisha-Bengal coasts, may move to Jharkhand by midnightStorm surge is the abnormal rise in seawater level during a cyclone and can lead to flooding in low-lying areas.Around 70km of embankment has been damaged in the coastal district of East Midnapore district, which shares a border with Odisha. In South 24 Parganas, reports of embankment breaches have been reported from at least 15 places.At least 20,000 houses have been already damaged, according to early estimates provided by the state government.Banerjee urged the people, who were lodged in the cyclone and relief shelters, not to return to their houses as the spring tide phase would continue till Thursday.According to estimates given by the Kolkata Port Trust, the water levels would reach their peak around Thursday morning.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Tuesday that the storm surge, triggered by Cyclone Yaas and the perigean spring tide, could reach up to 4 metres over and above the astronomical tide (spring tide).“The maximum damage would be caused by the storm surge this time. On May 26, when the cyclone hits, there is also the spring tide. The damage would be the maximum in the coastal districts of East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas,” Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director-general of IMD’s regional office in Kolkata, said on Tuesday.Experts said the water level in the sea rises at least a metre high during a spring tide, which occurs during a full moon, over a normal high tide that comes every day. The water level is highest during the perigean spring tide when the moon is closest to the earth.“The storm surge triggered by the cyclone at East Midnapore district would be 2m–4m, while in South 24 Parganas it would be 1m–2m. This is over and above the astronomical tide (spring tide),” said Banerjee.For storm surge, the IMD had issued a red warning, the highest level of warning that calls for taking action, for the East Midnapore district. For South 24 Parganas district an orange warning (officials to remain prepared) had been issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/storm-surge-triggered-by-yaas-and-spring-tide-inflicts-heavy-damage-in-bengal-101622017213358.html

All of them hailed from West Bengal,” said Gopalganj superintendent of police (SP) Anand Kumar. The Barauli police registered a case, and the bodies were shifted to Sadar hospital for post-mortem.Police said their preliminary investigation suggested that the driver of the minibus lost control and the vehicle first crashed against the road median and then rolled to the other side of the road, hitting the speeding lorry, the official said.Bihar excise and prohibition minister Sunil Kumar, who also hails from Gopalganj district, expressed shock at the deaths and asked the district authorities to ensure best possible treatment to the injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/2-bengal-migrant-workers-killed-14-injured-in-road-accident-in-bihar-101622013673137.html

26-05-2021||Dehradun||Centre finally lets Uttarakhand use locally made oxygen to meet state quota||The Centre has finally allowed Uttarakhand to use medical oxygen generated in the state for treatment of Covid-19 patients and also raised its oxygen quota following the high court’s intervention after several requests by the state government remained unanswered, a senior state official announced on Tuesday evening. Uttarakhand’s oxygen quota has been raised from 183 metric tonnes to 200 MT and the hill state is now under no obligation to procure oxygen from Jharkhand and West Bengal as was mandated by the Centre, said Amit Negi, secretary state health department.Uttarakhand was earlier granted a quota of 183 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, including 60 MT to be imported daily from Jamshedpur and Durgapur in Jharkhand and West Bengal, respectively. Uttarakhand had been requesting the Centre to let it meet its oxygen requirement from its own generation capacity, which easily exceeds the state’s quota. Negi said the state had set up 11 oxygen generation plants so far and more were being set up at district and sub-district levels. Earlier this month, the state government told high court that it had written to the Centre requesting an increase in oxygen quota, medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and pressure swing adsorption plants, apart from permission to use medical oxygen generated locally, since its procurement from Jharkhand and Bengal, as per the existing quota arrangement, posed logistical challenges in maintaining its constant supply to far flung areas. The court asked the Centre to decide on the matter within a week, while expressing surprise at the Centre’s alleged “studied silence” over the issues and added that it was the Centre’s constitutional duty to come to the aid of state governments.Uttarakhand reported 2,756 fresh Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the state’s infection tally to 318,346. It also reported deaths of 80 Covid patients, taking the death toll in the state to 6,020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/centre-finally-lets-uttarakhand-use-locally-made-oxygen-to-meet-state-quota-101622008093061.html

The notice stated that all judicial proceedings have been suspended. The court was to hear the matter virtually. A five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal was scheduled to take up the bail plea of the four political leaders -- two Cabinet ministers, a legislator and a former mayor. Click here for Cyclone Yaas LIVE Updates“The government has intimated the Registrar General that it might not be possible for it to provide transport facilities to the employees of this court on May 26 and May 27,” the notice stated. The CBI had, on May 17, arrested the leaders in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case.

He was attacked around midnight when driving back home. The assailants riding in an SUV intercepted his vehicle nearly 200 meters from his house, said Lucknow deputy commissioner of police (DCP), east, Sanjiv Suman.The police officer said it appeared that the assailants first broke the windshield of the doctor’s SUV with a brick and then opened fire on him. He said the police found CCTV footage in which the assailants are seen fleeing in a white colour SUV from the spot towards Barabanki via Dewa road.The DCP said the police have recovered only one bullet shell from the crime scene, however, some locals claimed they heard at least two rounds of fire. The injured doctor was first rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital by locals and was later shifted to the trauma centre.DCP Suman said primary investigation suggested that the assailants could have been following the doctor’s vehicle from his Sarvodaya Nagar trauma centre. The police are trying to recreate the crime sequence and efforts are on to trace the assailants, he added.The police initially suspected personal enmity behind the attack, but the doctor’s family has not named any suspect so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-doctor-shot-by-unknown-assailants-remains-critical-101622001913164.html

Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “The temperature is not expected to cross 44 degrees Celsius (°C). Unless that happens, there will be no heatwave. As many as five western disturbances, along with the impact of the cyclone, have kept away heatwave conditions so far,” said Srivastava.This month, Delhi recorded 144mm rainfall, which was the second wettest May since 2008. Srivastava said since no further rain is predicted in the coming week, the recorded rainfall could be considered as the reading for the month.Also Read | ‘Black day’ protest to mark 6 months of stirThe Safdarjung observatory, whose readings are taken as representative of the whole city, had recorded 21.1mm of rain in May last year. The recorded rainfall for the month of May stood at 26.9mm in 2019 and 24.2mm in 2018. In the years preceding that, rainfall received stood at 40.5mm in 2017, 24.3mm in 2016, 3.1mm in 2015, and 100.2mm in 2014, as per the IMD data.Srivastava said unlike the past few years, the Capital had not recorded any heatwave days this May so far. Meteorologists declare a heatwave when the maximum temperature for a location in the plains crosses 40°C. In the hills, the threshold temperature is 30°C. A heatwave is also declared when the departure in the maximum day temperature is 4.5°C to 6.5°C from the normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mercury-to-rise-but-delhi-temperature-still-lower-than-earlier-yearsimd-101621998372625.html
26-05-2021||Delhi||Sushil back at his theatre of dreams, this time to recreate an alleged killing||The sprawling Chhatrasal stadium in north-west Delhi is where it all began for two-time Olympic medallist and world champion wrestler Sushil Kumar. This is where his wrestling career started in earnest, when, as a 12-year-old boy, he enrolled into the wrestling school run by Asian Games champion Satpal Singh in 1995. The stadium complex became Kumar’s home, and in a sense, he never left -- till he went on a 19-day run from the law on May 4, ending in his arrest by Delhi Police on May 23.On Tuesday, the man who had made Chhatrasal India’s most iconic wrestling destination was led back to the stadium, flanked by police and forensic teams, to recreate the alleged killing of a 23-year-old wrestler called Sagar Dhankad.The scene where Kumar had plotted his greatest triumphs on the mat was now a crime scene. For more than an hour, investigators questioned Kumar and collected evidence, based on what the police claim is footage of the crime recorded on the mobile phone of one of Kumar’s associates. Kumar’s associate Ajay Sherawat, who was with him when the wrestler was arrested, was also questioned at the scene.On the night of May 4, Dhankad, who also trained at Chhatrasal, was beaten to death in a brawl involving two groups, one of which, according to the police, was led by Kumar.Kumar and Sherawat were also taken to an apartment in Shalimar Bagh, where Dhankad and four other wrestlers lived. This, police said, is where the fight began. Kumar and his associates first assaulted Dhankad at the apartment, before driving off with him and two of his associates to Chhatrasal, police said. Police also accompanied the two to an apartment in Model Town that is believed to be the epicentre of the brawl that led to Dhankad’s murder. Dhankad used to live in the apartment, and Kumar’s wife is thought to be the owner.On Monday, the first day of Kumar’s six-day-long police custody, the wrestler was questioned for roughly four hours at a stretch.“He was asked to narrate the incident and disclose the whereabouts of his absconding associates who are also wanted for Dhankad’s murder. Who all were in touch with Kumar and were helping him and his other aides, is also being looked into,” said an officer who is part of the investigation.The police also said that Kumar became emotional during the questioning.Kumar and others have been charged with murder, attempt to murder, assault, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and under other relevant sections, including that of Arms Act.The wrestler’s homeThe wrestling school at Chhatrasal, Kumar, and Indian wrestling became synonymous over the years. When he won a bronze at the 2008 Olympics, becoming only the second Indian wrestler— after Kashabha Dadasaheb Jadhav in 1952 — to win an Olympic medal, it bought immediate fame to the school. Budding wrestlers thronged the centre.“We used to have just a few trainees here, nothing out of the ordinary,” said a former Chhatrasal coach who had trained Sushil and who did not wish to be named. “After his medal, there was such a mad rush that we had to turn back hundreds of wrestlers.”Along with the fame, the complex began to improve too. Before 2008, it had just one Olympic standard wrestling mat, and one traditional earthen pit. Wrestlers lived crammed in tiny, low-roofed housing directly under the stadium’s rafters. By 2012, when Kumar won his second Olympic medal -- a silver -- becoming the only Indian to win two individual medals at the Olympics, the stadium had undergone a massive transformation to house the hundreds of wrestlers who came to learn under Kumar. Now there were plenty of Olympic mats, a state-of-the-art gym and a constant buzz in training.2012 was Chhatrasal’s year; Yogeshwar Dutt, who won a bronze at the London Games, was also a product of the school (and Kumar’s childhood training partner and friend). Another trainee from the school, Amit Dahiya, became the youngest wrestler from India to compete at the Olympics -- he made it to the quarterfinals.Many more wrestling stars followed -- a superb second line that includes current Tokyo Olympic medal favourite Bajrang Punia. In fact, along with Punia, two other Tokyo-bound wrestlers — Ravi Dahiya and Deepak Punia — also learnt their wrestling at Chhatrasal.“If there was a revolution in the sport in India, it was led by Kumar, from this very stadium,” said the coach quoted earlier. “Over here, he was simply “pehelwan” and everything happened with his knowledge. He was the driving force.”Kumar rose to become an administrator at the Delhi-government run stadium that became famous because of him.But despite the fame and the stature, or perhaps because of it, cracks also began to appear in the running of Chhatrasal’s wrestling school. By the end of 2012, Dutt and Kumar had a public fallout, resulting in Dutt leaving the centre and opening his own wrestling school. There were fallouts with coaches too, including one incident where a senior coach alleged that Kumar had assaulted him. The coach left and joined Dutt.The gangster connectionThe police are also investigating the involvement of gangster Kala Jathedi, whose name has surfaced in the brawl. According to the police Jathedi is at present based in Dubai and runs extortion rackets and other crime syndicates in north Indian states like Haryana, Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) and Rajasthan.“The probe so far has revealed that Dhankad’s friend Sonu, whom Sushil Kumar and his associates had also thrashed on May 4 inside the stadium, is closely related to Kala Jathedi and has multiple criminal cases registered against him.He is also listed as “bad character” of the area in police files. It looks like Kumar’s actions also left Jathedi outraged, which could be one reason for Kumar switching locations rapidly while he was on the run. Despite throwing away their cell phones and knowing that the use of a WiFi dongle would give away his location, Kumar may have done so to have the police reach him “sooner than Jathedi’s henchmen”,” said an officer who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sushil-back-at-his-theatre-of-dreams-this-time-to-recreate-an-alleged-killing-101621988243178.html
26-05-2021||Delhi||Vehicles back in parking lots as crematorium rush eases||Vehicles are back in the parking lot of Ghazipur crematorium -- the space that was being used to cremate dead bodies on temporary platforms for nearly a month when a sharp spike in the number of deaths due to Covid-19 led to city crematoriums running out of space.At the Seemapuri crematorium, too, in the past one week no body has been burnt in the parking lot. Photographs of mass cremations at the two sites were widely circulated last month, as the national capital reported nearly 400 deaths every day.However, with the number of deaths declining steadily, the situation is much better at the city’s funeral grounds and graveyards. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 156 Covid-19 deaths, which was the lowest since April 16.On May 22, when Delhi reported 182 deaths, it was the first time in 35 days that fatalities dropped below 200. On Sunday, too, it was below 200 before increasing slightly on Monday at 208, according to the Delhi government’s heath bulletin. To be sure, the daily deaths mentioned in the bulletin are not always of those who died in the previous 24 hours.A senior Delhi government health official, who asked not to be named, said, “The numbers are recalibrated and also reflect the deaths of those who died even two weeks ago. The Death Audit Committee (DAC) verifies each case to check if the person has indeed died of Covid-19 complications. Only then is his/her case added to the bulletin data. The deaths are certainly reducing. This can be seen at the crematoriums. The reason why the fatality number is still near 200 is because of the high volume of cases and deaths that happened in the last one month.”Officials managing the two crematoriums said the death numbers are coming down, and the situation has improved.Ram Karan Mishra, head priest of the Ghazipur crematorium, said that they cremated only five Covid-19 bodies on Saturday. “Last month, we performed at least 80-90 Covid funerals every day. The total body count then was 125 (both Covid and non-Covid-deaths). It was the highest in the last week of April. Since we had only 36 platforms, we had to remove vehicles and hold some funerals in the parking lot. I remember there was less than one feet distance between two pyres. You can also see some of my photographs conducting funerals with bodies placed closely.”Mishra said, over a week ago, vehicles were again allowed inside the lot. “Now, we even have time to speak to you. Last month, there was so much chaos that we had to call some of our boys from the village to help us,” he added.On April 2, the Delhi government declared the ongoing surge as the city’s fourth wave of infection. In terms of the number of cases and fatalities, it was Delhi’s deadliest by a big margin.In the first three days of May, Delhi recorded over 400 deaths every day, with the highest, 448, on May 3. Before the fourth wave, the deaths had reduced steadily over the past several months. In December, Delhi reported 1,276 deaths, followed by 292 in January 2021, and 53 in February. In March, there were 116 Covid deaths. In April, the number reached 5,120.Jitender Singh Shunty, founder of the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal (SBSSD), said he finally has time to speak to his family over the phone and take breaks during the day. The SBSSD manages the Old Seemapuri crematorium.“We do not use that space (parking lot) anymore. Fewer bodies of Covid victims are coming in now. We can manage it within the crematorium space. Last month, there were bodies all around and no space. We did a maximum of 118 funerals in a day last month, of which 90% were Covid-related. Now for the past 8-10 days, we are getting about 17 bodies daily, of which only 10 are that of Covid victims,” he said.HT reported on May 20, how the construction of 150 pyre platforms at Sarai Kale crematorium in south Delhi was halted as fewer bodies were being brought to the crematorium.Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health expert and epidemiologist, said that though the footprint of the fourth wave may mean that Delhi is unlikely to see such a sharp spike in cases and deaths in the immediate future, it is imperative to invest in health care infrastructure and staff.“While cases have dropped, I’d prefer to wait for the positivity rate to remain below 5% for at least two weeks before we can conclusively say the fourth wave has passed,” he said.Dr Lahariya also said that while vaccines are essential in the long run, the basics of Covid-appropriate behaviour such as masking and distancing are essential to stem spikes in the short term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vehicles-back-in-parking-lots-as-crematorium-rush-eases-101621984290195.html

Conveying the state government’s feedback to the Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Singla said there is a dire need of vaccinating the students appearing in the board examinations and teachers as their health, safety is of utmost importance. The school education minister said the examinations of only selected and essential subjects may be held in each discipline and question papers may be of lesser duration. “Due consideration may also be given to pre-board examinations and internal assessment,” he wrote in a letter to the Union minister. Raising the concerns of students and parents, Singla said the examinations should not be conducted until the safety of all stakeholders is ensured. “As there is every possibility that the students appearing in class 12 would be late in getting admission in the higher educational institutions, the Union government should issue directions to all universities and colleges to cope with the time loss of students,” he said. Singla said the higher education institutions should be asked to reduce the syllabi of the courses which would also reduce the mental pressure on students. “The students taking admissions in the higher education institutions after undergoing class 12 examinations would not be required to undergo all the semesters in the next course. For example, 8 semesters course may be reduced to 7 semesters which would help in reducing mental pressure on students and will also motivate them to perform with more confidence in higher education,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cbse-class-12-exams-need-to-vaccinate-students-teachers-punjab-minister-singla-tells-centre-101621975878113.html

Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, the former Punjab deputy chief minister said the PM should shun an indifferent attitude towards the farmers and accept their demands. On the completion of six months of the farm agitation on Wednesday, Sukhbir said he had urged the party rank and file to hoist black flags to demand repeal of the laws and show solidarity with the protesting farmers. Accusing the Capt Amarinder Singh-led government in Punjab of cheating the farmers who lost their lives during the protests by not giving their families compensation and jobs, the SAD chief said the process be initiated. “At least 400 people died during the protests and most of these families are awaiting compensation,” said Sukhbir. He also urged chief minister Amarinder to speed up vaccination to fight Covid-19 and make a special allocation of ₹1,000 crore to purchase vaccines for inoculating the entire state in the next 6 months. “The CM should give a monthly pension of ₹6,000 each to all families who had lost their breadwinners to the virus. Also, provide free education to those left orphans by the pandemic and waive power and water bills for all sections of society for six-month period,” he added.Also, Sukhbir inducted Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member and former Congress secretary Surjit Singh Tugalwal into SAD. Party leaders Bikram Singh Majithia, Sikander Singh Maluka, Daljit Singh Cheema and Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shun-indifference-hold-talks-with-farmers-sukhbir-badal-to-modi-101621974913918.html
26-05-2021||Chandigarh||PUSA-44 paddy variety an environmental hazard, need to discontinue its sowing: Punjab to Centre||The Punjab government has told the Centre that the PUSA-44 variety of paddy should not to be sown in the upcoming kharif season in the state, terming it an environmental hazard as it matures late and it produces more stubble. In an action plan sent to the Union ministry for environment on the steps initiated by the state to curb stubble burning and better in-situ management of paddy residue, the Punjab Pollution Control Board and the state agriculture department have proposed that the sowing of the paddy variety which comprises 15-16% of total cultivated area should be stopped immediately. Of a total paddy area of 77 lakh acres under paddy this kharif season, the premium basmati is cultivated over 12.5 lakh acres and the PUSA-44 over 12 lakh acres. Besides, the PR-121 is sown over 17 lakh acres and PR-126 over 12-13 lakh acre land. Five to six other varieties of paddy are also sown in the state. The PUSA-44, developed by Delhi-based Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), commonly referred to as PUSA Institute, is one of the oldest varieties grown in the state. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice chancellor BS Dhillon said the variety has the longest duration (145-150 days) of maturity and leaves a shorter window for wheat sowing after its harvest. “Also, it is sown and transplanted before the onset of monsoon, leading to more consumption of groundwater. On the other hand, the PR-121 variety matures two weeks early (in 135 days) while the PR-126 ripens four weeks early in about 110-115 days,” he added. The PR varieties were developed by the PAU. “Also, the PUSA-44 leaves more crop residue, one tonne more on 1 hectare. On 1 hectare, the PUSA-44 produces 7-8 tonne stubble while the PR varieties produce 5-6 tonnes of residue. It’s (PUSA-44) shoot is also 6-7 inches taller than other varieties,” Dhillon added. Variety preferred by farmers, millers The PUSA-44 is largely grown in Sangrur, Barnala and Mansa districts of the Malwa belt due to its high yield and the fact that it is preferred by rice millers. “Its yield is 5-6 quintals higher than the PR varieties. The per acre yield is 35 quintal against 28-30 quintals of the PR varieties,” said Nek Singh, a farmer from Khokh village in Patiala district’s Nabha sub-division.“So why would a farmer lose ₹9,000-10,000 per acre?” he asked. Bal Krishan Garg, a rice miller, they prefer the PUSA variety as it has lesser quantity of broken grain when shelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pusa44-paddy-variety-an-environmental-hazard-need-to-discontinue-its-sowing-punjab-to-centre-101621974913035.html

Later, in a social media post, Sidhu asked every Punjabi to support farmers. The MLA, who was accompanied with his wife, said the black flag is a symbol of rejection of the farm laws. He said that Punjab government has to provide an alternate method of assured minimum support price (MSP) and procurement. Also, his daughter Rabia hoisted a flag at their Amritsar residence. His appeal to unfurl black flags met with a lukewarm response as not many people didn’t come forward in Patiala to put black flags on their residences. “We are aware that Navjot Sidhu is raising the farmers’ issues, but he should come out in the open instead of making his presence only on social media. One has to match their words with action, if they are serious about the cause”, said Thakur Singh Mann, a farmer from Sanaur. ”It is a decisive battle for farmers and we won’t follow any politician and go only with our union leaders. The development came a day after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh appealed to farmers to not to hold a three-day protest in Patiala, saying it will lead to rise in Covid-19 cases even as he reiterated his support to their agitation against the contentious agriculture laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-hoists-black-flag-atop-patiala-house-to-support-farm-stir-101621974912002.html

Most of these species are narrow endemics and require specialised habitats to survive, thus acting as an indicator of pristine habitats. There are 106 currently known species of this genus, of which 26 are present in the North-Eastern states of India,” the paper’s authors said in a statement on Monday.The newly described species has been christened ‘Didymocarpus vickifunkiae’, and named after the late Dr Vicki Ann Funk, who was a renowned botanist with USA’s Smithsonian Institute. “The species is currently known to occur only in three locations in Mizoram, and can be categorised as an endangered species based on a standardised assessment devised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature,” said Dr Vinita Gowda, associate professor, department of biological sciences, IISER.“These findings continue to highlight the taxonomic endemism that we see among the flora of the north-east. Such endemism is typically seen in island habitats, where the species arrives and then the further evolutionary process becomes much localised. It’s something that we have seen in the north-eastern states but we don’t know exactly why, because tectonic histories in India are so complex,” Gowda added.These findings, which are based on in situ and ex situ studies (including molecular phylogenetic analyses with similar African Violet species from other herbariums across the world), are part of a larger study currently being undertaken by Gowda and her PhD students, to extensively document the genus Didymocarpus in India. This will help researchers to better understand the plant’s evolutionary traits needed to survive in this country (as opposed to China, Japan, African countries and South American countries, where it is also widely distributed).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/researchers-document-new-species-of-african-violet-in-mizoram-101621972571046.html

ACB officers said that the cash were in denominations of ₹500 and ₹2,000. “The cash was hidden mainly under the bed, in old plastic bags at the backyard and on the terrace. By the time the cash could be counted and seized as per the prevailing procedure, it was already [Tuesday] morning. Some documents, which were seized during the search at the bungalow, are being scrutinised,” said an ACB officer.A resident of Aarey Colony in Goregaon (East) had complained against Rathod to ACB on May 14, alleging that the CEO had demanded bribe from him for granting permission to carry out the repair work of his house. It is mandatory to secure prior permission from the CEO’s office to carry out any construction/repair works in Aarey Colony.Rathod’s aide Arvind Tribhuvam Tiwari, 57, was caught on Monday while allegedly accepting bribe of ₹50,000 on the CEO’s behalf. Rathod was arrested after that. A team of ACB officers on Monday night then carried out searches under the supervision of additional commissioner of police (ACB) Lakhmi Gautam at Rathod and Tiwari’s residences at Aarey. ACB officers suspect that the accused may have amassed huge amount of illegitimate assets during his service, and an open inquiry would soon be initiated against him. Rathod also held charge as Worli Dairy’s deputy commissioner.The officers did not seize anything from Tiwari’s house. Rathod and his family’s financial transactions and bank accounts would now be scrutinised, officers said. “Based on the findings of the trap laid and the subsequent seizures, we would secure permission from the authority concerned to initiate an open inquiry against Rathod to look into alleged illegitimate assets. An offence of disproportionate assets would be registered against him,” an ACB officer said. “Rathod is not co-operating with the probe. A court remanded in four days custody,” said Neelam Waval, assistant commissioner of police, ACB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/346-crore-docus-seized-from-home-of-aarey-colony-ceo-in-mumbai-101621972451038.html
26-05-2021||Other||Dept of atomic energy to build India’s 1st reactor on PPP model||The department of atomic energy (DAE) on Tuesday announced that it will be constructing the country’s first research reactor on public-private partnership (PPP) model. DAE is shortlisting the private enterprises for a partnership in the project. The research reactor, which will be designed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), will produce radioisotopes, and is expected to bring down the costs of nuclear medicine that is used in cancer treatment in India. DAE will provide the upfront capital and build the plant through its subsidiary – Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd – the department said in a statement. On April 15, the department had held an informal consultation with 17 companies from around the world, who are interested in joining hands for the project. “The participants represented businesses across the nuclear medicine value chain such as nuclear medicine, pharmaceutical, healthcare, medical devices and nuclear reactor equipment suppliers from USA, Canada, Argentina, Russia, France, UK and two-three Indian suppliers,” read the statement. The design, regulatory clearances and other preparatory work is going at a good pace, the DAE statement further read. In India, all major radioisotopes are produced by BARC, which houses research reactors in its Trombay campus and an accelerator in Kolkata. Some radioisotopes are imported from Europe, Australia and other Asian countries. Radioisotopes are radioactive isotopes that have an unstable atomic nucleus. They emit energy and particles when they change to a more stable form. Radioisotopes are widely used in nuclear medicine for diagnostics purposes as well as to treat diseases like cancer. The industrial uses of radioisotopes include identifications of flow malfunctions, measurement of flow parameters, evaluation of design of chemical reactors, monitoring of product quality and process efficacy.Private entities that are willing to invest in the construction of the reactor and its processing units will get exclusive rights to process and market the radioisotopes produced in the reactor. Radioisotopes in India can be procured and handled only by the users duly authorised by Radiological Safety Division (RSD), Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The demand for radioisotopes for nuclear medicine is on the rise. Between 2018 and 2020, the nuclear medicine departments in hospitals in India has grown from 293 to 349, as per AERB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dept-of-atomic-energy-to-build-india-s-1st-reactor-on-ppp-model-101621972391088.html

The court has directed the state to file its response to the petition before the next hearing on June 21. The resolution has scrapped the 33% reservation in promotions in government jobs for those employed under the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Vimukta Jati (denotified tribes), Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) and Special Backward Classes and are being offered to employees from the open category. The vacation bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar, was informed that while the main petition challenged the May 7 GR, others were filed to oppose the plea challenging it. The 33% reservation in promotions was introduced in 2004, under which 13% was for SCs, 7% for STs, 3% for Vimukta Jati, 2% to special backward class and the rest for VJNT. It was applicable to those who joined the state government service on or before April 25, 2004, as per their seniority. Those joining after April 25, 2004, were to get promotion as per the date of joining. However, the May 7 GR cancelled the reservation in promotion two days after the Supreme Court quashed the HC judgment allowing reservations for the Maratha community. The GR also mentioned that promotions by seniority to the 33% vacancies would be subject to the court’s final orders. Sanjay Ghodke, who has challenged the May 7 GR, said that the rights of those belonging to reserved categories would be affected by the decision. “These reservations of 33% existed since 1974, but now in a single stroke, the state has de-reserved all the seats,” his counsel Indira Jaising argued. The senior counsel further said that the state had no authority to issue the order, nor had it given any reason or justification while on it and hence it was arbitrary and an about turn from its earlier position. “In fact, Maharashtra is the only state in this country to de-reserve the posts reserved for SC, ST categories,” she said, adding that the state’s decision is galloping to fill up all the posts meant for reserved categories. Jaising sought a stay on the operation of the May 7 GR. However, the bench said that before passing any orders, the matter requires to be heard at length as there are several stake holders involved who too had to be heard. State’s counsel Mihir Desai said the state has proposed to grant promotions based on the GR. Following this the bench said, “We make it clear that any promotion that would be made by the state government pursuant to the Interim GR May 7 and circular dated May 10 shall be subject to further orders that would be passed by this court at the stage of admission. The promotees, if any promoted pursuant to the GR and circular, shall be informed about the pending proceedings in this court.” Directing the state government and other respondents to file affidavits in reply to the petitions within two weeks, the bench posted further hearing to June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/promotions-after-cancellation-of-33-quota-subject-to-court-orders-bombay-hc-101621972151028.html

ED is investigating allegations of money laundering based on a complaint by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. It is learnt that three of Deshmukh’s close associates in Nagpur had come under ED’s radar after their bank transactions had linked them to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and his family. According to reports, the ED team raided at least three places, including the residence and offices of businessman Sagar Bhatewar at Shivaji Nagar. Bhatewar is said to have had some financial dealings with the Nagpur-based politician, who is also facing a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the allegations, following a high court order. Despite repeated attempts, Bhatewar did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. The Central agency also raided the houses and offices of two other businessmen, reportedly close to the former home minister, at Jafar Nagar and Sadar areas in west Nagpur. It was said that ED had seized laptops and vital documents from these places. ED had earlier registered offences against Deshmukh based on by CBI’s first information report (FIR). CBI had raided Deshmukh’s Civil Lines residence at Nagpur last month and seized several documents, along with some cash. ED had also recorded the statement of a bar owner in Mumbai in connection to the case and also summoned some more people. Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked to dismiss assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and other police personnel to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/money-laundering-case-ed-raids-properties-of-anil-deshmukh-s-aides-in-nagpur-101621972091028.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Model that helped Mumbai tide over 2nd wave||From being the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic to being hailed nationally for its containment model, Mumbai has come a long way. The city with a population of over 20 million had only 10% vacant beds in hospitals and Covid jumbo care centres in the first week of April. Now, over 60% of the beds are empty in the city. To achieve the ‘Mumbai model’, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had to take multiple initiatives not only to handle shortage of beds, but control the mortality rate, and ensure timely supply of oxygen and medicines to the infected patients. In April, when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak, the country’s financial city recorded more than 10,000 daily cases thrice. But now, the daily average has come down to around 2,000 cases. The BMC has garnered quite a lot of praise from across the nation. The Supreme Court not only applauded the management of medical oxygen supply in Mumbai, but also recommended that the Delhi government replicate the “Mumbai model” to fight the pandemic. On April 1, Mumbai had 50,055 active patients who were on Covid-19 treatment. The number has now fallen to 27,649. This stands a 45% fall in the total active cases. Strengthened health infrastructure On April 1, Mumbai had 15,971 beds in 97 dedicated care centres and hospitals. Of this, only 4,160 beds were available. The city had 1,805 beds for patients on Intensive Care Units (ICU), but 139 of them were available. Of the 1,143 ventilator beds, only 82 were empty. By April 15, the number of total beds was raised to over 20,000, which included ICU and ventilator beds. Along with focusing on strengthening the health infrastructure, the BMC also had to chalk out plans and initiatives to deal with shortage of beds, which could have increased the fatality rate. “When the pandemic curve flattened post November 2020, we used some Covid-19 beds for patients with non-Covid infection. As soon as the number started soaring again, we upgraded our facilities. Initially, we had a limited number of ICU beds which were increased within a fortnight,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health. “Almost 40% Covid Care Centre (CCC) were activated and the remaining were kept on standby,” he added. Patients were, however, still struggling to find beds in hospitals and jumbo centres. Private hospitals were instructed to use 80% beds for Covid care. So, acting on war footing, the BMC standardised the system. “We decentralised ward war rooms (24) and each were instructed to manage their own geographical areas. It was mandatory for beds to be allotted only through these war rooms. Hospitals were directed not to allow direct or walk-in admission. The individual wards were responsible for contact tracing, isolation, identifying high-risk contacts,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force for Covid-19. The availability of beds was made public through a live bed tracker in both public and private hospitals across the 24 wards. In fact, all wards were provided with their individual ambulances to save time in commute. “Many a times, patients would keep waiting for a bed of the hospital of their choice which often delayed their treatment. When this Standard operating procedure (SOP) was started, it helped channelise the admission process,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer of R/C that covers Borivali. Private laboratories were even instructed not to inform the infected patients directly. “We were instructed to share the list of infected patients directly with the war rooms. Officials from the war rooms would individually contact the patients and arrange for beds as per their health parameters,” said a senior officer from a laboratory. These on-ground initiatives helped curb shortages of beds like witnessed in the first wake of the pandemic. At present, the city has 22,077 beds in the dedicated care centres and hospitals. As many as 13,704 beds are available. The number of ICU beds has increased to 2,867. Out of this, 532 beds are vacant. If an infected patient was asymptomatic, they were advised to isolate at home. In case, if they didn’t have equipment to check temperature or oxygen levels, the field officers visited them to record all parameters. All elderly above 50 years or people with comorbidities like diabetes, tuberculosis, cancer among others were isolated in CCC nearby. Early detection, isolation and treatment The Opposition criticised the civic body for conducting fewer tests, alleging it led to infected people spreading the virus to others. Till March 21, the civic body was conducting around 18,000 tests daily on an average. But from March 22, the BMC started increasing the testing to over 40,000 daily. “We were instructed to test as many people as possible. It was in two ways— the floating population of people in bus stands, markets, and malls were tested with a rapid antigen test (RAT) which gave results within 30 minutes. While the stationed population like shopkeepers, residents were tested with RT-PCR. This helped in early detection, isolation and treatment,” said Kakani. In April, on an average, the civic body was conducting over 45,000 tests daily. In fact, anticipating a shortage, the BMC had floated a tender procuring 2 lakh vials of Remdesivir. During the first wave of novel coronavirus last year, Mumbai’s oxygen requirement was approximately 210 metric tonnes which rose to 270 metric tonnes post March, when the city’s active cases surged to 90,000. The BMC initiated ‘Mission Mode’ under which all oxygen manufacturers and distributors were instructed to provide adequate oxygen supply in civic and private hospitals across Mumbai. The details of the supply and stock were maintained through a centralised Google Drive document around-the-clock. “During the first wave, we had realised the importance of oxygen so we installed nearly 24 Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tanks. But due to lower demand, half of them remained unused which we became helpful in the second wave when the cases increased drastically,” added Kakani. In the first wave, due to the national lockdown, the footfall of non-Covid patients fell by 80% so the private and major civic-run hospitals had enough beds for Covid-19 patients. However, in the second wave, with the relaxation of the lockdown, the hospitals were reeling under the pressure of both Covid and non-Covid patients. Thus, the jumbo covid care centres also played a major role in the second wave. Talking about it, Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of NESCO jumbo Covid care centre in Goregaon said, “So far, we have treated around 21,000 patients. We have 413 pipelines for oxygen. Along with that, we have over 200 ICU beds. In the month of April, there was a huge load of patients. We also provided counselling to the patients to help them with their mental health.” Getting ready for the third wave State health minister Rajesh Tope has already declared a possible third wave after September. As a precautionary measure, the BMC has decided to add 5,000 more beds for Covid-19 patients. In addition to this, three major jumbo centres will be set up, which will cater to over 2,000 patients. These centres will also have ICU beds. But the main priority would be to ramp up the mass immunisation programme. The civic body, which is expecting to get the vials next month, wants to inoculate over 1crore people within two months. “If we are expecting a third wave post September, it is imperative that we vaccinate as many people as possible. Along with elderly, we also want to inoculate the younger population who possibly would be more affected in the next wave. We are just waiting for the vials before we could reboost the immunisation programme,” said Kakani. Just like decentralisation of the war rooms, the BMC has plans to bifurcate the vaccination as per wards. “Citizens would get vaccinated as per their individual wards, which will help control crowding and smoothen the process,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/model-that-helped-mumbai-tide-over-2nd-wave-101621971911075.html

According to health officials, out of 158 confirmed cases of mucormycosis in the state till Tuesday afternoon, 32 had never developed Covid symptoms even as virus has emerged as the most common factor among the patients fighting the fungal infection. State’s nodal officer for black fungus Dr Gagandeep Singh said it is not necessary that only Covid-hit patients are prone to contract it. “Any person who has taken excessive steroids for treatment of other disease due to which he has become immune-compromised can contract the disease. Our experts are analysing every case minutely,” said the nodal officer. The nodal officer said it’s not a contagious disease and is curable if the patient gets treatment in time. According to media bulletin of mucormycosis, out of a total 158 patients in Punjab, 22 belong to other states. Of the 21 deaths, two patients were from outside the state. Amphotericin-B injection shortage another worry The shortage of Amphotericin-B injections being administered to treat the mucormycosis patients has added to the woes of the state health authorities. So far, the fungus has claimed 21 lives in the state. According to a senior health department functionary, the Centre on Tuesday sent 200 Amphotericin-B injections to Punjab against a daily requirement of 700 as 137 patients are availing treatment for the disease in different hospitals. Doctors say each patient needs 4-5 injections a day. Keeping the existing scenario in mind, the Punjab government’s expert committee on black fungus led by Dr RPS Sibia, professor and head, department of medicine, Government Medical College Patiala, on Tuesday discussed alternative drugs to treat the fungus. According to a senior health department functionary, the National Health Mission officials have already been given the task to procure some alternative drugs suggested by the experts from the open market. The expert committee on Tuesday reportedly also invited Prof Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of department of medical microbiology, PGIMER, for his suggestions on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/32-of-158-black-fungus-patients-in-punjab-have-no-covid-history-101621971071525.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge P305: Casualties of Cyclone Tauktae||Four more bodies of deceased crew members of P305, an accommodation barge that sank off the coast of Mumbai on May 17, were identified on May 25 a day after the Indian Navy called off its Search and Rescue (SAR) operations after a week. The accommodation barge sank in Heera Oil Fields off the coast of Mumbai as Cyclone Tauktae barreled its way northwards along the Konkan coast. By the time the boat sank, most of the 261 people on board had jumped into the swirling Arabian Sea with their life jackets, hoping that help was on its way. The barge became unmoored on May 16, after all 12 of its anchors broke away and by the following afternoon, water had begun to fill into the vessel. The SAR operations have rescued 186 people from P305 till now, and 71 bodies have been recovered, of which 52 people have been identified. The identification process for the remaining 19 is ongoing. The police is collecting DNA samples of relatives to ascertain the identity of the unidentified bodies. A tugboat, Varaprada, which was also missing along with 11 of its 13 crew members (two were rescued last week), was recovered from the seabed 20 nautical miles off the coast of Mumbai on May 24. Three of the eight bodies discovered in Daman and Valsad’s shores were of the crew members of the tugboat. P305 – owned by Durmast Enterprises Limited, and chartered by a consortium led by Afcons Industries to carry out a project contract for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) –received a warning of an impending storm, but chose to drop anchor close to the oil rig while other barges and vessels made their way to safety onshore.Both ONGC and Afcons have announced compensation for crew members. ONGC released a statement on Tuesday stating that it has handed over immediate relief amount to 56 survivors of Barge Papaa-305 and Varaprada in Mumbai. ONGC teams are on their way to hand over 22 more. “A nodal officer has been assigned from ONGC to each family of deceased, who is responsible for facilitating their logistics, boarding, lodging, counselling, completing formalities and transportation of mortal remains to respective home station and any local support,” the state-owned company said. Last week, Afcons also released a statement which said that it would provide compensation to the families of the deceased that would be a combination of “ex-gratia pay-outs and insurance compensation and would range from ₹35 lakh to ₹75 lakh per family.”Ajay Singh (39), rigger In October 2020, Singh left his family in Ajagara village of Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh, to work on the accommodation barge, P305. The earnings weren’t much – according to his brother, Sanjay, he earned ₹700 a day for a 12-hour duty. Riggers work at shipyards or other work units lifting, moving and positioning heavy equipment, machines and oversized loads. Singh was the only breadwinner of his family, which comprised his wife, a son who studies in class 10, and a daughter, a student of class 7. Initially, on account of the strict lockdown, none of his close family members could come to identify his body. They requested a distant relative, JP Singh, who resides in Koperkhairane, to visit the JJ Hospital mortuary where the P305 deceased were being brought in. However, the relative could not identify Ajay, as he had last seen him nearly 20 years ago at his wedding. Eventually, brother Sanjay, a 35-year-old farmer managed to come to Mumbai and identified his brother’s body. Afcons Industries flew his brother’s body back to the state, Sanjay said. The last rites were completed in Benares. Arjun Pandey, 29, welder A resident of Gopalganj in Bihar, Arjun Pandey worked as gas cutter and welder on barge P305 starting January this year. The soon-to-be-father was the sole bread winner of his family and sent most of his earnings -- ₹1,300 daily for 12 hours of work – back home. Pandey came to Mumbai on January 10, and stayed at his brother-in-law’s house in Navi Mumbai for a few days, before he joined work in last week of January. As the cyclonic storm barreled its way up north the coastline, Pandey called his pregnant wife on May 17 at around 7 am. He spoke to her for a short while and told her about the vessel which sent out an SOS signal to the Indian Navy after the storm intensified to an extremely severe cyclonic storm earlier that morning. That was the last she heard from him. A relative identified his body on May 20 after he scoured the list of survivors put out by the Navy, but couldn’t find Pandey’s name on it.Nilesh Pitale, 44, fire safety officer A Pune resident, Pitale worked as fire safety officer on the barge P305. Some survivors whom HT spoke to remembered Pitale with gratitude. The 44-year-old helped several crew members survive, by distributing biscuits and water after water entered their vessel and destroyed the food available in the kitchen. The barge, which got unmoored after all 12 of its anchors broke off, began to fill up with water around 2 pm on May 17. By 7pm it had sunk completely. Younger brother Vishwanath, who also lives in Pune and works in a courier company, identified Pitale’s body at JJ Hospital and took the body for cremation on May 21. Pitale leaves behind a wife, two elderly parents, a 17-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter. He was the only earning member in his family. Upendra Singh, 39, rigger Upendra Singh, a rigger on P305, belonged to a small village in Devaria district of Uttar Pradesh. His younger brother Satyendra (35) also worked as a rigger on another vessel, Trinity Nissi, which was also chartered by the consortium led by Afcons Infrastructure and was stationed at Heera Oil Fields. Singh had just joined work in October. On May 14, when the cyclone warning went out, Trinity left for the Mumbai shore but P305 moved 200 metres from the rig and dropped anchor. Satyendra identified his brother’s body at JJ hospital on May 20 and performed last rites back in their village two days later. The company helped fly the body back, and took care of the expenses, Satyendra said. Singh is survived by his wife, elderly parents and three children – two daughters, aged 12 and three, and a son aged five. Krishna Kumar Prajapati, 28, welder Krishna Kumar Prajapati, 28, was the only child of his parents who are farmers in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. Prajapati, worked as welder, earning ₹600 a day for 12 hours. On many days, he worked a few hours overtime to earn ₹150 to 200 more every day. He wanted to save enough money to send home as the pandemic had affected his family’s finances badly. Prajapati had other family members working with him on the barge. One named Anil had finished his contract on February 28. It was he who identified Prajapati’s body at the mortuary. Another cousin, 22-year-old Anup Prajapati, worked as helper on the same barge, but he returned to land 10 days previously after receiving a message that his parents had fallen ill. On May 16, as the storm began to gather intensity leading to the barge getting unmoored, Prajapati sent a message to Anup: “Cyclone ki wajah se barge full out hai” [The barge has gone out to the sea because of the cyclone]. Pappuram Meghwal, 32, pipe fitter Pappuram Meghwal working as a pipe fitter with his older brother Amararam (40) and younger cousin Mahendra Runawat on the barge. Married with two children, Pappuram jumped into the water with his two brothers before the barge sank on May 17. However, he couldn’t survive the choppy sea even as the naval ships involved in rescuing. His body was identified by his father last week and taken back to the village in ambulance from Mumbai. His last rites were performed on May 22. Yogendra Yadav, 45, rigger Yogendra Yadav, a resident of Kushinagar district, Uttar Pradesh was a rigger aboard P305 – a profession that he has been in for the past 12 years. He earned around ₹26,000 per month, most of which he sent back to his family which comprised of a wife and five children including three daughters and two sons ranging from 22 to 7 years.He was the sole breadwinner of his family and his death has hit them hard. His nephews Gulshan Yadav (20) and Pankaj (25), residents of Nalasopara identified the body. Gulshan said that Yadav’s wife is “in shock”. “My aunt is still in shock and clueless about how would she raise all the children alone. She is under tremendous trauma as the incident happened at a time when there was already so much pandemic related panic around.” Yadav’s body was cremated in his home town last week. Kulwinder Singh, 44, rigger Kulwinder Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur, Punjab had been working on the barge as a rigger, which involved physical work. For it, he earned between ₹20,000 to ₹22,000 a month, most of which he sent to his farmer family back home. A relative Jagpreet Singh, also from Gurdaspur, was also on the barge, and jumped into the choppy waters. He survived, and identified Singh’s body. Jagpreet was angry that the barge continued to stay on in the sea despite the cyclone warning, especially as other barges made their way back to safety. “The people responsible for the tragedy should not be spared and must face strict action,” he said. Singh is survived by his wife, two sons aged 8 and 12 years and a 5-year-old daughter. After the tragedy his family is in shock. The government should give a job to the family. Only monetary compensation won’t be of much help as he was the only earning member in the poor family,” Jagpreet said.Sachindra Prasad Singh, 59, barge surveyor. Sachindra Prasad Singh hailed from Darbhanga in Bihar, and worked as a barge surveyor. On May 17, Singh jumped into the choppy waters but could not be rescued. His son, Rudra Kumar, 26, came down to the city to identify the body and said that his family is inconsolable. “My family is in deep shock. We are busy in performing the rituals. My family is not in position to express the loss. It would not be easy for us to come out of this. I lost my father. It’s irreparable. The police must seriously investigate the matter and punish those responsible for it.”Vishal Katdare, 35, quality control engineer Vishal Katdare, a resident of Ambernath in Thane district, had only just got married in March, when he got this job offer. It was a tough decision to make but Katdare decided to take it, and joined the barge in April. “The family has not heard anything on the progress of the investigation of the case. We want a detailed investigation by police to find out if any one’s negligence led to the incident. The family members are in trauma and are not in condition to speak to anyone. They are shattered,” said Pawan Kulkarni, the cousin of Katdare, who identified the body. Amararam Meghwal, 39 A native of a remote village in Pali district of Rajasthan, Amararam was working on the barge P305 as a pipe fitter. On May 17, when the barge was going under water, he jumped into the sea, holding the hand of his younger brother, Pappuram, and a cousin, 19-year-old Mahendra Runawat. Amararam and Pappuram succumbed after spending four to five hours in the very choppy sea, but their younger cousin managed to survive. Amararam’s body was identified by another cousin brother, Kishor, on May 24. The family has received two cheques of ₹5 lakh from Afcons, the family said. “I don’t know the exact salary, but Amararam and Pappuram used to earn Rs. 35000 to 40000 per month including overtime salary,” he said, adding that the loss of income will hit the family hard. The body was transported to Rajasthan by ambulance on May 24, while his brother’s body was transported and handed to the family over the weekend. The last rites of both brothers have been completed. Amararam is survived by a wife, two children. IDENTIFICATION PENDING Shivkumar Mishra 52, missing Mishra, who hailed from Kushinagar district in Uttar Pradesh, had been working as a supervisor on the barge since October 2020. His earnings, which amounted to ₹1 lakh a month, helped his large family back home, which included a 17-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter. The last call he made to them was around 8:30am on May 17: the storm had already intensified and the barge had sent out an SOS signal as the weather worsened. Mishra told his family members about the situation. He also told his wife that there was network issue due to the cyclone but she should not worry, he would call her once the weather became normal. That was the last call that the 52-year-old made to his family. Santosh Mishra, a relative residing in Mira Road, visited JJ Hospital every day this past week and waited for hours till late in the evening in the hope that the Navy would bring Mishra’s body to the state-run hospital. Now, Mishra’s older brother who was supposed to come to Mumbai to enable a DNA test, tested positive for Covid and couldn’t travel. A relative from the village will carry some of his hair and nails to Mumbai, Santosh said. “Some of the bodies arrived here are not in a condition to be identified and we now have to do DNA test,” he said. Santosh Yadav, 32 Santosh Yadav, who hailed from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, had worked as electrician on P305 since November 2020. The 32-year-old had married early and had three children: two sons and a daughter, all aged between six and 11 years. Yadav earned more than ₹1000 per day for 12 hours of work, most of which went back to his family, a relative said. For the past three days, Yadav’s family members including his aged father, Mathura Prasad, have been pacing the JJ Hospital compound as they wait anxiously for news from the Navy’s search and rescue operations. On Monday, the search operations were called off. Mathura Prasad, a farmer, said that the process of identification through DNA is going on. Ranalakhi Kumar, 28 Ranalakhi Kumar had worked as a technician on P305 since November 2020. On May 17, as the barge began to sink, he jumped into the rough sea despite the stormy weather along with several others. His cousin Rana Singh worked as a technician on Trinity Nissi, another barge that was working at Heera Oil Fields and returned to shore after receiving the cyclone warning. While P305 had 261 on board, Trinity Nissi had 250 people on board and it was anchored near the Mumbai harbour. On May 19, many workers on board fought with the Master to return to land. They had heard what happened to P305, and some like Rana, had family members on that barge. Rana is still waiting for news of his cousin whose body has still not been identified. Kumar, a resident of Chhapara district in Bihar has two children, a 4-year old daughter and one-and-half-year-old son.

26-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha reservation issue: King Shivaji’s descendant leaning towards Congress?||Even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)is squarely blaming the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition government for Supreme Court’s decision to scrap reservation given to Maratha community in government jobs and education, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Maratha warrior king Shivaji and BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP, has openly taken a stand that is against the party line in Maharashtra. Amid the speculations that he is inching towards the Congress, Sambhajiraje has refused to blame the MVA government for the apex court’s decision. Speaking at public platforms after the May 5 judgment by the Supreme Court on Maratha quota, Sambhajiraje expressed his displeasure that he was denied an appointment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for discussion over the Maratha issue. The MP has been vocal on the reservation and has begun a state tour to galvanise support. During his tour in Solapur, he said on Tuesday that he was ready to resign as an MP if required. He also clarified his tour was not in favour of or against any political party or the government. He also appealed the Maratha leaders and organisations not to resort to the protest for the reservation. His retort came following remarks by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Monday that PM Modi may not have met Sambhajiraje because Maratha reservation issue is limited to only one state. “The Centre has taken clear stand related to the 102nd constitutional amendment on reservation. What else would Modiji have discussed with the MP,” he asked. When asked about Sambhajiraje’s appeal to Maratha outfits not resort to protest, Patil said everybody has right to say what he/she wishes in democracy. The bonhomie between Sambhajiraje and Congress is visible. The Congress on Tuesday objected to Patil’s remarks and criticised Modi for not meeting Sambhajiraje and thus insulting Maratha community. “PM Modi has time to meet Kangana Ranaut and Priyanka Chopra, but not Sambhajiraje who wanted to talk about Maratha reservation,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. Public works minister and head of state cabinet’s sub-committee on Maratha reservation, Ashok Chavan, too, appreciated Sambhajiraje’s stand on the issue. “He has taken a stand which is realistic and with an intention to give justice to Maratha community. We respect his opinion,”Chavan said after a meeting on the issue on Tuesday. Soon after the reservation was struck down, Sambhajiraje had said that he does not hold any government – incumbent or the previous – responsible for the ruling. At the same time, Maharashtra BJP leaders were criticising Uddhav Thackeray-led state government and warned it with the protest claiming it was state government’s failure. Patil has even announced support to the protests, beginning from first week of June. “My commitment is with the community. I am not answerable to BJP. The party should take its stand on reservation and suggest the way forward towards the reservation…. I requested prime minister Narendra Modi for an appointment to discuss Maratha reservation, but there was no response,” the MP said recently. Many in political circles feel that the MP may not continue with the BJP for long. “His entire family is has been close to the Congress. His brother Maloji Shahu Chhatrapati was a Congress MLA in 2004. He has time and again clarified that he has been nominated to Rajya Sabha by President and has no direct relation with the BJP. He shares cordial relations with the MVA leaders and was recently praised by Thackeray in his Facebook live address for the sensible stand taken by him after the SC ruling. It would be too early to predict anything, but a major development is expected on that front,” said a Congress leader. Political analyst from Western Maharashtra Prakash Pawar said, “Ever since another direct descendent of Shivaji Maharaj Udayanraje Bhosale joined the BJP in 2019, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati appears to be disturbed in the party. His statement against the BJP is a clear indication of his plans and he is testing waters by deliberately doing so. His political move will be clear towards the end of his term as an MP in the next few months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-issue-king-shivaji-s-descendant-leaning-towards-congress-101621970350924.html
26-05-2021||Other||348 newly elected gram pradhans sworn in, 274 others to take oath today in Prayagraj||In a first, 348 newly elected gram pradhans in 23 development blocks of the district took the oath of office in virtual ceremonies on Tuesday. The remaining 274 gram pradhans will take the oaths on Wednesday. The virtual oath-taking ceremonies conducted with the help of Google and Zoom links were held at primary schools and Panchayat Bhawans, intimation regarding which were provided to the gram pradhans concerned in advance by the Panchayati Raj department officials, informed district Panchayati raj officer (DPRO) Renu Srivastava. She said that returning officers were stationed at each site of the swearing-in ceremony to ensure the physical presence of the newly elected gram pradhans while block development officers had been entrusted the task of taking signatures of each of the individual being administered the oath on the document as required under the norms. The rest of all the proceedings were held in virtual mode. The district has a total of 1540 Gram Sabhas but many of these have posts of gram panchayat members lying vacant and for the swearing-in, the set quorum must be complete. As a result, swearing-in of just 629 is scheduled to be held on the two days while the remaining 911 gram pradhans would be sworn in only when this quorum gets completed, officials shared. The DPRO said that the district has a total of 19,820 posts of gram panchayat members who are sworn in along with the gram pradhans and so around 7,500 of them would also be sworn in later when their respective gram pradhans are administered the oaths. Earlier, district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami had issued the notification for the swearing-in ceremonies of newly elected gram pradhans and panchayat members to be held in virtual mode late on Monday night entrusting the responsibilities of conducting the ceremonies on respective officials of the various development blocks. They were sent the Google and Zoom links on Tuesday morning through which they then administered the oaths. Polling under the first phase of the three-tier panchayat elections had taken place in Prayagraj on April 15. Voting in all 1540 gram sabhas of 23 development blocks of the district was held at 5269 polling booths. The counting began on May 2 at centres set up in each development block and results of the elections were declared on May 2 and May 3.

26-05-2021||Mumbai||Samant-Fadnavis meeting leads to speculation||Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nilesh Rane’s claims of a “secret meeting” between Shiv Sena minister Uday Samant and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis last week have led to political speculations. However, Samant has dismissed the rumours, saying it was an incidental meeting in Ratnagiri, when the two leaders were on a tour to assess the damage due to cyclone Tauktae in Konkan region. Rane, the elder son of former chief minister and Sena bete-noire Narayan Rane, tweeted that Samant and his brother wanted to meet Fadnavis during the latter’s tour to Ratnagiri last week. “The two somehow reached saheb’s (Fadnavis’) room; unwilling to meet, still Devendra ji met with them,” Rane tweeted, setting the tongues wagging in the political circles. Samant, who is state higher and technical education minister, said it was not a closed-door meeting as Rane had claimed and that he met Fadnavis while “200 others” were present at the guest house in Ratnagiri.Samant said this was an attempt to “destabilize” his political career but it will not “diminish” the trust Sena chief and Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray have in him. He said he does not pay heed to the claims made by the Ranes, “who have been rejected by the people of Konkan twice”.The minister, who hails from Ratnagiri district, said he met Fadnavis as the former CM was at the same guesthouse and it was merely to welcome him in his district. “Why would I meet in front of 200 people? This incident occurred six days ago when I was on tour of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. Former chief minister [Fadnavis] came to the guesthouse in Ratnagiri where I was staying. As per the political culture of Maharashtra, if somebody senior like a former CM or opposition leader has come to the district, it is my duty to welcome him, which I did. I did not meet him alone. Those who were present there included BJP leaders Pravin Darekar, Ravindra Chavan, and Prasad Lad. I came to the guesthouse before he (Fadnavis) arrived and if I met him incidentally and exchanged greetings, I do not think I have committed any crime,” Samant clarified on Tuesday.Samant, who came to the Shiv Sena from Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 2014, is one of the key leaders from Konkan region, which is Sena’s stronghold. He is considered close to the Thackerays and was chosen to be a minister in 2019, overlooking two leaders from Konkan, including former minister of state for home Deepak Kesarkar, and former minister in Congress-NCP government Bhaskar Jadhav, who joined the Sena from NCP in 2019. The minister also dismissed rumours around “operation Lotus” (BJP’s alleged plan to bring down a government) , saying that he does not need to jump ship. “If somebody thinks that by tweeting such things, the trust that Uddhav ji and Aaditya ji have in me will diminish, it is very immature of them. There is no need for operation Lotus because a Shiv Sena chief minister will remain in the chair in future as well. Our Maha Vikas Aghadi is strong. Therefore, I don’t need to look at this operation lotus of theirs.”Later, Rane in a video tweet said that Samant could not have denied meeting Fadnavis and is now “in a fix” to save his ministership. “What culture are you talking about? Many former chief ministers come to Ratnagiri, you don’t go to meet them. … You know that BJP will come to power the next time, so you have planted a seed so that you can jump the ship when it is time,” Rane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/samantfadnavis-meeting-leads-to-speculation-101621970170955.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae-hit to get hiked compensation: CM||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday announced a hike in compensation rate for people who suffered losses due to cyclone Tauktae, which hit the coastal districts last week. With the multi-fold rise in compensation amount, the financial burden is expected to be around ₹250 crore, according to the preliminary estimates. The cyclone has caused damage to crops and horticulture on around 16,000 hectares in coastal districts of Konkan, including Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Raigad and few districts of western, northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha. The compensation hike is at least two to three times the set norms of National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). The compensation for horticultural losses has been hiked to ₹50,000 a hectare, from the existing ₹18,000; the compensation for the partial loss of residential structure has been increased to ₹15,000 from ₹6,000. The complete loss of house will be compensated with ₹150,000, against the existing norm of ₹95,100. The financial aid for loss of utensils and clothing has been hiked by double to ₹5,000. Similarly, compensation for losses of coconut and betel nut trees is hiked to ₹250 and ₹50 per tree. “According to the progressive report from the five districts in Konkan, crops and horticulture on 9,280 hectares have been damaged. It is on more than 11,000 hectares, after adding up the losses from other divisions and is expected to reach to around 16,000 hectares gradually. According to our estimates, as per the set NDRF forms, the losses are around ₹80 crore, which is expected to increase to ₹250 crore due to the hiked compensation,” said an official from relief and rehabilitation department. A total of 565 fishing boats sustained partial damages, while 90 were fully damaged in coastal districts. Cyclone Tauktae caused damage to horticulture, houses and government buildings and also claimed 20 lives. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his visit to Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg had said that the compensation would be announced after the assessment was completed. His office announced on Tuesday that the cyclone-hit districts will be given compensation on the lines of the one given after cyclone Nisarg last year. The state government had disbursed ₹725 crore towards the relief package for cyclone-hit districts last year. The Central government shared ₹268 crore out of it, against the demand of ₹1,065 crore by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-hit-to-get-hiked-compensation-cm-101621970051647.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||RSS chief must give opinion on bodies floating in Ganga: Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut appealed to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat to take a firm stand on dead bodies that washed up on the banks of river Ganga without last rites. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the issue is related to Hindutva and is as important as Ram Mandir. Raut also said the ‘toolkit’ and other social media platforms that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used, to target its political opponents, have now backfired on them.The Sena chief spokesperson’s statements on fatalities in Uttar Pradesh came at a time when the top brass of the RSS and BJP leaders met this week to discuss the party’s image on handling the Covid-19 crisis in the state. The northern state is slated to go for polls in eight-nine months.“We expect him to express strong views on various issues. However, for the last few months, everyone has been silent, especially, when thousands of dead bodies have been found floating in the river of Ganga, without last rites being performed, as per the rituals. The issue is related to Hindutva and as important as Ram Mandir,” Raut said.“People in the country expect that pro-Hindu leaders across the country should clarify their stand on the issue and I appeal to Mohan Bhagwat ji that he should express his views on it,” added Raut.The Sena leader also slammed BJP on the ‘toolkit’ issue and said the issue has not only started a debate in the country but everywhere in the world. “Whether it was toolkit, Twitter or other social media platforms, BJP used all this to target its political opponent earlier. Now it has backfired on them and they have started pressurising them through various ways, like conducting raids,” added Raut. He further said that he is watching and enjoying it. BJP had alleged that the Congress party is using a toolkit to defame the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over handling the pandemic.Continuing his attack on Maharashtra Raj Bhavan, Raut said that he is happy that the file containing 12 nominations recommended by the state for the members of the Legislative Council (MLC) is with Raj Bhavan. “I am happy that file is with Raj Bhavan but I will distribute sweets to everyone in Raj Bhavan, whenever the Governor signs the file.” He added that the file is not about Bofors or Rafael or any corruption case but contains names of people recommended unanimously by the state cabinet for MLC posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rss-chief-must-give-opinion-on-bodies-floating-in-ganga-raut-101621970050973.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha says eight global vax bids in; are deals possible?||The Maharashtra government said it has received eight responses to its global tenders for supplying Covid-19 vaccines, the deadline for which ended on Tuesday. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has received bids for the supply of vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Sputnik and AstraZeneca, even as nothing has been spelt out on how the proposals can go forward, considering one, Pfizer has reiterated its stance on dealing with only the Centre and that the vaccine is yet to be cleared for use in the country; two, Astrazeneca already has a pact with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is manufacturing the same vaccine under the Covishield brand name; three, a few Indian companies have already got the licence to manufacture the Sputnik vaccine.Against this backdrop, government officials will scrutinise the documents, as they said it is too early to call the tendering process a success because the bids have been submitted by suppliers or middlemen, among several other issues concerning the authenticity of the proposals and an absence of a supply schedule. Pfizer told HT that they have not appointed any supplier. “As stated earlier, during this pandemic phase, across the world, Pfizer is supplying its Covid-19 vaccine only to central Governments and supra-national organizations for deployment in national immunization programs. Neither Pfizer Inc nor any of its affiliates globally, including in India, have authorized anyone to import/market/distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the Government of India towards making our vaccine available for use nationally,” said a Pfizer Company spokesperson.According to officials, a total of eight firms have responded to the global tenders floated by the state. At least five of them offered to supply the Sputnik vaccines, while three have proposed to supply Pfizer, Astrazeneca and Moderna. Moderna, too, had said it will deal with only the Centre. Officials said they will verify the proposals and also have consultations with the bidders to decide if the bids can be processed further.Earlier, Tope said, “As we all know, Pfizer is a US firm, while Sputnik and Astrazeneca are manufactured by Russian and UK firms respectively. The bidders have even quoted a price for a dose, but have not shared any schedule on supplies, which is the most important thing for us. If they provide us the schedule for vaccine supply, then Maharashtra is ready for procurement.”On May 17, the state government floated an express of interest (EOI) for procuring 50 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration, and are being manufactured in other countries. In the beginning, the last date for submitting the bids was May 20, which was extended till May 25. By floating global tenders, the state was aiming at importing the doses of the vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Zydus Cadila, Sputnik, among others.While Tope seemed optimistic, state officials dealing with the process said that the response received by the state government is not directly from the manufacturing companies. “All those who have submitted the bids are intermediaries. They have also not given any schedule for supply of doses. Following this, we have sent emails to each of them, seeking a schedule for supplies. We will also be holding a virtual meeting with them, seeking all the necessary information before taking any decision on the bids received,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Each of them is ready to supply 10 million doses. The price quoted by them is in the range of 15 to 18 dollars per dose, which is likely to cost the state somewhere around Rs1,100 to Rs1,400 per dose, he added.Officials said the significant part would be to verify if the claims made by the bidders are backed by the manufacturers and whether they are practically possible. “We will have to consider factors such as the stance taken by companies such as Pfizer and Moderna, that they will deal only with the central government. They are also insisting on indemnity by the central government, which has not been resolved yet. In case of Sputnik, a bunch of Indian companies have got license to manufacture the vaccine and in such a case, they would have to follow Centre’s guidelines on sale of vaccine,” said another official, wishing not to be named. “Besides, we will have to consider whether AstraZeneca can supply in India since the Pune-based Serum Institute of India has an agreement with the former to manufacture and supply the same vaccine under ‘Covishield’ brand name,” said the official.The state government had suspended its inoculation drive for those below 45 years due to non-availability of doses on May 12. It was trying to place orders with Indian and foreign manufacturers to replenish their stocks and reopen all centres.The central government provides free doses for those coming under 45 years and above age group, but for the beneficiaries of the 18-45 age group, the stock has to be procured by the state government. The Indian manufacturers have also not given any confirmed supply schedule to the state, except assurance of improving supplies from June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-says-eight-global-vax-bids-in-are-deals-possible-101621969990971.html

He passed away on Sunday night,” a senior prison official, who asked not to be named, said.The officer added that Bohta was arrested in a theft case and lodged in the prison on April 9.In the last two weeks, around 3,000 prisoners from Delhi’s jails have been released on interim bail and emergency parole. The high-powered committee, consisting members of the high court, state government, prison department and the Delhi police, on May 7 recommended the release of such prisoners as one of the steps to decongest the prisons . Until last month, Tihar had around 20,500 prisoners against its sanctioned capacity of 10,026.Till date, 1,922 prisoners have been vaccinated within the complex. Of these 50 prisoners above 45 have got second dose of vaccination. Total number of vaccinated prisoners above 45 years is 1,552. Also, at least 370 prisoners between 18 and 45 have been vaccinated, jail officials said.Currently there are 22 prisoners who are infected with the disease. Since April 6, the prison has reported at least 370 cases of Covid-19, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seventh-tihar-prisoner-succumbs-to-covid19-101621969930936.html
26-05-2021||Delhi||Police to train youngsters in primary health care to deal with possible third Covid wave||Hundreds of youngsters will be trained as primary health-care workers over the next few weeks under the Delhi Police’s YUVA initiative to ready them for a possible third wave of Covid-19, Delhi Police said Tuesday. These youngsters will be trained as nursing care assistants, emergency medical technicians, home care assistants and ambulance drivers, among others.“The first batch of 55 youngsters already began receiving training in the north Delhi district from Saturday. We are going to have the youth receive health-care training at most of our 23 YUVA skill centres over the next few days,” said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson.Launched in 2017, the Delhi Police’s YUVA initiative has been arranging for employment skills to be imparted to youngsters at police stations so that they stay away from crime. According to the police, 20,000 youngsters have been trained to become skilled in a trade ranging from beauticians to technicians. Devesh Srivastava, special commissioner heading the initiative, said while health care was one of the many skills imparted to them, now it is being scaled up. “We will soon have at least a few hundred trained youngsters over the next few weeks and months to deal with a possible third wave of the pandemic,” he said.Anro Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north), said help from health-care organisations and laboratories was sought to train the youngsters. “It is a mix of theoretical as well as practical knowledge,” said Alphonse.Dr Dashvinder Singh, who is associated with NGO Sewa Bharti, which is involved in the training work in north district, said the need for “nursing care assistants” was felt during the second wave.“Patients had oxygen cylinders, but they didn’t know how to use them. We needed people to help with testing oxygen levels, collecting blood samples and reading blood pressure levels, but we were short of hands. The youth we are training will be crucial in coordinating between patients, doctors and nurses,” said Singh.He said that since a large number of these YUVA youngsters will also be trained as home care assistants. “These youngsters can help us deal with the crisis and go on to make a career in health care,” said Singh.Shivani Santosh Kumar, a 20-year-old woman undergoing training and living in Majnu Ka Tilla, said in the first three days, she learnt a few basics of nursing.She is undergoing seven days of initial training and she decides to pursue it further, she’ll be trained at a hospital. “The immediate focus is on a possible third wave of Covid-19, bur I am also looking at a future in the health-care industry,” Shivani said.On Monday, the police commissioner, SN Srivastava, coordinated with a host of stakeholders who will be helping with the training and placement of the youngsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-to-train-youngsters-in-primary-health-care-to-deal-with-possible-third-covid-wave-101621969871021.html
26-05-2021||City||How Odisha's model of disaster preparedness came into being||In October 1999, a super cyclone of massive proportions ripped through the entire Odisha coast snuffing away over 10,000 lives while rendering millions homeless. The 1999 cyclone remains etched in our memories as an apocalyptic failure of the administration as the mighty winds wreaked havoc exposing the extreme vulnerability of people to the whims of nature.In 2013, Cyclone Phailin wreaked havoc in the state affecting over 1.1 million people and causing damages worth ₹4,240 crore.A little more than two years ago, on May 3, 2019, Odisha was hit by cyclone Fani with a sustained windspeed of 180-190 km per hour that claimed 64 lives and caused damages worth over ₹24,176 crore. Termed “rarest of the rare” summer cyclone, Fani could have wreaked huge casualties across the districts of Puri and Khurda but for the massive pre-disaster planning undertaken by the state government. As the state readies for cyclone Yaas, scheduled to make landfall on May 26 noon, its expertise and resilience in dealing with disasters have come in for praise.Home to over 4.6 crore people, Odisha, along the Bay of Bengal, often acts as a magnet for all kinds of natural disasters starting from floods, cyclones to droughts. Between 1891 and 2021, over 100 tropical cyclones are known to have lashed Odisha — the highest number among other states on the coast.Professor Santosh Kumar of the National Institute of Disaster Management, who has studied the post-disaster response of Odisha in the wake of the 1999 super cyclone as well as the 2019 Fani cyclone, said Odisha has come a long way in the last two decades."Odisha has been able to protect its people. That's the most important part. In terms of bringing down the number of lives lost and the people getting affected, the state has done well. This has never happened in one day. Odisha took a conscious decision and gradually built upon its capacity, particularly at the community level. It has successfully started community-level warning, built multi-purpose cyclone shelters under National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project and built an Early Warning Dissemination System with last-mile connectivity. The capacity to deal with natural disasters has increased tremendously at the community level. If there is a model of preventing largescale deaths in disaster, we can call it the Odisha model," said Prof Kumar.From over 10,000 deaths in the 1999 cyclone, the fatalities have mostly been in double digits in most of the cyclones including the Phailin cyclone in 2013, Hudhud in 2014, Titli in 2018 and Fani in 2019 that swept through Odisha. Experts say timely evacuation due to an early warning system has helped.In October 1999, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued cyclone warnings three days before the cyclone struck the Odisha coast. Compared to that, the prediction for most of the cyclones has been at least 5-6 days prior to its landfall giving adequate time to the administration to take necessary steps."In 1999, the Odisha government learned about the change of path of the super cyclone pretty late and soon after the state’s communication networks collapsed and the situation could no longer be monitored. But now, cyclone warning by the IMD comes pretty early and is accurate with least deviation and observed path and predicted path almost going on the same line. This has not just inspired confidence among the people on the ground but also the officials. This has also prevented a large number of unnecessary evacuation," said prof Kumar.In April 2018, Odisha become the first Indian state to have an early warning system in place for natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunami for people living along its 480 km-long coast. The EWDS is a full-proof communication system to address the existing gap in disseminating disaster warning by strengthening the emergency operation centres in the state. At present, as many as 1,205 villages from 22 blocks in the coastal districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Puri and Ganjam have been covered under the EWDS. As part of the system, watchtowers have been set up at 122 locations within 1.5 km from the coastline for dissemination of cyclone or tsunami warning through sirens and mass messaging.“Establishment of EWDS is part of our robust disaster preparedness strategy aiming to save lives on a priority basis," said Kamal Lochan Mishra, executive director of Odisha State Disaster Management Authority.The specially designed multi-purpose cyclone shelters built on high stilts have also ensured that loss of lives is minimal even during sea surges and persistent water-logging. The 1999 cyclone led to massive sea surges with water ingressing up to 20 km, gobbling villages. In 1999, there were just 23 permanent cyclone shelters in 6 coastal districts that could accommodate about 30,000 people. But learning from its failures, Odisha has built a network of such shelters along the coastline."Odisha has a great community outreach system through which people are being reached on time. It now has a network of over 870 cyclone and flood shelters that can house 1000 people each. Over 450 cyclone shelters have maintenance committees where youth have been involved and trained for search and rescue, first aid medical attention, and for providing cyclone warnings," said Deepak Singh, lead disaster risk management specialist at the World Bank.Apart from the decentralized governance institutional set-up, Odisha also has a disaster-specific institutional mechanism. It has established 16 district-level disaster management planning committees which reach out to 155 block-level disaster management planning committees and 22,000 village-level disaster management committees.The state has raised 20 units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) that comprises highly trained personnel with multi-disaster tackling capabilities. Equipped with 66 types of sophisticated equipment required for disaster management, including road clearing equipment, branch cutter, tree pruner, concrete cutter, RCC cutter, boat, inflatable tower light, generator, forklift, hydraulic rescue kit, collapse structure search & rescue (CSSR) kit, medical first responder (MFR) kit, ambulance, manikin, high discharge submersible pump, flexi tent, flexi water tank, mountaineering equipment, commando searchlight, diving equipment set, breathing apparatus with a gas mask and chemical cartridge, the force is well-trained in tackling floods, building collapses, cyclones, biological and nuclear disasters.The proliferation of TV and mobile phones have made people aware of cyclones much before it makes landfall. In 1999, the chief secretary did not have a mobile phone and no second line of communications were kept ready. There was no Internet connection in the Odisha secretariat in 1999.Twenty-two years ago, there were not many pucca houses along the coast compared to 2021 when the state government has converted a large number of these houses to pucca ones under state-specific schemes like Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana, Mo Kudia or central schemes like Pradhan Mantri Grameen Awas Yojana. In 1999, the panchayats did not stock basic rations like rice, pulses, jaggery and kerosene while in subsequent disasters all panchayats stock basic rations."Like all previous disasters, our goal is not to allow a single person to die. Zero casualty remains our goal," said Pradip Jena, special relief commissioner of Odisha.However, Odisha has fallen short in its post-disaster response as well as preventing large scale damages to its infrastructure and primary sector like agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry.When Cyclone Fani struck Odisha coast, the state suffered losses worth ₹8,138 crore in the power sector due to the snapping of thousands of kilometres of power lines and electrical towers throwing several parts of the cyclone-affected area into darkness for more than two months. More than 5,500 base transceiver stations of various mobile telecom companies were damaged in the cyclone.The damage to the telecom BTS IN cities of Puri, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack led to mobile connectivity outage in 80% of areas across the three cities and resulted in disconnecting millions of users, including citizens, government officials and first responders, for weeks. Odisha State Wide Area Network, which was set up to connect the state with 30 district headquarters and 284 block headquarters and 61 horizontal offices through data, video and voice communications also failed.Fani hit the housing sector the hardest, damaging nearly 3.62 lakh units of houses across the 14 districts. As per an estimate by the state government, the combined economic losses to the state from the last 3 cyclones - Phailin, Titli, and Fani - was around ₹40,474 crore."Odisha needs to protect its infrastructure from getting hit in future disasters. Both central and state government infrastructures have been repeatedly lost during cyclones. The agriculture and horticulture sector have to be made resilient to such routine disasters. Odisha would hopefully become a model state in that," said Prof Kumar.Last 5 cyclones in OdishaOctober 2013: Extremely severe cyclonic storm Phailin crossed Odisha coast at Gopalpur, accompanied by a storm surge of 5 feet and heavy rainfall.

26-05-2021||Delhi||Tauktae made this May the rainiest in Delhi in 13 years: IMD||The 144.8mm of rain that Delhi received so far this May, is the highest for the month in at least the past 13 years, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The last time Delhi saw more rain in May was in 2008 when it recorded 165mm of rain in the entire month.Over 119mm of incessant rain, induced by the remnants of Cyclone Tauktae and a western disturbance, had lashed Delhi in the 24 hours beginning 8.30am Wednesday till 8.30am Thursday last week, breaking the capital’s all-time 24-hour rainfall record for the month of May.“Two main events this month contributed towards that record rainfall. We received a substantial amount of rain on account of Cyclone Tauktae in one day. Subsequently, there was another spell of rain on account of a western disturbance,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre.Srivastava said while the city had received rain on account of a number of western disturbances this month, rainfall in the aftermath of the cyclone was primarily the major contributor towards the monthly rainfall quota.“We also saw rain on account of western disturbances but the major share of rainfall was contributed by the moderate rainfall we received in the aftermath of the cyclone. This was followed by another spell of rain. Prior to that, the highest single-day rain record in May was in 2008,” said Srivastava.He said since no further rain is predicted in the coming week, the recorded rainfall could be considered as the reading for the month.The Safdarjung observatory, whose readings are taken as representative of the whole city, had recorded 21.1mm of rain in May last year. The recorded rainfall for the month of May stood at 26.9mm in 2019 and 24.2mm in 2018. In the years preceding that, rainfall received stood at 40.5mm in 2017, 24.3mm in 2016, 3.1mm in 2015, and 100.2mm in 2014, as per the IMD data.Srivastava said unlike the past few years, the Capital had not recorded any heatwave days this May so far. Meteorologists declare a heatwave when the maximum temperature for a location in the plains crosses 40 degrees Celsius. In the hills, the threshold temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. Also, when the departure in the maximum day temperature is 4.5 degrees to 6.5 degrees above normal, a heatwave is declared.“The temperature is not expected to cross 44 degrees Celsius. Unless that happens, there will be no heatwave. As many as five western disturbances, along with the impact of the cyclone, have kept away heatwave conditions so far,” said Srivastava.The minimum temperature in Delhi on Tuesday was 23 degrees Celsius, two degrees more than the previous day’s 21.2 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was 39.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees more than Monday’s reading of 36 degrees. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 40 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 24 degrees Celsius. Clear skies will prevail on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tauktae-made-this-may-the-rainiest-in-delhi-in-13-years-imd-101621969812876.html
26-05-2021||Other||Delhi: Licences of 25 chemist shops suspended for selling Covid drugs without prescription||Delhi government’s drugs control department has suspended the licences of 25 drug stores and initiated action against 12 others for selling medicine used in the treatment of Covid-19 without prescriptions. Department officials said they sent decoy customers to various stores across the city during drives conducted this month to purchase Ivermectin, antibiotics like azithromycin, and steroids to check if the medicines were being sold without a doctor’s prescription. The action comes when cases of secondary mucormycosis or black fungus are on the rise, which doctors are attributing to compromised immunity due to indiscriminate use of steroids in patients who have recovered from Covid , besides other factors such as diabetes.  “After streamlining the availability of medicines such as remdesivir and tocilizumab during the peak of Covid wave, we focussed on the ones that are usually readily available such as ivermectin, antibiotics and steroids. These drugs, however, should not be given without a doctor’s prescription. In view of the pandemic, we took quick action and suspended the licences of 25 chemist shops within three days, after giving them a day to respond to the show cause notices,” said A K Nasa, head of Delhi’s drug control office. The licences of the 25 drug stores were suspended after they sold ivermectin and antibiotics to the decoy customers without prescription on May 14 and 15. The drugs come under schedule H and H1 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, that requires that the retailers sell it only on prescription from registered medical practitioners and maintain records of their sale. Showcause notices have been sent to 12 other drug stores which were found selling steroids such as dexamethasone and budesonide without prescriptions on May 17 and 21. Their licences are also likely to be suspended. Last Saturday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) ordered all pharmacies across the city to display the stock position and MRP of eight medicines such as Ivermectin, Doxycycline, Dexamethosone that are used for the treatment of Covid-19. “Now we will conduct regular drives to see whether this is being followed,” said Nasa. Last year, when there was a shortage of remdesivir as cases of Covid-19 started increasing, the drugs control department stationed its inspectors with the seven stockists in the city to ensure people in need get it after submitting documents like Aadhaar, doctor’s prescription, and a positive Covid-19 report. This, however, could not be done during the current wave because of the large number of cases and huge demand for the medicine. “We decided to create a portal to make the process transparent. The suppliers were told to upload details of available stock of remdesivir as per Centre’s allocation on the portal and details of which stockist was given how many vials of the injection. Then, the stockists had to upload how many vials they received and which hospitals they sold to. The hospitals were also asked to enter details of patients who were given the medicine. This way, no one could hoard the medicines or sell it directly to people. Now, there is good availability of the medicine in Delhi,” said Nasa. To be sure, the number of new Covid-19 cases has also reduced from over 28,000 at the peak of the fourth wave of Covid 19 on April 20 to around 1,500 cases currently. For tocilizumab, the government has set up a technical expert committee that goes through every request raised by hospitals to ensure that the drug is not overused or misused. The drugs control department then ensures the availability of the medicine to the respective hospitals through its list of stockists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-licences-of-25-chemist-shops-suspended-for-selling-covid-drugs-without-prescription-101621969692246.html

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the money will be directly credited in the bank accounts of 151,000 such drivers in Delhi by Tuesday night. Earlier this month, Kejriwal had announced the one-time financial assistance to all PSV (public service vehicle) badge and permit holders of para transit vehicles, including auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, taxis, ‘phatphat sewa’, eco-friendly sewa, gramin sewa and maxi cabs. Delhi currently has over 280,000 PSV badge holders and 190,000 permit holders who are eligible to apply for the grant, officials said. Para transit vehicle drivers who hold driving licence and PSV badge that are valid as on February 1, 2020, are eligible to receive the financial assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-starts-disbursing-aid-of-5k-for-para-transit-drivers-101621969631482.html

The BJP dismissed the allegation and said the AAP-led Delhi government is causing the delay.“The BJP-ruled MCDs have not yet started the tendering process or begun the procurement of books for seven lakh students in their primary schools this academic year. In 2020, the MCD provided the books to their students after a nine-month delay and in 2019, there was a delay of eight months. The AAP demands that the BJP ruled MCD should immediately, within 15-20 days, start the tendering, procuring and distribution process of books,” Durgesh Pathak, AAP leader in charge of municipal affairs.The three MCDs in Delhi collectively have around 1,660 primary schools, with around 740,000 students enrolled with them, show MCD records.Delhi BJP spokesperson Parveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The allegations are baseless. Pathak should know that MCDs never float a tender for procuring textbooks; they are procured and provided to MCDs by the Delhi government’s Delhi Bureau of Text Books which has not delivered the books till date. The payment for textbooks too comes from the government’s Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan; that came last week after a delay of 46 days.”While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three MCDs.

Now, government centres have also run out of Covaxin doses for the 45-plus age group, even though centres offering Covishield doses to people aged 45 and above will continue to function. We have around 13 days’ stock of Covishield for this beneficiary group,” said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Atishi, while reading out the government’s vaccine bulletin on Tuesday in a live-streamed video.For the last one week, Delhi government-run vaccine centres offering Covaxin were only entertaining people coming for the second dose of the vaccine in the light of a shortage and no assurance of supplies from the central government for the remaining days in the month.Atishi on Tuesday also urged the central government to give approval to more Covid-19 vaccines and direct domestic manufacturers to further scale up production. “Developed countries are using vaccines from Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, etc. The Indian government is yet to give approval to these vaccines. We request them to expedite the approval process so that more vaccines can be imported. Also, the government should direct domestic manufacturers to scale up production. We need to increase vaccine coverage at the earliest,” said Atishi.To be sure, private hospitals in the city have their independent stocks for both 18-45 and 45-plus beneficiary groups.DRIVE-THROUGH VACCINE CENTREThe national capital will get its first drive-through vaccination centre at the Aakash Healthcare Super Specialty Hospital in Dwarka on Wednesday.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate the centre, said the hospital in a press statement, adding: “It will be a first-of-its-kind association between the Government of NCT of Delhi and a Corporate Hospital in the National Capital.”So far, government records said, 5.14 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Delhi.(ends)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-covaxin-stock-for-45-plus-beneficiaries-delhi-govt-101621969512163.html

The toll peaked 14 days later with 448 deaths reported in a single day on May 3. So far, 23,565 people have died of Covid-19 in the city, as per the government’s daily health bulletin, which also showed 1,568 new infections on Tuesday. The number of cases dipped below the 10,000-mark 12 days ago. “The deaths are likely to remain high for nearly two weeks even after the cases go down because that is the timeline of Covid-19. Those who were critically ill during the peak of the infection are still admitted in the hospital. It takes a patient admitted to the ICU nearly three weeks to recover and those on ventilators nearly four weeks. And, some of them will continue to die,” said Dr Sumit Ray, critical care specialist and medical superintendent of Holy Family hospital. However, with the number of cases going down and a high number of deaths being reported, the seven-day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive over the last seven days – has shot up to 7.96%. The CFR has never been this high since the first wave of the pandemic in June-July last year. Even when 437 fatalities were added to the city’s death toll on June 16 last year as Delhi reconciled its mortality figures, the seven-day rolling average CFR was 6.97%. However, the cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of total cases and deaths – has remained low at 1.66% on Tuesday compared to 4.11% on June 16.

Maximum hospitals that have been served notices are those with 100 beds or less, according to a Delhi government official. “Action will be taken depending on the hospitals’ responses,” the official said. On May 7, the government ordered all hospitals, including the ones run by the Delhi government, were asked to update the information on the application every two hours to ensure that the information could be used by those looking for beds. The CM also said that no calls on the helpline should be missed. The app was developed by the government to inform people about the real-time availability of beds in June last year before Delhi saw its first surge in the cases of the viral infection. Along with the bed status, now the application also displays the amount of oxygen the hospitals have in stock after the city faced an oxygen crisis in April-end. Max and Primus hospitals were contacted, but no response was received. Dr Ubaid Hamid, medical director of VIMHANS hospitals, said, “We haven’t received the official notice but it has been communicated to us through WhatsApp. I am not sure whether the notice was meant for us because the address stated is different. We have been updating the app regularly, except on two days when the person in-charge took a leave after losing their brother who was also undergoing treatment at the hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-serves-notice-to-74-private-hospitals-for-not-updating-bed-status-on-app-101621969451508.html

These things should be there in the papers every day. Fix a corner or column, may be on page 1 or page 3. Some column on a page should be dedicated to it daily so that people know where to go when they need it. People would be habituated. This is where you are lagging behind,” the bench said.“As we grew up, we used to see the amount of advertisement, propaganda for family planning ‘hum do humare do’. It was on buses, newspapers, it was everywhere and it worked. We just have to keep bombarding people with information. This has to be regular exercise,” it said.“You are playing a message which was made 6 months ago. Situation has changed. What is the difficulty? You should make a new ringtone and change it. You have to be agile on your feet,” the bench remarked.“Helpline numbers have not been broadcast as frequently and as effectively it should have been done on a daily basis. Their publication on one or the other medium is not sufficient. We have earlier as well emphasised this and we are compelled to once again take this observation since there is not much ground covered on this aspect”.“We again direct the Union of India and Delhi government to undertake publication of all relevant helpline numbers and information through all audio video and print mediums on continuous and daily basis to educate people of the facilities created by the State for testing, treatment and mental health issues arising out of Covid-19 pandemic,” it said.The observations and directions came after amicus curiae senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, told the court that it would be helpful if the government could consider publicising more about the helpline numbers and other data in newspapers or through any other medium. The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra suggested that a central helpline could be created by both the governments as there is a lot of misinformation on social media.Central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh assured the court that measures would be taken for daily publication. Questioning the Centre, the court said, “AIR, Doordarshan they are all your mediums. Please show us how frequently have you done it on Doordarshan? I have watched Doordarshan and I can say that I haven’t seen anything at all….You can employ people for making such content. Looking at the enormity of the problem, war makes propaganda, no? What is the fatigue?”Black fungus medicineDuring the proceedings, the bench also asked Ganga Ram Hospital to place before it the particulars of all black fungus patients treated at the hospital and how the injections were distributed to them.The order came on the plea by a man who was seeking directions to the Delhi government and Ganga Ram hospital to give Ampohtericin-B for his treatment.On court’s direction, one of the doctors of the hospital joined the proceedings and informed them that they don’t have only one patient but many and they have to administer the medicine as per the patient’s condition and requirement and that they have distributed all the 360 vials.The doctor said currently he was not having the data of patients being treated at the hospital, however, he will give the details on Thursday.Additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, advocate Satyakam told the court that the Delhi government does not have the medicine and as soon they are supplied by the Centre, it will be immediately distributed to the hospital.Appearing for the petitioner, advocate and his granddaughter, Iqra Khalid told the court that even though some vials have been given, he needs more and may lose and eye. The court asked the authorities to look into the matter and see if something can be done.The court said if any more vials are available with the hospital, it should be given to the woman lawyer’s grandfather, “whose eye has swollen since morning and is in great pain”.Plea for compensationThe bench also asked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Delhi government to respond to a plea seeking compensation for the parents and wife of a Covid-19 patient who died allegedly due to want of medical attention.It asked Delhi government’s Rao Tula Ram Hospital to respond to the plea which claimed that the victim’s condition was critical and his oxygen level was very low, still the doctor of the hospital allegedly did not recommended him for admission and due to the medical practitioner’s negligence, the man died while waiting for an ambulance.The family sought an appropriate compensation for the loss of life of the deceased due to complete mismanagement and criminal negligence of the authorities.Senior advocate Mehra informed the court that the state government is proposing to give ex gratia relief of ₹50,000 each to families of Covid-19 victims and that the proposal will be placed before the cabinet next week.The court was hearing the petition filed by the parents and wife of Naveen, who died of Covid-19 on the intervening night of April 26-27 allegedly due to want of medical attention and doctor’s negligence.MRP of oxygen concentratorsThe Centre also informed the court that pricing authority NPPA has initiated the process to fix a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators, needed for Covid-19 treatment, as people were being charged exorbitantly. The process for fixing the formula for MRP is likely to be concluded and the court will be informed about the development on May 31, the Centre said.Justice Sanghi observed that the pricing formula was important as most of the manufacturers were not putting MRP or maximum retail price on oxygen concentrators and were not readily available in shops.“It is not that it is available at Khan Market, it is through the back door only that people have been able to secure oxygen concentrators,” he said.In a lighter vein, Justice Singh added “actually this time it was available only at Khan Market”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/publicise-covid-helplines-widely-hc-tells-centre-and-delhi-govt-101621969450954.html

26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Five private hospitals put on notice for overcharging in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh health department has issued notices to at least five private hospitals for overcharging Covid-19 patients for treatment during the peak of pandemic.Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health department, said the notices have been issued as part of an ongoing inquiry into overcharging complaints received from patients.The hospitals allegedly found fleecing the patients are Eden, Healing Touch, Apollo, Kare Partner and Mukut, said officials. In the notices, the hospitals have been asked to respond as to why the treatment rates prescribed by the administration were not followed.“The hospitals have been given a period of one week to respond to the notices. We had previously asked them to refund the excess amount charged from patients,” said Dr Kang.According to the complaints, private hospitals were allegedly charging extra for oxygen and medicine even as these are part of the package notified by the UT administration.Dr Sanjay Bansal, owner of Eden Hospital, said that at the time of crisis, they were receiving the life saving drugs at a high cost. “Our main motive was to save the life of patients, and it can be due to this reason that the rates were not in line with packages prescribed,” he said. Despite the authorities in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali capping the charges for private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, they have been receiving complaints of fleecing. While the owner of a Zirakpur private hospital was booked and the 104 helpline number was launched to complain in Mohali, a state-level probe was ordered against a Panchkula-based hospital after the Haryana speaker and local MLA Gian Chand Gupta cited three such cases and wrote to Haryana health minister Anil Vij. Private hospital owners in Chandigarh have also demanded a hike in Covid treatment charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-private-hospitals-put-on-notice-for-overcharging-in-chandigarh-101621969151671.html
26-05-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh lashes out at BJP for ‘planning poll strategy amid pandemic’||: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), describing it as “audacious and shameless” for having held a meeting of top leadership to strategise for the coming UP Assembly polls. In a statement, Akhilesh said, “People are dying of Corona and black fungus due to government’s lack of administrative acumen and negligence; even last rites aren’t possible in many cases. Still, the party is doing a brainstorming with the Prime Minister and BJP state leadership for preparing a strategy for the polls (2022 UP assembly elections). We have never seen such a display of shamelessness in democracy.” There have been news reports that top BJP-RSS (Rashtriya Swayamasewak Sangh) leadership had been in a huddle in Delhi over the forthcoming UP assembly elections. Akhilesh said: “All that the BJP is bothered about is selfish politics and fake publicity. It is least bothered about peoples’ lives or livelihood and is focused on political power. Would people of UP forget all this? Anyways, the people in the state have resolved to dislodge BJP in 2022 and they will get relief when SP government returns.” He said: “There is no let-up in Covid and black fungus death yet. In rural areas, the situation is worst, but in the state capital and big cities patients were suffering and dying because of lack of life-saving medicines. The CM is hopping from place to place making tall claims, completely oblivious to the grim situation at home.” He said that those harping on ‘saving lives and livelihood’ were actually endangering both. The condition of daily wagers is deteriorating, the poor, labourers, vendors, and small traders are the worst hit, he said. “For the last one month prices of essential food items have shot up. Oil, vegetable prices have gone up multifold. Prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas have increased, and household budgets have gone haywire. Animal farmers are facing problems regarding feed and fodder, milk consumption has been badly hit,” he said. “Small scale industries have begun retrenching employees, daily wagers aren’t getting employment, the books-notebooks-stationery businesses have collapsed, and textile or footwear industry too is out of business,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-lashes-out-at-bjp-for-planning-poll-strategy-amid-pandemic-101621969092275.html
26-05-2021||Other||IITR-Lucknow team collects Ganga water sample in Prayagraj||: A team from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), Lucknow collected water samples of the Ganga from various ghats of Sangam city, on Monday. The team from IITR has collected river water samples from different locations in Kanpur and Varanasi also. “The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) requested us to collect the samples from various locations along the river and analyse the specimens against different parameters which throw light on the quality of water in any river”, said chief scientist of CSIR-IITR, Lucknow, KC Khulbe. “Now that the samples have been collected by our team members, we would be finding out the results in a month,” he added. After reaching Prayagraj, the team collected samples from Shringverpur ghat, one of the sites where bodies were buried on the banks. After taking water samples from the ghat, the team of scientists reached the Phaphamau ghat. They took sample of water of the Ganga from around the sites where bodies were buried on the edge. The team members were wearing PPE kits for their own safety during the exercise. Although the team members, who collected the water samples refused to comment on the reason for collection of the river water samples, but experts who have worked in the field of ground water and UP Pollution Control Board claim that the water is being tested in the backdrop of the mass burial points spotted besides the banks. “Although there are bodies buried at Phaphamau and Shringverpur ghats but there is no need to panic as Ganga water is still fine. However, analysis of Ganga water samples is a welcome step, and the result would further make the picture clear” said executive engineer, irrigation department, SK Singh. Former regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, Mohd Sikander said that groundwater was found on the banks near Ganga just below two feet. If bodies are buried on the river edge, the groundwater may get infected, and this infected groundwater could get mixed with the flow of the Ganga and can pollute it too.Officer in-charge of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Prayagraj Pradeep Vishwakarma said, “The samples have been collected to check the quality of water of the river and I can comment only after getting the final results”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitrlucknow-team-collects-ganga-water-sample-in-prayagraj-101621968850998.html

26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Positivity rate recorded below 10% across Chandigarh tricity||Amid a receding second wave, the daily positivity rate was recorded below 10% across the tricity on Tuesday.Positivity rate is the true indicator of the growth or decline in the spread of an infection, as it is the proportion of people testing positive among all those sampled. It was recorded at 8.6% in Chandigarh, 9% in Mohali and 9.6% in Panchkula, which means of every 100 people tested for Covid-19 less than 10 were found infected on Tuesday. During the peak of the second wave, it had remained around 20-25%. Meanwhile, recovery rate has jumped above 90% across the tricity, while cumulative active case load stands at 10,548, down from the peak of 24,201 couple of weeks back.In terms of cases, the tricity saw an uptick from Monday’s 611 to 808 on Tuesday, while there was a minor decline in daily fatalities from 20 to 17. Mohali, which has been the worst hit, reported 376 cases and nine deaths, followed by 285 cases and five casualties in Chandigarh, and 174 infections and three deaths in Panchkula.“Positivity rate has seen a steep decline after a steep rise in May. It is expected to come down further by the end of the month,” said Chandigarh health secretary Arun Gupta. “Even though there is a fluctuation in the number of tests due to low demand now, we are not seeing a rise in positivity rate, which suggests that infection spread has declined.” While testing levels have been in the range of 3,000 to 4,000 daily, positivity rate has been between 8% and 10% in the past four days in Chandigarh, having touched 28% on May 12. In fact, the central government had time and again flagged Chandigarh’s high positivity rate.Even Mohali has recorded less than 10% positivity rate four times in the past five days. It had once touched 25%. “Sampling in the district has not decreased and we have ensured round-the-clock availability of a team at the district hospital with two dedicated mobile teams for the needy,” said Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan attributed the downward trend to the lockdown and night curfew. “We are hoping it will continue. I urge people to follow the Covid-19 guidelines by wearing masks and maintaining social distance.” Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said the second wave, which started in March, is moving towards an end as the district has started seeing a decline in cases in the past four days. “People should not lower their guard as the behaviour of the new mutant variants is not easy to predict.”“In epidemics we have lull and stormy periods. We have passed this stormy period once again and reached the lull period,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER. “As a society, we are learning to remain afloat during the lull periods by taking precautions and in the stormy period by imposing restrictions. The longer we are able to take corrective steps, the longer the lull period remains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/positivity-rate-recorded-below-10-across-chandigarh-tricity-101621968792290.html

26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t pay charges to informal garbage collectors, says Chandigarh MC||The Chandigarh municipal corporation on Tuesday asked the city residents to pay garbage collection charges only to its representatives and not to informal cart-based waste lifters. The civic body in a public notice stated: “If any resident pays the waste collection charges to the door-to-door collector, then it will be sole liability of the resident and the amount paid will not be adjusted by the municipal corporation.”The MC started door-to-door garbage collection project through motorised vehicles in Sector 1 to 30 in December last year, and extended it to other areas in March and April. The civic body is presently collecting waste collection charges through its drivers using point-of-sale (POS) machines, and plans to add the charges to water bills in a couple of months. Residents have repeatedly raised concerns over the issue, especially in areas where both MC vehicles and cart-based collectors are turning up. “There is total chaos because the MC is not doing its work. If cart-based collectors are coming and collecting garbage in place of MC vehicles, then why shouldn’t residents pay them? The MC should make it clear on the ground and not just on paper,” said Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh, adding that the MC vehicles don’t come regularly.RK Garg, president, Second Innings Association, said: “It is the responsibility of the MC to resolve this issue rather than put all the burden on residents. It is between the MC and collectors. Residents will pay to the service provider.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-pay-charges-to-informal-garbage-collectors-says-chandigarh-mc-101621968611466.html

26-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh water tariff hike: Stay notified, no arrears for bills paid already||The UT administration on Tuesday notified the stay on hiked water tariff and said no arrears will be given for already paid inflated water bills.The UT order, issued by principal secretary (local government) Arun Gupta , states that the administration is “deferring the implementation” of the September 11, 2020 notification, under which water charges were hiked by 200%.The order has come into effect prospectively, that is, from the date of issuance – May 25.“The order only covers the period from May 25, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and not the period from September 11, 2020 to May 24, 2021. So, there is no question of paying arrears to residents who have already paid the inflated water bills,” said a senior UT official, on condition of anonymity.Since September 2020, residents have paid inflated water bills for eight months in four cycles. The latest bills for April and May are due to be paid, which as per administration officials, will be based on the September 11 notification.Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairperson Hitesh Puri said, “We welcome the immediate relief. But, the municipal corporation should give arrears to residents for the eight months already paid.”Residents complained that the latest order does not clarify what will happen to the tariff after March 31, 2022. “We do not know whether the September 2021 notification will be applicable or the administration follow the MC resolution passed in February, under which tariff was reduced, particularly the exorbitant sewer cess. The administration and MC should clarify this,” added Puri. “It is simply a face-saving U-turn taken by the ruling dispensation in the MC in view of the upcoming elections in December. Public anger was simmering for last eight month and the Opposition jumped to make most of the situation. It is nothing to welcome as the water tariff issue still remains,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-water-tariff-hike-stay-notified-no-arrears-for-bills-paid-already-101621968131994.html

The anomalies in the appointment of teachers also resulted in major loss to the state exchequer, they said. On the basis of findings that surfaced while scanning the records provided by district minority welfare officer and madarsa authorities, the SIT had registered an FIR against 21 managers and staff of these madarsas and other unidentified people under IPC sections 409 for criminal breach of trust by public servant, 420 for fraud and 120-B for criminal conspiracy in the matter on May 20. SIT officials said the case had been further investigated to ascertain the role of people involved in the fraud through the years. It was found that the teachers’ appointment was done on the basis of certificates issued by the institutions that are not recognised by the state or the central government, said an SIT official. He said the appointment of one teacher was done when he was not even 18 years of age, which is the minimum age criterion for appointment of assistant teachers at madarsas. In another case, four sisters were appointed in the madarsa where their father was manager, added the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/recruitment-anomalies-at-madarsas-in-azamgarh-sit-registers-fir-101621968130875.html

Tejpal was acquitted by the Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi at the dedicated fast track court in Goa on May 21 with the judge saying that there wasn’t enough evidence to warrant a conviction and proceeded to give him the benefit of doubt. No sooner than the verdict was pronounced in court, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, who was addressing a press conference later in the day, claimed that the state would file an appeal “as soon as possible” and that “a woman has been wronged” with Tejpal’s acquittal. The chief minister, who claimed that he had personally seen the evidence and documents submitted before the Court, said that “there cannot be an acquittal.”“I feel a woman has been wronged. The Goa government will not tolerate it. We are filing an appeal in HC as soon as possible,” Sawant had said on Friday.On Tuesday, the Goa government filed an appeal before the Bombay High Court at Goa which is currently on vacation. The development was confirmed by a member of Tejpal’s legal team, who however said they were yet to be officially intimated. The judge in her judgement, copies of which were handed out to the parties on Tuesday, gave Tejpal, who is facing charges of sections 376 (rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code, the benefit of doubt and acquitted him on account of lack of sufficient evidence. Tejpal, in a statement after the verdict was pronounced, thanked the court for a fair and impartial trial. “It is with profound respect that I thank this court for its rigorous impartial and fair trial and for its thorough examination of the CCTV footage and other empirical material on record… I wish to make no further statement at this time and request my family’s privacy be respected as we try and reclaim our broken lives. I will make a comprehensive statement at an appropriate time in the future,” Tejpal said.“In an awfully vitiated age, where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth. The past seven and a half years have been traumatic for my family as we have dealt with the catastrophic fallout of these allegations on every aspect of our personal, professional and public lives. We have felt the boot of the state but through it all, we have cooperated fully with the Goa Police and the legal system, through hundreds of court proceedings. We have unwaveringly followed every mandate of due procedure and abided by every principle of law as laid down in the Constitution. We have also endeavoured to uphold every norm of decency expected in a case like this,” Tejpal said in a written statement handed out to the reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-police-files-appeal-against-tarun-tejpal-s-acquittal-in-high-court-101621967886239.html

Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, has organised the dharna.Earlier, the decision to elevate Chaudhary, 42, who was till now the party vice president, was taken during a virtual meeting of the party’s national executive. His elevation to the post comes following the demise of party president and his father Ajit Singh, who had succumbed to Covid on May 6.During the meeting, party’s general secretary Trilok Tyagi proposed Jayant’s name for the post of national president which was approved by former MP and national general secretary Munshiram Pal and unanimously supported by all members of the national executive.In his first address after being elected president, he expressed his gratitude to his party leaders and workers and called upon them to follow in the footsteps of party ideologues Chaudhary Charan Singh (his grandfather and former PM) and Ajit Singh ( former union minister and a multiple-time MP). He also asked them to work towards making the party organisation stronger. He also said his party’s struggle to espouse the farmers’ cause will continue. Expressing his concern over the prevailing pandemic, Jayant accused the state and the central governments of failing to control its spread. He said Covid vaccination in rural areas should be expedited with the help of accredited social health activists (ASHAs) and Aanganwadi workers.Born on December 27, 1978, Jayant Chaudhary, a former Lok Sabha MP from Mathura (2009-2014), graduated from Delhi University and in 2002 did his MSc in accounting and finance from the London School of Economics and Political Science.Meanwhile, senior Samajwadi Party leader and former member, state planning commission, prof Sudhir Panwar congratulated Jayant Chaudhary on his elevation as the RLD national president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jayant-chaudhary-elected-new-rld-president-101621967830889.html

During landfall, it would have a wind speed of 155 kmph-165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph. The impact will be severe for six hours before and after the landfall at Chandbali. Big trees and electric poles may get uprooted. Chandbali is likely to witness the maximum damage due to the cyclone," said IMD DG Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.In a major change in its prediction, the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) has recently changed the landfall place of Cyclone Yaas. In its latest bulletin, the JTWC has observed that Cyclone Yaas will make landfall at the mouth of Budhabalanga river estuary in Balasore district.Severe cyclonic storm Yaas lays over East-central and adjoining West-central Bay of Bengal as it moved northwestwards with a speed of about 17 kmph during the past six hours. The system lays about 160 km south-southeast of Paradip and 250 km south-southeast of Balasore.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm is likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours and continue to move north-northwestwards before landing very close to Chandbali-Dhamra port by the early morning of May 26.Doppler radar at Paradip has spotted the eye of Cyclone Yaas. The radius of the 'Eye' is said to be 35 kilometres. Areas falling in the route of the eye to suffer massive destruction.Odisha's special relief commissioner Pradip Jena said over 5 lakh people have been shifted to cyclone shelters in Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur Jajpur, Kendrapara, Keonjhar, Khordha, Dhenkanal, Gajapati, Ganjam, Mayurbhanj, Nayagarh, Puri and Angul so far. The maximum number of people, 1.43 lakh have been shifted in Balasore district, followed by 1.05 lakh from Kendrapara and 94000 from Bhadrak, the SRC data revealed.“We have put four coastal districts- Kendrapara, Jagatisnghpur, Bhadrak and Balasore - on high-risk zone and started preparation accordingly after the meteorological department predicted that the cyclone will hit the coast anywhere near Bhitarkanika, Dhamra and Chandbali. As many as 6,900 cyclone centres are ready for use where 7.50 lakh people can be accommodated,” special relief commissioner PK Jena said.Jena said 710 diesel gensets and 813 tankers have been dispatched while more than 10,000 employees of the energy department have been deployed in the districts likely to be affected for electricity restoration works. Another 2,000 workers will reach their locations by tonight. More than 300 health teams have remained prepared to handle any emergency. In view of the weather warning by IMD, flight operations at Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar will be suspended from 11 pm today to 5 am on May 27.As many as 4,000 personnel of NDRF, ODRAF, fire services and state police have been deployed at strategic places. Around 52 NDRF, 50 ODRAF, 206 fire services, 86 teams of the forest department have been pressed into service.As the landfall site is not very far from the Paradip port, the Paradip Port Trust authorities suspended its operations from 2 pm on Tuesday. At least 12 vessels were sent to the deep sea to avoid the path of the storm while all the trucks, dumpers and large cargo handling equipment in the port area have been taken to a safe zone, said PPT chairman Vinit Kumar."The authorities have been in coordination with the Odisha government and the Jagatsinghpur district administration to take all the precautionary measures," Paradip Port Trust Chairman Vinit Kumar told reporters.The Integrated Test Range of the DRDO has taken various measures to protect its facilities at Chandipur and Abdul Kalam Island at Dhamra. The Integrated Test Range (ITR) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has three missile launch pads at Chandipur and one launch complex at Abdul Kalam Island, besides two separate mission control rooms and blockhouses. Though the island will be impacted by the cyclone, the control room and the blockhouse have been designed to withstand wind speeds up to 400 km.Milan Kumar Pal, spokesperson of the ITR facility, said his organisation is prepared for the very severe cyclonic storm, and are implementing the standard operating procedures prepared by DRDO.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has earmarked 112 teams for deployment in five states and the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, its highest-ever number of teams for deployment in a disaster. Out of these, NDRF has earmarked 52 teams for Odisha followed by 45 teams for West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-evacuates-over-5-lakh-people-as-cyclone-yaas-set-to-make-landfall-101621967692307.html
26-05-2021||Noida||Developers seek protection from insolvency for a year||Real estate developers on Tuesday demanded protection from insolvency proceedings for at least a year as the sector had been severely hit financially due to the pandemic. They also wrote to the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) seeking more time to repay loans.“Section 7 of Indian Bankruptcy Code (IBC) allows a financial creditor to file for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor. Section 9 provides for application of insolvency by an operational creditor, while Section 10 is for initiation of insolvency proceedings by a corporate applicant. We have requested that applicability of these three sections be suspended for a year like it was done in 2020 in view of Covid-19 pandemic,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of National Real Estate Development Council.Last year’s relief expired on March 31, 2021.“We request from UP RERA and the government of India to extend this relief further because the second wave of Covid -9 has further ruined the business with most of our sales staff, construction works and others falling ill and affecting projects. Besides we request for a moratorium of one year for business loans in view of Covid 19 pandemic,” said Arora.There are at least 600 ongoing realty projects in Gautam Budh Nagar district that consists of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. As per the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), around ₹50,000 crore investment is at stake in these projects.“The real estate sector saw worst phase in terms of sales and construction in 2020, when first Covid 19 wave arrived halting work at realty projects. As the sentiment began to revive in the market, the second wave struck and further deteriorated the sector and forcing a liquidity crisis,” said Prashant Kumar Tiwari, president of Western UP Credai.The UPRERA will look into all these issues in its meeting next week.“We are going to consider their (developer’s) proposal next week in authority meeting and take appropriate action in this regard,” said Balvinder Kumar, UP-Rera member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/developers-seek-protection-from-insolvency-for-a-year-101621967770888.html

The opposition is trying to incite children against the government that reflects their negative politics. They are wasting their energy in quest of an issue on which they can do petty politics,” Sharma said in a statement.“The opposition must learn from chief minister Yogi Adityanath, should step out from their homes and serve the people,” Sharma added. He said to maintain their existence in political arena, the opposition was working hard to find an issue. Sharma said how those who refused to take the jab were now talking about vaccination.“The oppositions is rattled by the popularity of chief minister Yogi Adityanath among the masses. CM visited 50 districts in Covid times to take stock of measures taken to contain its spread. As a result, recovery rate in UP has gone up to 95%. Those sitting inside AC rooms and are only sending out tweets are disturbed how government has succeeded in controlling the spread of corona,” the deputy CM said.“There is no vaccine available for children and Yadav is now trying to mislead them and has put their future in danger. Is he (Akhilesh’s) dreaming of ruining the state?,” asked cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh in a tweet. “He misled the people by saying he was not going to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as he didn’t trust the BJP government. Subsequently, he risked many more by violating Covid protocol,” Singh, also the spokesperson for the UP government, said. He said the former chief minister was trying to change the goal post for his own convenience. “He first refused to get vaccinated and is now demanding vaccination for children below 18,” the minister said. Earlier in the day, the SP chief had tweeted, “Pehle tika, phir pariksha (No examination without vaccination).”On the issue of examinations, Singh said over the phone that union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ and defence minister Rajnath Singh held meetings with all education ministers and secretaries across the country on Sunday to get feedback on conducting board exams.“Both CBSE and ISC have deferred class 12 exams and cancelled class 10 exams. A decision to conduct UP Board high school and intermediate examinations will be taken in consultation with chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” Sharma said.Covid vaccination drive started in country on January 16 this year with two indigenously developed Covaxin and Covishield vaccines. The second phase of the drive to inoculate people above 60 and those over 45 with comorbidities began on March 1. The third phase began on April 1 for all above 45 years of age while people in 18-45 age group became eligible for inoculation in the next phase which started on May 1.On CM’s recent visit to Saifai and Azamgarh, Singh said Yogi had visited Saifai, the native village of SP chief, and Azamgarh, the parliamentary constituency of Akhilesh, without any semblance of partisan politics in which the SP indulged all through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oppn-rattled-by-yogi-s-popularity-among-masses-up-dy-cm-101621967654888.html
26-05-2021||Noida||Noida’s ‘oxygen langar’ at Botanical Garden wrapped up||Noida: After nearly three weeks since it started, the drive-through ‘oxygen langar’ service at Botanical Garden Metro Station parking lot in Sector 38 has been wrapped up as not a single patient turned up there in the past couple of days.The free oxygen service for Covid-19 patients was started on May 5 by the management of Gurudwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Khalsa Aid International, an NGO, and the district administration. When it started, at least 20 Covid patients with dangerously fluctuating oxygen levels were being given relief with the help of 20 oxygen concentrators round the clock per day. At least 10 beds were set up in the parking lot for patients who needed the service.However, 20 days on, the number of patients seeking oxygen at the site has significantly reduced. “Since May 21, we haven’t got a single patient at the oxygen langar. Hence, on Monday, we decided to wrap up the arrangements,” said Lt. Colonel (retired) Surjeet Singh, who is part of the initiative.However, Singh said that the service has not been shut but only shifted from the Metro parking lot to the gurudwara in Sector 18.“We have put four beds at the gurudwara’s dispensary in case patients need the oxygen langar service. The service at Botanical Garden was started at a time of emergency for patients who were unable to find beds or oxygen support for themselves. But now, the situation seems to have got better and we have scaled down our service back to the gurudwara,” said Singh.He said that we will continue to provide oxygen cylinders to be taken home to those who need it, at a refundable security deposit of ₹8,000. “In case a person cannot afford the security deposit, our team will go to their residence to verify the authenticity of the case and then lend the cylinder free of cost,” said Singh.Meanwhile, in Ghaziabad too, the takers for oxygen langar service have reduced. In Ghaziabad, the Shri Guru Singh Sabha Gurudwara in Indirapuram, along with NGO Khalsa Help International, had started providing a drive-through oxygen service free of cost to patients in need from April 23. On May 9, a similar set up was put up at Hapur mod Gurudwara with 10 beds.However, now, the set up at Indirapuram has been removed as number of patients reduced. “Earlier, we were getting at least 500 to 700 patients a day at the Indirapuram Gurudwara alone. However, since last week, the number of patients reduced to about 100 a day. Hence, we have now restricted the service only to the Hapur mod Gurudwara where patients are availing oxygen langar service,” said Gurpreet Singh, founder of Khalsa Help International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-oxygen-langar-at-botanical-garden-wrapped-up-101621967653611.html

26-05-2021||Noida||Not-for-profit Covid centres come to aid of patients in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Honey Garg, a Ghaziabad resident, spent about ₹4.25 lakh for his Covid-19 treatment at a private hospital and tested negative on May 20. Initially, his oxygen levels were low, and the issue continued even after he got discharged. Garg said that with limited finances available, he arrived at a Covid care centre run by an NGO at a college in Mohan Nagar, and is now getting proper care for free for the past five days. During the second Covid wave, some non-government organisations (NGOs) have pitched in with free-of-cost services for Covid-19 patients. The centre at Mohan Nagar, run by NGO Khalsa Help International, has ensured regular oxygen supply, food, medicines and Covid care taken up by a team of doctors. “The centre has come as a blessing in disguise for me after I spent most of my savings during Covid treatment for about 10 days. Still after discharge, I required oxygen and I came to know about this centre. The staff here are taking good care of my health,” Garg, who has a small computer repair business, said. Saroj Bhatia’s retired husband is also one of the patients at the centre and requires regular oxygen supply. “My husband is getting all the facilities here, besides regular oxygen supply. He had tested positive for Covid and later turned negative. But getting oxygen was a major issue we faced,” she said. Harminder Singh Kohli, in-charge of the Mohan Nagar centre with 100 beds, said that the facility started May 11 and discharged more than 150 patients so far. “Forty patients are still admitted to Covid and non-Covid wards. We also plan to increase the beds. We have a team of doctors and volunteers who take care of patients, and everything is free. We have even provided staying facility for family members of patients who come from outside Ghaziabad,” Kohli said. At another similar centre at a school in Nehru Nagar, which was initiated by the organisation, Sewa Bharti, on May 25, 28-year-old Priyanka Mittal is staying with her husband who got discharged from hospital after 15 days of treatment. “His oxygen level was low even after the discharge from the hospital. So, we came here and found that all health-care facilities, including oxygen, are available for free. I, along with my husband, am staying here since May 20,” Mittal said. Another family from Niwari is also staying at the centre as their 55-year-old member is admitted at the centre. “My mother-in-law was having frequent complaint of fever and we took consultations from several doctors. We got her admitted to a private hospital and we ended paying up ₹18,000 for her one-night stay. Then we were told to arrange for oxygen,” said Reshma Singh, a resident of Niwari at Modinagar in Ghaziabad. “Thereafter, we heard about the Nehru Nagar centre and brought her here. Now, we are relieved of any financial burden. The centre has also given us one room to stay, along with other facilities for free,” she added. The Nehru Nagar centre’s assistant in-charge Anuj Puri said that the centre has 100 beds and has all health-care facilities at par with government’s L1 category hospitals. “About 76 patients here have recovered so far and we have a provision of 50 beds equipped with oxygen supply. A team of doctors is available round the clock. We have also made proper arrangements of room for families who wish to stay,” he added. Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that both the centres have come in handy for patients when Covid cases were coming in at a fast rate. “Both centres have facilities comparable to L1 category hospitals and what is more overwhelming is that all facilities are free-of-cost, including oxygen, medicines and treatment. These centres are also used for patients who have recovered but have no separate room at home for home isolation. This year we did not open L1 centres as infection was severe and L2/L3 category health-care hospitals were primarily used,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/notforprofit-covid-centres-come-to-aid-of-patients-in-ghaziabad-101621967650960.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC gets 8 offers to supply 10 million Covid vaccine doses||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said it has received eight proposals for supplying 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, in response to its global tenders, but it extended the duration for the same till June 1. Of the eight, seven proposals are for supplying Russia’s Sputnik V and one is for supplying Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The BMC said further scrutiny is ongoing, and the last date for submitting proposals has been extended up to June 1, 2021. Civic officials said they have to screen the proposals as all bids seem to be coming from suppliers or middlemen and not manufacturers. They will have to consider various factors, including latest developments such as the decision of companies like Pfizer to deal with only the central government and Indian companies getting licence to manufacture Sputnik. Besides, they will have to consider whether AstraZeneca can supply in India since the Pune-based Serum Institute of India is manufacturing the same vaccine under Covishield brand name. “As stated earlier, during this pandemic phase, across the world, Pfizer is supplying its Covid-19 vaccine only to central governments and supra-national organizations for deployment in national immunization programs. Neither Pfizer Inc nor any of its affiliates globally, including in India, have authorized anyone to import/market/distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the Government of India towards making our vaccine available for use nationally,” said a Pfizer company spokesperson.The first civic body in India to seek vaccine supply directly from the international market, the BMC had on May 12 floated a global expression of interest (EOI). The duration for the same ended on May 18, but the deadline of the same was extended till May 25. Last week, it had said it received three proposals, but the proposals were lacking some documents, due to which the last date was extended up to May 25. The three proposals were for supplying Russia’s Sputnik, of which one was a UK-based company and two were Indian firms. The price range in all the three proposals was around Rs1,500 for both doses.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “In response to our global EoI for procurement of 1 crore vaccine doses (10 million), eight bids have been received till date. One bid is for Pfizer/AstraZeneca and the remaining seven are for Sputnik. The time period has been extended by one week to enable various bidders to submit a complete set of documents in support of the bids as prescribed under BMC’s global EoI. Further, any additional bid shall also be entertained.”According to BMC, of the seven suppliers who have shown interest in supplying Sputnik V, one has also offered to supply Sputnik Light (a single-dose vaccine). Civic officials said they had video conferencing with all the eight suppliers and have asked them to submit the supporting documents, which will include supply schedule, supply quantity, supply price including taxes etc. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the BMC said, “The BMC is currently scrutinising documents submitted considering it is important to examine the business relationship between suppliers who are willing to supply vaccines and companies that actually manufacture the vaccines. This is to ensure that the supply of vaccine is ensured in a time-bound and smooth manner. The scrutiny is also being done on the basis of the period in which vaccines will be supplied, number of vaccines, and its price etc.”Meanwhile, the BMC plans to aggressively undertake the vaccination drive once it receives additional doses in the form of mobile vaccination centres. As of Tuesday, 3,014,743 citizens were vaccinated, of which 99,206 were in the age group of 18 to 45, followed by 1,065,041 in 45 to 59, 1,189,999 above 60 years of age and remaining were health care and frontline workers. On Tuesday alone, 34,265 citizens were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaibmc-gets-8-offers-to-supply-10-million-covid-vaccine-doses-101621967592122.html

The police department had urged the public to come forward as volunteers and provide help with food, medicines, transport, among others. “So far, 15 children have received benefits while 101 volunteers have come forward to provide necessary aid. More volunteers are joining every day,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety).Officials said that of 15 children, four have lost their parents to Covid-19 in May. They are two sibling pairs: brother and sister aged 10 years and eight years and two brothers aged 15 years and seven years. The first pair is now under the care of their aged grandparents and the other is with their maternal uncle, a daily wage earner, Shukla said, adding that both the sibling pairs are from Greater Noida.The initiative has already been able to sponsor the education of the first pair for one year, the officials said.“The teen boy was working at a roadside eatery and we are trying to get him trained as electrician or plumber. His younger brother is in class 4 and efforts are on for education sponsorship,” said the DCP.The officials said they are concerned about cases that may be going unreported, especially in rural belt.“We need to increase the reach of the project at the ground level. We will ask the health department to share the project details with the Covid-dedicated hospitals,” said another police official.According to the officials, the basic education department has also shared a video detailing the fine points of the initiative with the teachers. Information about children being affected by the pandemic can also be shared at the police helpline (112) and the Childline (1098), the officials said.FXN India Suraksha, the NGO managing the district Childline, is also a part of the initiative. “After the initial help, the Childline will take over the care of the children. We want to help as many beneficiaries as possible. People should provide any leads they have for children who have been affected in this manner,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXN India Suraksha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/project-aasra-15-covid-affected-children-receive-benefits-101621967531591.html
26-05-2021||Noida||Covid-19 infects 291 minors in second wave till now, no death||Only 291 of the 35,609 positive cases (0.8%) detected in Gautam Budh Nagar between April 1 and May 24 were of children, according to data from the district health department.The district chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said that there had been no deaths under this category. “Of the infected, 233 have already recovered under home isolation, and only 58 are active cases -- 18 in Covid-dedicated facilities and the rest still under home isolation,” he said.The data confirms what experts have been saying all along, that children are more likely to recover and more likely to contract a mild form of the disease, if infected.Dr DK Gupta, director of the Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) – the only children’s hospital in the district at the moment – said that the pattern of Covid-19 infection has remained same in both the first wave last year and the ongoing second wave.“There have been no deaths of children so far. During the first wave, out of those 16 critically ill patients – who had multiple co-morbidities like kidney failure, cancer and cardiac problems – we couldn’t save the lives of three,” he said.On Monday, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, director Dr Randeep Guleria said they had no evidence that children would be more affected in the event of a third wave.“I agree with Dr Guleria’s opinion. These (that children will be more affected) are assumptions, which is far away from the reality. Medical sciences do not rely on assumptions as it causes panic. I firmly believe that the trend of Covid-19 impact will remain the same in the third wave and people need not fear,” Gupta said.Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) director Dr Rakesh Gupta, who once headed the department of paediatrics in the Armed Force Medical College (AFMC), Pune, said that since a large number of adults are likely to have taken their vaccination by the time of a possible third wave, the share of infections in minors will likely be more. “But if the scientific valuation is any indication, the infection is not going to be as fatal as in cases of adults,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-infects-291-minors-in-second-wave-till-now-no-death-101621967530869.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Act against e-commerce companies flouting Covid-19 lockdown norms: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to immediately take action against erring e-commerce websites violating the Break the Chain norms while delivering non-essential goods. The HC also sought to know what relief the state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) proposed to give retailers on the lines of those given to hawkers etc with regards to a waiver of license and other fees, given the lockdown. The state and BMC have been asked to file affidavits in three weeks and posted hearing of the petition on June 21. The vacation bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition filed by the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, was informed by advocate Dipesh Siroya that retail shop owners selling non-essential items had suffered heavy losses, financial instability and mass unemployment due to Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown. In light of this, the retailers were seeking a waiver of property tax, renewal fees and license fees payable by them for the entire period of lockdown starting from March, last year. It was submitted that though the retailers had supported the government announced lockdown, there was no reciprocal subsidy for the closure of trade for the over 13 lakh retailers who employed approximately 45 lakh employees. The federation also claimed that it had made several representations for tax waivers to various authorities including the BMC, but after they did not receive any response, hence, approached the HC. Advocate Jamshed Mistry for the federation said that while incentives were given to licensed hawkers and others during the pandemic crisis, no package was announced for retail traders, hence they were aggrieved. The federation also said that though various standard operating procedures (SOPs) including April 13 ‘Break the Chain’ order was issued only for supply and provision of essential goods and services, the e-commerce suppliers were supplying non-essential goods and services and violating the state directives, hence they should be stopped.The court directed the state government to take immediate action against errant e-commerce companies if they were found flouting guidelines and also asked the state to file an affidavit in reply to the petition in two weeks enumerating the incentives given to hawkers and why the same could not be extended to retail traders.The bench also directed BMC to decide on the representation by the federation and file an affidavit in reply within two weeks enumerating steps taken by it regarding waiver of license fees and other reliefs sought in the petition and posted further hearing to June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/act-against-e-commerce-companies-flouting-covid-19-lockdown-norms-bombay-hc-101621967471472.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 24,136 new Covid-19 cases, 601 deaths||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 24,136 new Covid-19 cases and 601 deaths. The total number of tests conducted on Tuesday were 264,275. The total number of people affected by Covid-19 to date stands at 56,26,155.There are currently 3,14,368 active patients across the state, of which, Pune tops with 45,648 patients, followed by Mumbai with 27,855 active patients. The death toll has now reached 90,349, with Mumbai leading with 14,650 deaths, followed by Pune with 11,747 deaths.Meanwhile, the state government has banned home isolation in 18 districts that have a high number of patients. All the Covid-19 patients—both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic will have to be shifted to Covid care centres (CCC) in these districts.These 18 districts are Thane, Pune, Satara, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Osmanabad. Beed, Raigad, Hingoli, Akola, Amravati, Kolhapur, Sangli, Gadchiroli, Wardha, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Latur.State health minister Rajesh Tope, who addressed the media after the meeting with collectors and commissioners of these 18 districts, said that monitoring home quarantine patients has become an issue.“There will be no more home isolations in these 18 districts where the positivity rate is higher than the state average. We have seen that proper treatment not been given to patients in home isolation. Hence, the patients will be shifted to Covid care centres (CCC). We are increasing the number of CCC across the state, especially in smaller villages,” said Tope.He said the government has instructed the officials to undertake focussed testing. “We have instructed all officials, especially, in 18 districts, that they should indulge in right testing of high-risk contacts and low-risk contacts. The aim should not be to undertake generalised testing and bring down the positivity rate,” said Tope.However, many have criticised the move and said it will discourage people from testing and burden the inadequate health infrastructure.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital described it as an ill-advised move. “There is no point in asking asymptomatic or those having mild or no symptoms to be admitted to the CCC. The government is burdening the already stressed infrastructure in these places. These patients be better treated at home,” said Shaikh.“In rural areas, Covid-19 is treated as stigma, and after banning home isolation, the situation will become worse, as no one will come for testing. People will rely on simple medicines or turn to quacks for treatment,” warned Shaikh.The Maharashtra rural development ministry would make available Arsenic-30 homoeopathic tablets to the villages and also give an insurance coverage of ₹50,00,000 to any employee who dies of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, any gram panchayat will get a 30-bed isolation centre if demanded by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-24-136-new-covid-19-cases-601-deaths-101621967472029.html
26-05-2021||Noida||Walk-in registration for 18-44 group not started in UP yet, says Noida health dept||There was an unusual rush for vaccines against Covid-19 at several Gautam Budh Nagar government-run vaccination centres on Tuesday.The reason was that several had heard the headlines that the central government had allowed walk-in registration for vaccines for those who were in the 18-45 age category. The move is aimed at reducing vaccine wastage and providing help to those without access to internet or smartphones.What they didn’t realise that the Centre had also added that it would be left up to the respective state government to implement it or not.And Uttar Pradesh hadn’t, yet.“The facility for walk-in registration of vaccination for the 18-45 age group at government centres is not there in UP yet. Only online registrations and appointments for vaccination are accepted till further orders,” read a statement issued by the GB Nagar health department.Residents said that they hoped the government would allow the walk-in option. “Scheduling appointments online is not possible for everyone. Sometimes slots get booked in a few minutes. Besides, some people do not have access to the necessary infrastructure,” said K K Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations.Meanwhile, district officials said they have increased the number of Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVC) from 37 to 59. “The drive-through centre at GIP mall has now been shifted to the mall’s basement due to the higher temperatures outside,” said Gajender Singh, the district nodal vaccination officer.On Monday, the new CVCs had a combined capacity to inoculate 4,300 people. Five of these are in Dankaur, five in Noida, three in Jewar, two in Dadri and seven in Greater Noida.In addition, the drive-through centres have also been increased to 10. The new centres are at Pathways School in Sector 100 , Millennium School near Sector 119, Cambridge School in Knowledge Park 1, Aster Public School in Delta-II and Pragyan Public School in Jewar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/walkin-registration-for-18-44-group-not-started-in-up-yet-says-noida-health-dept-101621967470933.html
26-05-2021||Mumbai||What action is proposed against firm supplying faulty ventilators through PM Cares: Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Centre to inform it about the action proposed to be taken against the supplier who provided 150 ventilators through the Prime Minister (PM) Cares Fund after news reports stated that 113 ventilators which were unboxed turned out to be defective.The bench took serious cognisance of the issue and sought to know from the Centre as to what remedial steps it proposed to take to address the issue as the ventilators were to be used in government and private hospitals in the Marathawada region. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Bhalchandra Debadwar was hearing the suo motu public interest litigation (SMPIL), instituted after news reports pointed to issues pertaining to shortage of medical oxygen supply, black marketing of Remdesivir, funeral rites of Covid-19 patients and the inability of the common man to foot the huge bills for treating the black fungus infection, among others. Amicus curiae Satyajeet Bora submitted news reports which stated that 113 of the 150 ventilators provided through the PM Cares Funds were non-functional. Chief public prosecutor DR Kale representing the state informed the bench that the ventilators were manufactured by a company named Jyoti CNC with model name DHAMAN- III. He submitted that the dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad had received the same and had deployed 17 ventilators in GMCH. However, the ventilators developed extremely serious flaws which would impact the treatment of patients. The flaws included low inlet oxygen pressure and the patient becoming hypoxic which was life-threatening. The bench was further informed that 55 ventilators were distributed to Hingoli, Osmanabad, Beed and Parbhani districts and 41 ventilators were allotted to private hospitals asking them not to claim ventilator charges from patients. The remaining 37 ventilators with the GMCH were yet to be unboxed. Kale referred to letters from private hospitals which indicated that all the 41 ventilators provided to them were non-functional and posed a serious threat to the life of the patients, hence declined to use the ventilators and asked the authorities to take them back. The dean of a government hospital in Ambajogai, Beed district also informed that the ventilators were not worthy of being used. “We find the situation as regards to dysfunctional ventilators through the PM Cares fund to be quite serious...ventilators are believed to be lifesaving instruments and malfunctioning can put lives of patients in danger,” observed the bench. The court expressed serious concerns over the malfunctioning ventilators and noted that the dean of GMCH was justified in his decision of not unboxing the remaining 37 ventilators. The court then observed that the 74 ventilators supplied by several industrialists including Garware Polyester, Bajaj Auto, Hindalco etc. were functioning perfectly and flawlessly and said, “The company (Jyoti CNC) should not get away with this. It is the state exchequer money, it’s not bounty to be distributed.” The Court also expressed its displeasure over politicians jumping on to the issue and visiting GMCHs to find out whether ventilators were functioning properly. “We express our displeasure as regards such indulgence by people’s representatives. It is likely to cause more botheration to medical faculty than render any assistance,” noted the bench and posted hearing of the suo motu PIL next on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-action-is-proposed-against-firm-supplying-faulty-ventilators-through-pm-cares-bombay-hc-101621967412388.html

26-05-2021||Noida||Noida: Better safe than sorry, say schools, Class 12 students||With the Centre and states yet to come to terms on conducting the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 board exams, parents, teachers and student in Noida are a concerned lot.On one hand is the safety of students, and on the other is their future. Even harder hit are those students who have lost one or more of their parents, relatives or friends to Covid-19’s second wave that ravaged the city. The exams were earlier scheduled to begin from May 4. On April 14, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) postponed it due to the pandemic. On Tuesday, most states are learnt to have opted for conducting class 12 exams, picking a proposed method that involves a shorter duration for the tests, holding them at schools where students are enrolled, and switching to only multiple choice and short-answer questions, a few opted for conducting it at designated centres, and some also wanted the exam scrapped. A final decision is likely on June 1.Schools back cautionKamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida, says that neither options were “foolproof”. “The children as well as school are confused. In any case, we await the final announcement so that we can start preparing to conduct the exams,” she said.Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, said it would have been better to have followed the Class 10 assessment that was based on internal assessment. “Our school has over 500 students in Class 12 and asking all of them to step out and appear for an exam now is unthinkable,” she said.“In any case medical, engineering and even some departments in Delhi University hold their own entrance exams online that can decide students’ career path,” said Yashika Bhardwaj, principal of KR Mangalam World School, Vaishali, and a telecounsellor for the CBSE.Students’ distressAstha Singh, a resident of Sector 53 and student of Amity International School, said the mental stress on students was real. “I have seen many of my friends losing one or both of their parents due to Covid. It is a very difficult time for them. We have this underlying fear that we may bring the virus back home after the exam,” she said.Indirapuram resident and DPS Noida student Ankita Pathak had won a scholarship at a university in Canada for a course in business administration. “By now I would have been packing for Canada. However, with delayed exams and flights to Canada banned, those plans are on hold. I would’ve liked the board exams be optional and internal assessments be the basis of qualification,” she said, adding that the university offered to hold her seat till the situation eased.Shantanu Sharma from Amity International School too had a similar problem. He has been accepted at a university in Netherlands for anautomotive engineering course. “The academic year is set to start in September and if boards are held from July to August, as the CBSE suggested, we hope to get the results before deadline (CBSE plan is to give results in September),” he said.Foreign universities and colleges accept students based on letter of recommendations from the school with the condition that they present their final exam results before the start of the academic session. “As international universities operate on standard timelines, interested students are concerned about the admission process,” Rajiv Bansal, director of operations of Global Indian International School.Some are also changing plans and looking at applying to private universities. “I aimed to get a seat at one of the National Law Universities in India or pursue Economics in Delhi University. But now I feel I need another option as well so I am also appearing for entrances of private law universities,” said Kanishk Srinivas, a sector 62 resident and student of DPS Noida.Most kids are 17, give them vaccine: ParentsSome parents assume that since most Class 12 students were just a year away from being eligible for the vaccinations, it would be safe to vaccinate them.Manoj Kataria, president of Gautam Buddh Nagar Parents’ Welfare Society said, “Holding board exams at such a distressful time could be harmful for the students’ well being. Moreover, parents are concerned for the well being of their children as well,” he said. “These can become a super spreader event. Moreover, reports say that the third wave is going to affect children and we cannot take a chance,” said Preet Bhargava, a resident of Greater Noida West whose son is a student of Class 12.However, experts said that demand for vaccination is not a solution. “Union ministry of health has not given any directives for vaccination for children yet, hence we cannot comment on that. However, this is not a solution in the current scenario. Efforts should instead be made from the authorities as well as students and parents side to ensure that proper Covid protocols are followed when exams are held. Usually we see parents gather at exam centres when board exams are being held. Such a situation should be avoided at all costs,” said Dr NK Sharma, IMA President (Noida Chapter).On Monday, New Delhi All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr Randeep Guleria said, “If we look at the data, and compare both the Covid-19 waves, children are usually protected as the numbers are fewer. Even if they get infection, the disease is usually mild.” He added that there was no proof that children would be more affected in the event of a third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-better-safe-than-sorry-say-schools-class-12-students-101621967351543.html

26-05-2021||Pune||Women volunteers ease burden at Pune crematorium ensuring last rites for Covid-19 victims||Preparing the pyre at a crematorium is not most people ever imagine having to do.With the number of deaths due to Covid-19 putting tremendous pressure on crematoriums in the city, a group of women ve volunteered to help all-men’s team with crematorium service.At the Vaikunth crematorium in Navi peth, 25 women from various professions, are on the job, so to speak, working in five-hour shifts basis, with five members in one batch.The job of these volunteer is to collect wood and dung cakes to prepare the pyre before the body arrives. After the body is cremated, the next day, the women are tasked with preparing the urns for the ashes and keeping it ready for the relatives. The women also keep the crematorium clean.“From mid-April to May 15 – there was heavy rush at the crematorium. Earlier, only men were doing this job and later, we also got a chance to provide this service,” said Vaishnavi Rathi, a 23-year old interior designer.Swaroop Vardhni and Seva Sahayog are the two NGOs through which women enrolled for this service.“It was overall a very different feeling when I started, as generally women don’t go to crematorium for the last rites. The worst part is, no one from the family, due to Covid, was allowed to attend the last rites, so we made sure we gave a respectful goodbye to departed souls,” added Rathi.Women also recite prayers for departed souls and perform all the rituals that a family member would normally do.“With constantly standing near the pyre, it was hard to work with PPE kits. We made sure we sanitised ourselves from head to toe before returning to our homes,” added Rathi.Anuprita Lele, another volunteer, said “Many married women also took part in this initiative and worked really hard to serve the society. With the body completely wrapped we could not understand to whom we are paying our last tributes. We just focused on doing things in an organised way.”With Covid death numbers now lower, the women’s service at the crematorium is currently on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/women-volunteers-ease-burden-at-crematorium-ensuring-last-rites-for-covid-19-victims-101621956190573.html
26-05-2021||Pune||Pune green enthusiast asks for used bicycle donations||Cyclist Anand Vanjape is on a mission to find an eco-friendly means of commuting, once the lockdown is lifted. In order to achieve his goal, Vanjape has been busy reaching out to cycling enthusiasts to donate used bicycles for the needy and the poor. “In four days, even since we announced this drive on social media, we have managed to get 35 bicycles, but the target is to get 200 bicycles by the time lockdown is lifted,” said Nilesh Shinde, cyclist and a friend who is helping Anand in getting these bicycles. These bicycles are not just going to help the students in Mulshi area where they have to travel 10 kms to their school, but these cycles will be means of commuting for many of the needy people in slums, first time job holders, maids and everyone who have to travel the distance to their work areas. “With the current Covid situation, these bicycles could be the best bet of a healthy way of travel instead of travelling on buses which is comparatively expensive,” said Vanjape, “Besides, it is also an eco-friendly and will help save the environment.” The group of volunteers, young people are helping them to reach out to those avid cyclists to donate their cycles. The mission has so far even got geared cycles which Vanjape and Shinde help repair in a workshop they have set up in Kothrud. “Many people cannot afford to buy bicycles and these cycles can serve dual purpose, one as a mode of transport and also a healthy way to keep fit,” said Vanjape. While collecting cycles for needy, Vanjape is also getting a lot of calls for children’s bicycles, which are also expensive, hence now they are also collecting children’s cycles which can be distributed free of cost and after the child is grown up can be recycled. “The idea is to create a culture of recycling bicycles, for every child goes through five bicycles in his life and if they can bring a joy on someone’s else’s face, why not come forward and donate one,” said Vanjape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cyclist-enthusiast-wants-to-build-cycle-culture-in-city-asks-for-bicycle-donations-101621955471187.html
26-05-2021||Pune||New species of bamboo found in north-western ghats, named after ecologist Madhav Gadgil||PUNE A new species of bamboo, named after Prof Madhav Gadgil, an eminent Indian ecologist with a particular affection for bamboos, has been made by researchers and biologists from Pune.This recent discovery of the new species, Pseudoxytenanthera madhavii, was made by Dr P Tetali, Dr Sujata Tetali, Sarang Bokil, EM Muralidharan, Dr Ritesh Kumar Choudhary and D. Mandar Datar.“The specimens were collected from the natural habitat in Shirkoli village in Pune district’s north-western ghats. Pseudoxytenanthera madhavii is a new species of bamboo, locally known as “Mes”, and traditionally utilised in the north-western ghats,” said Tetali, a senior researcher, who lead the team.“The new species Psudoxytenanthera madhavii has been known to locals for ages and was traditionally used for construction. However, this species was not yet known botanically, as both bamboos Mes and another common bamboo in the ghats known as Manga, were treated under one botanical identity Pseudoxytenanthera stocksii. Our proposal for giving this new name was published in the recent issue of New Zealand-based journal “Phytotaxa”,” added Tetali. This bamboo grows up to 30 to 55 feet and can can be grown in Velha, Bhor and Mulshi talukas. “Pseudoxytenanthera madhavii is wild in moist and dry deciduous forests and has been widely cultivated in Pune and Satara. Much of this bamboo is used in construction and for shelter. However, its demand for furniture and in the housing industry is increasing due to its smooth surface, mechanical strength, better slivering and stripe-making qualities. In addition, it takes good polish,” said Tetali. At present, there are 128 species of bamboo in India, most of which are restricted to Northeast India, with only four species found in Maharashtra. Who is Madhav Gadgil?A recipient of multiple awards Madhav Gadgil studied Zoology at the universities of Pune and Bombay, before becoming the first biology student at Harvard University to receive a PhD for a thesis based on mathematical modelling. Gadgil has been largely responsible for introducing careful quantitative investigations in ecology and animal behaviour as well as viewing humans as an integral component of ecosystems to India. He is the founder of the Centre for Ecological Sciences. He was a member of the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India from 1986 – 1990. He chaired NCERT’s panel on Environmental Education and is currently a member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/new-species-of-bamboo-found-in-north-western-ghats-named-ecologist-madhav-gadgil-101621955050600.html
