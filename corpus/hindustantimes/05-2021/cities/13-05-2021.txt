He had stated that those who wished to contribute to the district administration’s plan to fight the pandemic could donate to the DSRC fund that would be utilised for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the district. The name of a bank and the DSRC account number were mentioned in the appeal.Niranjan said, “Several people from various walks of life met me in the office with the request that they wished to donate to the district administration fund for health facilities for Covid patients. In view of the pressure of the local people, I issued an appeal. To make the donation transparent, I gave the account (number) of DSRC, which is audited annually.”Shiv Kumar Jaiswal, a member of the Deoria traders’ organization, said earlier too residents of the district, including traders and professionals, had donated money to DSRC during floods or the outbreak of diseases, including Japanese encephalitis. “The fund was utilised for public work. The DM gave the details of the utilisation of the fund to members of the committee at review meetings. It’s a unique initiative by local people to assist the administration in public work. We have urged the DM to permit the people to donate to DSRC fund,” Jaiswal said.On Wednesday, 387 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in Deoria. The tally of active Covid cases in the district was 2,931. The DM said the recovery rate of Covid patients in the district was 89.3% whereas the positivity rate was 7.5%. After the second wave, the district administration arranged 350 beds in Level-2 government facilities and 450 beds in private hospitals in Deoria, the district magistrate said.There are 18 ventilator beds and 10 BiPap beds in Deoria district. “The sample test target of the district is 2,000 per day, but we are doing 3,500 sample tests daily. The trace, test, track and treat campaign has been launched in the rural areas of the district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-criticism-deoria-dm-withdraws-appeal-to-public-for-funds-101620930531736.html

Darshi also holds the post of additional deputy commissioner (development), Moga. Names of two other officers of the civic body, an executive engineer and junior engineer, are also there in the complaint. The complainant is a non-resident Indian (NRI) who alleged that the architect was paid the money for designing three buildings of which two were never constructed. Even the tender for construction of two buildings was never floated, it was alleged. An official of the vigilance bureau privy to the investigation said the civic body had decided to construct a night shelter, main MC office and town hall buildings in 2014. The tender for architectural services of the three buildings was allotted to a Ludhiana-based architect on October 29, 2014, and payment was released in December 2019.The civic body paid the architect fee of ₹1.12 lakh for designing building of night shelter, ₹7 lakh for the main office and ₹96,574 for the town hall. However, only night shelter building was constructed.Confirming the development, DSP Kewal Karishan of vigilance bureau, Moga, said, “We are investigating this matter and it will take some time. I will be able to share details after completion of the probe.”Darshi confirmed that only the night shelter building was constructed. “The tenders for construction of the other two buildings were cancelled for some reasons. The tender for architectural services of the three buildings were allotted to the architect before that. The payments were released as per rules,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vb-begins-probe-into-9-lakh-paid-to-architect-by-moga-mc-101620929751699.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cong faces crisis as councillors move HC against Jaitu MC chief’s election in Punjab||Five Congress councilors are among the 11 newly elected members who have challenged the May 7 election of Surjit Singh Baba as the Jaitu municipal council president in the Punjab and Haryana high court, demanding that the election be set aside since he doesn’t enjoy trust of the majority members. The high court has treated the civil writ petition as urgent and fixed the hearing for May 19. The Congress had won nine of the 17 seats in the civic body elections held in February. The petition was filed by five Congress councillors, three independents, two of Shiromani Akali Dal and one belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party, alleging that Baba’s appointment was made in an unjust and unfair manner. “The name of Baba was announced by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu from an envelope claiming it is an order of the Congress high command,” the petitioners alleged. The petitioners said they immediately raised an objection inside the House after Baba’s name was announced. “Ten elected members of three different parties along with Jaitu MLA Baldev Singh submitted a written complaint to the chief secretary, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court and chief election officer,” they added. On May 7, the election for the office-bearers of Jaitu municipal council was held amid high drama, with a faction of Congress councillors backed by Faridkot member parliament Mohammad Sadiq opposed the appointment of Baba. One of the petitioners, Suman Devi of the Congress, is backed by Sadiq, while Baba has the support of Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon. Suman was nominated as senior vice-president but she staked claim on the president’s post. MP Sadiq said that out of 17 councillors, Suman had the support of 10 but Baba was still named the president. “This is totally unconstitutional, MLA of another area should not interfere in the affairs of my constituency,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-faces-crisis-as-councillors-move-hc-against-jaitu-mc-chief-s-election-in-punjab-101620929451653.html
13-05-2021||Gurugram||Lack of awareness, poor enforcement of curbs in rural areas leading to more deaths, allege residents||Hesitancy to get tested, reliance on chemists and self-medication are major obstacles in preventing further spread of Covid-19 in rural areas, said residents, even as the health department started mass screening following complaints of an increase in the number of deaths due to the infection and influenza-like illnesses.Naveen Kumar, a resident of Baspadmka village in Pataudi, who had sought help from the administration on Twitter, said that many people with symptoms did not turn up at the testing camps organised by the government.“On Thursday over 100 people got tested and out of them, 10 turned out positive for Covid-19. However, there is a large number of people suffering from high fever and other symptoms in the village who did not turn up. I hope the health department conducts testing in every household,” said Kumar.He said that eight to 10 recent deaths were of people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms.The situation is similar in Manesar village, which is witnessing one or two deaths daily for the past 15 days, locals said. “The population of Manesar is around 100,000 and people live in highly dense pockets. We have witnessed seven deaths in Aaalhu mohalla alone due to Covid-19 this month. Villagers are admitted to local hospitals and a large number of them have self-quarantined with little help from authorities. The Covid-19 safeguards and protocols are not being followed,” said Om Prakash Yadav, a former village head.He said that lack of enforcement is leading to more infections and causing deaths. “Today, we lost a young man of 43 years, who was healthy and in the prime of his life. His family is shattered,” he said on Thursday.According to the health department data, the test positivity rate (proportion of positives out of the samples tested) in rural areas was at 21.8% in April. Officials identified seven high-risk areas for mass surveillance and door-to-door screening.The health department said that it has registered around 17 deaths due to Covid-19 in the seven high-risk areas. “The large outreach planned in rural areas is aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 infections and ensuring better treatment so that patients do not succumb due to complications,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Officials said that a large-scale exercise is being launched across the district for testing and screening people in villages, and serious cases will be referred to hospitals.Yadav said, “Around 50 large isolation centres will be set up in villages initially with healthcare facilities. One team for testing and another for isolation will be deployed in villages that will help the in medication and preventing the spread.”To ensure that locals don’t rely on chemists for treatment, Yadav said that healthcare professionals are being deployed to curb this practice. “We will ensure timely testing and treatment,” he said.Residents of villages said that infected persons prefer to wait for a week to approach the hospitals and only do so when their condition deteriorates. Free movement of infected persons is further spreading the infection, complained locals.In Sultanpur village, at least eight people died due to Covid-19 this month, most of whom relied on self-medication, said locals. “Our neighbour waited four to five days before getting tested and suddenly collapsed. He could not survive a single day in the hospital. His wife is also in a critical condition and is surviving on ventilator support,” said Pravesh Chauhan, a resident.Many infected persons or those with influenza-like illness are also not isolating and there is no one to keep a check, residents said.“It is difficult to ask people to refrain from sharing hukka or playing cards. Some step out for fresh air but this has caused more infections,” said Dilip Yadav, a resident of Kherki Daula, who recently shifted to a condominium across the toll plaza.Bhawar Singh, a resident of Hassanpur village, said that authorities should ensure that critical patients from rural areas are admitted to hospitals. “We have to make a lot of effort to get the patients admitted, even if their condition is bad,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lack-of-awareness-poor-enforcement-of-curbs-in-rural-areas-leading-to-more-deaths-allege-residents-101620927291536.html

Some 50 isolation centres will be set up initially, and will be increased if the situation demands, they said.Gurugram deputy commissioner (DC) Yash Garg said that the health department, and the district development and panchayat department will send teams for Covid-19 testing and screening over the next 10 days, to contain the local spread. These teams will also sanitise the villages.Panchayats will also get grants for setting up isolation centres based on the population, according to the district administration.“Villages with a population of over 10,000 will get ₹50,000, and less than 10,000 will get ₹10,000,” Garg added.He also appealed to the people to get themselves tested for if they have Covid-19 symptoms and isolate themselves immediately from other family members to stop the spread of the infection.“We will treat the patients, and also conduct awareness drives on Covid-19. With the district administration’s help, the enforcement of safeguards and Covid-19 protocols will also be ensured,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), adding that that Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers — those from the panchayat department — will be part of local teams that will work in rural areas.According to the health department, its officials identified seven high-risk rural areas where 138 teams are testing and tracing Covid-19 for treatment.On Wednesday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed the officials concerned to set up adequate healthcare facilities and isolation centres, and deploy healthcare teams across the rural areas in Haryana. He also ordered that the village isolation centres should have beds and beddings, triple layered masks, and hand sanitisers with bottle dispensers and steamers.Patients must get food either through the community or on a hire basis, Khattar had said, adding that the health department will provide essential medicines and medical equipment to the isolation centres in the villages, and the healthcare staff will supervise the patients and shift critical patients to the facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/164-isolation-centres-to-be-set-up-in-villages-intensive-testing-on-the-cards-101620927292248.html
13-05-2021||Gurugram||Cops feed 600 daily wagers amid lockdown||The police are providing meals to nearly 600 industrial and construction workers who have either lost their jobs due to the pandemic or are facing financial difficulties due to the ongoing lockdown.A team from the Manesar police station prepares the food and delivers it to designated spots, where it is shared with workers twice a day.Yashwant Yadav, station house officer (SHO) of IMT Manesar police station, said that they started this initiative after many workers approached them to get food from a mess on their premises. “Labourers used to ask for food as they were unable to buy even a single meal. Due to the lockdown, community lunches stopped and many factories have been shut since the lockdown was announced.”“They offered to work in exchange for food, but we told them that we had enough staff but that they were welcome to have meals,” he said.After more than 15 people approached them, the police started preparing more food and the message spread through word of mouth, following which the numbers started increasing daily. Two cooks were also hired to help with the preparations for lunch and dinner.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that in a survey on May 8, they located four sites where daily wagers were sleeping without having food. “A team was formed to feed the needy and ration was bought by the police station staff. They did not ask for any help or fund and for nearly 10 days, they were spending from their own pockets. Now, the ration is being sent from the police headquarters,” he said.At present, the department is supplying food to workers at the four locations, including Labour Chowk. The initiative is being announced through loudspeakers in areas where daily wagers are staying and social distancing and mask discipline is enforced, said officials.“I lost job my again this year and could not tell my family members as they need money. I am hopeful I will get another job soon and will start saving and sending money to my ailing mother in Bihar. Last year, I had returned to my village after the lockdown was announced and returned to Gurugram after eight months,” said Lankesh Kumar, who worked with an automobile company.Another labourer, Kanwar Singh of Bihar, said “There was no hope to get any meal and we had slept on an empty stomach for two nights before we got freshly cooked food. We sleep near the police station so that we do not have to travel to eat on time and they do not run short of food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cops-feed-600-daily-wagers-amid-lockdown-101620927231578.html
13-05-2021||Gurugram||Haryana’s 1st wildlife census postponed amid wildlife safety concerns in times of Covid||The first state-wide wildlife census in Haryana, which started in April, was postponed indefinitely amid Covid-19 crisis, said the officials on Thursday.ML Rajvanshi, chief conservator of Forests (wildlife), said, “We have indefinitely postponed the state-wide wildlife estimation process, which started last month, amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Several states have reported animals being infected with the coronavirus. We do not want to take risk, so we have halted the estimation process for now.”Over 25 forest officials have tested positive in Haryana, making it riskier to continue the census, said a senior forest department official.The wildlife census, which is conducted in collaboration with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, had started in the second week of April this year. The forest department, with the WII, was scheduled to set up camera traps for a survey of large mammals between May 1 and June 30.With the help of the survey, the forest department officials wanted to assess the abundance and distribution of the major mammalian carnivore population, and prey population inside the protected areas. The census also focuses on assessing abundance and distribution of nilgai and rhesus macaque in a human-dominating landscape outside these areas. As part of the census, 59 beats of Shivalik forest and 38 beats of Aravalli forests will be surveyed.The forest department, however, was able to conduct the monkey survey in urban areas from April 28-30 through the ‘Wildlife Census Haryana’ mobile application, wherein residents noted the presence of monkeys in their respective areas.The data recorded on the mobile application will be used to devise strategies to reduce man-monkey conflicts, rampant in cities like Faridabad and Gurugram, the senior forest official added.“Amid the rise in such cases, we had asked the residents not to venture out, and report the presence of monkeys in their areas — either through their balconies or terraces. We have received a good response for this survey, despite the high number of cases, with around 600 participants recording their sightings on the application, with over 6,000 monkeys being present across Haryana,” said Rajvanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryanas-1st-wildlife-census-postponed-amid-wildlife-safety-concerns-in-times-of-covid-101620927232195.html
13-05-2021||Other||Post-Covid illnesses on the rise, the recovered need oxygen||Private hospitals are reporting an increased footfall of patients who developed lung fibrosis and severe pneumonia after recovering from Covid-19 and need immediate hospitalisation with oxygen support.According to Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the state nodal officer for tertiary care of Covid-19 patients, and who is also a lung and respiratory disease specialist at the Post Graduate Institute Medical Sciences- Rohtak, since the magnitude of the second Covid-19 wave has been massive, such cases have increased everywhere.“It is mostly seen in patients who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for treatment after testing positive. Such patients require a sufficient number of days to recover. But, to manage beds and to accommodate other patients, many people are asked to leave hospitals and home-isolate without complete recovery. Therefore, 10 to 15% of the recovered patients develop lung infections and need to be put on oxygen support,” said Dr Chaudhary.The district administration also hiked the oxygen quota for hospitals treating such cases.“Post-Covid care and treatment are most important and the number of people complaining of lung (illnesses) and pneumonia has increased. The administration is aware that such cases are on the rise. Therefore, we have increased the oxygen quota by nearly 30% so that hospitals can cater to such patients and store additional oxygen for emergency purpose,” said Yash Garg, Gurugram deputy commissioner.The administration has been supplying oxygen to at least 82 hospitals in the district.Dr Vikram Singh, the director of Aarvy Hospital, said that due to the current burden on hospitals to admit seriously ill patients, many people are asked to remain on oxygen support system at homes. “If required, they are admitted to hospitals. At least 30-40% recovered patients develop lung fibrosis and are suggested to remain on oxygen support at their homes,” said Singh.Dr Neeraj Gupta, a pulmonologist and the head of ICU care at W Pratiksha Hospital, is currently treating at least three recovered Covid-19 patients who developed pneumonia and are admitted to the ICU. “Such patients have high oxygen demand as their lungs could not heal properly even after recovery. Many patients have to be given immediate treatment in hospital, while some are suggested to remain at home and continue with treatment.”Gupta said she comes across at least nine such cases every day, of whom two to three people develop serious symptoms.Causes for post-Covid illnessDr Mohit Mathur, associate director of critical care at Max Hospital, Gurugram, said, “The scar tissue which replaces the diseased lung tissue after the infection is not capable of the original function to transfer oxygen into the blood. Such patients are left with a persistent oxygen requirement,” said Mathur.In many cases, people discharged from hospitals said that they found it difficult to walk even 10 steps.Swati Saxena, 34, a resident of MG Road, said that she was discharged from the ICU on April 28 within seven days of getting admitted. She was later admitted again on May 2 and discharged earlier this week. “I had heart rate issue, breathlessness and chest pain. It took three days to recover from the pain. Four oxygen cylinders were used daily and the volume of oxygen given to me was high, as compared to when I was first admitted for Covid-19,” said Saxena.“Basically, in many cases compromised lung capacity or poor lung function due to this infection has been causing further multiple complications even after recovery,” said Dr Satish Kaul, head of the department and director, internal medicine, Narayana Hospital.Detecting the illnessAt present, there is no certain way to definitely say which patients will eventually develop lung fibrosis, doctors said. A few existing studies show that age, severe illnesses, prolonged ICU treatment, need for mechanical ventilation, a history of smoking and chronic alcoholism may increase the risk of developing lung fibrosis after recovery from Covid-19.“CT chest and restrictive pattern on pulmonary function test are some of the ways to detect this problem. The bigger challenge is that apart from few anti-fibrotic agents which are of doubtful efficacy, there are not many drugs to address this problem. Therefore, recovery becomes a slow process, extending over months,” said Mathur, who is treating 10 such cases on average every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/postcovid-illnesses-on-the-rise-the-recovered-need-oxygen-101620927171495.html

Kiran Bharti said that on May 4, the Bhagalpur police arrested them on the charges of assaulting medical staff and vandalizing JNLMCH following mismanagement and negligence that caused the death of her family members.Police said the accused alleged that their grandfather (Shashidhar) was not provided oxygen, causing the death, and attacked the doctors.“When I reached hospital after cremation of my father, I found that the oxygen supply was switched off. I made a video and made it viral on social media. This led to police action against me,” alleged Akshay before being taken by the police.“A woman going to the crematorium is prohibited in our traditions.

We had held many meetings with villagers urging them to appear for testing in large numbers but to no avail,” the SDM added.A senior medical officer, who is looking after sampling at Sisai village, said the village has a population of over 20,000 and only 223 persons appeared for testing in a week and 6% of them were found infected.“People have high fever, cough, wheezing but they are approaching quacks for treatment instead of appearing for Covid test,” the doctor added.Balbir Singh, acting president of the Sisai municipal committee, said 54 persons have died in the village since April 24, of which 15 have died of Covid-19.“The health department is including deaths which have taken place in the district only. More than 30 deceased had high fever and cough but none appeared for testing. Many of their family members had refused testing. The villagers have a mindset that if they test positive, they will not get a bed in government hospitals. We had sanitised the village on our own level,” he added.Parminder Singh, representative of Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja’s native village Parbhuwala, said the village saw 18 deaths, of which three are confirmed Covid deaths.Sarpanch Om Prakash, who is leading Talwandi Badshahpur village until new panchayat forms, said more than 16 persons have died in the last three weeks. “Three of the deceased were cremated by doctors following Covid protocol,” he added.Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni has directed to start testing in villages where people are suffering from high fever and asked village nambardars to help health teams ensure proper testing.“We have asked the villagers to adopt Thikhri pehra in their areas to stop the spread of the virus,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-reluctant-to-appear-for-testing-in-rural-areas-of-hisar-101620924173176.html

The court directed the state government to file its response to the interlocutory application filed by the Rashtriya Swasthya Mission Karmchari Sangh, Bihar, within four weeks. On Wednesday, over 27,000 health workers had gone on “home-isolation” alleging apathy of the state government towards their old demands, threatening to derail health facilities across the state. Sangh secretary Lalan Singh said they had returned to work on court’s order and the government’s assurance. Experts’ committee report Earlier in the morning, the court directed that the report of the committee of experts be shared with all the counsels appearing in the proceedings on Covid management. The three-member committee had been constituted by the Centre on the directive of the Patna HC to examine the facilities available at the hospitals in Patna and the status of oxygen supply. The team was headed by Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS, Patna. Advocate General Lalit Kishore will file the response to the court within the next four working days. Meanwhile, the state government informed the court that the management of Medanta Hospital had agreed to open their institution at Patna with effect from May 17, 2021, by making provision for at least 50 beds to be utilized only for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thousands-of-health-workers-call-off-stir-after-hc-intervention-101620924171941.html

The pilot project, executed through Common Service Centre (CSC) e-governance under the Digital India, aims to provide internet access and facilitate the 18-44 years target age group pre-register for vaccination in the two districts. The two districts have a population of roughly 49.27 lakh, of which Nalanda accounts for 28.77 lakh and Patna 20.5 lakh (source: Census 2011). The health ministry has made it mandatory for those in 18-44 years age group to pre-register for Covid-19 vaccination. Unlike those 45 years and above, walk-in and on-spot registration for vaccination is not allowed for the younger age group. “Bihar has vaccinated 85,50,682 beneficiaries so far,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, at a press conference on Thursday. It has a target population of 7.51 crore to vaccinate, of which 5.39 crore are in the 18-44 age years group and 2.12 crore in the 45 years and above age group. “We have sent out one van in each of the districts of Patna and Nalanda to reach out to the rural people in the 18-44 years age group and facilitate them pre-register for Covid-19 vaccination. Our vans are equipped with large TV LED screen, laptops and generator set,” said Santosh Kumar Tiwari, state head CSC, Bihar. The CSC has also offered to help the Bihar government distribute Covid-19 kits, containing basic medication and thermometer, to patients under home isolation and also test suspects using rapid antigen kits. The state health department, however, has not responded to this initiative of the CSC so far, said sources. Should the state health department agree, it has to provide to the CSC Covid-19 medication kits for patients and rapid antigen kits for on-spot testing of Covid suspects. This will, in turn, help the health department increase its daily testing and reach out with Covid medication kits to a larger rural population, where the second wave of the pandemic has now extended to. Of late, more new Covid-19 cases are being reported from rural than urban areas in Bihar. The Covid vans would also offer Aadhaar-enabled banking services and allow an individual withdraw up to a maximum of ₹20,000 per day, said Tiwari. There are 40,000 CSCs also referred to as village level entrepreneurs in Bihar. These are physical facilities for delivering Centre’s e-services like booking railway tickets, applying for PAN card, Aadhaar, etc. to rural and remote locations.Headline: Vaccination in BiharIntro: The state has vaccinated 11.31% of its population against Covid-19 since the inoculation began on Jan 16Target population: 7.51 crore 18-44 age group: 5.39 crore 45-plus: 2.12 croreVaccinated so far: 85,50,682||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/it-ministry-sends-covid-care-vans-to-patna-nalanda-101620924171315.html

Of these, 465 deaths (51%) were reported since March 31 this year, she said.“Last year, 10 persons lost their lives due to Covid at PGIMS in May last year, 25 in June, 36 in July, 41 in August, 84 in September, 45 in October, 127 in November and 52 in December. Similarly, this year, 13 deaths were reported in January, two in February, three in March, 268 in April, and 197 till May 12,” she added.She said that the death toll witnessed a sharp rise in April, 2021.“Many patients reached here after their lungs got infected and their saturation level dipped. Such patients died after they got admitted for one to two hours. People are not coming here for testing and are moving in after their health completely deteriorates. We have 113 ICU beds and doctors are making all efforts to save lives of every patient undergoing treatment. Also, people had lowered their guard this year which resulted in rise of caseload and deaths,” she added.A senior doctor at PGIMS, requesting anonymity, said that there is rise in Covid-suspected deaths. “Hospitals are admitting patients who have RT-PCR positive reports and there are patients with false negative, whom hospitals are refusing admission. Such patients are also dying,” the doctor added.The doctor added that they have seen a rise in patients from rural areas visiting PGIMS for treatment.“In the first wave, few patients from rural areas came for treatment here but the transmission has spread its tentacles in villages. Since April last week, we are receiving calls from villages seeking to help in admitting severe patients. This is happening because people are not appearing for tests in villages and are approaching us after their lungs are found infected in CT reports,” the doctor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/of-all-covid-deaths-at-pgims-rohtak-since-virus-outbreak-51-are-since-march-31-101620923993824.html

But only six lakh vaccine doses have been received so far - three lakh each in different consignments, he said.GLOBAL TENDERS BEING FLOATEDKhattar added that a global tender is being floated to purchase vaccine for the 18-45 age group. The cost of the vaccine will be borne by the state government and it will be administered free of cost at government hospitals.State health minister Anil Vij, who also holds the home portfolio, tweeted that the tenders to buy the vaccine will be floated at the earliest.He had recently said that about 1.1 crore people in state are in the 18-44 age bracket.Khattar said about 47 lakh doses have been administered so far. The CM said the villages are witnessing frequent movement of people and thus are becoming Covid hotspots. “It is important to keep a close watch on outsiders coming to villages as such people are becoming a threat to other villagers,” he said.PRADHAN MANTRI JEEVAN JYOTI BIMA YOJANAKhattar on Thursday announced that the state government will pay premium for the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on behalf of the government.The CM urged the needy to go to banks and fill form so that they can get benefit of the scheme. Forms of this scheme can be filled by May 31.The first instalment of the premium should be in the account of the account holder. As soon as the instalment premium is deducted from the account, the premium amount will be deposited in the account by the government. The scheme is for people between the ages of 18-50 years with an annual premium of ₹330.For the eligible below poverty line (BPL) families, the premium of this scheme will be deposited in their account every year after deducting it from their account. Under the scheme, the family will get an insurance benefit of ₹2 lakh on death (due to any reason) of an eligible person in state.He said that the families who have lost members prematurely during the second wave of Covid and could not fill the form for benefit of this scheme will be given a benefit of ₹2 lakh by the state government.13,500 OF TOTAL OXYGEN BEDS IN STATE OCCUPIEDKhattar said there are 17,000 oxygen beds in private and government hospitals in state, of which about 13,500 beds are occupied by patients.He said that private hospitals contribute 60% of the arrangement of these oxygen beds but it is painful when it comes to notice that some hospitals are charging more than the rates fixed by the government.He added that strict action will be taken if anyone is caught doing such activities. He said that the ambulance rates are fixed and one should not charge more than the fixed price.Khattar said delivery of oxygen is being done at homes on doctor’s prescription. “By Thursday afternoon, 6,000 patients have registered for cylinders and more than 3,000 cylinders have been refilled and delivered,” he said.He added that the state government is making arrangements to set up isolation centres.

The civic administration has issued notices to some hospitals in the neighbourhood for the illegal activity. According to Vishal Shinde, city unit president of Janadhikar Sena, he had intercepted a PMC truck dumping medical waste around 3 am. The driver and mukadam incharge gave him evasive answers about the waste being thrown in the open in violation of Covid protocols. Shinde later lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station seeking an FIR against the civic staff. According to the complaint, dogs and pigs are seen scavenging the medical waste and later seen frequenting nearby residential areas. Following the complaint made to PMC deputy commissioner Ajit Deshmukh, the civic administration claimed to have issued notices to some nearby hospitals. Shinde claimed that medical and other waste are dumped by PMC trucks in the areas during night time. Shinde said, “While PMC is spending money on Covid treatment, it is unable to check illegal dumping of medical waste.” PMC senior health inspector Mangaldas Mane said, “Why the PMC vehicle of Kondhwa-Yeolewadi regional ward office went to Taljai Pathar is being probed.

13-05-2021||Kolkata||‘Situation far worse’: Dhankar visits Cooch Behar, amps up attack on Mamata||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday faced protests by a handful of Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers at Dinhata in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district during his visit to meet victims of post-poll violence despite a strong advisory from chief minister Mamata Banerjee.The two exchanged strongly-worded letters on Wednesday evening. While Banerjee accused Dhankhar of violating protocols by planning to visit Cooch Behar without the state’s sanction, the latter accused Banerjee of showing no regard for the Constitution.On his visit, Dhankhar was accompanied by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Cooch Behar Lok Sabha member Nisith Pramanik and the party’s district unit president Malati Rava Roy. They took the governor to some villages where people alleged that TMC workers attacked them and ransacked their homes after the poll results were announced on May 2.Late on Thursday afternoon, about a dozen TMC workers shouted ‘go-back’ slogans at Dhankhar in Dinhata town. They were driven away from the sidewalk by the local police.“This is a serious security failure. This is a total collapse of rule of law. I never imagined this would happen,” the governor could be heard telling police officers deployed for his visit. He even got out of his car and stood in the middle of the road.“A dozen ruling party workers could stop my convoy, with no fear of law and police. Such state of affairs @MamataOfficial ! I had to intervene finding they were determined to involve with my security,” Dhankhar tweeted later in the evening.Pramanik, who accompanied the governor, contested the Dinhata assembly seat and defeated the TMC’s sitting legislator Udayan Guha by 57 votes. Guha suffered multiple fractures in his right arm and two of his security personnel were injured in the head when they were attacked, allegedly by BJP workers, on May 6. Denying the charge, BJP leaders said the attack was a fallout of infighting in TMC.Pramanik, however, did not take oath and resigned from the assembly on Wednesday to retain the Lok Sabha seat.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the saffron camp bagged seven of north Bengal’s eight seats. In the assembly polls in north Bengal, the BJP won 30 of the region’s 54 assembly seats.On Thursday, black flags were shown to Dhankhar at Sitalkuchi where four villagers were killed in firing by Central Industrial Security Force personnel while polling was in progress on April 10. Dhankhar met the family of a young man who was murdered in Sitalkuchi on that day.“The law and order situation in this region is far worse than what I had thought,” Dhankhar said at a press conference in Cooch Behar’s Dinhata town in the evening. “The chief minister instigated her workers against the central forces. She also threatened to teach people a lesson after the central forces left Bengal. All this puts democracy in danger,” said Dhankhar.Reacting to the TMC demonstrations, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh told a news channel that Cooch Behar resembles war-hit Syria. “Not even the governor can move freely in the region,” he said.Leaders of the TMC accused Dhankhar of being partisan.“The governor is behaving like a BJP cadre. He has violated all sections in the Constitution that define a governor’s role,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.In his letter to the chief minister on Wednesday which announced his intention to go ahead with his Cooch Behar visit, Dhankhar had cited “inputs of rampant loot, arson, killings, rape and other horrendous acts against those in opposition to your party” to explain his decision.This was in reply to Banerjee’s letter in which she wrote that by unilaterally deciding to visit Cooch Behar, the governor was going to violate “well-established norms of protocol” and requested him to “desist from abrupt decisions with regard to field visits.”The BJP bagged 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 but could win only 77 assembly seats against the TMC’s 213. Elections were held in 292 of the state’s 294 assembly seats as two candidates for two seats in the Murshidabad district died of Covid-19. Polls in these constituencies will be held later. Polls will also be held at Khardah in North 24 Parganas as the winner, TMC leader Kajal Sinha, died of Covid-19.In addition to these three seats, the Dinhata seat in Cooch Behar and the Shantipur seat in Nadia district will also go to the polls again. Like Pramanik, Jagannath Sarkar, the BJP Lok Sabha member who won the Shantipur seat, also resigned from the assembly on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/situation-far-worse-dhankar-visits-cooch-behar-amps-up-attack-on-mamata-101620919016749.html

Due to a poor response, the Pune railway division took the decision. “The daily special train running between Pune and Mumbai, to and fro, was getting very few bookings. Occupancy was hardly 10 per cent. So it was decided to cancel the train from May 14 onwards, rather than face losses,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson. “This train was running as per the timings of the Deccan Queen Express. Our appeal to passengers is not to panic as there are several other trains running between the two cities. These are the connecting trains and run at different times throughout the day,” added Jhawar. In April, other trains were cancelled due to poor response. These include the Pune-Nagpur weekly special train, Pune-Ajni weekly special train, Pune-Amravati weekly special train and Kolhapur-Nagpur bi-weekly special. All these trains were originating from the Pune railway division, but due less occupancy of less than 15 per cent, were cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punemumbai-special-train-cancelled-due-to-poor-response-101620918770989.html

On Wednesday, at a state cabinet meeting, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray passed the proposal to sell 4.75 hectares for commercial use to Tata and Siemens at a concessional rate. Suhas Diwase, chief executive officer (CEO) of PMRDA said, “The companies will use the land for commercial purposes. At present, work on a casting yard is on. Actual work on the metro corridor will start soon.”The state is using the “design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT)” model for such land acquisitions. Earlier, PMRDA had declared that a metro facility between Shivajinagar and Hinjewadi will be operational by March 2023. However, due to a delay in acquisition of land, it took time to start actual work. PMRDA has estimated 30,000 passengers per hour during peak hours in its detail project report (DPR) on this route. PMRDA needs to acquire a total 9,579 sqkm from various establishments. Till date, PMRDA has acquired 1,94.9sqm from the Khadi Gram Udyog. They have also sent compulsory acquisition notices to the remaining land owners under Section of 11 of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act.Vivek Kharwadkar, chief engineer, PMRDA, said, “Work is going on in full swing.”In 2018, the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) signed a contract with Tata and Siemens for the project to be developed on a public- private partnership model to decongest traffic in the city by improving connectivity within the metropolitan region. The proposed route is 23.3km elevated track between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar. It will take less than 40 minutes to cover the distance from the civil court in Shivajinagar to the Hinjewadi IT Park.The route will have 23 elevated stations. The project is estimated at ₹8,100 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-approves-sale-of-balewadi-land-for-hinjewadi-to-shivajinagar-metro-route-101620916910810.html

I'm worried thinking if there is a plan or data maintained how many covaxin or covishield ll be required when we all become eligible for the second dose. Scared to think we might miss the window due to non availability of the required one then," tweeted Baba TJ.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi wrote: "Big issue as Delhi has already run out of Covaxin. What about people who got their first doses, is their second dose indefinitely delayed? What is the Centre/ State's take on it??".As per the protocols, there should be 28-days gap between the two doses of Covaxin. Around 90 lakh people are eligible for the inoculation under the 18-44 age group in the national capital.Twenty eight-year-old Nisha Siaini, who till Wednesday thought of herself and her husband as "extremely lucky" to have successfully found a slot for vaccination, is now worried about the availability of the second dose.She is afraid that the shortage of vaccines will "create doubt among those who want to take Covaxin in the future"."Those who have taken Covaxin have been left in lurch. There is no surety that we will be able to get the 2nd dose on time. Also, we cannot even take any other vaccine. This will create doubt among those who want to take Covaxin in the future," said Nisha, a professional banker, who got her first jab along with her husband on May 5. "The only answer to this problem is that the Centre help the company ramp up production or ask other companies to manufacture Covaxin," she suggested.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday had suggested that the Centre share the anti-COVID-19 vaccine formula of the two manufacturers with other companies in the country to scale up production.The situation is more grave for those who are already due for the second dose of Covaxin and are running from pillar to post for vaccination. "#Kejriwal I got my first dose of covaxin on 5th of April at Bhagwati hospital sec.13 Rohini. My second dose is due now they are saying We have no vaccine. Now where to get vaccine," tweeted Ashwani Rampal."Dear Mr. Kejriwal, Please help us to get 2nd doss of Covaxin for my Parents. From last three days we are visiting centres even with the appointment slip of Cowin. However, they respond that Vaccine is finished. 1/2 @ArvindKejriwal @PMOIndia @AamAadmiParty @msisodia," tweeted Hardik Arora."My mom and grandma got first dose covaxin a month ago, My booking of second dose got automatically cancelled 2 times and now they are no slots left.

The vaccine being developed by IISc is promising as the results show a better neutralising effect than the existing vaccines. This vaccine which is yet to begin the human trial process could be a big breakthrough in India's battle against pandemic as the vaccine can be stored in room temperatures up to 30," read the release.From a public health point of view this is a huge advantage as it enables the government to scale up the distribution of vaccines in a much faster and easier way, stated the professor.The health minister has also sought help from the institute in developing an audit mechanism for oxygen generation plants and finding ways for optimal utilisation of oxygen and minimise wastage at both refilling/bottling units and at hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-health-minister-sudhakar-seeks-iisc-s-support-in-combating-covid-crisis-101620908183175.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools go the extra mile for students who lost parents to Covid||From organising online prayer meets for students who lost their parents to Covid to ensuring constant communication with them, schools in the national capital are taking various steps to ensure emotional and mental support for these children to process their grief.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said at least six students in her school have lost one of their parents this month. “These deaths can weigh heavily on the minds of children and there has to be a specialised approach because every situation is different. We have asked teachers to be in touch with these students and their families. Many families are still in shock and we will encourage them to opt for counselling when they are ready,” she said.The surge in Covid fatalities is reflected in official figures shared by the Delhi government which show that 5,120 people died in April while the number has reached 3,197 between May 1 and 9 this year.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales Pusa Road, said the school tries to be the first contact for the child after they receive information of a parent’s death. “We have created WhatsApp groups where teachers inform us if there has been a death of a parent. We first call the immediate relatives of the parent to get stock of the situation there, ask about the child, and assure the family of any assistance they need,” she said.The school then gets in touch with the classmates and their parents to find out the child’s closest friends and establish a peer group. The peer group is then instructed to keep the child engaged and busy through conversation, activities and group phone calls as it is easier for them to talk to someone their age. The school also organises virtual prayer meetings for children and is planning on a “concert of hope”.Also Read | Delhi’s daily Covid-19 cases fall to 10,489; positivity rate below 15%“We will share photographs of those who have lost their lives to Covid and bring the children together on a platform so that they can share their grief. The death of a parent involves more than mental health issues. Their entire lives will change because of this,” she said.Psychologist Manveen Kaur, who is the counsellor at Amity International School in Saket, said that dealing with death is more difficult with children as they often don’t understand their emotions or are unable to identify or communicate it, leading to behavioural changes.“If grief counselling is not done in the right way, it would have long-term adverse effects like longstanding depression and anxiety in children, trust issues in life and can become a part of their personality,” she said, adding that they are doing family therapy with such children and their immediate family members.“The family members are the immediate contact of the children and need to be counselled on how to behave with them and involve them in daily activities or look for changes in their behaviour,” she said.Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School in Saket, said the school is planning voluntary group therapy sessions where children can share their grief together.Also Watch | ‘Delhi’s oxygen demand down to 582MT, divert surplus to others’: Manish SisodiaSchools are also helping students with other necessities during the pandemic. “From providing cooked meals for the families who tested positive to arranging for medicines, oxygen or cremation facilities, we have a dedicated cell looking into the various needs which came up during the pandemic,” said Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh.Government schools in the capital have also asked their teachers to maintain communication with children and parents despite the ongoing summer vacation. Sarita Batra, principal at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Shalimar Bagh, said the school management committee has also been active in keeping tabs on the children to see if they need any help.“We have been recording motivational stories on fighting these challenging times and sending them to children. Sometimes, we also discuss stories on video conferencing platforms with each section and turn this into a storytelling session, allowing children to express themselves. Our teachers also record voice messages for the children on WhatsApp and motivate them to not lose hope,” she said.The Central Board of Secondary Education also launched a mobile application for students of classes 9 to 12 on Monday to look at the psychosocial wellness of students. The app offers counselling sessions, educational material on social, emotional and behavioural issues such as depression, anxiety over exams and internet addiction disorder, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-go-the-extra-mile-for-students-who-lost-parents-to-covid-101620908691229.html

13-05-2021||Lucknow||UP village in panic as Covid-19 cases surge in rural areas||The lanes of Mauaima village in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj, which are normally abuzz with activities, wore a deserted look. Residents were not even letting children step out of their homes as fear has gripped the village amid rising Covid-19 cases in rural areas.Tirthraj Yadav, 36, the newly elected village head, said the residents were scared of symptoms associated with Covid-19--cough, fever, and body aches--which are otherwise dismissed as normal and associated with changing seasons. Yadav blamed lack of education for misconceptions about the disease, which have added to the panic. He added many believe that if one person of a family tested positive for Covid, the kin will also be sent to hospitals. Yadav said misinformation that free vaccination can make one sicker, etc has also made people in rural areas reluctant to undergo voluntary testing. “Many hide their symptoms and try to get themselves treated on their own, which has cost them, dear,” said Yadav.The villages under the Mauaima village council, which have a population of 25,000, have officially reported around six Covid-19 deaths. But residents say the number is around four times higher. The last rites of many people, who have died, have been performed hurriedly over the last few weeks.Yadav said the deaths of three members of a family triggered much panic. “If one goes by cremations and burials, we have had around 25 deaths in the last few months...most of them died after showing symptoms like fever, cough, and breathing trouble. But their kin preferred to not get them tested.”Also Read | Uttar Pradesh reports 17,775 Covid-19 cases, 281 related fatalitiesMuhammad Waseem, 42, of the nearby Bataha Majra, said around 500 people in his village have contracted Covid or showed its symptoms. “But merely one in five went to the Community Health Centre (CHC), which has free Covid-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination facilities,” said Waseem, who owns around 100 power looms. Waseem said unfounded fears were deterring people from seeking treatment. “Without any logic, many believe that the vaccine would make them sicker. Some just do not want to send their sick kin to hospitals. I have tried to convince people to make use of the free services, but it is tough to get them to change their minds.”Phool Chandra Yadav, 50, a resident of Khakri Matpur Majra village, echoed Yadav and Waseem.Dr Ram Gopal Verma, the CHC in charge, said they were conducting house-to-house testing with the help of 160 teams. “Around 320 tests are being performed at the centre daily on average,” Verma said. He added the second phase of a state-wide drive to identify Covid-19 patients was underway. “We have divided our block into seven zones, and each is being covered. It is possible that a few houses may not have been covered yet, but by the time the second phase gets over, all homes would be covered.”Verma said four to six Covid-19 cases were being detected daily. “However, lack of cooperation from people under the Mauaima Gram Panchayat has been a challenge for us. We have instances where people found with symptoms have been given medicine kits and asked to get tested. But they refused to turn up for tests after getting relief from medicines. Many times, despite an ambulance being ready, positive patients and their kin simply refuse to go to the hospital and get into altercations. However, our efforts are on with help of police and district administration officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-village-in-panic-as-covid-19-cases-surge-in-rural-areas-101620903171305.html

13-05-2021||Other||Guest column: As Goa battles Covid storm, nobody steering the ship to safety||As many as 75 persons died due to Covid-19 in Goa on Tuesday, May 11, making it the highest single-day death toll for the state in the pandemic so far.The total death toll caused due to the pandemic now stands at 1,805. The state also recorded as many as 3,124 Covid positive cases on the same day (May 11), taking its total active cases to 32,836. The positivity rate in the state till a few days ago, was hovering around the 50 per cent mark (every second person was testing positive), the highest in the country. For the smallest state in India, with a population of just 1.5 million people, these are very scary statistics indeed. Why does Goa find itself in this situation? Gross negligence and mismanagement of the Covid crisis by the state government. The BJP chief minister, Dr Pramod Sawant, the late Parrikar’s blue-eyed-boy, despite being a trained Ayurveda doctor, has displayed extremely poor leadership qualities in the face of the crisis. To make matters worse, both he and the state health minister, Vishwajit Rane, have never been on the same page ever since this pandemic began. They have held contrary views and opinions and have worked at cross purposes, sadly at the cost of human lives. Sample the latest. Rane made a striking statement to the local media on Tuesday (May 11) that 26 Covid patients had died in the state’s premier medical institution, Goa Medical College (GMC), due to oxygen supply problems. Instead of rolling up his sleeves and solving the problem, which is his ministry’s biggest challenge, Rane has chosen to take three steps backwards and instead has sheepishly asked the Bombay High Court (Goa bench) to conduct a probe into the matter of poor oxygen supplies at the GMC. The chief minister on the other hand, in response to the poor oxygen supply situation at GMC simply accused the hospital administration of “mismanagement”, refusing to acknowledge the repeated pleas of the GMC administration of inadequate oxygen supply. To make matters worse, Sawant has directed his ire at the lone company entrusted with the task of supplying oxygen to all state government medical facilities, blaming them for poor support. With the two worthies mentioned above having maximum executive powers to turn things around, but shrugging their basic responsibilities, the common man in Goa, whether in towns or villages, is at his/her wit’s end. However, this mismanagement of the Covid crisis in Goa began several months ago. Unknown to many, the Goa government’s financial status is at best precarious. Local media reports have consistently pegged the state’s current debt at a staggering ₹20,000 crore. Not surprisingly, Sawant opened up the tourism gates in October 2020. The big blunder, however, was that he did not insist on Covid negative certificates from visiting tourists. People in other parts of India welcomed this opportunity to let their hair down, and came in droves. The photographs of tourists cramming the north Goa beaches in the last week of December 2020, was akin to a mini-Kumbh Mela. Cheek by jowl and unmasked, tourists made merry on the beaches with zero policing by the state government. When the local media repeatedly badgered the chief minister for his continuing reluctance to insist on Covid-negative certificates from tourists, he would simply repeat his favourite line in Konkani, ad-nauseam, “Bhivpachi garaz naa!” (There is no need to be scared!) This lowering of the guard and non-insistence of a Covid-negative certificate had its obvious repercussions. Several staff members working on the casino boats on the river Mandovi tested positive for Covid. Believe it or not, but the Goa government actually granted permission to a casino to host a boxing tournament featuring India’s leading professional boxer Vijender Singh, complete with spectators, in mid-March this year.Also, as recently as April this year, local media consistently reported of bars and restaurants in north Goa crammed with tourists sans masks and no Covid SOPs in place, thanks to zero policing from the state government.To make matters worse, post the first Covid wave, the state government has also been guilty of not working to enhance local oxygen manufacturing facilities, increase hospital beds and recruit additional medical staff, despite several reminders and warnings from the state’s medical establishment. The result: Goa is facing its biggest health crisis to date and scarily, there does not seem to be anyone in charge.

The spike in CFR, the proportion of people who die from a disease among all diagnosed with it, is the highest in the state.According to Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, for a week now, Kolhapur has been witnessing a surge in the number of daily Covid cases and the average CFR is also above 3.4% against the state’s 1.3%. During the previous wave too, Kolhapur’s CFR touched 4%. “Team of experts from divisional task force, including state advisor for Covid Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Dr Arti Kinikar and Dr Dilip Kadam, visited Kolhapur to assess the reasons why its CFR is on the higher side.

As a responsible government, we will give the surplus oxygen to the states who need it,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a press briefing on Thursday. On an average, Delhi is now getting 579.25MT oxygen on a daily basis, of which 42% is being supplied by the railways and 58% is coming through roadways, data showed.

The four ministers, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar, on Wednesday demanded the suspension of the Amritsar East MLA for his unwarranted belligerence against the chief minister. “Sidhu’s provocative and targeted attacks on the chief minister over the past several days are an invitation for disaster for the Congress,” they said in a hard-hitting statement, suggesting collusion between Sidhu and opposition parties in the state, such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

13-05-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru rides high: Cyclists provide relief to residents amid the lockdown||As Karnataka tackles the second wave of coronavirus, many are finding it difficult to get access to medicines and other essentials. That has inspired a group of cyclists in the city, Relief Riders to come to the rescue of many, especially the senior citizens. And in return, the citizens have been sending out messages of gratitude such as: ‘I have received my medicines, thank you very much. I am extremely grateful to you for your help, you’ve saved my life.’ Bengaluru resident Sathya Sankaran is one who receives many messages on similar lines everyday, for himself and his team for helping out those in need. “We had started delivery of essentials on cycles during the first lockdown in 2020. Our group stayed active, and when this new lockdown was announced, we knew what we would be needed,” says Sankaran, who is currently overseeing the work of 200 volunteers.“The lockdown has been particularly hard on the elderly, and many others who have Covid or non-Covid medical conditions, and have no one to take care of them... Our cyclists ferry the essentials to them between 6am and 10am,” adds Sankaran informing how their young volunteers are being given training to stay safe while undertaking the deliveries. “As part of Relief Riders, we are being asked to deliver necessities in our local areas, so as to ensure safety of all volunteers,” says Arvind Bhateja, a volunteer with the group. Since cyclists don’t need passes to commute and adhere to norms listed by the local health department for the lockdown, many are coming forward to volunteer with the group. “I started cycling during the lockdown last year, and originally did it for health benefits. But, after a chance meeting with the Relief Riders, I realised it was time to give back to society. It has been a rewarding experience so far,” says Asha Rajdev, a pilot who volunteers with the group, and Dr Arvind Bhateja, a Bengaluru-based neurosurgeon, who along with his wife are active members of Relief Riders. “My wife and I commute to work on cycles, and on our way we take a little detour and try to help as many people as we can with essentials. At Relief Riders, we are being asked to deliver in our local areas so as to ensure safety of all volunteers,” says Bhateja, who had started #ResetWithCycling initiative last year to promote cycling.And for residents, these bikers are God sent! “Relief riders had been my life saviors during the time when my husband was down with 104 degree fever. They searched multiple medical shops to bring my medicines and necessary equipment to me. I can’t ever forget the help I’ve received from them,” says Manisha Mishra, one of the beneficiaries of the initiative.The initiative has now been extended to cycling communities in seven other cities across India including Chennai, Gurugram, Mumbai, and Hubballi. “In one of the households that we cater to, there are two bedridden senior citizens with a nurse. They wanted home deliveries so that they don’t expose themselves to the virus. We helped them out with groceries and it’s heartwarming to be of assistance to people,” adds Bhateja.

13-05-2021||Patna||Bihar meets Covid-19 challenge with ‘e-LOTS’ web portal for virtual learning||In a bid to strengthen the online learning system for government school students amid Covid-19 pandemic, Bihar state education department launched a web portal named e-LOTS on Wednesday to converge e-books and audio-visual learning materials on a single digital platform.The web portal has been jointly developed by the Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) and Unicef and has created a digital library for students and teachers as well, education department officials say.“As schools are facing closure due to the pandemic, the web portal has been designed to continue the teaching and learning process. Subject-wise and chapter-wise e-books have been uploaded in English and Hindi. Those who wish to access audio-visual learning materials can switch to linked gateways with a single click,” said BEPC director Sanjay Singh.Conventional mode of classroom learning has been disrupted since last year in March, when the Covid pandemic outbreak forced closure of education institutions forcing teaching to move online. Bihar is currently under a fresh spell of lockdown during the second wave of Covid-19.The e-LOTS portal has been linked with various digital educational platforms like DIKSHA portal, Swayamprabha channel and National Repository of Open Educational Resources to provide adequate study material for comprehensive learning of students and training of teachers, they added.Singh said the portal will also help teachers with information on curriculum, learning outcomes and teaching-aids.“Besides, teaching materials created for running catch-up courses have also been uploaded for reference of teachers,” he added.The e-LOTS web portal can be accessed through http://bepclots.bihar.gov.in/ or a mobile application available in Google Play store.The portal also offers career advice and guidance to class 10 and 12 pass outs with options to explore various traditional and vocational courses, entrance exams and scholarship.As per the education department, more than 41,000 people visited the web portal on Wednesday.

13-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to compile database of mucormycosis to assess its spread||The Maharashtra health department has decided to create a separate database of cases of mucormycosis, primarily being found in Covid-19 patients, to assess its actual spread and how to tackle it, officials said.Two Covid-19 patients recently died of this rare but serious fungal infection in neighbouring Thane, while there has been a surge in such cases in Mumbai and Pune, they said.As per doctors, mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus, is mostly found among Covid-19 patients who have diabetes. Its symptoms include headache, fever, pain under the eyes, nasal or sinus congestion and partial loss of vision.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said there could be over 2,000 mucormycosis patients in the state as of now and with more and more Covid-19 cases coming up, "their number would increase for sure".On Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said as many as 111 patients, all Covid-19 survivors, were undergoing treatment for mucormycosis in hospitals here.According to state health services director Dr Archana Patil, earlier there was no regular health management of mucormycosis, though it was detected in a few pockets.However, the Maharashtra health authorities have now decided make a detailed report of such cases in the state, and guidelines regarding it will soon be issued to all the districts, Patil said on Wednesday."Once such data is compiled on a real-time basis, we will have some idea about the actual spread of the fungal infection and how to respond to it. We can also allocate medicines and provide necessary guidance as per its prevalence," the official said.According to health experts, cases of mucormycosis are rising in the state mainly among Covid-19 patients.The immune system of such patients is weak which makes them more susceptible to this fungal infection, they said."There were some cases of this fungal infection in private hospitals last year during the first wave of Covid-19. But, some of those hospitals did not inform the state government or the ICMR about it," a state health official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-compile-database-of-mucormycosis-to-assess-its-spread-101620877579460.html

District magistrates have been directed to create an additional 186 vaccination centres, with about 10 vaccination sites at each, officials in the know of the matter said.The government has also increased the number of shots administered per site per day from 150 to 200, according to a latest order.“Opening up of 186 more vaccination centres with approx 10 vaccination centres (sites) in addition to existing centres…” read the order by special secretary (health) SM Ali.Not all the additional sites will be used for immunising those between the ages of 18 to 44 years; the vaccination drive for others (45+ age group, frontline workers, health workers etc) will also be moved to schools as per the order.“A majority of the existing government centres for the 45+ age group are in Delhi government hospitals and Delhi government dispensaries, and these may be considered for shifting to centres in schools,” the order said.The immunisation drive for the 18 to 44 age group had started in schools on May 3, instead of hospitals and dispensaries, with a view to avoid beneficiaries coming in contact with those who might have Covid-19.Currently, there are 374 centres -- with 470 vaccination sites -- for those above the age of 45 in Delhi. There are 101 centres, totalling 354 vaccination sites, for those between the ages of 18 and 44 years. There were only 16,900 doses of Covaxin left in Delhi as on Wednesday morning, which were administered to beneficiaries across 44 centres and will be exhausted by the end of the day, health officials said.“Thursday onwards, there will be no centre administering Covaxin -- the government has had to shut 100 centres for want of Covaxin. Bharat Biotech has refused to provide any more doses to Delhi. In a few days, those who have received the first dose of the vaccine will be ready for their second dose. We hope that the Centre will intervene and get us more (Covaxin) doses from Bharat Biotech,” said AAP MLA Atishi while releasing the daily vaccination bulletin on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dms-told-to-set-up-186-more-jab-centres-101620865117443.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||Forest dept ups vigil as demand for wood spikes in crematoriums||As the city grapples with a rising demand of wood for cremations of Covid-19 victims, the Delhi forest department is now on its guard to control cases of illegal cutting of trees in the capital.Senior forest department officials said that instances of illegal felling of trees have started coming to their notice and said it could have been prompted by the sudden surge in demand for wood for cremations. The forest officials, along with Delhi Police, are keeping a close watch on the black-marketing and sale of wood for funeral pyres, officials said.For instance, on May 2, a case of the illegal cutting of four fully grown trees was reported from south Delhi’s Dera Mandi. While the south division of the forest department sealed the area and is conducting an inquiry into the felling, officials have not been able to retrieve the timber.A similar instance of trees being felled was also reported by environment activists on April 9 from Sundar Nagar, where forest department confirmed that no permissions to cut trees were given to any construction agency or individual.Forest officials suspect that limited availability has fuelled instances of illegal wood trade in different parts of Delhi and NCR, which needs to be checked to control long-term damage.“While we are providing permissions to the municipalities for the cutting of dead and dried trees, we are keeping a close watch to ensure only the municipal agencies are cutting the trees and that too in the required number. But we are also stressing that civic agencies should come up with a long term solution for this high number of cremations because this pandemic is not going to get over in a day or in a week. We need to come up with more sustainable solutions such as electric and CNG-fuelled cremation facilities so that damage to trees can be minimised,” said a senior forest official.Forest department records show that the south division has granted permissions for the felling of 400 dead and dried trees to the municipality, while the north division has granted early cutting permissions to the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for the construction of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) at Ashok Nagar, so that the wood can be sent to the local crematoriums. The north division is also in the process of identifying fallen trees in the Bonta Park, Kamla Nehru Ridge, so that these can be used for funeral pyres if required.“We are only giving permissions to government agencies and not entertaining any private requests now,” said Navneet Srivastava, deputy conservator forests (west division).When the death toll in the national capital started rising exponentially under the second wave of coronavirus, the three municipalities (east, north and south Delhi municipal corporations) had written separate letters to the forest department to make arrangements of wood, as the municipal-run funeral homes were running out of wood for pyres.Residents living in the Capital’s outskirts said that while the focus of the government and the municipal agencies are on the big crematoriums, there are smaller facilities which have become massively starved of resources, which is also leading to instances of families having to buy wood at high rates.“Every village here has a crematorium but because of the pandemic, these facilities claim to have run out of supplies. Grieving families are often asked to get wood. Each pile of wood, which is some 200-300 kg, is sold at ₹20,000 or so. Not just Covid deaths, families of people who are dying of other causes also have to arrange resources,” said Karamveer Singh, a resident of Najafgarh’s Ghummenhera Village.While the forest rules stress that only government-approved suppliers can arrange wood to crematoriums -- to ensure the prevention of illegal cutting and trade of wood -- another resident of Tikri Kalan, bordering Haryana, said that wood dealers ensure that the piles are supplied to cremation facilities after the payment is received.“We bought wood for my cousin’s cremation. He died of cardiac arrest and we could not get him tested for Covid. The city is facing a crisis; we had no other option but to arrange for resources ourselves. What should we have done? We could not have waited endlessly for the crematorium to get wood,” said Rahul Chaudhury, from Tikri Kalan, who paid ₹9,500 for the wood.A caretaker of the Nigambodh Ghat crematorium, which is among the largest cremation facilities in the city, explained that since the municipal facilities are managed by NGOs, the wood here is supplied by government suppliers.“By April-end and beginning of May, the death count was so high that we were facing a severe shortage of wood. Even though this is a big facility, we had to cut the wood for funeral pyres from the usual 500-600 kg per body, to around 450 kg, to save wood. The situation of smaller cremation facilities is worse,” the caretaker said, requesting anonymity.The municipalities said that they were experimenting with alternative and sustainable technologies to meet the Covid crisis.“We (north corporation) have very recently started making logs of dried cow dung, and shredded crop stubble, which is a farm waste. The east corporation has also issued directions to use cow dung so that the consumption of wood is less,” said north Delhi mayor Jai Prakash.Meanwhile, BK Singh, former principal chief conservator forests in Karnataka, said that the temporary shortage of wood may not result in any long-term damage, but added that it is important that the forest department keep a close watch on illegal traders. “The shortage might be solved in a few days but it is imperative that this market for illegal wood is not encouraged because demand is often man-made. In these circumstances, the forest department should in fact press agencies to plant more trees in lieu of what is being cut,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-ups-vigil-as-demand-for-wood-spikes-in-crematoriums-101620864317986.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||‘What’s the offence?’: 4 get bail in O2 device case; order on Kalra’s bail today||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to four people, including the CEO and vice-president of Matrix Cellular, for their alleged role in hoarding and selling oxygen concentrators, saying it was unable to understand the offence they had committed. Meanwhile, another city court reserved its order on the anticipatory bail plea by co-accused Navneet Kalra till Thursday.While Kalra has allegedly been on the run since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular last week, the police arrested five people, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, Hitesh, and four senior officials of Matrix Cellular – Gourav Khanna, the chief executive officer (CEO), Gaurav, who is the business head, Sathish Sethi, the manager, and Vikrant, a sales executive. Khanna was the last person to be arrested from Gurugram on Friday.The court granted bail to Khanna, Gaurav, Vikrant and Sethi on Wednesday.According to Delhi Police, Matrix Cellular received a consignment of 650 oxygen concentrators from China, of which 524 have been recovered. The concentrators were being sold for ₹70,000 each. The court, however, wanted to know if there was any illegality in this.“It may be noted that the gravamen of the case of prosecution is the alleged black marketing and hoarding of concentrators by the accused, however, the aforesaid terms are not defined in any of the Acts under consideration before this court,” chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Arun Kumar Garg said, while granting bail to the four accused.He said “no prima facie case under section 420 IPC is made out against the accused, at least from the contents of the FIR”.“The court is unable to comprehend as to why the provisions of Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of the Essential Commodities Act, 1980 are not being invoked by the state, if the state wants to stop black marketing,” the magistrate added.Kalra plea order reservedMeanwhile, additional sessions judge Sandeep Garg reserved the order on the pre-arrest bail plea by Kalra for Thursday at 10am, after hearing the arguments of the prosecution and defence.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that Kalra’s custodial interrogation was required and that bail should not be granted as he was an influential person.“His intention was to cheat the public at large and wrongfully gain. Had Delhi Police not busted the racket, many people would have been cheated,” he alleged.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing Kalra, asked the court how can his client be accused of selling the oxygen concentrators at exorbitant prices, if there is no ceiling price fixed by the government.“There is no MRP fixed by the government till date. How will you decide if the prices are exorbitant?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whats-the-offence-4-get-bail-in-o2-device-case-order-on-kalra-s-bail-today-101620864058156.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||HC asks govt to cap cost of Covid treatment at pvt facilities in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the Delhi government to cap prices for treatment of Covid-19 patients at private hospitals and nursing homes in the city, saying the administration cannot turn a blind eye to overcharging by hospitals merely because there were no complaints.“We want this taken up on top priority,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, and directed the health secretary, Delhi government, to convene a meeting with the administration of several hospitals and decide on the rationalisation of the charges. The bench asked the Delhi government to issue appropriate orders after the meeting.“Merely because there were no complaints, the situation on the ground cannot be ignored. We agree [with the petitioner] that you cannot turn a blind eye to it. We had asked you to again speak to all stakeholders. That exercise should have been done. You could have seen the condition on the ground, spoken to all the stakeholders and then arrived at a reasonable figure so that people are not fleeced,” the bench said.The directions came after the lawyer, Abhay Gupta, representing one of the intervenors in the main petition by Rakesh Malhotra, raised the issue of alleged overcharging by private hospitals. Gupta placed on record a hospital bill in which the ICU package price was ₹30,000, but the charges for bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machine, oxygen, monitors, etc, were additional and to the tune of thousands of rupees per day.The court said that the government can have different slabs based on services offered so that there is transparency.“There should be some transparency. It shouldn’t be like someone is charging a lakh or someone’s charging ₹50,000,” the bench said.Senior advocate and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao told the court that, according to his research, several private hospitals were refusing to admit patients even if they had cashless insurance cover, unless they deposited ₹50,000.The court also questioned the state government for not making over 1,000-bed Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka fully operational till date.Justices Sanghi and Palli said the Delhi government should learn from the “bitter experiences” it had during the current infection wave. “If a third wave comes, as many experts are warning it might, and your facility is not up and running (to full capacity), then again we would be back to this situation,” the bench said after senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for Delhi government, said completion of the hospital was not a pressing issue as around 4,500 beds were currently available in the national capital.“Though the situation may have somewhat improved with regard to availability of Covid beds, one cannot forget the situation that existed till just a couple of days ago when serious patients in need of hospitalisation with oxygen support, those requiring ICU with ventilators, were not able to get admission and many of them died without getting any chance to get treated appropriately,” the court noted in its oral order.Advocate YP Singh for the petitioner, Dwarka Bar Association, told the court that 80 beds were operational in the Indira Gandhi Hospital, and only eight were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-asks-govt-to-cap-cost-of-covid-treatment-at-pvt-facilities-in-delhi-101620863163525.html

In April this year, the monthly cases in the UT went beyond 45,000 along with 289 fatalities. February had the lowest 1,935 infections and 21 deaths.Of the 65 deaths in the UT on Wednesday, 46 were reported in Jammu division and 19 in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 2,750 were from Kashmir while 1,759 were from Jammu, besides 87 travellers. Dr Rakesh Bahl, senior consultant, department of community medicine, GMC Jammu, said the sudden surge in cases after a year was due to people letting their guard down.“We, as a society, let our guards down and stopped observing Covid preventive measures strictly. If your mask isn’t covering your nose, it is as good as wearing no mask at all,” he said.Officials said with 863 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 621 in Jammu district, 377 in Baramulla, 327 in Pulwama and 233 in Anantnag.The number of active cases has reached 51,542, officials said. Dr Bahl pitched for adopting Covid appropriate behaviour and getting vaccinated as the only foreseeable way out of the pandemic.“A combination of two properly fitted masks — one home-made fabric mask over one surgical mask — is needed for maximum protection. The N95 masks are primarily meant for people at much higher risk of infection like doctors and other healthcare workers,” he added. Nearly 3,603 patients have recovered from the disease, including 2,287 from Kashmir and 1,316 from Jammu. As many as 1,74,953 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 76.26% against around 98% in the first fortnight of February. The officials said that 43,916 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, taking overall tests to 7.77 million.Srinagar and Jammu districts have together contributed for about 97,000 cases and 1,377 deaths in total. Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole during a visit to south Kashmir urged people, especially above 45 years of age, to strictly follow the guidelines of “no venturing out unnecessarily” for their safety. “People should maintain social distance, hand and face hygiene and above all ensure wearing masks. Keep in touch with radio and television as all the government information is easily accessed through this medium of communication,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4509-fresh-infections-push-j-k-s-may-covid-tally-past-50000-101620852646987.html

The decision came after the deputy commissioner sent a team of the education department to the school premises to conduct an inquiry. The school was found open for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. While the school closed at 11am instead of the usual 3.30 pm, authorities later sent a message to their staff stating that the school will remain closed from now onwards. The directions to close the school were issued by DC Varinder Kumar Sharma. “We had sent a team to the school and directed them to shut down as no private school is allowed to remain open. We will take action if they still remain open,” said district education officer (DEO) Lakhvir Singh. It was reported on May 11 that tossing all Covid norms to the wind, the government-aided private school had been calling its entire staff of around 70 teachers to school daily for taking online classes from the school premises despite strict curfew orders. Interestingly, the district education officer is on board on the school’s managing committee. The district administration only permits government school teachers to come to school at 50% strength and that too from 8 am to 11.15 am. The school remained open from Monday till Wednesday despite a number of its teachers isolating themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-authorities-swing-into-action-send-team-to-ludhiana-school-to-conduct-probe-101620852106926.html

The fresh cases catapulted the total infections reported in Ludhiana over the 71,000-mark. So far, 71,066 cases have been reported in the district, of which 12,278 are active, and 1,638 patients have succumbed to the pandemic. Of the 28 deaths reported, 14 were men and 14 were women. The youngest victim was a 30-year-old resident of Kidwai Nagar while the oldest was a 78-year-old resident of Vishal Nagar. Most fatalities were reported among people in their 50s (13), four victims were in their 30s, five in their 60s and four in their 70s.Three deaths were reported from Shimla Puri, two from Kidwai Nagar and one fatality each from Gurdev Nagar, Aggar Nagar, Model Town, Civil Lines and GLADA Heights Society.Think of families shattered, casual behaviour to blame: DC Concerned over the district’s high death rate, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “As many as 168 people have lost their lives in the district in the last seven days, with an average 24 deaths per day. The casual behaviour of a certain section of people is to be blamed for the rapid surge in cases.” “So many families have been devastated but it is not enough to jolt people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and refrain from crowding,” he said, while interacting with the public on his weekly Facebook live session on the official page of DPRO Ludhiana.‘Ludhiana more critical than other districts‘On the difference in relaxation timings for Jalandhar and Ludhiana, he maintained that the situation in Ludhiana was more critical. “Do not compare apples and oranges,” he said. “Ludhiana is the biggest and most populated district of the state and comparing the restrictions imposed here with other districts is unwarranted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-cases-breach-71k-mark-as-1-215-more-test-positive-in-ludhiana-101620851446891.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 35% of those dead in April had no comorbidities||Nearly 35% of those who died of Covid-19 in the month of April had no comorbid conditions and were reasonably healthy, data released by the Ludhiana health department has revealed. The monthly death count also shot up to 231 in April as compared to January and February when the figure remained in two digits at 36 and 29 respectively. In March, the monthly fatality count stood at 115. As per the data, out of the total 231 Covid deaths in April, 152 victims were suffering from comorbidities while 79 had no prior health issues. The data also found that the 60-plus age group was more susceptible as 55% of the total deaths in April fell in this age category. The 50 to 60 age group accounted for 25% of the deaths while 20% were under the age of 50. The deaths among women also rose from 50 in March to 99 in April in the district. The combined female death count of January and February stood at 13. The data also shows that out of the 231 fatalities, 167 deaths (72%) were reported in urban areas, 14 (6%) in the urban block (towns) and 50 (22%) in rural areas of the city. Dr Bishav Mohan, member of the Covid task force of the state, said, “There are three reasons for the rise in casualties. The first is that the virulence (severity) of the virus has increased which makes considerably healthy persons extremely sick. Secondly, there has been a rise in the number of infections in rural areas. The third reason is that people are seeking medical help only when their condition starts deteriorating. By the time they reach the hospital, they are in a critical state, which increases their chances of succumbing to the virus. Early testing, treatment and awareness are imperative to save the patients in such situations.” District family planning officer Dr SP Singh, who is also the nodal officer for Covid, said, “This time around, the virus is undoubtedly more aggressive and virulent. We are increasingly witnessing cases where patients have absolutely no comorbidities. Patients below the age of 40 are being hospitalised with serious complications as well despite not having any history of diabetes and hypertension.” Observing that people’s negligence was responsible for the surge in cases, Singh said, “The method of arresting the virus’ spread is still the same. Despite making all efforts to raise awareness, the younger population is still taking the virus lightly, which was not the case during the first wave, when people feared Covid.” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargav said more younger people were testing positive during the second wave as they had suddenly started stepping out. “There are some variants prevalent in the nation which may also be affecting younger people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-35-of-those-dead-in-april-had-no-comorbidities-101620850547493.html

Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal said this while presiding over a meeting at the party head office in Chandigarh. The Akali leaders said the Congress government in the state should try to take everyone along in the fight against the pandemic and an all-party meeting was necessary to ensure that everyone worked in synergy and assist the government to provide necessary aid to people. The SAD chief also reviewed the relief being provided by the party and its youth wing. He said aid had been extended to 50 assembly constituencies and efforts will be made to reach out to all segments in the coming days. The party leaders also took note of the sufferings of people due to the ongoing lockdown in the state and stressed the need to give relief to all sections of society. The worst-affected were taxi operators, rickshaw pullers, small shopkeepers and labourers, they said, adding that the government should provide financial relief to them. They also asked the government to provide relief to the middle class by deferring bank loan installments or waive installments for six months. The government should also address the grievances of the traders at the earliest, they said. On black marketing of Covid cure medicines, Sukhbir said it was unfortunate that private hospitals were charging lakhs of rupees from infected people and the government was not intervening in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/convene-all-party-meeting-on-covid-situation-in-punjab-sad-to-capt-101620850068175.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Inadequate canal water, bad weather delay cotton sowing in Punjab’s Malwa belt||Lack of canal water supply for irrigation and inclement weather conditions in the last two weeks have slowed sowing of cotton in the semi-arid Malwa region of southern Punjab.The crop was sowed on nearly 70,000 hectares till Monday, 22% of this year’s target area of 3.25 lakh hectares, state agriculture officials said. The exercise is expected to be over by May 23 with a delay of eight days in the government’s sowing schedule.Sowing on more than 12,000 hectares area in Mansa district was delayed due to the non-availability of canal water, it is learnt. Sharanjit Singh of Mansa’s Mann Khera village, who owns 24-acre land, said he was able to sow cotton on about 5 acres using tubewell. “Groundwater is not of good quality in the Sardulgarh area and we depend on water supplied from the Bhakra canal. But the supply was suspended for over 14 days due to a breach in the canal and we are now left in the lurch. Delay in sowing will impact the cotton quality and the crop may be vulnerable to pest attack,” he said.Pargat Singh, a cotton grower from Sangha village whose joint family has 22-acre land, said the delay in sowing has worried them. “Agriculture experts say May 15 is the ideal time for sowing and we have already lost the golden time. The farmers were encouraged by last year’s good yield of 8-10 quintals per acre produce and the crop sale was also hassle-free with handsome rates offered. But this time inadequate electricity supply and lack of canal water worry us,” he added.Mansa chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said the Bhakra mainline had major damage near Fatehpur village and water in the channel is expected to be released tonight. “All villages are expected to get water in the next 24 hours,” he added.Punjab agriculture deputy director for cotton Rajesh Kumar Raheja said the state’s target is to cover 3.25 lakh hectares under cotton this year, an increase of 74,000 hectares from the last season’s 2.25 lakh hectares.Raheja said except Mansa no other district of Malwa belt had any irrigation issue for cotton sowing. “In the last two weeks, cotton-growing districts witnessed cloudy weather. Farmers apprehend rainfall and re-sowing means more expenses. Climatic conditions slowed sowing which will be over in the next 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inadequate-canal-water-bad-weather-delay-cotton-sowing-in-punjab-s-malwa-belt-101620850067145.html

The back label says — Made in England.This photo album was discovered one afternoon at the Sunday Book Bazaar, in Delhi’s Mahila Haat. It was buried under a pile of Sidney Sheldon paperbacks. The album was purchased for a mere ₹100.Inside is the documentation of one man’s life. Most photos cover India and England from the 1920s to the early 1940s, when we were still colonised by the British. The earliest pictures were taken in a family mansion in Ahmedabad, year 1925. Each page is extensively annotated in a clear, beautiful handwriting, with a pencil whose grey glossy shade shines out of the album’s black pages. The opening page shows a boy in various poses. Some pages later, the scenes shift to 1940, with a page marked, “Our ship to UK.” The boy has grown into a young man — he is standing in a sunlit corridor, dressed in a suit, with a woman in sari standing a few steps behind. The next page fixes the setting in Cambridge. The successive photos depict him as a law student in the university town.One does occasionally fish out precious books from the city’s famous book bazaar. But it is rare to discover something so valuable, containing such extensive photographic details of a privileged individual’s life — that too from a period so rich in history. A great many books in the market are obtained by the sellers from so-called kabadi-wallas, who collect them from households getting rid of their collections, or parts of it. This album must have been given away by mistake.Its middle section is most curious, with many pictures of a white woman; in each she is intensely gazing towards the camera, or perhaps the person holding it. The handwritten notes are missing here. She disappears abruptly, with later pages shifting back to India. Now our protagonist is in a huge mansion in Ahmedabad. He is wearing kurta pyjama. In one picture, he is sitting cross-legged on the floor, his dinner plate a large banana leaf. The album concludes with our Cambridge-returned hero posing in front of various Delhi monuments. Who was this man? What became of his life? The answers might be in other albums — hopefully they are lying safe with him, or his inheritors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-lost-album-regained-101620849848397.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Purchase of Fateh kits in Punjab under lens||The purchase of ‘Fateh kits’, which are being provided by the Punjab Government to Covid-19 patients, has come under scrutiny with the National Health Mission (NHM) awarding the purchase of kits worth ₹20 crore without following the due tendering process. Also, Grand Way Incorporation, a Ludhiana-based firm which was given the purchase order, doesn’t have the drug licence — a mandatory condition to participate in the tendering process. A Fateh kit contains a digital thermometer, a steamer, a fingertip pulse oxymeter, vitamin C limcee and zinc tablets, vitamin D3 capsules, Ayush kwath, dolo and other medicines. NHM director (finance) Neeraj Singla said the purchase was made in emergency as cases of infection were rising exponentially in Punjab and the department did not have the kits to distribute it to the patients. The purchase order was given on May 7. The NHM had invited the tenders for the purchase of kits on April 29, it is learnt. The tender was reportedly cancelled because four companies quoted the same price at the rate of ₹1,780 per kit. The NHM officials claim that the tender was cancelled because all four bidders deliberately quoted the same price. “Since new tendering would have taken more time and we wanted kits immediately, one of the companies, which earlier provided 50,000 kits ₹1,095 apiece agreed to supply us kits at ₹1,195 apiece. The pandemic has taken such a turn that we needed to buy the kits urgently,” said Neeraj Singla.The company was asked to provide 1.5 lakh kits at a total cost of ₹20.07 crore. The firm was given the earlier purchase order on April 19 of supplying 50,000 kits through tendering. It did not have the mandatory drug licence while participating in the bidding process at that time also. “A bidder cannot even apply for tenders for supplying drugs without the licence as per Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The bidder was allowed to involve a third party for supplying drugs. All other applicants in both the tenders had the drug licence,” said a health department official. NHM director Kumar Rahul said the condition of having drug licence is not necessary and the company can make purchases from third party as the kit contains several items in non-medicine category. “Since the tender was cancelled, the other bidders will also be given the purchase order as our kit is in demand because of the rising Covid cases. All procedures have been duly followed,” he said. Attempts to contact Grand Way Incorporation did not yield any result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/purchase-of-fateh-kits-in-punjab-under-lens-101620850007415.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Bank employees robbed of ₹45 lakh at gunpoint in Fazilka||Unidentified persons allegedly robbed employees of a private bank of ₹45 lakh at gunpoint near Fazilka district’s Jalalabad town on Wednesday. The robbers allegedly opened fire at the car in which Kotak Mahindra’s Jalalabad branch assistant manager Luvpreet Singh and his subordinate Gurpartap Singh were travelling and threw chilli powder in their eyes before fleeing with a trunk containing the cash.No one was injured in the incident. Jalalabad deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Palwinder Singh said the bank employees did not have security personnel with them. He said two motorcycle-borne men fired on the tyres and the windscreen of the car in which Luvpreet and Gurpartap were returning to the Jalalabad branch. The accused forced the bank staffers to stop the vehicle near Chak Saidon Ke village and fled with the cash and their mobile phones. Gurpartap was driving the vehicle. The DSP said after the crime, the accused travelled towards Jalalabad for nearly 2 km from the crime spot and then took link roads.“Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area are being scanned. We are also looking into as how the criminals knew about the movement of cash,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bank-employees-robbed-of-rs-45-lakh-at-gunpoint-in-fazilka-101620850006374.html

13-05-2021||Delhi||Over 4,000 ward beds, 98 ICU beds free in Delhi for first time in four weeks||The Capital on Wednesday evening had over 4,000 ward beds and 98 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, earmarked for Covid-19 patients, vacant for the first time since the second week of April when coronavirus cases had started rising rapidly. To be sure, the city has added over 7,000 beds for Covid-19 patients since then, of which nearly 2,000 were ICU beds, according to the data on the government’s Delhi Corona app. Of the total 23,345 hospital beds in Delhi, 4,682 were vacant as on Wednesday evening, putting the occupancy rate at 79.9%. Of the 5,911 ICU beds, 98 were vacant, putting the occupancy at 98.3%. In comparison, on the evening of April 16, only 443 of the 3,989 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients were vacant, putting the vacancy at 87.9%. About 10 days later, on April 26, the city had completely run out of ICU beds -- the app showed just 12 empty beds that day, and 11 of them were for pregnant women with Covid-19 and the other remaining bed, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, was already taken. Doctors see this as a sign of the Covid-19 situation gradually easing in Delhi. “The situation is definitely improving; now, there are oxygen beds available in the hospital and we do not have to refuse any patient. We have restarted all admissions. The ICUs are still full because patients, once admitted, need nearly three weeks to recover from Covid-19,” said a doctor from one of Delhi’s large private hospitals, asking not to be named. On Wednesday, Delhi reported 13,287 new Covid-19 cases, up from Tuesday’s 12,481, according to the state health bulletin. But even that figure was far less than what was reported during the last two weeks of April, when an average of 23,000 new cases were reported daily. Another doctor from the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital, said on condition of anonymity, “The rush of patients in need of admissions has reduced over the past two or three days. Earlier, we were getting 150 to 170 patients each day; that has gone down to about 80 to 100 daily.” This also means that the oxygen requirement of hospitals has also reduced. “Not only has the supply of oxygen been streamlined, the requirement itself has gone down,” said a doctor from Burari hospital, asking not to be named. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a press briefing on Tuesday said, “At the moment, there is no problem with beds in relation to oxygen. The demand for oxygen is decreasing now that the cases are going down, but we should keep getting the oxygen; otherwise there will be problems. We need 700MT of oxygen daily, and we are getting a little less than that (currently).” There was acute pressure on Delhi hospitals between April 27 and May 3, according to a senior administrator from Delhi government-run Rajeev Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital. “There are fewer people coming to the hospital now that cases have gone down and beds are available. The situation was critical between April 27 and May 3,” the administrator said, adding that the extensions set up by the government also helped ease the burden on the hospital. At its peak, the hospitalisations in Delhi had touched 22,000 at any given point during the current wave of the pandemic, according to Jain. “The demand for beds is still there, there are still 20,000 people admitted to hospitals. But the maximum occupancy during the previous wave was 9,500 ( in November), while during the current one, it is around 22,000. That is a huge number,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-4-000-ward-beds-98-icu-beds-free-in-delhi-for-first-time-in-four-weeks-101620849465936.html
13-05-2021||Other||At least 29 ‘black fungus’ cases in AIIMS, Ganga Ram spark worry||New Delhi: Hospitals are recording a spike in cases of mucormycosis, a potentially deadly fungal infection, as the surge in Covid-19 cases has led many people to be prescribed steroids and immunomodulators, which leave some people vulnerable to other pathogens. Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, has been seen among those who have uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised or those who are given excessive steroids or immune-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it may kill 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.At least 10 patients suspected to have contracted mucormycosis are currently admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Doctors said the centre used to see only two such cases a month previously. “We have 10 patients admitted in the ENT department who, we suspect, have mucormycosis. Now, we are seeing reports of opportunistic infections like mucormycosis from Gujarat and other areas where it (tocilizumab) was used a lot. Many Covid-19 patients either have underlying diabetes or their blood sugar levels became uncontrollable because of the steroids given for treatment. Some of them (Covid patients) also receive medicines, such as tocilizumab and itolizumab, which furthers the aggressive decline in the immune system. All this leads to a very high chance of opportunistic infections,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS, in a webinar. Dr Alok Thakar, head of the ENT department at AIIMS, said, “We are seeing a surge over the last week or so. The last time we saw a surge in mucormycosis cases was when Covid-19 cases increased but this time, the number of cases is greater. Since last year, we are treating probably three to four patients a month and now, we are treating four patients a day at times. For the last three days, we have been getting four to five patients a day.” “It generally occurs a couple of weeks after the onset of Covid-19 infections. However, it is still rare even among Covid-19 patients ; very few who have recovered will get it,” said Thakar. He said people should maintain basic hygiene after recovering from Covid-19 to ensure that they do not get any infections, stay away from soil, and also get their blood sugar levels tested.Another 19 people with mucormycosis are admitted at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said Dr Ajay Swaroop, head of the ENT department at the hospital. “Before Covid-19, I would have seen as many cases probably in five years. We get one patient with the fungal infection in three to four months; that too because we are a big tertiary-care facility. Now, we are hearing of patients in other city hospitals who have contracted mucormycosis and who want to move in here for treatment.” The sudden increase has also resulted in a shortage of anti-fungal medicines used for treating the infection. “The anti-fungal drugs are not freely available and there is a shortage because the demand has gone up again,” said Dr Guleria. Dr Swaroop said, “Although I don’t know the current situation about the drugs, but it stands to reason that if 35 people need it instead of the usual five, there will be a shortage. The lypholised (freeze-dried) drug that is slightly better and less toxic to other organs was anyway difficult to get.” Black fungus infection numbers went up 2.5 times last year between September and December across 16 centres in the country, said Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh. He is part of the Fungal Infection Study Forum and is one of the members who drafted the government advisory on mucormycosis. “It is likely to go up further this time; we are planning to conduct another study,” he said. Chakrabarti added not much is known about whether the immune dysregulation caused by Covid-19 could be causing the secondary fungal infection but there are three known reasons for it. “One, uncontrolled sugar in Covid-19 patients; nearly 7 to 20% of Covid-19 patients who have diabetes may be at risk of contracting the infection (mucormycosis). Two, for those without diabetes, high use of steroids may lead to poor glycemic control after Covid-19, thereby leading to the fungal infection. Three, the ferritin levels go up during a Covid-19 infection. Ferritin is known to contain iron which is a good food for mucormycosis,” said Dr Chakrabarti. The study done by his team found the infection usually happens 18 days after the onset of Covid-19. “So people should look out for pain in left or right side of the face, nasal blockage, nasal discharge, especially black discharge. Loosening of teeth has also been seen this time among Gujarat patients. If a diagnosis is delayed and the infection enters the eye orbit, it causes double vision, blurring, or protrusion of the eye. It can also cause ulcers in the palate of the mouth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-least-29-black-fungus-cases-in-aiims-ganga-ram-spark-worry-101620849405898.html

It is increasingly being understood that each one of us must come forward and lend our hands, resources, and logistics to fight the pandemic... Hansraj College has a hostel that caters to 200 residents. We are ready to offer the space and with your support that can be converted into a 100-bed ICU facility as the Covid patients are not getting hospital beds and that is causing anxiety. University employees and their families are also facing challenges as facilities are scattered and infected people are increasing every day.”She had also requested a vaccination centre and a testing centre on the campus. “We also request you to set up a vaccination centre (Covishield) (currently there is no vaccination centre in the North Campus) and testing centre in the college for the university teaching and non-teaching staff,” she wrote.“We have opened this RT-PCR testing centre in collaboration with a private company. There was no testing centre on the DU’s North Campus until now. The centre also provides home collection service to the university staff and test reports will be given within 24 hours,” Sharma said.“We also want to start a vaccination centre and a 100-bed covid care facility on the college campus as soon as possible. We are ready with 100 beds and if the government provides us with the resources we can set up a proper Covid-19 care centre,” the principal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-testing-centre-set-up-at-du-s-hansraj-college-101620849346481.html
13-05-2021||Other||HC says high time to fix MRP of oxygen concentrators, summons all booked for hoarding to attend virtual hearing||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday told the Centre that it was “high time” to fix maximum retail price (MRP) of oxygen concentrators and other equipment used for the treatment of Covid-19 patients to stem out alleged malpractices such as hoarding and black marketing.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also issued contempt notice to every person, including businessman Navneet Kalra, named in over 50 FIRs lodged between May 2 to May 8 in cases of alleged hoarding and black marketing, and directed them to appear before the court virtually on May 19. The bench said the notices will be served to the people named in the FIRs through the station house officers (SHOs) of the police stations where the cases are registered.The court directed that the notices will also be sent to individuals whose name were added to the FIR during the course of investigation.“We direct issuance of court notice to all accused in said cases...This should be served to SHO of local police stations concerned where cases are registered… Issue notice to accused name in FIR and those added as accused in course of investigation…,” the court said in its oral order.The discussion on the price of the oxygen concentrators began after advocate Sanjeev Sagar, counsel for one of the petitioners, Manish Chauhan, said public prosecutors and judicial officers were unaware of the May 2 order of the bench. Chauhan, a resident of Delhi, was seeking court’s directions to the government to declare medicines and medical equipment meant for Covid treatment as essential items under the Essential Commodities Act. Sagar told the court that a trial court has said that offences cannot be “made up” against such individuals and the option was to book them for contempt of court if they are selling medicines or equipment at exorbitant rates.The bench was shown media reports which said that the concerned trial court, while hearing the anticipatory bail filed by restaurateur Kalra, in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his restaurants, said that first a law has to be made to regulate prices, and people cannot be penalised in a hurry because the high court wanted steps to be taken.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao said the trial court cannot be blamed since a price cap has not yet been fixed for a majority of the imported equipment, and the central government has to inform the high court what steps it has taken.Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan told the court that the issue was under consideration, and sought time to inform the bench as to what decision has been taken. He assured that a decision will be taken soon.The court asked Sagar to prepare a note on fixing prices, for informing public prosecutors and judicial officers in the subordinate courts, and said it will be circulated by the Delhi government.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who, along with several hospitals, sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.The notices to those named in the FIR were issued in accordance with a May 2 order of the bench in which it warned of contempt action against all those indulging in hoarding of medical equipment or medicines, or selling them at prices above MRP. It said that the issue of fixing the price for the oxygen concentrators and other equipment has been pending with the Centre since June 2020, but no concrete decision has been taken so far. “It is high time that MRP for oxygen concentrators and all other equipment for the treatment of Covid is fixed so malpractices are immediately stemmed,” the bench said.The matter will be now heard on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcsays-high-time-to-fix-mrp-of-oxygen-concentrators-summons-all-booked-for-hoarding-to-attend-virtual-hearing-101620849345921.html

13-05-2021||Delhi||4 men, trained by Jamtara gangs, held for duping Covid-19 patients||The police have arrested four men who were allegedly trained in cyber crime by gangs of Jamtara, Jharkhand, and used to cheat Covid-19 patients and/or relatives in Delhi-NCR of money after promising them oxygen cylinders. Delhi Police said while six cases that were reported from Delhi have been solved.The accused have been identified as 19-year-old Ritik Singh, Yogesh Singh, 23-year-old Mohammad Arzoo and 24-year-old Ravish Abiram. Police have recovered six mobile phones, 14 SIM cards, a laptop, three two-wheelers, and multiple ATM cards, PAN cards and credit cards from these men.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said on May 3, police received a complaint from a Karol Bagh resident, Kshitij Mehra, who said he had contacted on a phone number to enquire about an oxygen cylinder for his friend who was a Covid-19 patient.“Mishra said the man who answered the call introduced himself as Ritik Singh and demanded payment for the cylinder. Mishra paid him ₹47, 500 in several online payments after which the man was not reachable on phone. Once we got the complaint, we investigated the money trail, found the bank accounts and SIM cards used in the fraud and zeroed in on Ritik Singh. Subsequently, a search was conducted in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, and the suspect was arrested last Friday,” the DCP said.Singh said following Ritik’s arrest, his accomplices Yogesh, Arzoo and mastermind Ravish were all arrested on Monday.“During further investigation, Ravish told police that he had undergone training in cyber fraud in Jamtara, Jharkhand, and he had learnt different techniques to dupe people. He admitted that they used to get innocent men and women to open bank accounts by offering them a fixed salary every month. The mobile phone used to cheat people and the credit and debit cards used to withdraw the amount from the said accounts were also recovered from the possession of the arrested men,” the DCP said.He said police have so far worked out six cases of cheating reported from Karol Bagh, Hauz Khas, Najafgarh, Kalkaji, Uttam Nagar and Kotla Mubarakpur in Delhi. “Further probe to nab the remaining members of the gang is underway,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-cybercrime-trained-con-men-held-for-online-fraud-in-guise-of-supplying-oxygen-cylinders-101620849286553.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt partially opens the 500-bed ICU facility at Ramilia Grounds in east Delhi||The Delhi government on Wednesday partially opened a new 500-bed intensive care facility near Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in east Delhi. “Today (Wednesday), nearly five patients were admitted to the ICU facility created at the Ramlila ground near GTB hospital. All 500 ICU beds have not been opened yet. We have started with nearly 100 beds for now since the requirement has marginally declined in recent days,” said a senior official, asking not to be named. Explaining the admission process, a second health official said patients cannot approach the facility directly to get an admission. “Since this is a critical care centre or an ICU centre, admissions will be permitted only if the patient is referred here by the GTB hospital, to which this centre is attached. So, a person requiring treatment need to first go to the GTB hospital and doctors there will have to send them here,” the official said. The temporary facility is fully air-conditioned, has oxygen generation plants and free Wi-Fi for patients. A senior official of the public works department (PWD), which built the facility, said the centre was created in a record time of 10 days. A similar facility is being created at the main Ramlila Ground near Lok Nayak hospital. This will also have 500 ICU beds and will be ready in a day or two, the first official quoted above said. On April 27, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced the setting up of these two intensive care facilities at the Ramlila grounds in central Delhi and east Delhi as well as adding 200 ICU beds at the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre. He had said the state would have an additional 1,200 beds for Covid treatment by May 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-partially-opens-the-500-bed-icu-facility-at-ramilia-grounds-in-east-delhi-101620849285908.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi government likely to announce cap on prices of oxygen cylinders||The Delhi government is planning to cap the prices of oxygen cylinders in the Capital and has increased the number of procurement points for the public from 14 to at least 94, senior officials said on Wednesday.“We are actively considering capping the prices of oxygen cylinders. On Tuesday, we held a meeting with all dealers, refillers and district magistrates to discuss the issue. A decision will be taken soon,” said Ashish Kundra, Delhi transport commissioner and officer-on-special duty (health).A senior official on condition, who asked not to be named, said that during Tuesday’s meeting, retailers said the rate for D-type cylinders should be capped at around ₹700 a unit, while the rate for re-fillers should be ₹350. The cost of a B-type cylinder, retailers said, should be around ₹250. The final rates are yet to be fixed, the official said.Oxygen cylinders are categorised as types A to H, depending on their size and capacity, with A being the smallest. The B-type cylinders are usually used by individual patients, while D-type cylinders are used by hospitals in manifold rooms connected to the hospital’s main gas pipeline.On average, Delhi has been receiving 579.25 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen a day from the Centre, of which 42% is being supplied by the railways and 58% is coming through roadways, state government data showed.The decentralised pool of refill points should also ease the city’s oxygen bottlenecks, said officials.Until recently, officials said, small hospitals, ambulances, as well as families of Covid-19 patients in home isolation, were queueing at these 14 refill points, resulting in waits of eight or 10 hours in many instances.“This has been decentralised to some extent now with the central pool of cylinders, to which we have given all district magistrates access. To make cylinders more accessible to patients, we have also identified at least 80 dealers or retailers who will be issued licenses to sell cylinders. So, with these 80 dealers along and 14 refillers, we will have a network of at least 94 authorised points where people can get oxygen cylinders,” Kundra said.All these 94 points have been linked to the government’s online oxygen portal.A Bawana-based dealer whose name and number were recently linked to the government portal said, “On May 10, we got permission to refill oxygen cylinders. We are asking for the IDs of the patient and the person who has come to refill the cylinder, along with a doctor’s prescription.”Another dealer, who asked not to be named, said, “We have been getting calls from people for oxygen supply ever since our name was put up on the website, but we can’t help them, because we are not getting oxygen supply.”But V Ashok, another dealer listed on the portal, said, “We are providing empty oxygen cylinders to people right now, because we do not have clarity about oxygen supply. So, we are guiding those who come to us to the nearest oxygen refilling plant. I hope the government gives some clarity on whether these dealers are allowed to refill cylinders and sell them in their stores.”The senior official quoted above said the government is getting in touch with all dealers, giving them the licenses and clearances necessary and explaining the process to them.“The dealers will have to get cylinders, refill them and sell them. They can include the transportation costs and minor profit margin. The government will soon cap the prices of these medical goods,” said the official.Residents on Wednesday pointed out that the oxygen cylinder booking portal that was announced by the Delhi government a week ago has not yet been made fully operational.The “online booking for refilling of oxygen cylinder-Delhi government-corona relief” link, which was put up on the Delhi government’s portal on May 6, was replaced with “Oxygen cylinder near you” a few days back, which provides the list of 94 oxygen dealers/depots along with their address and contact numbers.Satyajit Vaish, President of Manav Vikas Society and a resident of Panchsheel Park who has been helping people in home isolation arrange oxygen cylinders, said, “Most of these dealers don’t answer the phone. They can’t provide or refill an oxygen cylinder. One has to go to the authorised refilling plants. The government must provide at least one dealer in each assembly constituency where people can get the cylinders refilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-government-likely-to-announce-cap-on-prices-of-oxygen-cylinders-101620849225938.html
13-05-2021||Other||Cameroonian resident held for duping 40 people of ₹9 lakh||New Delhi: In a first known case of alleged involvement of foreigners in a Covid-related scam in Delhi, a woman from Cameroon, along with her boyfriend, duped more than 40 Covid-19 patients and their family members of nearly ₹9 lakh on the pretext of offering remdesivir injections, said police on Wednesday.Remdesivir is a key anti-viral drug used in the treatment of Covid-19 and is currently in high demand in the national capital due to the unprecedented surge in infections. While the woman, Ashwingwo Ashelly Azenmbuh , has been arrested from a rented flat in south Delhi’s Devli Khanpur, her boyfriend, Elumara Christian alias Emeka from Nigeria, is on the run. A total of 12 bank accounts that the couple had been operating in Delhi and other states were identified and blocked, said police. Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the couple had uploaded details of a fake company “Global Suppliers”, along with a cellphone number, on social media. They introduced themselves as supplier of remdesivir injections. The Covid patients or their relatives who contacted them were asked to deposit an advance in bank accounts for the delivery of the injections, said Singh.“The suspects withdrew the money within minutes of the patients and their family members depositing the money in their bank accounts and thereafter, avoided receiving their calls. They even blocked the callers who paid the advance. The couple has cheated about 40 people across India on the pretext of providing remdesivir injections,” said the DCP adding that so far, they have identified 23 victims who were (collectively) cheated of nearly ₹7.5 lakh. Police said that on May 5, one Rakhi Gupta from Rohini filed a complaint alleging that she was duped of ₹25,000 that she paid to obtain five vials of remdesivir injection needed for her Covid-positive relative. Gupta said since the injections were not available with chemist and pharmacy shops, she started looking for possible leads on social media from where she got the number of a supplier, said police. “Gupta contacted the person, who asked her to provide with the prescription slip of the patient and demanded ₹5,000 for each injection. The person tricked her into depositing ₹25,000 in a bank account. Thereafter, the person neither delivered the injections nor refunded the money. A case of cheating was registered on Gupta’s complaint,” said Singh.Through technical surveillance and intelligence gathering, the police traced the suspects to a flat in Devli Khanpur in south Delhi. It was learnt that a couple from African origin lived in the flat. A police team went to the area after receiving information that the suspected woman was in the house on the night of May 8. The team members waited the entire night for the male suspect but he did not turn up.“On the morning of May 9, the team raided the flat and arrested the woman. Our teams are taking efforts to nab her boyfriend who is on the run,” said Singh. The police said that 10 SIM cards, five cellphones and two wi-fi hotspot devices that were being used for the crimes were seized from the flat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cameroonian-resident-held-for-duping-40-people-of-9-lakh-101620849166480.html
13-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools get nod to upload Class 10 marks by June 20||The education department on Tuesday allowed Delhi government schools to upload the tabulated marks of Class 10 students, based on internal assessments, by June 20 if their teachers are engaged in Covid duties. Earlier this month, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had said the results will be declared by June 20.The education department’s decision comes a week after the Delhi government schools asked the CBSE to review its timeline for the declaration of Class 10 results. In a notification released on May 1, the CBSE said schools will have to conduct pending assessments, if any, by May 15 through telephone calls or other modes, finalize results by May 25, check and moderate marks by May 28 and submit marks to the CBSE by June 5.On May 4, HT had reported how teachers and principals of various Delhi government schools said it may be difficult to adhere to the CBSE timeline since teachers were engaged in Covid duties such as door-to-door survey in hotspots, assistance in contact tracing and testing, screening at the airport and in vaccination-related activities.Last week, the Delhi government had written to the national board asking them to review the timeline. A senior official of the education department said, “The board informed us we can have internal flexibility. This is why we asked schools to upload the marks by June 20. Based on their situation and available resources, schools can decide when to carry out the particular tasks within the stipulated time-frame.”On Tuesday, additional director of education (exam) Rita Sharma asked government schools to stick to the CBSE schedule “as far as possible”, allowing an extension to only those schools which are struggling with resources. Sharma asked schools to submit marks by June 20 and gave them the autonomy to manage the timeline as per their “conditions and circumstances.”“Keeping in view the high number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the lockdown that has restricted the movement of teachers, and deployment of teachers for various Covid duties, the last date for uploading the marks of internal assessment (out of 20 marks) and year-end exam (out of 80 marks) on the CBSE portal may be relaxed up to 20th June, 2021,” read the circular from Sharma.Schools requiring further extension beyond June 20 can also reach out to the education department. “For such special cases for further extension of time schedule, the concerned Head of School may put up their case to Exam Branch through Deputy Director Education (District) by 18 June, 2021. The Exam branch will take up the case of such schools with CBSE for its results to be either withheld or to be declared separately by CBSE,” read the circular.Out of the 100 marks for each subject, 20 marks are for internal assessment, which has already been tabulated by the schools as per existing policy, and the remaining 80 marks are for the year-end board examinations. Due to the cancellation of exams, the board has announced that this 80-mark component will be calculated on the basis of different internal exams including unit tests, mid-terms and pre-board exams.However, the director of education on Tuesday has asked schools to calculate the 80-mark component on the basis of pre-board exams as many schools were not able to complete mid-term tests.“If any student has not appeared in any one or more than one subject(s) of the Pre Board Examinations 2021…the school may conduct one-to-one assessment of such students telephonically as per guidelines of the CBSE,” the circular read.CBSE officials did not respond to calls and messages for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-schools-get-nod-to-upload-class-10-marks-by-june-20-101620849165885.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Nearly 40% of PM Cares ventilators faulty or pending installation in Punjab||Nearly 40% of ventilators received under the PM Cares Fund in Punjab are either faulty or pending installation due to non-compatibility with equipment in state hospitals. Managing director, Punjab Health Systems Corporation, Tanu Kashyap said all 809 ventilators received through the Central scheme have been distributed. “Of these, 174 are non-functional, while 136 are yet to be installed,” she said. The state government had earlier this month flagged the issue of defective ventilators received under the scheme and urged the Centre to direct the company to repair the faulty lifesaving machines. On Wednesday, it was found that of the 80 ventilators received under the scheme at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, 71 were defective. According to official information, 47 of the 59 ventilators at Government Medical College, Amritsar, and 50 at the Government Medical College, Patiala, were also non-functional. Earlier this month, Punjab health secretary Hussan Lal had written to joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare Dr Mandeep Kumar Bhandari saying that there are complaints of malfunctioning in ventilators.The health secretary said they raised the issue of defective ventilators with central authorities during video conference and through a letter in first week of May. “During the meeting, some other states also raised similar issues with the ventilators delivered under PM Cares Fund. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has been entrusted the work of installation and maintenance of ventilators. The company further appointed another firm, TBS, for the purpose. The private company do not have enough manpower due to which there is delay installation and repair. A team engineers visited the Faridkot medical college on Wednesday to repair ventilators. But these machines are not compatible with other equipment installed at the hospitals across the state, so we are facing difficulty to make them functional,” he saidIn April, the Union health ministry had asked Punjab to install all 809 ventilators supplied under PM Cares Fund. The Union health secretary had said that of the total ventilators, only 558 have been installed while 251 are still pending installation. “Non-commissioning of ventilators defeats the very purpose of this exercise by the government of India. There is a need for taking urgent steps to complete the installation of the ventilators for management of Covid pandemic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nearly-40-of-pm-cares-ventilators-faulty-or-pending-installation-in-punjab-101620849106504.html

While the police is coming down hard on all shops dealing with non-essential wares, including groceries, after noon, the liquor vends,which can be seen operating till late night, are somehow escaping their scanner.The vends draw their shutters in suit with other businesses at the start of curfew but the employees stay inside. Customers slip the money through the hole carved in the shutter and the salesperson pushes out bottles through the same cavity.Not sure what to purchase? No problem. Some liquor vends also allow customers to enter the shop through the back door and peruse the shelves. For the booze lovers unwilling to risk arrest, some liquor vendors are also offering home delivery.In order to evade the men in khaki, some ingenious liquor vendors have deployed lookouts to alert them should policemen on patrol be in the vicinity.Such illicit sale was observed on Ferozepur Road, near Barewal Road, outside the Railway station, Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) Chowk, Shingar Cinema Road, Samrala Chowk, Janakpuri Chowk, Sufiyan Bagh Chowk, Old Jail Road, Amarpura and Transport Nagar.The light pouring out of the hole in the shutter indicates the outlet is open for business. At CMCH Chowk, it was observed that a liquor vend was conducting business with impunity after curfew, even as a police team deputed on the site turned a blind eye to the establishment.A policeman deputed near Sufiyan Chowk could be seen peeping through the hole and asking the salesman to switched off the lights.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said that sale of liquor had been banned during curfew hours, but some business owners were violating the directions. “FIRs are being lodged daily. We will ask the excise department to cancel license of those violating the curfew,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grocery-shops-may-close-at-noon-but-you-ll-get-booze-24x7-in-ludhiana-101620848986563.html

13-05-2021||Delhi||‘High time’ to fix rates of O2 machines: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Wednesday told the Centre it was “high time” to fix the maximum retail prices (MRP) of oxygen concentrators and other equipment used for the treatment of Covid-19 to stem out alleged malpractices such as hoarding and black marketing.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also issued contempt notice to every person, including businessman Navneet Kalra, named in over 50 FIRs lodged between May 2 to May 8 in cases of alleged hoarding and black marketing, and directed them to appear before the court virtually on May 19.The bench said the notices will be served to the people named in the FIRs through the station house officers (SHOs) of the police stations where the cases are registered.The court directed the notices be sent to individuals whose name were added to the FIR during the course of investigation.“We direct issuance of court notice to all accused in said cases...This should be served to SHO of local police stations concerned where cases are registered… Issue notice to accused name in FIR and those added as accused in course of investigation…,” the court said in its oral order.The discussion on the price of the oxygen concentrators began after advocate Sanjeev Sagar, counsel for one of the petitioners, Manish Chauhan, said public prosecutors and judicial officers were unaware of the May 2 order of the bench. Chauhan, a resident of Delhi, was seeking court’s directions to the government to declare medicines and medical equipment meant for Covid treatment as essential items under the Essential Commodities Act.Sagar told the court that a trial court has said that offences cannot be “made up” against such individuals and the option was to book them for contempt of court if they are selling medicines or equipment at exorbitant rates.The bench was shown media reports which said that the concerned trial court, while hearing the anticipatory bail filed by restaurateur Kalra, in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his restaurants, said that first a law has to be made to regulate prices, and people cannot be penalised in a hurry because the high court wanted steps to be taken.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao said the trial court cannot be blamed since a price cap has not yet been fixed for a majority of the imported equipment, and the central government has to inform the high court what steps it has taken.Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan told the court the issue was under consideration, and sought time to inform the bench on the decision taken. He assured that a decision will be taken soon.The court asked Sagar to prepare a note on fixing prices, for informing public prosecutors and judicial officers in the subordinate courts, and said it will be circulated by the Delhi government.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who, along with several hospitals, sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in hospitals and nursing homes.The notices to those named in the FIR were issued in accordance with a May 2 order of the bench in which it warned of contempt action against all those indulging in hoarding of medical equipment or medicines, or selling them at prices above MRP.The matter will now be heard on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-time-to-fix-rates-of-o2-machines-delhi-hc-101620847629084.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra suspends vaccination drive for 18-44 age group||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to temporarily suspend the vaccination drive for the 18-44 years category and divert the vaccines that it purchased for that age group to provide second doses for those above 45, due to a shortage of available doses required to curb the spread of Covid-19. Following a state cabinet meeting on Wednesday, health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government would divert the stock it has purchased for inoculation of people between 18 and 44 to ensure that those who require their second dose get it on time. “The government has decided to temporarily suspend the vaccination of 18-44 category. The Centre is unable to provide second doses for the national programme to vaccinate people above age 45. There is a due date to these doses and therefore it is essential to give the second dose in time. Therefore, whatever stock Maharashtra government has purchased for 18-44 category, will now be diverted for vaccination of over 45,” Tope said. He added that people should not “expect” their first dose as providing second dose to the people has become the state’s priority now. The recommended time period between the first and second doses of Covaxin and Covishield is between 28 days and 42 days in the case of the former, and 42 to 56 days in the case of the latter. The third phase of the national vaccination drive permitted states to procure vaccines for 18-44 year olds directly from the manufacturer, while the Centre would continue to procure and distribute vaccines to states for the 45 years and above age group, health care workers, frontline workers and other priority groups. At least 350,000 vaccines were bought by the state government for the 18-44 years category, whose vaccination was permitted by the Centre starting May 1. As of May 12, around 1 million vaccines were available from the stock of both the categories. The Centre’s supply to the states comes in every five to seven days: the last batch of vaccines arrived on May 9. More than 2 million people are due for their second doses, government estimates showed. “We have 1 million doses available with us, including 700,000 Covishield and 300,000 Covaxin. The vaccines that the Centre provides in the next two-three days, will be used for second doses only. For now, do not expect first dose, as we have to finish the second doses of people. We will take a decision [to restart] based on the availability after five to seven days,” Tope said. The state cabinet also decided that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi explaining to him the vaccination situation in the state. The vaccination drive in Maharashtra has been marred with lack of vaccines though the state tops the country with highest vaccination count with 18.8 million doses till May 11. Of these, 3.6 million belong to the priority categories. The state has inoculated 596,091 people in the third phase of the vaccination drive till May 11. Around 90 million people are eligible for the vaccine in Maharashtra. A senior health department official said that the state has been “aggressive” on the vaccination drive as it is the only way to arrest the magnitude of possible third wave. “Since the beginning, Maharashtra did not get enough doses. We have shown our capabilities to vaccinate 450,000 and 500,000 people in a day. But the inflow has been slow and fewer. We need around 1.5 million or 2 million doses weekly to go at a good pace. State has been aggressive in immunisation plan. Even when we did not have adequate doses, chief minister insisted that we should start the drive, as part of the preparation for the third wave,” the official requesting anonymity said. Tope said that Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, informed the chief minister that it would provide 1.5 million doses per month after May 20. “After that supply starts, we can then take a decision to restart 18-44 category’s vaccination. For now, our priority remains giving second dose for people over 45,” the minister added. Among those eligible for the second dose, 1.6 million are for Covishield and 400,000 for Covaxin. The health minister reiterated that the state government is unable to plan for the vaccination of 18-44 category as there are only two vaccine manufacturers in the country and the Centre is not giving its approval to allow import of foreign vaccines. Tope said that they discussed floating global tenders for foreign vaccines but are stuck due to Centre’s clearance. “Many in the cabinet have asked to include vaccines in the global tenders. But first the Centre has to give permission for these vaccines including, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson. Besides that, the cold chain has to be readied as these vaccines have to be kept in sub-zero temperatures, unlike our [Indian] vaccines which are between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. If the Centre gives its approval, the state government has no hurdles to go in for global tenders for vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-suspends-vaccination-drive-for-18-44-age-group-101620847786837.html

The innovative drug has been granted patent and licence.“The antiseptic was able to heal even bad wounds of dogs after application,” says Dr Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor, GADVASU.He revealed that owing to the initial success of Sepil in chronic non-healing human wounds, we started using it on animals at the veterinary hospital here.Clinicians noticed up to 80% healing of wounds within six days among dogs.The V-C said one could barely recognise that there ever was a wound at the site after the application of Sepil along with the initial use of systemic antibiotics for five days.“The filling of the void created by the bite, no scarring and the normal hair appearance in the follow up were clearly visible. With this herbal formulation, debridement surgeries can be avoided. Moreover, pet owners can skip physical visits to the vet amid the Covid pandemic. They can apply Sepil at home and need not come to the hospital for dressing, debridement etc,” said the V-C.“The results have been encouraging with quick healing and good rejuvenation of around 5X2 cm deep wounds,” said Dr Navdeep Singh, head of veterinary surgery department at GADVASU.He stated that testing was going on in more animals and soon concrete data would be compiled.Sepil is likely to be the much-awaited solution for non-healing wounds, said Prof Vikas Gautam, the inventor of this formulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pgimers-herbal-antiseptic-working-wonders-on-animal-wounds-too-101620847607269.html

Complainants claimed that they lost money after making calls on such numbers.He said that fraudsters have made fake websites and displayed contact numbers on them. When someone searches for a customer care or helpline number, the search engine throws up these numbers in the search results too. Upon calling these numbers, the scammers posing as customer care executives, seek personal details of the callers and steal money from their bank accounts.The SI appealed to the residents to never share their bank details with anyone. In the event of being duped, they should immediately contact the cyber cell and lodge a complaint, he said.He also advised people to visit only the authorised websites of companies or banks concerned to get the customer care numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-search-for-helpline-numbers-on-google-cautions-ludhiana-cyber-cell-101620847606220.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Surge in mucormycosis cases: Maharashtra sets up task force||In view of a three to four times surge in mucormycosis or black fungal infection amid increase in recovered Covid-19 patients in the ongoing second wave, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created an internal advisory board consisting of head of the department of ENT, ophthalmology, medicine, anaesthesia from various medical colleges in the city. Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said the state public health department has formed a separate task force to look into the matter of mucormycosis in the state. Since February, five major government and civic-run hospitals have recorded 151 cases of mucormycosis in recovered Covid-19 patients. Mucormycosis is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of mould called mucormycetes. It causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death if not treated on time, said doctors.“The board will investigate each case like probable source of infection, line of treatment if the patient needs infection or debridation (medical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue), procurement of the medicines and post-recovery treatment,” said Kakani.“In Covid-19 patients, immunity gets compromised due to some medicines like Tocilizumab and steroids. When they get exposed to mucor mould, which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables, it becomes life threatening. It affects sinuses, brain and lungs,” said Dr Girija Suresh, senior ophthalmic consultant, Fortis Hospital, Mulund. Surge in cases in second waveThough no cumulative data is available for last year, doctors from both private and government hospitals have witnessed a drastic rise in mucormycosis cases in the second wave which started in February. At Fortis Hospital, doctors have observed a three-time rise in cases. Similarly, Dr Amol Patil, senior consultant, ENT and skull-base surgery at Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, said while they treated five patients with mucormycosis last year, the number of cases since February this year has increased to around 15. “Most patients are within the age group of 30-50 years who came with sinus infection. In patients with advanced infection, we observed eye involvement causing vision loss and spread of the infection to the brain, with life-threatening sequelae (secondary infection). We are seeing more cases now as compared to last year, but we need thorough clinical studies to fully understand the reasons,” said Dr Patil.Of the 151 mucormycosis cases recorded in the second wave in the city, King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital also known as Sion hospital, BYL Nair, Sir JJ Hospital and RN Cooper Hospital have recorded 34, 32, 38, 40 and seven cases, respectively. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital, said they were receiving one or two cases per month in the first wave of the pandemic which has now increased to seven to eight per month. Doctors believe the actual number could be higher. Dr Ajay Doiphode, president, Association of Otolaryngologists (AOI) Mumbai Branch and Mumbai ENT Association, said there is no proper system of data collection, and therefore many cases may have gone undocumented.Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs of Covid patients, but it also reduces the immunity and increases the blood sugar levels. Dr Doiphode attributed unregulated usages of steroids that lower immunity as one of the primary reasons for the surge in cases. “When ICMR declared that steroids are helpful in the treatment of Covid-19, doctors blindly started prescribing the steroids. Patients with mild symptoms who took treatment at home are given steroids. This unregulated usage needs to be stopped,” he said. Prevention better than cureWith early detection of cases, a patient’s organs and tissues can be saved from getting surgically removed. A patient in his early stage of infection can be treated with anti-fungal injections such as Liposomal Amphotericin B injection. Dr Doiphode said, “The doses depend on the weight of the patient. Per kilogram, we administer 5mg. But in more serious cases, we increase it further. We also have another anti-fungal medicine, Posaconazole, which is given post recovery.” With this, doctors also need to monitor the kidney. But if a patient is detected at a later stage, doctors have to debride the infected tissues and organs. At Sion hospital, 11 patients have lost their eyes and six of them succumbed to the infection, as per Dr Renuka Bradoo, head of the hospital’s ENT department. “Most of the patients were middle aged with the medical history of diabetes,” she added.With the rise in the cases, the city is witnessing a shortage of Liposomal Amphotericin B injection. As per doctors, each patient needs five to six injections per day. Dr Bharmal said BMC has floated a tender to procure 190,000 of the life-saving injection and 38,000 Posaconazole tablets. “They need to fasten the procurement process or else, more patients will die,” said Dr Doiphode.Patients suffering from the fungal infection normally have stuffy nose. Sometimes, blood may ooze out of the nose. They might have swelling and pain in the eye along with drooping of eyelids and blurred eye vision. There could be black patches of skin around the nose.Dr Suresh said the only way to reduce the possibility of fungal infection is to administer right doses of steroids. “The patients, even after recovery, should follow up with doctors. It is also important to maintain hygiene after getting discharged from hospitals,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/surge-in-mucormycosis-cases-maharashtra-sets-up-task-force-101620847547755.html

The court noted, “While news reports said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to politicians not to organise such events, it is still happening….even the leader/minister is a super spreader...There seems to be no action. What is this politicians-police nexus?” In its order, the bench noted, “We are pained to note that the minister was physically holding ceremonies in his constituency. The newspaper also states the minister had violated diktats of the chief minister, who had asked his own ministers and leaders not to hold ceremonies physically.”“We would refrain from drawing conclusions at this stage, but we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the minister gave consent to these functions and has physically attended them, and photographs indicated that most of the time the mask was on his chin or did not even wear a mask at times,” observed the bench. Adding that everyone needed to discipline themselves, the court said, “We all should obey law and lockdown restrictions. None of these orders or restrictions is being followed by these politicians.” Suggesting that such events could be held virtually, the bench noted, “Do we not realise that citizens gather in large numbers when people’s representatives make physical appearance for the inauguration ceremony? Is it that lockdown restrictions and orders passed by court in the interest of public health are meant only for the poor while politicians are above law? The bench also noted that the case lodged in light of the event excluded the minister from the list of accused. The bench will hear the suo motu PIL and address the other issues related to Covid-19 management on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-irked-at-shiv-sena-minister-for-gathering-at-inauguration-101620846527341.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Most schools conducted WhatsApp-based assessments for Class 8 to 10: Survey||Majority of the schools in Maharashtra have conducted assessments for Class 8 to Class 10 on WhatsApp, data shared by the state education department has revealed. The second-most widely used method of conducting assessments was online tests, as per the survey findings.Schools that used WhatAapp-based assessments either used a set of questions pre-set by them which were sent to students through a link on the social messaging app or asked students to answer questions on the app either in the text format or by sending scanned images of solved papers. The Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) had asked schools across the 36 districts in the state to report on the various methods used throughout the pandemic period to assess students of higher grades. The survey was based on figures that schools reported themselves with the help of the portal created by the education department. Schools were asked as to which method/s they used to assess students while schools remained shut all of last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown. The methods included WhatsApp-based assessments, online tests, online sessions, offline tests, home visits, with the help of workbooks and other means. Schools could record one or more than one method used by them. A total of 12,931 schools reported their assessment methods, of which 12,298 said they used WhatsApp-based assessment. In Mumbai, too, the most popular format remained WhatsApp-based assessments with 731 schools using the method.Schools in several parts of the state took offline sessions between November and April as the government permitted reopening of schools in places where Covid-19 cases were low or non-existent. The survey revealed that 9,930 schools conducted offline assessments of students. Similarly, around 7,352 conducted assessments through home visits.While the data does not give the full picture, as only about 50% of the total schools in the state provided their input, it is now being studied as a representative sample by officials to gauge the formula for internal assessments for Class 10 students. With the cancellation of SSC exams, the education department is now mulling over options to mark around 1.7 million students in the state. Teachers, however, said the department will have to be careful while considering WhatsApp-based assessments. “We do not know the validity of these assignments because there is no consistent format. Achieving equivalence will be a challenge,” said a teacher from a suburban school.BOX: MaharashtraTotal schools surveyed: 12,931WhatsApp assessments 12,298Online test 9,758Online session 8,401Offline test 9,930House visit test 7,352Workbook 8,402Other 3,643MumbaiTotal schools surveyed: 800WhatsApp assessments 749Online test 731Online session 724Offline test 614House visit test 325Workbook 591Other 402||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-schools-conducted-whatsapp-based-assessments-for-class-8-to-10-survey-101620846526161.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 hit aviation sector hard, domestic passenger footfall at lowest in decade||The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the domestic passenger traffic across the country to a decadal low, even as daily flights from Mumbai are currently down to numbers seen during the first wave in May and June 2020. Domestic traffic in the financial year ending March 2021 was 53.4 million passengers, the lowest since 2010-11 when domestic air operators flew 53.8 million passengers on national routes. “We were seeing 650 flight movements until April as the traffic had started to pick in both domestic and international sectors. However, due to the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in the country we have gone back to May-June’s traffic last year and are handling just around 200-250 flights daily,” a Mumbai airport official said, on condition of anonymity. By comparison, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International airport Mumbai handled an average 950 daily flights even as recently as 2019 before the pandemic hit. The domestic traffic in 2019-20 was 274.50 million, as per data made available by rating agency ICRA. The sector was showing signs of recovery as airlines clocked around 60-70% seat occupancy by the end of 2020, after all flights were stopped in March at the start of the pandemic, and domestic flights were allowed to resume only after two months. However, figures provided by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) show that domestic traffic in February 2021 registered a mere 1% growth over January, with the capacity (number of flights deployed by the airlines) static at 71% in both months. In April, domestic air traffic declined by 29% from March, while there was a 15% fall in capacity between the two months. “The first half of this fiscal will be a washout. Till there is a very aggressive focus on vaccination, job losses are inevitable as demand is frozen with nearly 400 plus aircraft on ground in the first quarter,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), India, an aviation advisory and research think tank. Part of the reason for the depressed numbers is the continued ban on international flights, which began in March last year and was recently extended to May 31. However, starting April 2020, cargo and DGCA approved flights began to take off. Nevertheless, international traffic has declined by over 90% due to the absence of regular overseas flights. India made bilateral air bubble arrangements with 28 countries, although recently some countries like Hong Kong and Australia announced restrictions on flights to India after a surge in cases was reported from here. Maharashtra’s case trajectory began to register a surge starting February, and by March-end, it contributed to as much as 60% of the country’s caseload and continued to remain the most affected state in the country till April-end, Union health ministry figures pointed out. When flights were allowed again on May 24, the average load factor (the total seat occupied in an aircraft) was 5%, which gradually increased to 60% -70% by October-November. This year too, passengers are wary of flying, which has forced airlines to cancel flights across the country: most airlines have dropped pre-March schedules by almost 40%-50%. SALARY CUTS, JOB LOSSES “Pre-Covid we were on average flying around 70-80 hours per month which came down to zero for a brief moment and then reached about 50 hours around July to September last year. We have not reached the same hours as pre-Covid till now,” said one pilot from Indigo airlines, requesting not to be named. The pilot, with about eight years of experience with three airlines, said that there were two main reasons for reduction in hours: fewer passengers leading to cancellation of flights and a high number of pilots and crew getting infected with Covid-19. This pilot also contracted the disease last month. “Airlines fear that people will neither travel for leisure nor for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions in 2021. They believe that new virus strains, quarantine rules prevalent in states across the country and other factors will have an impact on the industry. The most important quarter for the domestic market is the first quarter, and in 2021, this seems to be a wash out already. But it’s better than last year where operations were shut for two straight months,” said Praveen Iyer, a former senior executive from Jet Airways. The current fiscal will witness a loss, he said. “All airlines except Indigo will struggle to manage their cash position. As far as employees are concerned, the worst is over. Lay-offs are doubtful, but salary (including incentives/ allowances) cuts that are already in effect may continue,” Iyer said. With deeper pockets than its competitors, Indigo has retained most of its pilots even though there was a cut of around 10% in each department. In May last year, the company made a salary cut of 15% and then there were 10 days per month without pay till November which took the proportion of the cut to almost 45%. However, in November, the company stopped sending its personnel on 10 days a month without pay but increased the salary cut to 28% which remains in force till this day. SpiceJet air crew members floated an online petition a day after the low-cost carrier slashed salaries up to 50% in April for all employees. In the petition, the signatories claimed that many were also underpaid as they worked through the pandemic. Earlier this month, the CEO of GoAir wrote to the employees stating that the plan to restructure their pay was on hold due to the surge in cases, which has “impacted overall operations and reduced flying capacity,” a report in the Hindu BusinessLine newspaper stated. However, experts said that if the current situation persists, more job losses are imminent in the aviation industry. “Most of us had restarted recruitment with the improvement seen in the last four months,” said Murali Ramachandran, chief executive officer of Celebi Aviation Holding, India, a ground handling agency. “It is (job losses) already happening and will continue to happen for the next several months, because it’ll take a while for air travel to come back again. But again, just like the last time, the stronger airlines continue to take a very different approach to their employees compared to the less efficient airlines and I expect to see that differentiation to continue,” a former top airline executive, who has worked for both international and domestic airlines, said. RECOVERY TARGETS “We don’t have uniform rules related to international resumption beyond bubbles as yet and it may take longer to bring it into place,” Kaul said. International traffic is expected to be back to pre-Covid times by 2023-24, he said. Other experts Hindustan Times spoke to also proffered a similar timeframe for recovery: the second half of 2022 for domestic traffic, and longer for international travel. The airline executive quoted above explained that this would be so because of the differential vaccination regimes of different countries. “I think we’ll have to get to a situation where there’s a health passport, vaccination certificates, etc and so you’ll see things picking up. But as there’ll be different parts of the world that will be vaccinated at different times, I think it’s going to be until sometime, maybe the second half of 2023 before the globe as such feels more comfortable with international travel.” An executive associated with the Association of Private Airport Operators said that the airports maintain asset intensive infrastructure despite the fall in air traffic. Private airport operators need to pay the Airports Authority of India as part of joint ventures. More than half of their revenue comes from non-aeronautical parts such as landing-parking charges and retail outlets, he explained. “Our fixed costs are almost 80% of the total costs, as far as airports are concerned. So our fixed costs are very high, unlike airlines or any other stakeholders, we are in a very bad situation. They (the airlines) can cut costs, by reducing fleet strength but airports don’t have that kind of adaptability. Now non aero revenue has almost gone to 5% or 10% of the pre Covid levels also because the retail business at airport too is negligible as a result of which the retail outlets are unable to pay rents,” he said.

13-05-2021||Mumbai||MAT stays Daya Nayak’s transfer||The Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) on Wednesday stayed the transfer of encounter specialist police inspector Daya Nayak, who was shunted out of Juhu unit of the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad to far-off Gondia district. A bench of MAT member AP Kurhekar stayed the May 6 order primarily in view of “the grave situation prevailing now because of COVID-19 pandemic and the second wave”. Nayak was transferred to caste scrutiny committee, Gondia, considering that Nayak has served 20 years in Mumbai. “Government of Maharashtra by G.R. dated May 10, 2021 has taken conscious decision not to effect any transfer including mid-term or mid-tenure till June 2021 in view of COVID-19 pandemic situation. The said G.R. was issued hardly four days after impugned transfer order,” said MAT while staying the transfer order. “The benefit of this G.R. also can be extended to the Applicant (Nayak) though impugned transfer order was issued four days before the issuance of G.R. in the light of continuing Pandemic situation,” reads the order. Nayak moved MAT through advocate MD Lonkar, challenging the transfer order on various grounds that he was transferred to a different division in contravention of the 2015 rules of divisional allotment for appointment to Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ posts. He further pointed out that in 2014 the applicant was transferred from Mumbai to Nagpur, but at the time, the government had accepted his representation in view of threat to his life from underworld and terrorists and he was reposted in Mumbai. “It appears that the then Commissioner of Police has received complaint against the Applicant that he is keeping relation with criminals and also threatened one Mohammed Nabi Khan for withdrawing report lodged against him,” the government pointed out. MAT, however, criticized the action observing that, “Director General of Police dug out report of Commissioner dated December 31, 2013 and solely on the basis of it recommended the transfer of the Applicant. What is striking to note that except this old and stale report of the Commissioner dated December 31, 2013 there is absolutely no fresh material as to what prompted the Director General of Police to transfer the Applicant suddenly after the lapse of more than eight years from the receipt of letter dated December 31, 2013.” said advocate MD Lonkar who appeared for Nayak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/matstays-daya-nayak-s-transfer-101620846465534.html

The companies (those who are interested) would mention the delivery schedule then,” he said. While the state government was running the vaccination drive, supplies were an issue.“We are getting supplies from two Indian companies so far for all age groups. But we foresaw that they will not be able to supply all that is needed. The state could not do statewide vaccination for the 18+ age group. It is going on in 18 districts. That’s why the state decided to go for global tender for 40 million doses,” he added.A health department officer said, “We are in touch with international vaccine manufacturing companies. The companies will have to supply the vaccines to the warehouses set up by the department on schedule. The manufacturers should also have cold chain transportation facility.” The state government had already placed orders for the supply of one crore Covid vaccine doses —50 lakh doses from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited that manufactures Covaxin and 50 lakh doses from the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) that makes Covishield.Additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad said the state government had received 3.50 lakh doses of Covishield from SII and three lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech till Sunday. The Uttar Pradesh government has made advance payment to both the Covid vaccine manufacturers. The state will get the required vaccine doses from both the companies soon, he said.Vaccine wastage down The health and family welfare department was working to check the wastage of vaccines, he said, adding that earlier the wastage was 20% in the initial stages. The state government then reviewed and monitored the working of vaccinators and gave fresh training to them to cut the wastage, he added.“Now the vaccine wastage has been brought down to less than 2% for Covishield and less than 3% for Covaxin. Efforts are being made to reduce the wastage further,” he said.Prasad said, till May 11 the state government had given 1,11, 63,988 first doses to people above 45 years and 29,35,660 second doses as well to people in this age group (45+).A total 1,40,99,648 vaccine dose had been given to the people above 45 years. The vaccination for the people between 18 and 44 years was launched on May 1. Till May 11, 2,16,897 beneficiaries between 18 and 44 years received the Covid vaccine jabs, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-says-it-s-in-touch-with-suppliers-for-quick-delivery-of-vaccines-101620846106063.html
13-05-2021||Lucknow||Consider giving ₹1 cr to kin of poll officials who died of Covid: HC||The Allahabad high court asked the Uttar Pradesh government to consider giving Rs1 crore to the families of poll officials who succumbed to Covid-19 during the recently concluded panchayat elections and urged the Centre to devise an immunisation plan for the differently abled.A bench comprising justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar also expressed unhappiness about reduced testing, asked the state government to institute within 48 hours a three-member pandemic public grievance committee in every district and said suspected Covid-19 deaths should be treated as coronavirus casualties.The bench was hearing a suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation on conditions of quarantine centres and treatment of Covid-19 patients in the state.The four-phase panchayat elections for roughly 800,000 rural body seats was held between April 15 and 29, coinciding with a devastating surge in infections.The high court and health experts blame the elections for driving the disease in the hinterlands and a prominent teachers’ union claimed that 700 staff died on poll duty. The state government has denied the charges and announced a compensation of ₹30 lakh for the kin of the deceased. But the bench said the amount was too low.“To compensate the loss of life of the bread earner of the family and that too because of the deliberate act on the part of the state and state election commission to force them to perform duties in the absence of RT-PCR support, the compensation must be at least to the tune of ₹1,00,00,000. We hope that the state election commission and government will rethink over the amount of the compensation and come back to us on the next date fixed,” the bench said in a written order passed on Tuesday but made public on Wednesday.“It is not a case that somebody volunteered to render his/ her services during election but it was all made obligatory to those assigned with election duty to perform their duties during election even while they showed their reluctance,” the bench added.The judges also expressed concern about the vaccination of differently abled people and asked the Centre how it will inoculate people who cannot go to vaccination centres or cannot register themselves online. The court then asked the state government if it could form guidelines for inoculating these people even in the absence of central norms. The court said a three-member panel in each district will hear grievances of people related to Covid-19 treatment. Each committee will comprise a chief judicial magistrate or a judicial officer, a professor of a medical college and an administrative officer of the rank of additional district magistrate.The court was dissatisfied with the government affidavit as no information regarding the number of ambulances in the state or meals provided to Covid-19 patients in government hospitals were provided.“We want food details with the calories count of each item in respect of the hospitals of all the categories,” it said.The court said deaths of suspected Covid-19 patients shall be treated as Covid mortality for a limited purpose. “Even if it is the case of suspected death of Covid patients for antigen testing, we are of the view that all such cases of death should be taken as Covid deaths and no hospital can be permitted to hold these cases as non-Covid cases so as to reduce number of Covid deaths in that particular hospital,” said the bench.“Government officials and the hospitals cannot be permitted to shirk away from their responsibility in ensuring that the dead body of such deceased persons is disposed of strictly as per the Covid protocol. Nobody is admitted to a hospital unless he has landed himself in a condition where the SPO2 level has gone down, ie, below 94 and, therefore, to take such deaths as non-Covid deaths would be a blunder,” said the bench while asking the government counsel to file an affidavit on this issue.The case will next be heard on May 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/consider-giving-rs-1-cr-to-kin-of-poll-officials-who-died-of-covid-hc-101620845515380.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s ESIC Hospital is now Covid facility for children||The Chandigarh administration is opening a separate facility for children suffering from Covid-19 at ESIC Hospital in Ram Darbar. The move comes after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the health department to earmark exclusive wards for such “young patients”, who are increasingly testing positive for the new strain of the virus during the second wave.Initially, the paediatric facility will have six beds, both ICU and oxygen, which can be extended to up to 16 if needed, said officials.Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services, Chandigarh, said the need for an exclusive paediatric ward was felt as the two new facilities at Panjab University and the Sector 45 civil hospital are admitting mostly adult patients. “ESIC Hospital has trained paediatricians and anaesthetists. Initially, it has been earmarked for children, but if the need arises, adult patients can also be admitted,” she said.Chandigarh has only one paediatric Covid facility at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. It has 32 beds, which include nine ICU beds, and has reached 80% occupancy.“The overall infection numbers are very high in the second wave, and consequently the number of affected children has also gone up. The treatment outcome is good among them and mortality due to Covid is uncommon,” said Jayashree Muralidharan, professor of paediatrics at the PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-esic-hospital-is-now-covid-facility-for-children-101620845746429.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Several lives could have been saved by door-to-door Covid vaccination: Bombay HC||Expressing anguish at the Central government for not abiding by its earlier direction to consider allowing door-to-door vaccination, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday observed that had such policy been implemented, it would have saved lives of several senior citizens and specially-abled persons who were unable to visit vaccination centres.The court also asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to apprise it on its proposed initiative to have ward-wise vaccination camps to reach out to a larger population in Mumbai and sought to know if vaccination officials would visit homes and administer jabs to eligible persons. After being informed that persons without any type of identity card could register on the Co-WIN website for getting the vaccination, the court sought to know whether beggars, homeless and transgenders could avail of the facility. The court asked Mumbai, Pune and other civic authorities to inform it about measures undertaken by them to vaccinate such persons and also the number of such beneficiaries.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking directions to the Centre, the Maharashtra government and the BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination facility for people over 75 years of age, the specially-abled and the bed-ridden. On April 22, noting that senior citizens could not be left to die and hence should be given priority while administering vaccines, the HC had directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to reconsider its decision of not having door-to-door vaccination and to find a via media solution to address the issue. On Wednesday, the court asked additional solicitor general Anil Singh as to why its earlier directions were not complied, “When we had passed the reasoned order on April 22, your government should have considered either way. Why wait till filing of an affidavit in Supreme Court in suo motu PIL?” While referring to photographs in local newspapers wherein senior citizens in wheelchairs were seen waiting in queues at vaccination centres the bench said, “If we had door-door vaccination, so many of our prominent citizens across fields, who were not in good health could have saved them. Definitely, something could have been done. Particularly considering some of the recent deaths.” The chief justice then said that in the meeting of senior administrative judges with BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday, they were assured that by May 17, BMC would have vaccination camps across all its wards in Mumbai and said, “Once such camps are started, we will have to see whether it would be possible for the BMC to send vaccination officials to the residences of bedridden persons to administer the jabs. This is the only way we can do it.” The bench sought response from the Centre and civic bodies on its queries and posted the further hearing to May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/several-lives-could-have-been-saved-by-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-bombay-hc-101620845685486.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Fill up vacant posts of medical officers in Maharashtra prisons, vaccinate inmates: HC to State||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state government to fill up one-third of vacant posts of medical officers and other medical staff in jail hospitals across Maharashtra and ordered the prison authorities to abide by the new standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the high powered committee (HPC) to decongest jails in light of the second Covid wave.The court asked the prison authorities to follow SOPs of the Central government for vaccinating prison inmates, including those not having Aadhar cards.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) based on the report published in Hindustan Times which highlighted the rise in Covid-19 cases in two months from 47 to 188 in the prisons in Maharashtra, was informed that as per its directions in a previous hearing the prison authorities had filed a reply. The reply stated that there were 35,124 inmates lodged in various jails across Maharashtra and there was a shortage of medical officers. During the previous hearing on April 29, the court had observed that Taloja Central prison had only three Ayurveda doctors and no Class I medical officers or other staff as required under Prison Rules, 2015. Expressing concern over the death of two prisoners and a jail staff due to Covid-19, the bench had questioned the authorities on the availability of qualified medical staff in prison hospitals and asked the Centre and the state if prison inmates needed to have Aadhaar cards before they get vaccinated.On Wednesday, the court noted that as per the state’s reply, nearly one-third posts of medical officers across jails in Maharashtra were lying vacant and observed that while all prisons should have requisite and able medical staff, the state’s reply was silent on the issue. The bench further noted, “We are not asking you to increase the number of sanctioned posts. At least fill up the existing posts. Already one year of the pandemic is over and you cannot depend on already burdened state-run hospitals. All jails must have at least sanctioned posts of medical staff filled.” The court further noted that apart from Taloja jail, prisons at Kolhapur, Amravati, Nagpur, Mumbai Central and Yerawada (Pune) also did not have any Class 1 medical officers.On the issue of vaccinating prison staff and inmates, Professor Vijay Raghavan, member of Centre for Criminology and Justice, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), who is assisting the court in the suo motu PIL submitted that vaccination should be done in camp mode inside prisons like other states had done rather than taking the inmates to civil hospitals. He also said that HIV positive prisoners or pregnant women, patients of Tuberculosis could be considered by the HPC for release.The prison authorities informed the court that jail staff were considered frontline workers and out of 3,818 prison staff members across 46 jails, 3,252 were vaccinated. It also said that 10,161 inmates above 18 years of age had Aadhar cards. The state and central government further informed the bench that on May 6, the union government had issued SOPs allowing registration of groups of people who did not possess any photo ID card or Aadhar cards on Co-WIN portal. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh for the Centre said that as per these SOPs, prison inmates could be vaccinated despite not having Aadhar cards by registering through the Co-WIN portal. Directing the state government to reply to its queries, HC posted the further hearing to May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fill-up-vacant-posts-of-medical-officers-in-maharashtra-prisons-vaccinate-inmates-hc-to-state-101620845625365.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Specially abled, 60+ can walk in for second dose of Covishield||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday issued revised guidelines for vaccination, allowing walk-ins for those above 60 years of age and specially abled for their second dose of Covishield. In case of the second dose of Covaxin, anyone above the age of 45 can walk in on coming Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (May 17-19). The process is being looked at as a pilot project, and will continue if the response is good. Vaccination between Thursday and Saturday will be strictly on the basis of appointments on Co-WIN portal, and the drive will remain shut on Sundays, said the BMC in its revised vaccination guidelines on Wednesday. This order will come into force from May 17.This comes in the backdrop of concerns over delay in the second shot discussed in a meeting between Mumbai suburbs guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, and Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, on Tuesday. Last Thursday, the BMC had ruled that vaccination for all age groups in the city will be done only on the basis of appointments via Co-WIN portal. This was done in the backdrop of overcrowding reported across vaccination centres in the city. A stampede-like situation was also reported at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo vaccination centre.Chahal, in the circular, said that every vaccination centre will decide their vaccine administration timing, depending on the availability of doses. The circular also says that every booth in a particular vaccination centre should be at least allotted 100 doses each.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “For now, for three days, we will allow walk-ins for those who are due to get their second dose. This means, anyone above the age of 45+ can walk in for the second dose of Covaxin and anyone above 60 years of age or specially abled can walk in for Covishield’s second dose. If the response is good next week, this arrangement will be continued.” However, vaccination for the 45+ age group will continue on the basis of appointments. Kakani added, “During this, slots for the first dose will not be available. Also, from Thursday, the vaccination drive for 18-44 years will be halted.” Meanwhile, Aaditya Thackeray tweeted on Wednesday: “For ONLY all those due for the second dose, age group 60 and above or differently abled, the BMC has reserved Monday, Tuesday Wednesday (17th, 18th, 19th May) walk-in vaccination at all our centres. Looking at the limited supply of vaccines, it is crucial that we complete the prescribed second shot in the coming week for those who have gone past the prescribed gap between 2 vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-specially-abled-60-can-walk-in-for-second-dose-of-covishield-101620845566842.html

13-05-2021||Mumbai||Less than 50,000 cases recorded in Maharashtra for fourth day||Maharashtra is witnessing a gradual decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases per day as it recorded less than 50,000 new cases for the fourth consecutive day.On Wednesday, the state recorded 46,781 new cases, along with 816 deaths. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the state has now reached 5,226,710. There are currently 546,129 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 103,067 patients followed by Nagpur with 49,345 active patients. The death toll has now reached 78,007 with Mumbai leading with 13,972 deaths, followed by Pune with 10,176 people.There were a total of 252,167 tests conducted on Wednesday, while 58,805 patients have been recovered. The total number of deaths has now reached 78,007, with 816 succumbing to the virus on Wednesday.The number of cases started declining below 50,000 from Sunday onwards as it recorded 48,401 new cases followed by Monday and Tuesday with 37,236 and 40,956 new cases, respectively.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that situation in the state is stabilising. “The positivity rate of the virus is coming down. In addition, the growth rate is on the decline at 0.8%, as compared to the national average of 1.4%. We are ranked in the 30th position in terms of the growth rate of Covid-19,” said Tope.Tope said that in 15 districts of Maharashtra, the Covid-19 has slowed down, showing marked improvement.Dr Jeevan Jain, a physician from Lalbaug, who has treated over 15,000 Covid-19 patients, said the lockdown played a crucial role in the decline of the virus. “The lockdown has slowed down the virulence and decreased the potency of the virus significantly. The lockdown needs to be extended so that its gains are not lost,” said Jain.The majority of the ministers in the state cabinet have demanded the extension and have authorised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to decide on this.Given the surge in Covid-19 cases, a strict lockdown was imposed in Nashik for 10 days. The police department stationed themselves at 40 different junctions penalising people, who stepped out without a valid reason. Similarly in Pune, the action was taken against 23,000 violators in the last five days for breaking Covid-19 rules.Meanwhile, the Union minister Nitin Gadkari donated 650 ventilators and 300 oxygen concentrators to both government and private hospitals in Vidarbha. The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) celebrated the birthday of their chief Prakash Ambedkar by distributing fruits to the orphanages, after maintaining all Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/less-than-50-000-cases-recorded-in-maharashtra-for-fourth-day-101620845505353.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Neonatal ICUs, creches for kids of Covid positive parents on Mumbai civic body’s cards||Alongside ramping up infrastructure in light of the recent projection of more cases in children and infants, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also decided to set up creches for children whose parents are Covid-19 positive, especially, if such children do not have anyone to take care of them during their parents’ quarantine period. All paediatric wards for Covid-19 positive children are likely to have an adjoining and safe stay area for mothers of ailing children, especially in the case of infants who have tested positive for Covid-19. This was discussed in a meeting between Mumbai suburbs’ guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, and additional municipal commissioner in charge of the civic public health department, Suresh Kakani, on Tuesday. Thackeray later said, “We cannot expect an infant or a very young child who has tested positive for Covid-19 to stay away from its mother. But we also need to make sure the mother is safe from Covid-19. So we will have to design an area that meets both our requirements, alongside paediatric Covid wards.” “This works the other way round as well,” Thackeray added. In cases where both parents of young children have tested positive for Covid-19 and will be institutionally quarantined, but the child has tested negative, BMC will make arrangements for the children to be looked after if they don’t have family members to take care of them. Hindustan Times reported last week, that BMC will add at least 500 beds in dedicated Covid care centres across the city, for children and infants afflicted with Covid. The existing six Jumbo facilities have a capacity of accommodating 250 more beds each. Moreover, the four new Jumbo facilities coming up at Mahalaxmi, Sion, Malad, and Kanjurmarg will have pediatric Covid wards. However, Thackeray said, “BMC will also focus on adding more neonatal ICU and ventilator beds.”Experts have noticed the trend of a rising number of Covid cases in children below 10 years of age, and in infants over the past few months. Om Shrivastav, who is a part of the Maharashtra government’s covid task force said, “Between the first and second wave, we have seen an increase in the number of cases in children below 10 years and infants. We can assume this trend may continue, and we don’t want to be caught off guard, or start making preparations after the crisis has hit us. So we must keep infrastructure ready.” The state government is also forming a pediatric task force of experts for the same. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Wednesday reported 2,104 Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths, taking the tally to 681,233 and the toll to 13,972. There are 36,595 active cases in the city at present. On Tuesday, Mumbai conducted 33,499 tests, which have shown Wednesday’s cases. The daily positivity rate is 6.2% on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neonatal-icus-creches-for-kids-of-covid-positive-parents-on-mumbai-civic-body-s-cards-101620845446663.html

A patient whose sample test report is not positive, but the blood sample, X-ray and CT scan report show Covid infection, will also get oxygen supply in home isolation, she said.Covid positive people will have to submit a signed prescription of a medical practitioner emphasising that the patient needs oxygen during home isolation. The district administration officials will ensure that oxygen cylinder was made available to the needy patient, she said.The DMs will also ensure that oxygen cylinder was not given to patients who are admitted in a Covid hospital. To streamline the supply of oxygen cylinder to patients, the district administration will fix more than one supply spot in each district. The officers will obtain a copy of the Aadhaar card of the patient, the family member who collects the oxygen cylinder and the mobile phone number. Each oxygen cylinder given for home isolation will have a mark.On May 10, there was a requirement of 56 MT (metric tonnes) oxygen for patients in home isolation in the state, according to a report submitted by the DMs of all the 75 districts of UP.“If there is an increase or fall in the demand, the DMs will inform the control room established in the state home department for the online monitoring of oxygen supply across the state,” Singh said.In a press statement, the state home department said in the last 24 hours, 1014.53 MT metric tonnes) oxygen was supplied to hospitals and oxygen refill centres across the state.Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi monitored the supply of oxygen from the control room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-asks-all-dms-to-ensure-oxygen-supply-to-home-isolation-patients-in-need-101620845445955.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Lockdown in Maharashtra expected may extend by two weeks, all ministers in favour of the same||The ongoing lockdown in Maharashtra is all set to be extended by another fortnight. In the meeting on Wednesday, almost all of the state cabinet ministers demanded two weeks’ extension to the lockdown in the wake of the rise in Covid-19 cases in some of districts. The formal decision on the same is expected to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a day or two.After a partial lockdown from April 5, the state government imposed a complete shutdown from April 22. The state has allowed essential establishments to remain open between 7 and 11am, people to step out only for medical and valid reasons, restricted inter-district travel for valid reasons and brought down attendance in the government offices to 15% during the lockdown which ends at 7am on May 15. The lockdown has helped the administration to arrest the spike in Covid cases. The number of active patients came down to 546,129 on Wednesday from 699,858 on April 22.The decision of the complete lockdown was taken by the state cabinet in the third week of April after the health department projected the active cases to rise to more than 1.1 million by May 1. The state cabinet on Wednesday pressed for the need to extend the ongoing lockdown for another two weeks. “The final decision over the extension will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray soon. The cabinet ministers are in the favour of an extension of two weeks,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.Tope said that though the cases in about 15 districts are on the decline the remaining districts have been witnessing the rise in the same. “We have improved on the positivity and growth rate of the cases. With 0.8% growth rate against 1.4% national rate, Maharashtra is in 30th position in the country. The positivity rate and other parameters related to the Covid-19 have improved in the state. Though we cannot claim to have the infection curve completely stabilised, the daily caseload is certainly on the decline,” he said.According to the officials from the relief and rehabilitation department, there would not be any relaxation given from the current restriction during the extension of the lockdown. “There are a lot of sectors who have been demanding for the relaxation in train travel, office attendance, but the chief minister is firm on extending it in the existing form. The decision about imposing the complete lockdown for four weeks was taken by the cabinet last month. It was also decided to declare it in two phases. We expect the gradual unlocking to begin after May 30 or 31,” said the official.The official pointed out that the lockdown has helped the state ease the pressure on the health infrastructure to a great extent.“We have more than 25% beds vacant in the state, with some districts reaching 40%. We have eased the shortage of life-saving drugs like Remdesivir and oxygen through concentrated efforts over the last few weeks. But the vaccination drive is not attaining the desired speed, though we top in the number of people inoculated, amid the shortage of the vaccine. We expect the extension of the lockdown to help at the beginning of the flattening of the infection curve in the next fortnight,” he said.Some of the districts like Buldhana, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli have already imposed stricter curbs at a local level with permission from the chief secretary of the state. Some of these districts have completely shut down the establishments including essential ones and curtailed the intradistrict public transport as they have been witnessing a continuous rise in the cases.Out of the total active patients, 44.22% or 247165 are in five districts (Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik) while another 20.37% or 113845 are in five more districts (Ahmednagar, Solapur, Satara, Sangli and Chandrapur) as on May 11. 32.92% or 194486 patients out of 590818 active patients, as of May 11, are hospitalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-in-maharashtra-expected-may-extend-by-two-weeks-all-ministers-in-favour-of-the-same-101620845385374.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body floats global tender for vaccines, restricts China||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday floated an expression of interest (EOI) to procure 10 million vaccine doses from vaccine manufacturers abroad. The decision was taken by the BMC on Monday to speed up the vaccination process.According to BMC, all clearances (from the Centre) regarding Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses will have to be taken by the manufacturers themselves. However, it has barred Chinese vaccine manufacturers from participating in the procurement process by restricting the participation of countries sharing borders with India.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the BMC said, “To supply one crore (10 million) doses of Covid prevention vaccine, BMC has published a Global Expression of Interest (EoI) inviting various companies to submit proposals. This notice has been published today (May 12, 2021) and according to this, EoI are to be submitted to the BMC by 1pm on May 18, 2021. The proposals will be unveiled on the same day, May 18, 2021, at 3pm. If the BMC issues a work order, the entire vaccine will have to be supplied to the concerned companies within three weeks.”This comes two days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday gave a nod for the BMC to float a global tender. Mumbai suburbs guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday had tweeted, “Looking at the need for adequate vaccines to ensure that vaccination is swift & efficient, after discussing the issue with CM Uddhav Thackeray ji, as guardian minister of Mumbai, we have asked BMC to explore possibilities of global procurement of vaccines.”Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “BMC has floated global bid to procure one crore Covid vaccines at the earliest. BMC has resolved to make every possible effort in future and also to acquire sufficient quantity of Covid vaccines to vaccinate all eligible citizens of Mumbai on a war-footing in the next 60-90 days.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have floated just the expression of interest, and have put a condition that all certification and approvals vaccine manufacturers will need, they will have to get it from the government of India, drug controller. The EoI, for now, is to procure ten million doses, and regarding indemnity issues, we have mentioned that the best international practice will be followed. Ultimately, we all will be bound by conditions of the Central government.”Velrasu also confirmed that BMC has also put a condition that applicants should not belong to countries sharing borders with India, which will restrict the entry of Chinese vaccine manufacturers.Further, considering several vaccines from the western countries require cold storage mandating temperature in minus, the BMC has made it mandatory for manufacturers to arrange for such a facility. The BMC in the EOI document has stated, “BMC has cold storage facilities consisting of walk-in cooler (WIC) 2 in no. with 40 cum capacity each. The temperature of WIC is+20 to +80C. If the covid vaccine requires storage and temperature requirements other than that available with the B, C, the applicant will have to provide the required storage facility for the Covid Vaccine, till the vaccination points. Currently, MCGM has 20 hospitals and 240 vaccination centres.”The document further adds, “The applicant should have their own cold chain transporting system from their manufacturing unit or should have a valid contract with a transporting agent having facilities to transport Covid Vaccines under cold chain norms to the storage facility / any of the hospitals/ vaccination centres within BMC jurisdiction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-floats-global-tender-for-vaccines-restricts-china-101620845325441.html
13-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to roll out vax for 18+ on May 14||The Chandigarh administration will begin the vaccination drive for 18-44 years age group on May 14. There is no facility for walk-in registration, and the beneficiaries will have to book the slot and obtain the time and place of vaccine through the Co-WIN portal, stated an official release on Wednesday. On the first day, 1,000 slots will be opened, said officials.The decision came after the Government of India allotted 33,000 vaccines for the younger age group in Chandigarh. The doses reached the city on Wednesday.The Centre had extended the drive to all adults on May 1. However, amid shortage of vaccines, various states and UTs had to delay the launch. While Panchkula became the first in the tricity to roll it out on May 2, Mohali launched it only for construction workers on May 9.UT adviser Manoj Parida said that in addition to the existing vaccination centres in the government sector, additional sites will be opened in a few schools, exclusively for this age group of beneficiaries. The details of the venues will be intimated individually to the beneficiaries while booking the slot. “Vaccines will be administered in a phased manner to avoid crowding. All necessary arrangements will be made to ensure Covid protocol is strictly followed and doses are administered under proper medical supervision,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh.The administration has earlier announced that the vaccine will be provided for free at government centres.Private hospitals are to get the vaccines directly from manufacturers. For example, the Serum Institute of India has allocated 12,000 doses of Covishield to Chaitanya Hospital in Sector 44 for May. “They may also start the vaccination drive on payment basis immediately after the actual receipt of vaccines. They are already registered on the Co-WIN portal and will be able to offer the slots after they receive the doses,” said a UT spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-roll-out-vax-for-18-on-may-14-101620845267721.html

13-05-2021||Mumbai||Mission Oxygen: Maharashtra govt approves sops for industry||To encourage the private sector to generate liquid medical oxygen as part of its Mission Oxygen plan to increase daily production up to 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) in the state, the state cabinet on Wednesday gave in-principle approval to the sops to the industry. The state is expected to bear a burden of around ₹200 crore towards the incentives. Under its Mission Oxygen, also coined as Swayampurna Maharashtra, the state has set a short-term goal of 2300 MT to be achieved in the next six months. The mission, which is expected to cost the state ₹1,100 crore, will have the participation of private players with the aim of at least one new plant in each of the six divisions. The state is extending sops in terms of waiver in the registration fee, electricity duty, stamp duty and GST. “The waiver in GST will be 150% in backward Marathwada and Vidarbha and 100% for the rest of the state. This will help us in encouraging the setting up of new LMO plants,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. “We have six major players including Linde India, Inox Air Products, Praxair India, Taiyo Nippon Sanso India, JSW Steel and Air Liquid India Holdings who produce most of the current daily generation of 1295 MT. We are in talks with existing manufacturers and expect new entrants,” said an official from Mantralaya. During the discussion cabinet members also suggested incentives for the cooperative sugar sector, which has started tapping the generation of oxygen. The state has planned more than 290 PSA (Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) plants and dozens of Air Separation Units, along with the LMO plants with the help of private players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mission-oxygen-maharashtra-govt-approves-sops-for-industry-101620845265933.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Two weeks after videos of abuse surface, IIT-KGP suspends prof||A professor from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur has been suspended two weeks after videos of her purportedly abusing students from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes categories and those with physical disabilities emerged on social media. Seema Singh, an associate professor of English from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences, was suspended on Monday pending an internal investigation, said Tamal Nath, registrar, IIT-Kharagpur. On April 24, video recordings of Singh were posted anonymously on the confessions page of the institute, an informal group of students on social media. The recordings are those of preparatory classes, allegedly taught by Singh online and attended by over 100 students and parents, where she can be heard hurling abuses repeatedly. IITs offer preparatory courses for two semesters to aspirants of SC and ST communities as well as persons with disability (PWD). The preparatory courses are offered against vacant seats reserved for students who missed out on admissions through the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). At the end of the two semesters, the students can either take JEE again or seek admission based on their performance during the preparatory course. In the video clips, Singh can be heard verbally abusing both students and their parents for not attending classes, keeping their cameras switched off during the class. Singh also castigated a student for sending an email stating that they would not be able to attend the class for a few days due to the death of their grandparent. “Professor Singh has been suspended until further orders. A fact-finding committee had been instituted to look into the allegations and has submitted its report. We are now instituting an internal inquiry,” Nath said. Singh was unavailable for comment.Soon after the videos went viral, Singh had, in an email to students, apologised for her behaviour. “I am writing this to express my sincerest apology for what happened last week. It was definitely not my intention to hurt anyone… It was never the slightest intention to be discriminatory towards any segment of the student community,” Singh wrote in her email. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiated an inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-weeks-after-videos-of-abuse-surface-iit-kgp-suspends-prof-101620845206486.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||SoBo society files case against contractor over fake Covid reports||A housing society in south Mumbai has filed a criminal case registered against a contractor for allegedly producing fake negative Covid-19 test reports of four workers engaged to carry out repairing work in a flat.According to Gamdevi police, the complainant Hiren Thakkar, 64, is the manager of Saajit Cooperative Housing Society Sagar Villa, located on Bhulabhai Desai Road. In his complaint to the police, he stated that one of the residents of the society, R Khemka, wanted to get some repairing work done at her flat and hence secured due permission from the society. But due to the ongoing pandemic situation, the government has made Covid-19 testing of labourers compulsory, before starting any repair work. After Khemka was informed about it, she told the same to the contractor, Shivaji Maruti Kambale. On Tuesday, four workers arrived at the society for the work and Kambale submitted their negative Covid test reports to the society. “When the society manager saw the Covid test reports, he noticed that the VID (Virtual ID) number and the testing time on all the four reports are same, which raised suspicion about the genuineness of the reports,” a police officer said.Thakkar then informed society’s chairman Percy Dubash, who then contacted the pathology lab for verification. The lab executive said those reports were not issued by them and further added that the VID number on the reports was linked to some other person’s test report conducted last year. Following this the society informed the Gamdevi police.“We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code against Kambale. His friend had helped him in making the false Covid test report. Both of them will face legal action soon,” said Rampiyare Rajbhar, senior inspector of Gamdevi police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sobo-society-files-case-against-contractor-over-fake-covid-reports-101620845207206.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Congress must play role of strong opposition: Shiv Sena||Three days after questioning where the Congress would be in terms of national-level politics in 2024, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday, in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, said the Congress must play the role of a strong opposition in the future. It stated that the popularity of the Narendra Modi government is sliding due to Covid-19 deaths, inflation, economic slowdown, unemployment, etc, and added that the prominent opposition party in the country must come down from “Twitter branch” to the ground. On Sunday, Sena leader Sanjay Raut in his weekly column RokhThok had taken a critical tone on the Congress’ performance in the Assembly elections held in West Bengal, Assam and Kerala. He had said there was no leader in Delhi to take on Modi. However, in an editorial on Wednesday, the Sena lauded Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of the Centre and said that the Central government accepted several suggestions made by Gandhi in the fight against Covid-19. “Going ahead, the Congress party must act like a fierce opposition party. The anger against this government is building up among the people. The popularity of the government is sliding due to unemployment, economic slowdown, inflation, and deaths due to Covid-19. At this moment, all the key opposition parties must come down from the Twitter branch (social media) and go on ground. That does not mean leading crowd on the streets amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but the opposition must question the government on a daily basis. The Congress must take a lead in this,” the editorial said. The editorial further said that during the Congress Working Committee meeting, party president Sonia Gandhi expressed concern on the poor performance in the recently-held Assembly elections in five states. It said that the same issues were raised by the column (RokhThok) in Saamana. “The results are so poor that some changes have to be made to the party. Sonia Gandhi raised these issues in the meeting. Congress leaders from Maharashtra say they do not read Saamana, but Sonia Gandhi takes cognisance of Saamana,” the editorial read, taking a swipe at Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole.The editorial also added that leaders, who had left the Congress, are going on to bring their own regional parties to power in that particular state. It cited examples of Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Hemant Sarma in Assam, and N Rangaswamy in Puducherry — all three are former Congress leaders. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Raut, executive editor of Saamana, said the views expressed in the newspaper was due to concern, as the Congress is a big party and contributed immensely in the freedom struggle. “The same party had to face defeat in Assam and Kerala, and Sonia Gandhi raised the issue of why the party could not come into power in the states during the party’s working committee meeting, which was also raised by Saamana,” said Raut. He further said that everybody, “be it gully or Delhi” (at local level and national as well), take note of Saamana and decide their policies accordingly,” said Sena leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-must-play-role-of-strong-opposition-shiv-sena-101620845205355.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Storm expected to lash south Maharashtra coast starting Friday, may lead to cyclone||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted the formation of a low-pressure zone over the Arabian Sea starting Friday (May 14). This weather condition is then expected to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16, prompting IMD to issue yellow-category storm warnings for parts of Madhya Maharashtra and the southern end of Konkan coast. This is not expected to have significant impact over Mumbai and north Konkan.“Squally weather with wind speed reaching 45­55 kilo metre per hour (kmph) is very likely to prevail along and off South Maharashtra-Goa coasts on May 15 and 16. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over South Maharashtra-Goa coasts on May 15 and 16. Fishermen are advised not to venture into these areas during the above period,” IMD’s regional forecasting centre said in a statement Wednesday.The storm “is very likely to move north to north-westwards and intensify further into a cyclonic storm over east central Arabian Sea around May 16 and continue to move north-north-westwards for some more time with further intensification,” it cautioned.IMD has issued a yellow alert with a forecast of thunderstorm with lightning, rain and gusty winds at isolated places in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Beed, Nanded, Latur, Osmanabad for May 14 and 15. This may also bring some relief to these districts from the summer heat. For Mumbai, however, partly cloudy skies are expected to prevail, with a near normal temperature (about 34 degrees Celsius daytime maximum) for the next few days.Orange category (ie heavy rainfall) alerts have been issued for Lakshadweep Islands from May 13 to May 15, along with the possibility of a tidal wave occurrence. Parts of Kerala, Karnatake and Tamil Nadu are expected to receive isolated but heavy bouts of rain over the next four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/storm-expected-to-lash-south-maharashtra-coast-starting-friday-may-lead-to-cyclone-101620845205971.html
13-05-2021||Mumbai||Deonar plant: Firm checking green impact not accredited||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has outsourced the environment impact assessment (EIA) for a proposed waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the Deonar dumping site to an unaccredited consultant organisation (CO), in variance of the directions of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). Fine Envirotech Engineers (FEE), a Mahim-based environment consultancy headed by proprietor Dr Umesh Kulkarni, which conducted baseline environmental monitoring and socio-economic surveys for the Deonar WTE project, is not recognised by the National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET), the statutory body that audits and certifies EIA consultants nationally. FEE has been tasked with drafting EIA reports for several other public infrastructure projects in the city. These include assessments for MMRDA’s Metro-2A and Metro-7 lines, and the BMC’s solid waste processing facility in Kanjurmarg. Dr Umesh Kulkarni, proprietor of FEE, also confirmed that his organisation has operated without NABET accreditation for “the past five or six years”. “There is a stay order from the Bombay High Court against the ministry’s office memorandums, which remains valid. I have been in the business for three decades and our team of experts, across sectors, have conducted several successful EIA projects.” The absence of NABET recognition does not preclude FEE from conducting such assessments. The accreditation was made mandatory for EIA Consultant Organizations by the Union environment ministry through an Office Memorandum dated December 2, 2009, FEE has obtained a stay order from the Bombay high court against the direction.“Fine Envirotech Engineers… have been granted stay of the Office Memorandums issued by the MoEF by which Environment Consultants were directed to have an accreditation from NABET,” states a letter written by FEE’s legal counsel to the environment ministry in September 2017, a copy of which has been accessed by HT. “By virtue of the same, Fine Envirotech Engineers are carrying various category projects all over India and are currently engaged by a varied clientele including government and private,” the letter continues. The HC order referred to was passed on August 23, 2013. The stay order continues to be valid. With the matter still subjudice, FEE is allowed to continue operations, but without statutory oversight.“The CO’s arrangement with the BMC is not illegal per se, but raises an important question which needs to be answered in public interest. Why are authorities giving work to an organisation that is not duty bound to a centrally mandated level of quality, and which does not get audited regularly? Even if the CO is technically capable, it creates a major hole in the accountability,” said Zaman Ali, a city-based environmental lawyer. Hindustan Times also spoke to representatives of two other COs based in Mumbai, accredited by NABET. “As a certified organisation, it is our view that such projects should be given only to accredited COs which have proven sector-specific expertise. The NABET certification process is riddled with red-tape and could be improved, but having accreditation is mandatory,” said a proprietor of one such firm, seeking anonymity.Experts also said the permissibility of unaccredited EIAs is questionable in light of the MoEFCC’s March 2016 amendment to the EIA notification, which clearly states that such work is to be undertaken only by certified organisations. BMC’s chief engineer for solid waste management, Kishor Bhambure, was unable for a comment. However, a subordinate official who is directly involved with the project, but requested anonymity, said they were not aware of such an amendment in law. “But we know that FEE is not recognised by NABET. They have a case pending in the courts and are in possession of a stay order, which makes them eligible to carry out the EIA for our Deonar plant,” said the official.There are, in fact, multiple stay orders in the matter passed by the High Courts of Gujarat and Karnataka as well, on the basis of different petitions from COs. “As a result of these stays by High Courts, some consultants who were actually not found competent through a detailed assessment process, are carrying out EIAs for various sectors thereby potentially endangering the projects as well as the environment and people around. Additionally, some other consultant organizations, who have not even applied for accreditation, are using this route to by-pass the entire process and doing work at inexplicably low costs. This is a big disincentive for… consultant organizations... who are willing to follow the process directed by the Government and are making continuous efforts and investments to produce proper EIAs,” the Quality Council of India noted in an internal report in April 2015.FEE’s Deonar EIA report itself has been criticised for a lack of rigour. A solid waste management expert certified by the Quality Council of India, and who has at least a decade of experience conducting similar impact assessments for projects in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, said while seeking anonymity, “The EIA report suffers from a few gaps. Firstly, the OC has not ascertained whether the waste material from Deonar landfill is suitable for incineration. Second, there is no chemical analysis of the leachate generated by the landfill site, which may be polluting groundwater. There has been data collection, but the data has not been meaningfully interpreted for public benefit.”Moreover, the expert also pointed out that FEE has not, in its draft EIA document, adequately disclosed the names of concerned experts -- also known as Functional Area Experts -- involved in the exercise, along with their qualifications. “This disclosure is usually in the final chapter of any standard EIA document. In the given EIA report, in Chapter 12, the consultant has just given a person’s CV as consultant disclosure, without mentioning accreditation status of that person. There is no sector-wise list of appropriate experts. This is a violation of EIA guidelines,” said the QCI-certified expert quoted above.Experts also highlighted that there is likely to be an inherent conflict of interest when project proponents are allowed to appoint EIA consultants at their own discretion, and suggested that, to bring more transparency to this process, the consultants would ideally be allocated by regulatory authorities themselves.Commenting on the matter, Meenakshi Kapoor, an independent environmental policy researcher, “”This case raises more questions when viewed with a March 2020 order of the MoEFCC, in which it states that consultants who do not stick to the issued Terms of Reference should be issued a show cause notice and repeat offenders should be delisted. If non-accredited consultants can operate, they have nothing to lose even if they do a shoddy job and are told off for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deonar-plant-firm-checking-green-impact-not-accredited-101620845145392.html

We urge you to recommend to the committee to release the BK (Bhima-Koregaon) undertrials on interim bail at least. They are all law-abiding citizens who have families outside. We are worried about their safety in these desperate circumstances where everyone is at risk.”They claimed they were worried about the health of the arrested accused as most of them are aged above 60 years and have comorbidities. “Although vaccination is believed to reduce the lethality of Covid-19 infection, it is seen that only four BK undertrial detainee — Gautam Navlakha, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Shoma Sen — have received a single dose of the vaccine, as of last week of April,” reads the letter.The families also claimed the communication channel between the accused and their family members have also been disrupted. “Although letters have been written by the BK detainees in Taloja prison on several occasions in the past two months, we, the families, have not received most letters from them.

13-05-2021||Chandigarh||High drama as hundreds waiting for hours told to leave at Panchkula vax centre||Tempers flared at the Civil Hospital in Sector 6 as hundreds of people waiting for hours for Covid vaccine were told to return empty handed on Wednesday evening.Even those reaching at 4pm, ran into a queue of 300 people, who had arrived after reading or hearing news about a special event at the hospital, which normally does not host vaccinations, being a Covid care centre.“There was a news report that vaccination drive will go on till late evening at the Sector 6 hospital and people can reach by 5pm. But even after joining the queue at 4pm, I didn’t move three to four steps for the next two hours,” said Inayat Kakar, a Panchkula resident.She complained that while the vaccination moved at a snail’s pace with hundreds still in queue, a few VIPs went in for shots easily. As the staff announced the stock was over and the window was closed, heated arguments erupted.“Why invite people when they cannot manage the drive? Worse, people are being exposed to infection by holding the vaccination drive at a Covid care centre,” said Kakar, who returned without a jab at 6.30pm.When contacted, immunisation officer Meenu Sasan said the large-scale drive was held without her permission. “I never allow vaccination at a hospital that is treating Covid patients. There will be no more vaccination there.”She said the principal medical officer did approach her for a small vaccination event for around 100 people in view of Nurses’ Day, while saying that they will manage it, so she had only allowed that.Later, in the evening, she got a call during a meeting that lots of people had reached the hospital for vaccination. But, it was not managed as promised, she said.Vaccination pace slowing downEven though Panchkula took the lead in tricity in starting the third phase of vaccination for the 18-44 drive on May 2, its vaccination numbers have declined since April.Only 24,110 people have been vaccinated in the first 11 days of May, compared to 27,920 in the same period in April.This, despite the sharp surge in new infections and deaths. While the district had logged 8,013 cases through April, the figure has already reached 5,319 in just 12 days of May. Worse, at 60, the deaths this month have already surpassed April’s 53.Yet, the younger population is still finding it a challenge to book a slot, which gets full within a few minutes. “I have been trying to book a slot for several days now, but in vain. The slots are always full,” said Uday, a Panchkula resident.Another youth, Aakash, said he had been facing the same issue, with the slots turning red within a few seconds for the past three days.While those in the 18-44 category struggle for slots, those above 45 years are facing a tough time due to non-availability of the right vaccine for their second dose. For instance, there is no Covaxin stock at the government dispensaries in Sectors 7 and 12.To this, Dr Sasan said, “The vaccination drive depends on the supply of vaccines. In the beginning of May, there was a shortage of supply, hence the drive slowed down. But, we are trying our best to manage within the limited resources.”“The number of sites has been decreased for now, as our focus will be on covering those living in slums,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-drama-as-hundreds-waiting-for-hours-told-to-leave-at-panchkula-vax-centre-101620844366004.html

13-05-2021||Pune||Pune Railway division’s smooth handling of “oxygen express” allows city to breathe easier for the future||PUNE At 12.30 am on Wednesday, a goods train carrying oxygen tankers stopped near a ramp built at the Loni railway station. This first train carrying oxygen tankers, four, had arrived in Pune from Angul, Orissa. Total liquid oxygen of 55.04 metric tonnes arrived in these tankers and was escorted by police and RTO officials to an oxygen plant in Chakan. “It took us around 1.5 hours to unload the tankers from the train, as initially air was filled into tyres of each tanker. The weight of each tanker is huge. Each tanker came onto the ramp and was safely unloaded,” said Vijaykumar Chobe, upper tehsildar, Chobe added, “We are still in very much need of oxygen supply, not only Pune, but for other districts in the Pune division. As of now all four tankers will go to Chakan where the liquid oxygen will be unloaded and stored.”Currently, daily, 325 metric tonnes of oxygen is needed for Pune district. This is supplied through oxygen coming from Gujarat and Karnataka, and oxygen manufactures within Pune district. Also, 30 tonnes of oxygen supplied by France of 40 tonnes was given to Pune district by the state government. Renu Sharma, Pune divisional railway manager said, “The railways role in this oxygen tankers movement is only as a transporter. These tankers on the train came from Angul, Odisha, and were given a green corridor with a preference on the route to reach Pune. As the tankers were fully loaded, the speed of the train was kept to around 60 kmph. To unload the four tankers at Loni railway station, a special ramp was built within two days. After this first experience of unloading oxygen tankers, Pune division is fully prepared for further any such operations, either at Loni or Khadaki railway station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-division-s-smooth-handling-of-oxygen-express-allows-city-to-breathe-easier-for-the-future-101620835003500.html

On May 12 at 7.30 am, Gaware and Sherpa, Pasang Zarok, reached the top of Mt Everest, a height of 8,848.86 metres. Gaware, a member of the Giripremi mountaineers club in Pune, summited his second 8,000-metre peak in less than a month. He climbed Mt Annapurna 1, the 10th tallest mountain in the world, on April 16. “I am tired, drained out, but extremely happy,” said Gaware, a resident of Wadgaonsheri, over the phone from base camp in Nepal. He calls his wife, son and his parents his strongest supports, that led him to achieve this feat. According to Umesh Zirpe, veteran mountaineer and leader of Giripremi expeditions, “Jitendra has been training for two years and has an exercise regime of six to seven hours, which is not easy. He has a good physique and was very focused on his training and goal of achieving his dream of summiting Everest. Although, Mount Annapurna is known for its extremely risky peak, it is every mountaineer’s dream to summit Everest.” Gaware has also climbed Mt Kanchenjunga, the third- tallest mountain in the world, in May 2019, and Mt Ama Dablam (Nepal), in October 2019. Gaware says he focused on endurance and trained rigorously by trekking 86km nonstop, from Sinhagad fort to Raigad, to Torna and back to Raigad. Bhushan Harshe and Dr Sumeet Mandale mentored Gaware. Ganesh More, Vivek Shivade, and Avinash Kandekar, a professor at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) helped Gaware with the weather forecasts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/giripremis-jitendra-gaware-summits-mt-everest-his-2nd-8k-m-peak-in-less-than-a-month-101620830082719.html
