02-05-2021||Mumbai||Online learning will have impact on students’ future, planning essential: Experts||At a zilla parishad school in Palghar, nearly 30% students have not been able to attend classes since the school moved online in March 2020. Lack of access to technology, poor connectivity and the trauma induced by pandemic-related pressures such as job losses, has meant that many students have remained in schools only on paper. “While the pandemic has left no scope for physical classes, in an area like this, it is a distant dream to see all students online. We have taken all efforts to ensure that their learning doesn’t stop. We call them on their phones, make routine visits to their homes, distribute physical worksheets and a lot more. So, we can say that we are teaching. But how much the students are learning, we really need to assess,” said the principal of the school on the condition of anonymity. As schools, colleges and universities in the state continue to remain online for over a year now, experts now worry about the future repercussions of this shift. While education boards and governments across the country cancelled exams, moved everything online and tried to tweak their teaching-learning process this year, many say that a more long-term solution is needed to plan for the coming years. Many suggest reworking the syllabus, slowing down the teaching-learning process to meet the needs of students and teachers, planning realistically for exams among other things. Francis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network said education boards need to start planning for the next year or two from now as the pandemic has had a huge impact on learning over the last one year. “Boards, schools and everyone needs to realise that this year has been exceptional. Both students and schools had to face a lot of uncertainties and have managed to somewhat sail through. However, there is a learning loss that has been caused during this time. Hence, boards need to slow down a bit, assess what needs to be done to tweak the syllabus a little while working around the challenges with schools,” he added. With rising cases and the resultant lockdown, the Maharashtra government had to cancel its Class 10 SSC exams this year. Other boards such as CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE and IB also took the same call. Experts said a similar decision might have to be taken again in the coming months and years because one cannot predict how the pandemic pans out later. “We need to prepare for the worst. This year, we only did firefighting. We cancelled exams, we moved schools online because it was the need of the hour. But now that we know this can be our state even in the coming years, we need to prepare ourselves better. Schools need to be taught to assess student performance throughout the year, colleges need to be equipped to move their theory and praxis based teaching online and make it more effective,” said Shubhada Mhatre, a civic body teacher in the city. While educational institutes are coming up with the short term and long term plans to address for the coming year, lack of clarity from the governments is turning out to be a hurdle in the process. For instance, in Maharashtra, school and college closures are extended by a few months now and then. In the month of November 2020, when Covid-19 cases in the state had substantially reduced, institutes were asked to ready for a physical reopening. While some schools and junior colleges in Maharashtra could open, many others in cities such as Pune and Mumbai could not. Even the ones that opened in the various districts across the state had to close again as cases rose in April 2021. Institutes said the government can now come up with a slightly longer strategy to indicate in advance whether learning will be online during the coming months. “A lot of investment is required to set up the infrastructure for online learning. During the first wave, we had all our basics in place with a smooth transition from offline to online. While we were planning to invest in more advanced technologies, however, institutes were asked to prepare for a physical reopening. And now we are back to our emphasis on the online mode. Even private institutes which are ready to invest will be able to plan better if the government comes up with a slightly longer plan,” said Hrridaysh Deshpande vice-chancellor DY Patil Group. At this point, most prominent boards are yet to lay down a formal strategy to address concerns around learning losses in the coming months. While the Maharashtra state board did release a set of guidelines for mitigating learning losses in February 2021, the specific details about what schools need to do to assess learning outcomes are yet to be released. “Right now, teaching has sadly remained a formality. We don’t know if the children have learnt what is taught and fear a lot of challenges in the coming years,” said a teacher from a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/online-learning-will-have-impact-on-students-future-planning-essential-experts-101619979417695.html

The gram panchayat has decided to pay for testing, hospitalisation, treatment and medicines of Covid-19 patients from the village. The administration has asked the families to send bill receipts to them which will be reimbursed. The panchayat said the initiative is to stand strong by the villagers to encourage people to get tested to ensure timely treatment to avoid fatalities.Khativali village in Shahapur taluka, Thane has a population of around 6,000 villagers; around 45% of them are tribals. There is only one Covid treatment centre in Shahapur taluka and it is 8kms away from the village. If the centre gets full, villagers do not have any other option but to get admitted in a private hospital, but as they could not pay such a huge amount they would avoid going there. Therefore, this administration has assured to pay the hospital bills. There are 6,660 cases of Covid-19 reported in Shahapur Taluka of which 241 are currently active. Around 170 people have died due to the infection. Devidas Jadhav, 43, member of Khativali gram panchayat, said, “Since last year, most of our villagers have lost their jobs. We completely banned the entry of outsiders, and still some people got infected. Twelve of our villagers succumbed to Covid in the first wave. Since the past one month, two to three villagers are testing positive every day. They had gone out mostly to look for jobs. They or their families do not have the proper resources to get tested or treated. So we have decided to help them for the same.”The panchayat also provides ration to the villagers who need them. Gajanan Shinde, a villager, said, “This announcement has provided relief to us as most of us have earned very little in the past one year, and we are using the same for daily groceries. To arrange money for treatment is really a task but now we are little relaxed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gram-panchayat-in-shahapur-to-pay-for-covid-19-treatment-of-every-villager-101619979418278.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||SpiceJet air crew starts online petition against management over pay cut||A day after low-cost carrier SpiceJet deducted up to 50% salary for April for all its employees, citing the second wave of Covid-19 as reason, its air crew on Sunday started an online petition against the management. The online petition stated that despite risking their lives and doing their duties, the employees are underpaid and that some who worked full-time have received very small amounts as their salary. The airline has, however, stated that part of the salary was deferred and will be paid to the employees later. Airline sources said ground staff, cabin crew, commercial staff and pilots were paid only 10% to 50% of their April salary.The petition read, “We all who file this petition want to make a change in how an airline company in India sees their employees...as per the latest Covid-19 survey from Indian Central government, people aged less than 35 years (75% of Covid cases) are most like to get infected with this deadly virus. No matter what survey says or news channel telecasts, we (cabin crew) risked our life to go on-board. We quarantined ourselves, we followed guidelines, we took care of customers on-board...why wouldn’t we speak for ourselves now?... All employees of SpicJet received their salary with massive 50% deduction. Some employees who worked full-time received only ₹12,000…”The cabin crew said that the salary cuts by the airline were mentally affecting them.SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline chairman and managing director Ajay Singh has decided to forgo his entire salary and that the airline is ensuring that most of their colleagues, including those in the lowest pay grade, are not affected at all by this deferment and will be paid salaries in full. “The deadly Covid-19 second wave has resulted in the country’s worst-ever crisis with the aviation sector again bearing the biggest brunt. Unfortunately, we have been forced to implement certain tough measures to secure the long-term interest of the SpiceJet family. There will be no salary cut for any employee. However, under these extreme and unavoidable circumstances we are enduring, we are forced to implement a graded salary deferment for some of our employees. This is only a temporary measure and the deferred salary amount will be paid by the company in full once the condition improves,” the airline spokesperson added.In an internal communication to its pilots on Saturday, the airline said the domestic passenger traffic across all airlines, which had peaked at more than 300,000 passengers on a daily basis in mid-February, has now drastically dropped to less than 130,000 passengers per day. “..The salary deferment (of between 10% and 50%) in the higher pay grades is a temporary measure to survive this economic crisis and the deferred salaries will be paid by the company once the conditions improve,” read the internal mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spicejet-air-crew-starts-online-petition-against-management-over-pay-cut-101619979357658.html

02-05-2021||Other||Pharma firms must supply Remdesivir vials to Maharashtra on time: Bombay HC||Taking note of chaos prevailing due to multiple procurement methods of Remdesivir vials, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Sunday directed the chief secretary of Maharashtra to act immediately and remove the confusion leading to delay in getting the life-saving drug for Covid-19, from seven manufacturers. The HC also directed the chief secretary to immediately go for centralised procurement and distribute the drug in a fair and equitable manner to all the districts, consistent with the order of the Centre.Taking pharmaceutical companies to task for their failure to adhere to the supply schedule, the HC made it clear that all the seven manufacturers of Remdesivir shall supply vials to the state as per the allotment guidelines, and only after the quota allotted to them is fulfilled, they can distribute remaining vials to private parties. In case of any violation, the FDA has been directed to prosecute such an erring pharma company for violating directions of the court and for jeopardising precious human life.All pharma companies have been directed to submit their daily production figures of Remdesivir and life-saving drugs to tackle Covid to the FDA commissioner and upload on their website. Any violation will attract criminal prosecution, the high court warned.The HC also expressed unhappiness over curtailment in state quota by Centre for the next nine days and asked the Centre to consider its decision. As per the latest order issued by the Union health ministry, Maharashtra will cumulatively get 809,500 vials up to May 9 which includes the earlier 4.35 lakh vials. The HC noted that such reduction is not consistent with a reduction in the number of active cases in the state which still has the highest number of active patients in the country.Hours before Nagpur bench of Bombay HC began its emergent hearing on Sunday afternoon for non-compliance of its order to supply 20,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur, Akola and Bhandara districts, the state government quietly dispatched 19,128 vials while by Sunday afternoon another trench of 960 vials was received.The FDA commissioner Parimal Singh and Nodal Officer Vijay Waghmare informed a division bench consisting of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote about this development during the special hearing. Since Nagpur has not received a single vial in the last two days so also districts of Bhandara and Akola, forcing the high court to release 15,000 vials for Nagpur, 2,000 for Bhandara and 3,000 vials for Akola as interim relief without disturbing the regular quota. But till Saturday night there was no word about Remdesivir allotment, after which Amicus Curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar moved an application seeking urgent hearing and action for breach of the order.The machinery swung into action and before the hearing commenced informed the HC about the receipt of 19,128 vials received for three districts and allotment of 960 more vials by Sunday evening.The HC made it clear that state FDA must ensure supply of allotted quantity as well quantity not supplied during last 10 days to all districts every day and procure it from pharma companies while casting duty on companies to adhere to supply schedule given to them or else coercive action will be ordered against them for any deliberate default.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pharma-firms-must-supply-remdesivir-vials-to-maharashtra-on-time-bombay-hc-101619979057752.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees slight dip in cases, positivity rate up||Maharashtra witnessed a drop in the Covid-19 cases on Sunday to 56,647 from over 60,000 cases in the preceding six days. The state reported a further drop in weekly cases, establishing the government’s claim of stabilisation of the cases. The state tally stands at 4,722,401 and the death toll at 70,284 after the addition of 669 fresh deaths.The curve of the Covid-19 cases in the state appears to be stabilising as the daily average of cases dropped to 61,053 in the last one week from April 26 to May 2 by reporting 427,374 new cases.The previous week, April 19-April 25, reported a total of 460,689 new Covid-19 cases with a daily average of 65,812 cases per day. According to the state authorities, the lowering of figures has helped in reducing the load on the health infrastructure like hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, ventilators as well as various medicines which were scarce for the last couple of week. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said that cases have come down this week. “We have seen the new cases stabilising in 19 districts across the state. The numbers will come down further in the next 15 days. The stabilisation will be replicated across the other districts too in the coming days,” he added.“This trend has reduced the load on our medical infrastructure also. There is no problem now with the oxygen supply and people are the hospital beds are available to patients,” said Lahane. In the last few weeks, due to a surge in Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths was due to a shortage of beds, oxygen cylinders and ventilators as well as medicines like Remdesivir. State authorities have projected that as many as 28 districts will fall short of the required isolation beds, 25 in oxygen beds, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) beds by May 11 if the number of active cases rose as per the prediction. As many as 13 districts will face shortage of ventilators if the active cases rose. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Sunday reported 3,629 new Covid-19 cases, and 79 deaths, taking the tally to 655,997, and the toll to 13,294. There are 61,436 active Covid-19 cases in the city. In the last 24 hours, Mumbai has conducted 28,636 tests. The daily positivity rate for Sunday is 12.67%. So far, Mumbai has conducted 5,490,241 tests, with an average positivity rate of 11.9%. On Sunday, 5,542 Covid patients recovered and were discharged. The present recovery rate is 89%. Mumbai’s doubling rate has now increased to 103 days, from as low as 45 days reported in the first two weeks of April. The overall growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the city is 0.66%.Dr Amin Kaba, who is associated with several hospitals, said, “In urban pockets, we have sufficient infrastructure, but this is not the case with rural areas where even basic medical care is very hard to find.” He said there is an acute shortage of medical professionals which has contributed to the rise. “We have noticed that by the time the patient is shifted to a far-flung urban centre, he has lost precious time. This needs to be rectified,” said Kaba. The state has currently 6,68,353 active Covid-19 patients in which Pune leads the tally with 1,09,254 cases followed by 72,503 cases. Similarly, the state has recorded 70,284 deaths of which 13,294 deaths followed by 9,709 in Pune. There were 2,57,470 tests conducted in the last 24 hours in the state with a positivity rate of 22%.

02-05-2021||Pune||BJP defeats MVA candidate to snatch seat from NCP in Pandharpur-Mangalwedha bypoll||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Samadhan Autade defeated his rival candidate and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominee backed by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Bhagirath Bhalke in a closely contested bypoll for Pandharpur-Mangalwedha seat in Maharashtra’s Solapur district. Bhalke’s defeat dealt a major setback to Maha Vikas Aghadi government, especially the NCP, as the seat was represented by party legislator Bharat Bhalke whose demise due to post-Covid-19 complications in November last year necessitated polls here. The NCP chose Bharat’s son Bhagirath Bhalke against local businessman Autade, factoring sympathy wave in view of sitting legislator’s demise even as voters preferred otherwise. Autade was polled 1,09,450 votes compared to 1,05,717 votes to Bhalke at the end of counting, which saw neck-and-neck fight between the two contestants. While Autade won the polls, margin remained slender till 38th round when BJP candidate was declared winner by a difference of 3,733 votes. Political observers said that the victory for BJP in bypoll is a major boost for the party as its nominee defeated candidate who had backing of three parties – NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena. “Despite NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena coming together, these parties could not ensure victory for Bhalke in first directly fought battle after MVA came to power in 2019. This will be projected by BJP that it can defeat MVA even if three parties jointly field a candidate,” said Abhay Deshpande, political observer. From NCP, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had personally anchored the election for party, right from selecting the candidate to campaigning here for a week in a row. “The entire MVA government was against me. However, voters of Pandharpur - Mangalwedha sided with me while Prashant Paricharak and other BJP leaders took every possible effort to make this victory possible,” said Autade after the results were declared. Leader of opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis while congratulating Autade, said, “Pandharpur voters showed the mirror to MVA and its misgovernance of one and half years. Despite using all its might, MVA nominee lost elections.” Earlier in 2019, Autade had fought assembly polls and garnered over 54,000 votes as an independent candidate. During this election, Autade was extended all possible support by BJP leader and its legislator in the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) Prashant Paricharak. Prashant’s uncle Sudhakar Paricharak, who died of Covid in August last year helped BJP through sympathy vote. Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said Pandharpur result is unlikely to have an impact on state politics. “It is true that we should have won this bypoll when all three parties had come together. However, local factors seem to have influenced the outcome,” said Raut. Besides issue of pending water pipeline project for Mangalwedha, the dues not paid to cane farmers by Bhalke controlled sugar factory went against the NCP candidate. Congress leader Satej Patil said, “Multiple factors may have contributed to the loss of MVA candidate. I don’t think we fielded a wrong candidate but there may have been some laxity in taking all elements along.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-defeats-mva-candidate-to-snatch-seat-from-ncp-in-pandharpur-mangalwedha-bypoll-101619972397560.html
02-05-2021||Pune||Pune police question women who received funds meant for sex workers||Two days after the Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh initiated a probe in the misappropriation of funds meant for sex workers, the Pune police have begun questioning women who received the money. Besides Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi, the police have now found that some women living in Dattawadi slums have received ₹15,000 in their accounts. This was brought to their notice by Nitin Waghmare, founder Akhil Bharatiya Bahujan Sena. The amount which was released by the Maharashtra government as financial aid to be paid to sex workers as part of an amount of ₹7.94 crore, it was deposited into the bank accounts of maids and waste pickers living in Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi and now according to police, in women in Dattawadi Slums. “We are still following up on the information received and in the process of interviewing the women who received the money. So far, we have interviewed 10 women but yet to get to the culprits,” said police inspector K Indulkar of Dattawadi police station. Meanwhile, the women in Mohammadwadi are feeling embarrassed and undignified for being recognized as sex workers. “I never realized what I was getting into when I signed on the form that the woman gave me,” said Lata Yedke, who is afraid of breaking this news to her husband who is away in the village. “I work hard as a maid and when these women approached us saying that the government and foreigners together have started a scheme for poor women, I thought this could help me get out of the rented place we have, but instead it has embarrassed me. I would not even like to touch this money and I want to return it at the earliest,” she added. Gangubai Gaikwad who was made aware that the funds were meant for the sex workers, said, “I am glad I did not receive the money. I was upset earlier when few of the women in my Vasti got it but now I don’t want it at all.” Vijaya Kundale, recalls a woman sitting with a neighbour and all of them filling up forms, so when approached, she too filled up the form. “I was told that by giving my ration card copy, aadhar card and bank details, I was going to get money from government. I lost my work during Covid last year, so I thought this was good, but now, it has become shameful and feel undignified to be even part of this scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-question-women-who-received-funds-meant-for-sex-workers-101619972337444.html

02-05-2021||Pune||In a first, uGMRT reveals patchy environment of a rare cosmic explosion||The scientists from the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) Pune used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to determine that AT 2018 cow, the first of a newly discovered class of cosmic explosions has an extremely patchy environment. This is the first observational evidence of inhomogeneous emission from an FBOT. The origins of FBOTs are still under debate, but proposed models include explosion of a massive star, collision of an accreting neutron star and a star, merger of two white dwarfs. The FBOT AT2018cow was discovered on June 16, 2018. At a distance of about 215 million lightyears, the ‘cow’ showed luminosities much greater than that of normal supernovae. Prof Poonam Chandra from NCRA-TIFR and Dr AJ Nayana, a former Ph.D. student of Prof Chandra both carried out radio observations of AT 2018cow with the uGMRT to determine the properties of its extended environment and emission region. “Our study has tremendously benefited by the unique low-frequency capabilities of the uGMRT. The uGMRT observations of the ‘cow’ played a unique role in finding the non-uniform density around this explosion. Our work provides the first observational evidence of inhomogeneous emission from an FBOT. The density of the material around this explosion falls drastically around 0.1 light-year from the transient. This indicates that the progenitor star of AT2018cow was shedding mass much faster towards its end of life.” said Nayana. AT 2018cow is also unusual in that it has been observable in the radio for a very long time. The longer one can observe the post explosion emission, the more distance the material that was ejected during the explosion has travelled. This allows one to study the large-scale environment of the source. Both Dr Nayana and Prof Chandra have been observing the ‘cow’ for two years with the uGMRT to understand its properties. “This is the first FBOT seen for this long at low radio frequencies and the uGMRT data gave crucial information about the environment of this transient. This is the beauty of low-frequency radio observations. One gets to trace the footprints of the progenitor system much before it exploded. It is interesting that the material from the explosion is moving with speed greater than 20 per cent speed of light even after ∼ 257 days post-explosion, without any deceleration.” said Prof Chandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/in-a-first-ugmrt-reveals-patchy-environment-of-a-rare-cosmic-explosion-101619972157480.html

This means a reduction of 60,500 vials of Remdesivir for Maharashtra," the judges said.The bench observed that such a reduction in the allocation of Remdesivir vials to Maharashtra is not consistent with the number of active cases in the state."On April 30, the number of active cases in Maharashtra was 6,72,000 while the same is 6,64,000 as of May 1, which means active cases reduced hardly by about 1.2 per cent, whereas the reduction in the allocation of vials to Maharashtra for the aforesaid period is by 14.5 per cent."This mismatch needs to be reconsidered and removed by the Central government,"the bench said.The high court also said that the Additional Solicitor General of India Ulhas Aurangabadkar would take instructions from the Union government on this issue and apprise the bench.In the same vein, the bench asked the Centre to reconsider its decision regarding the state-wise allocation of Remdesivir for the aforesaid period of ten days (from May 1 to 9) and increase the quota for Maharashtra to make it consistent with the reduced number of active cases.Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Parimal Singh submitted in the HC that they will issue new orders ensuring that the districts affected by Remdesivir shortage will get the supply and the backlog is cleared.Singh told the HC the FDA will meet representatives of pharma companies and ensure they follow the directions at the district level.The bench directed that no pharmaceutical company, which is duty-bound to supply Remdesivir vials as per the Centre's orders dated April 24 and May 1 to different states and Maharashtra, shall supply the drug to private purchasers unless the daily quota of the supply allocated to each of these companies is fulfilled."Only after that and in case of any remaining balance of Remdesivir vials, the pharma company concerned shall supply the vials to private purchasers till the fulfilment of orders received by them," the bench said.The bench directed the health secretary of Maharashtra and state FDA commissioner to ensure that these directions are followed by pharmaceutical companies concerned.The HC also directed the pharma firms to send their daily production figures to the state FDA commissioner and also upload them on respective websites.The bench warned of strict legal action for violation of its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/increase-allocation-of-remdesivir-to-maharashtra-hc-tells-centre-101619967709712.html

The attack happened around 8:30am near Bopdev ghat in Kondhwa area of Pune. The arrested man was identified as Dinesh Shirpat Dhumak (39), a resident of Bavdhangaon in Pune who repairs water-filter for a living. A local court has remanded the man to two days in police custody. “She works as a housemaid and due to Covid regulations; she had started living in the building where she works. She had come to visit. The people from nearby area heard her screaming and informed the police,” said police sub inspector Vaishali Gapat of Kondhwa police station who is investigating the case. Dhumak picked up the woman on his motorbike and took her to the spot near Bopdev ghat where he stopped his bike and asked her to show where her workplace was. When the woman refused to reveal where she went to work, Dhumak allegedly said to the woman that he wanted to see her face and asked her to take her mask off. As the woman took her mask off, he retrieved the bottle he was carrying and flung the liquid at her, aiming for her face. However, as the woman ducked the liquid landed on her left eye and left hand.

Senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange of Kothrud police station received a call at 8:30am from Krushna Hospital that the hospital was left with oxygen supply that could last only for 30-40 minutes, according to a statement issued by Kothrud police station. The hospital was not able to source oxygen and had no place to shift the 20 patients on oxygen support. “After receiving the call, senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange sent officials of Kothrud police station to the hospital and arranged for four jumbo cylinders from two nearby hospitals -Suryaprabha Hospital and Sahyadri Hospital,” read the statement. However, those four jumbo cylinders were not going to last for long for the patients on ventilator as well as oxygen support. The gravity of the situation was relayed to Pournima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3 and Gajanan Tompe, assistant commissioner of police. The senior officers rallied local police station officials and Special police officers (SPOs) who arranged for a dura cylinder from Shivajinagar and got a crane as well as a vehicle to carry it to Kothrud. The police escorted the dura cylinder to Krushna hospital in time to save the patients from shortage of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kothrud-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-police-avert-tragedy-101619967777302.html

Former employee union leader and chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum (JKCSF), Abdul Qayoom Wani expressed resentment over the dismissal calling it a jab on the employees’ integrity.“The dismissal of Idrees Ahmad, teacher of a Kupwara school, and other two employees came as a strange shiver to the whole Kashmir society under the shade of Article 311 and neglecting all other disciplinary service rules that govern the employees’ performance and conduct of his service career,” Wani said.“This type of dismissal from government service remains ambiguous until facts are made public and/or subjected to the judicial system for legal proceedings,” he said.The JKCSF has demanded that the decision must be revoked and reviewed judiciously under the service norms so that justice can prevail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-a-first-kashmir-teacher-dismissed-in-interest-of-security-of-state-101619966578163.html

02-05-2021||Dehradun||Salt bypoll: BJP’s Mahesh Jeena wins election, defeats Cong’s Ganga Pancholi||Bharatiya Janata Party’s Mahesh Jeena won the Salt bypoll in Uttarakhand, defeating Congress’s Ganga Pancholi, with over 4,600 votes, as per the statistics. Jeena bagged 21,874 votes while his rival from Congress got 17,177 votes. The rest of the five candidates could register less than 1,000 votes. The number of people who opted for NOTA (None of the Above) was 721, while the number of rejected votes was 63, said district administration officials. Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, said victory in Salt shows people in the state continue to repose their trust in the BJP and its working. “This is very clear now that in the elections next year, people will again vote for the BJP. This win would be a tribute to Jeena as his brother will now carry forward his dreams of development in the area. He has fought for the development of Salt and people never forgot that Congress tried various tricks in its bag to mislead people. People of Salt constituency have given a befitting reply to them,” he said. Suryakant Dhasmana, state Congress vice president said the party lost the elections as the BJP played the ‘sympathy card’. “Their campaigning was not focussed on the main issues faced by the people of the state. They just focussed on the sympathy factor. Otherwise, tell in which area of the state is the youth happy with the state government? The youth wants employment, relief from the price hike, better health infrastructure. Where is all that? People are dying because it is not there”, he said. The by-election for Salt constituency in Uttarakhand’s Almora district, which has 96,241 voters - 49,193 make and 47,048 female voters, was held on April 17. The constituency was lying vacant after BJP MLA Surendra Singh Jeena succumbed to Covid-19 last November, necessitating fresh elections. The BJP fielded Jeena’s elder brother Mahesh Jeena as its candidate, while from Congress’ side Ganga Pancholi was given a ticket. Pancholi stood against Surendra Singh Jeena in the 2017 state assembly polls but lost by about 3,000 votes. As a litmus test ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year, both parties tried hard to woo the voters with senior party leaders from both parties holding poll rallies in support of their respective candidates. During the campaigning, the BJP focussed on its achievements, development plank, good work done by their deceased legislator and the promise that if their candidate is elected, they will redress all the issues faced by the people of the area. Congress focussed on highlighting that BJP made tall promises of development and employment to the public of the state during the poll campaigning in 2017, but failed on every aspect of development in the last four years of its rule. Congress tried to make unemployment its main election issue. MM Semwal, political expert and professor of political science at Garhwal Central University, Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal, said results of this bypoll have hinted at the public mood for the next assembly polls. “It was also the first test for both CM Tirath Singh Rawat and BJP state president Madan Kaushik who have been newly appointed. And this results will force Congress to evaluate itself for the next year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/salt-bypoll-bjp-s-mahesh-jeena-wins-election-defeats-cong-s-ganga-pancholi-101619965978233.html
02-05-2021||Lucknow||Bahraich man, friends gift oxygen generator machine to medical college||A 40-year-old businessman and his friends pooled in money to buy an oxygen generator machine and gifted it to the government medical college in Bahraich, enabling Covid-19 positive patients with fluctuating SPO2 (oxygen saturation) levels to visit the Level-1 Covid care facility there to get relief.Sarwar Ali, who took the initiative and emerged as an “oxygen man” for the residents of Bahraich battling the second wave of Covid-19, said he was shocked by the death of kin, friends and neighbours.“Daily, I received information about the death of Covid-19 patients after the second wave hit the district. In a majority of the cases, the patients’ family members said that the deaths were due to a drop in oxygen level or the unavailability of oxygen support in hospitals,” he said.“Experts and doctors told me if the oxygen supply was not boosted in hospitals or oxygen support was not provided to patients immediately, more people will fall prey to SARS-CoV-2,” he said.“I discussed the issue with my friends and whether anything could be done to make oxygen available to patients in dire need of it. We searched the Internet for oxygen supply, air separator plants and other oxygen manufacturing machines. We decided to gift an oxygen machine to the government hospital where a majority of the poor patients are admitted,” said Ali who has done Masters in Computer Application (MCA) from Lucknow University and belongs to Bahraich.“We zeroed in on an oxygen generator machine manufactured by a South Korean company. We contacted the company’s agent in Gurugram (Haryana). He told us the machine will cost ₹20 lakh. With the contribution of friends, we pooled in ₹16 lakh. We contacted the company agent again and urged him to cut the price on humanitarian grounds. To our surprise, he agreed. The money was transferred into the company’s account on April 15,” he said.Now, the task was to transport the machine from Gurugram to Bahraich immediately, he said.“We informed district magistrate Shambhu Kumar about our endeavour. He assured all help and deputed the joint magistrate to accomplish the task. Within four days, the machine was transported to Bahraich. The company’s engineer was called from Ambedkar Nagar to install the plant on the state medical college premises. On April 23, the oxygen generator was operational, providing oxygen to the supply line of Covid wards. It has the capacity of producing 64,800 litres of oxygen in 24 hours. A large number of patients are surviving on this oxygen support,” he said.The district magistrate said the initiative taken by Ali and his friends was laudable. He said, “Other people should also come forward to help people in distress.”Sarwar said Uttar Pradesh and the rest of the country were facing an unprecedented crisis due to Covid-19.“It’s impossible for the government to provide health facilities and services to all patients. People, particularly those who have money, should assist the government and the poor in fighting the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bahraich-man-friends-gift-oxygen-generator-machine-to-medical-college-101619964957191.html

Their kin alleged that the deaths were caused due to shortage of oxygen, a claim strongly denied by the administration as well as the hospital management. Financial commissioner, health and medical education department, Atal Dulloo appointed divisional commissioner, Jammu Dr Raghav Langer, as the inquiry officer and asked him to probe the circumstances leading to the deaths at the hospital. Consequently, Langer constituted a three-member committee, comprising director health services (Jammu), director industries and commerce (Jammu), and superintendent engineer, mechanical engineering department, Jammu, the officials said. One among them is also a member of a panel constituted last month to ensure an adequate and timely supply of medical oxygen to hospitals. The three-member committee was formed to assist the inquiry officer during the proceedings of the probe, they said. Following the death of the four patients, their family members created a ruckus and accused hospital management of negligence that led to the death of their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-orders-probe-forms-3-member-panel-after-4-covid-19-patients-die-at-jammu-hospital-101619963817742.html

Our country is suffering from oxygen and vaccine shortage. In such a condition, it is important to check the spread of Covid-19,” said Mahipal Singh Yadav, a farmer and social activist, who set up the steam facility. Yadav said, “I too wanted to do something for society at this juncture so I decided to develop the community steaming facility free of cost to help people.” 45-year-old Yadav calls his facility “Bhaap Ka Langar”. He set up the facility with 200 litres capacity barrel, an oven and an LPG gas cylinder on a handcart. He boils the water to generate steam which is then let out through a plastic pipe. Yadav said, “Since taking steam is very beneficial in cold and cough, it helps in checking the spread of Covid-19. I am providing this service for two hours every morning and evening”. He parks his steam facility on a handcart near a private bus station on Haldwani road from 8 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 6 in the evening. His motto is to provide steam to daily wagers and other factory labourers and agricultural field workers on their way to work and on their way back home. “It is not certain how long the ‘Bhaap Ka Langar’ will run but I will try to keep it running till the second wave of Covid-19 ends,” Yadav added. Sony Nagi, another social activist from Bazpur said, “Everybody knows how important taking steam is for health. Yadav’s ‘Bhaap Ka Langar’ is playing an important role in maintaining people’s health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-man-starts-bhaap-ka-langar-to-help-people-amid-covid-19-surge-101619959377661.html

With this initiative, the state will be well equipped in oxygen generation with nine plants in all.These dedicated plants will be established at identified government hospitals in district headquarters across various states/UTs. The procurement will be done through the health ministry.Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, while thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said, “The allocation of funds to install 551 PSA #Oxygen Generation Plants in public health facilities across the country through #PMCares is a propitious decision to curb the oxygen crisis & help those in need especially during these times.

In the process, many cops have succumbed to the virus. But now, Delhi Police has set up three special Covid Care Centres, one each in Shahdara, Rohini and Dwarka, for its personnel and their families. “These centres come as a relief since they are dedicated to our needs,” says Sudesh, wife of Delhi Police constable Bijender Deswal, adding, “My husband became Covid positive last year. Though he didn’t have to get hospitalised, but we were very worried. Today, there are so many police officers whose families or they themselves are battling Covid-19. So the initiative to open these Covid centres comes as a blessing because we can be now assured that incase we get infected, we will be taken care of!” “These facilities have been made for immediate relief of patients before they find admission in the hospital. While Shahdara and Rohini are operational, Dwarka PTS will also soon be operational,” says Chinmoy Biswal, DCP Crime and PRO, Delhi Police. He adds that “Delhi Police resources will cater to the facility and provide medicines, an ambulance for emergencies, and a police team under an Inspector, which will look after the facility and coordination in each place.”At Shahdara Covid Care Centre — the biggest of the three — R Sathiyasundaram, DCP Shahdara, informs that 16 police personnel and their family members are quarantined at present. He adds, “We have a capacity of 78 beds, including 30 oxygen beds. We have one doctor and one nurse from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, who are working round the clock, along with four more medical personnel. A special corona kit is also being made available to the personnel getting admitted, which includes essentials such as sanitisers, handwash, masks, slippers and other toiletries. We are trying to ensure that the health parameters of people who are Covid positive can be stabilised before hospitalisation.” Collaborating on this project with Delhi Police, is a Delhi-based non-profit organisation, Sewa Bharati, to provide oxygen cylinders to these Covid Care Centres. Hemant Kumar, vice-president of the organisation, says, “Delhi Police is doing immense amount of work to ensure law and order in the city while also providing basic necessities to the people. We had a dialysis centre where we had certain oxygen cylinders that had been donated to us; we are now providing these to Delhi Police’s Covid Care Centres, as well as other underprivileged patients around the Capital.

Most searched for information available online related to investing and trading. It was a strange coincidence that when the wheels of the economy had stopped moving, the stock markets were going through the roof. The common man could not understand this irony and many thought it was just a bubble created by some crazy investors.However, one year down the line, it has now been established with data and statistics that even during the harshest lockdown, common people overcame the “market-fear” and were willing to invest money and trade online. One such trend has also been highlighted by subscription-based online financial education platform LearnApp.com.The online education start-up founded by Prateek Singh has seen a huge surge in first-time investors who have subscribed to learn about trading and investing. 0.15 million Puneites registered for a variety of courses in the one year of the pandemic, 2020-21, on the platform. This is 2x higher than the subscribers from Mumbai. Their data also reveals that 8 per cent of these subscribers are women, aged between 25-34 years of age. While the world was crippled with financial insecurities, first-time investors from Pune saw this as an opportunity to learn something new and grow.In the beginning...Singh says, “In the summer of 2007, I had my first tryst with the whole concept of trading. My father opened a Demat account for me, and my first trade was in a company called Milk Food. That was followed by the global market crash of 2008 and from there on, it took me about six years to achieve profitability consistently. Ideally, it shouldn’t have taken that long, but the reality was there weren’t any resources to learn from for a new market participant. I had to make those mistakes and learn from them.”“Not only was I passionate about trading, but I also wanted to build a platform where people can learn from my experience. I founded a start-up called Market Scientist in 2014, with the idea of creating videos and blogs teaching personal finance, business, investing and trading. There were a bunch of people who thought videos will never work. As an entrepreneur, I wanted to build something and measure the results with real users, rather than spend my time listening to opinions. I moved on from Market Scientist and decided to launch LearnApp in 2018 with Ankush Oberoi, Swati Sharma and Sohail Alam.”Lockdown experienceWhen the lockdown was announced, people had more time since they were working from home, and at the same time, there was a lot of activity in the stock market as well. Says Singh, “This is where we saw two changes in customer behaviour - first, online became an acceptable mode of learning; second, online webinars became an extended form of learning. We were already leaders in the financial space and with the help of these two, we were able to reach more people.”“In the initial days of the lockdown we saw a spike in users, but the same users didn’t stay with us by end of April. To be honest, until last year there were several small issues that needed to be fixed because of which we saw lower completion rates. We had to fix that, and the only way we could that was by speaking to each of our users by taking their feedback and iterating each of our courses. It took us a while to fix these bugs, but as soon as they were fixed, our completion rates went from less than 30 per cent to over 50 per cent.”Explaining further, he says, “Our yearly subscription model also helped increase the completion rate and acquire new subscribers during the lockdown. Users had more time to explore the platform and they began to love the content we were creating, giving us a great completion rate. Many new users who were looking forward to learning about markets reached out to LearnApp and took their first online course with us.”Taking care of his team was also a priority for Singh. He said, “The environment in March 2020 was uncertain and a lot of businesses were shutting down. To make sure our teammates do not have to worry about their jobs we started paying salaries two days early and offered micro-loans if someone needed help in their family. This really helped build trust and remove uncertainties that they may have had about their future. In the end, it is the team and the consumers, and catering to them is what kept the business afloat even in the worst of the crisis.”Millenial Money: a global trendAccording to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) data, new dematerialised or demat account additions rose to an all-time high of 10.7 million between April 2020 and April 2021. This is an increase of 2x in new demat accounts opened in FY20-21. Interestingly, not only has there been a surge in the first-time users, global data trends have also shown that in the post pandemic world, younger or millennial investors in India have started opening demat accounts to start trading, in sync with the global trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-punekars-stock-up-on-share-market-lessons-101619952057704.html

He is one of five powerful “Jarkiholi brothers” who wield significant influence over the border district and its politics.Belagavi bypoll was necessitated after the death of four-time parliamentarian Suresh Angadi in September last year.Two of Satish’s brothers, Ramesh and Balachandra, are legislators with the BJP.If the trends hold, the defeat would deal a big blow to Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and is likely to open the floodgates of dissent that has been simmering for some time within his government and party.The Congress, if trends continue, appear to have wrested control of Maski assembly constituency with the imminent defeat of Pratapgouda Patil, one of the 17 legislators who defected to the BJP and helped Yediyurappa to power in 2019. Patil has 24,516 votes as against Basanagouda Turvihal of the Congress who has stormed away with 39,790 votes so far.“It appears that there is an anti-wave against me. I don’t know why since I had done enough developmental work for this constituency,” Patil told reporters in Raichur.A defeat for Patil would go against CM Yediyurappa, who benefitted from the former’s defection, as the latter had assured to reward the turncoats for their favour.Patil had won three times on a Congress ticket before he defected in 2019. However, he had won by just 213 votes in 2018 against Turvihal, who had then contested on a BJP ticket. The candidates switched parties this time around.The only reason for BJP and Yediyurappa to cheer came from Basavakalyana where its candidate Sharanu Salagar was leading with 15,052 votes against Congress’ Mala B Narayanarao who secured 7,900 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/satish-jarkiholi-makes-strong-gains-against-bjp-s-mala-suresh-angadi-in-belagavi-bypolls-101619948156958.html

The injuries on his body indicated he had been beaten mercilessly before being shot dead. Both his hands were also tied to each other, said a doctor at [the district hospital?], where Oraon’s body was taken for post-mortem.“The angry crowd didn’t allow the doctors to conduct post-mortem and forcibly took the body away,” a senior doctor, who didn’t wish to be named, said.Oraon, who unsuccessfully contested from Katihar’s reserved Manihari seat in last year’s assembly elections, was abducted last Thursday very close to his house following which his abductors demanded ₹10 lakh in ransom.While his sister Seema Devi filed a missing report at Khazanchi Hat police station, Oraon’s family also paid the ransom to kidnappers feeling it was likely to safeguard against any threat to his life.“Despite the family paying the ransom of ₹10 lakh, the leader was killed,” said a person close to the family.“Oraon was killed due to a land dispute,” said LJP state general secretary, Shankar Jha, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits.Station house officer of Khazanchi Hat police station Sunil Kumar Mandal claimed they had carried out raids and the murder case will soon be resolved.Three persons including a woman were earlier detained in the case. Police claimed recovery of Oraon’s body was done on the basis of information received from these detainees. “Further probe is underway,” police said.A police officer aware of the developments in the case claimed that the current investigation was driven by two possible motives including land dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/abducted-ljp-leader-found-murdered-in-bihar-violent-protests-break-out-101619946297072.html

He told me my video has hurt religious feelings and I have no right to mock religion. I felt he was right so I apologised and withdrew the video," Kaushal said."I had no intention of hurting anybody's religious feelings. The video had a message against infanticide in the end," the comedian added.A Hind Rakshak spokesperson said Kaushal withdrew the video about Navratri after the organisation issued him a "first and last warning".It was on Eklavya Singh's complaint that Faruqui and some others were arrested in January for a stand-up act at a cafe in Indore.Faruqui was released a month later after the Supreme Court gave him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-comedian-withdraws-video-after-objection-from-outfit-of-bjp-mla-s-son-101619942470901.html

The commission said candidates and their supporters were allowed at the centres only after showing negative Covid-19 reports amid some reports of flouting of the norms. Those, who have had both Covid-19 vaccine shots, were also being allowed.“The results of the village pradhans [heads] election will start coming in from late Sunday night. The results of kshetra [regional] panchayat and zila [district] panchayat members may be available only on May 3 [Monday],” said an SEC official, who did not wish to be named. He said counting started simultaneously in all 75 districts for 58,176 posts of gram pradhan (village heads), 7,32,485 village ward members, and 75,852 kshetra panchayat members along with 3,051 zila panchayat members.“The counting will continue till the last result comes,” he said, adding that the first results may start trickling in from Sunday night.More than 1.2 million candidates were in the fray. As many as 45,00,00 of them tried their luck for the posts of gram pradhans.The guidelines issued by state election commissioner Manoj Kumar on Friday for the counting mandated the setting up of health desks across all the centres. They also directed the availability of medicines and deployment of doctors there. “Anyone showing symptoms like cold, and fever was being denied entry.

Officials said district magistrates have been empowered to take action against those found violating protocols.Earlier, officials held a meeting with heads of different employee associations ahead of the counting to assure them that all Covid protocols would be followed. The aim of the meeting was to build confidence among government teachers and other staff engaged in counting. Dinesh Chandra Sharma, the president of a teachers’ union, said they will abide by the Supreme Court order and take part in counting. “However, if the teachers felt that the Covid protocols were not followed, they will boycott counting.”On Saturday, the Supreme Court refused to stay the counting of votes after taking note of the SEC’s assurance that Covid-19 protocols would be followed across all the counting centres.The court on Friday sought a response from the state government and the SEC on a plea seeking a direction for adherence to Covid-19 protocols during the counting of votes for the four-phase elections that concluded on April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/counting-starts-for-up-panchayat-polls-first-results-by-tonight-101619940476293.html

02-05-2021||Gurugram||Wanted gangster Sube Singh arrested at IGI Airport||The Haryana Police Special Task Force (STF) on Saturday said they arrested wanted gangster Sube Singh Gujjar, 32, from the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Delhi. Gujjar allegedly used to be the right-hand man of another gangster Kaushal. However, after a financial dispute, they parted ways and Gujjar allegedly started targeting Kaushal’s extortion racket. He allegedly took over Kaushal’s gang after he was arrested. Gujjar was wanted in more than 100 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Gurugram, Delhi and Rewari. The police had declared a reward of ₹7.60 lakh for information that led to Singh’s arrest. STF deputy inspector-general Satheesh Balan said Gujjar was arrested after he exited the airport.“We had been monitoring him for the last many months. He was shifting his hideouts from one place to another-- in Chennai, Alwar in Rajasthan, Patna in Bihar and Visakhapatnam. Whe had been close to arresting him too but he evaded us. We got to know Gujjar would be arriving from Goa and a team was sent to arrest him outside the airport,” said Balan. STF inspector Varun Dhaiya said that Gujjar had changed his look and lost weight making it difficult to identify him. “It was a big challenge to get a hold of him. We managed to follow him outside the airport and caught hold of him before he could board a cab. He was alone and had ₹3,000 on him,” he said. Sube was declared a proclaimed offender by a district court in April 2018. Singh’s properties comprise two plots, one of 1.3 acres in Bar Gujjar village near Manesar and another of 0.8 acres in Manesar industrial area, both properties were auctioned but police could not find any buyers.In 2019 and 2021, the district administration tried to auction the properties twice. Officials said Gujjar lived in Nepal for over 18 months after he went absconding from Gurugram in 2016 and was running operations from there. He is involved in more than 100 cases of extortions, kidnapping, murder and attempt to murder and is mostly involved in collecting money from traders, jewelers, sweet shop owners, bakery owners and prominent transporters and industrialists, who are scared of complaining to the police. The police added that this month, Gujjar was planning to shift to another place in Rajasthan but he was arrested. Dahiya said Gujjar had shifted eight locations in Goa in the last five months since December 2021 and he never lived in any hotel as he was finding it difficult to make ends meet. “He was initially living in an apartment near north goa, where he lived for nearly two months. Later, he shifted to South Goa and Panjim. His wife also stayed him for a few months but we are yet to verify her whereabouts,” he said. The police said Gujjar did not even trust his friends with his location and never disclosed it to anyone except two of his associates who lived with him in Goa. He had last changed his location on Thursday to come to Delhi to collect money from his associates. According to the police, there are numerous cases of murder, extortion, blackmail and threat calls, made through international numbers, against Gujjar; he has more than 200 cases registered against him in Haryana. Police said Gujjar used internet-based calling to ensure his whereabouts could not be traced. He used voice over internet protocol (VoIP) to make extortion and threatening calls. He was using virtual numbers, i.e., a number without a directly associated line, to make the businessmen feel that they are getting calls from outside India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wanted-gangster-sube-singh-arrested-at-igi-airport-101619927696322.html
02-05-2021||Gurugram||Eight patients die in a private hospital due to oxygen shortage||Eight critical Covid-19 patients died at a private hospital in Sector 56 on Friday after the hospital ran out of oxygen. Relatives of the dead assaulted doctors and hospital staff alleging negligence. Doctors at Kirti Hospital, which has 50 beds for Covid patients, said those who died there were between 40 and 75 years of age. On Saturday, the hospital asked families of all patients to take them elsewhere as it struggled to find oxygen. By evening, the hospital shut its operations. Assistant commissioner of police (Sadar) Aman Yadav said the violence in the hospital occurred at around 11 pm following which a team was dispatched to control the situation. He said that the people had vandalised the hospital. “We organised three oxygen cylinders with the help of Red Cross and the municipal commissioner to save lives of the patients there,” he said adding that 18 more were arranged soon. Although doctors and hospital staff suffered injuries during the attack, no case was registered against anyone, said police. “The doctors failed to provide proper treatment to my brother-in-law and he died due to shortage of oxygen supply,” said a Delhi resident who requested anonymity. The hospital said they had made many attempts at procuring oxygen. “Since (Friday) morning I was informing the municipal corporation of Gurugram [MCG] commissioner (about the oxygen situation), but he ignored my messages and did not respond to my calls either. I had even informed the deputy commissioner but to no avail. I was begging and pleading before all officials to help but no one landed a helping hand and we lost eight patients,” said Dr Swati Rathore, director of Kriti Hospital. Rathore said she had requested families to shift their patients on Friday itself after they failed to get the oxygen but there were no beds available anywhere. “Their oxygen saturation level had reached 65 [safe limit is >95%] and there was no other way to save them except by giving oxygen. We had sent our vehicles to get oxygen refilled but despite waiting for more than 12 hours we did not get a single cylinder. We need at least 60 oxygen cylinders per day but we are hardly getting 10,” she said. “My patients died and the administration should be held responsible as they did not support us.”Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram denied the Rathore’s allegations. “I was not aware of the oxygen status of the hospital nor did the concerned doctors inform me. I received a message at 3 am on Saturday following which I had sent 20 oxygen cylinders,” he said. Garg said he will get an inquiry initiated into the incident. MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh did not respond to the calls and messages. Nandkishore Deoli, whose brother-in-law was admitted in the hospital, said that they were on their way to Dehradun to admit him in a private hospital there. “For the past four days we were in panic as everyday was a challenge to get oxygen. We survived because we had an oxygen cylinder and refilled it on our own. There is no infrastructure and facilities for the patient, we could not leave him there to die,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/eight-patients-die-in-a-private-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619927456292.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Phase 3 of Covid-19 vaccination drive starts at 5 centres in Delhi||The third phase of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) immunisation drive began in the city with at least four private hospitals and a government clinic vaccinating people between the ages of 18 and 44 years.“Today it is more of a symbolic launch of the drive as vaccination has been started only at one centre for those between 18-44 years. We have already received 4.5 lakh doses from the manufacturers and now we are distributing them in all districts. From May 3, we will start the vaccination drive on a large scale in Delhi,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who also visited the clinic in northwest Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar where the government kicked off the immunisation drive phase three.So far, Delhi has received 150,000 doses of Covaxin and 300,000 doses of Covishield, as per documents seen by HT.The drive began across four centres of Max hospital - at Shalimar Bagh, Patparganj, Panchsheel Park and BLK hospital in Rajinder Place, which also comes under the same management. “People came in large numbers for the vaccination drive on Saturday,” said an official from Max hospital.Apollo hospitals, which had earlier said that it will begin the vaccination drive on Saturday, was yet to begin immunisations at the hospital. “Our teams are working to add the hospital to the CoWIN platform. The drive will likely begin from May 3 or 4,” the hospital said. Slots for vaccination at Fortis hospital was shown to be available on Sunday on the government’s CoWIN platform.As many as 45,353 jabs were administered over the last 24 hours in Delhi, according to the daily health bulletin.As per documents seen by HT, which was reported on Saturday, vaccination of those aged 18-44 will begin at 100 schools, and not government hospitals, with each institute hosting five session sites. Each site will be given 150 doses, suggesting a total capacity of 75,000 doses per day. The documents further state that the government plans to increase the number of schools to 274 -- one in each ward of Delhi -- by May 7.With 17 schools/educational institutes as centres and 85 session sites, the West district will have the highest number of vaccination points. The number of centres in this district will be increased to 46 from May 7.Even as private hospitals remained in the dark about whether they will get doses from the Delhi government, some private hospitals handling Covid-19 patients received an order stating that their staff will be deployed in nearby schools for the immunisation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/phase-3-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-starts-at-5-centres-in-delhi-101619911805618.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||10,000 challaned in April for Covid violations in Chandigarh||The residents’ defiance of Covid-19 protocols of social distancing and wearing masks has yielded the police department ₹1.23 crore from fine collection so far this year.Since January, 20,802 residents have been challaned. A major chunk of these challans, however, were issued in April itself: till April 28, 10,843 challans have been issued and ₹60.94 lakh collected as fine, the highest monthly figures since June 2020, when the drive was started.Between June 2020 and December 2020, the police had collected ₹1.01 crore through 18,954 challans issued for various violations.Intensifying the drive, the traffic wing of the Chandigarh Police in March this year had also started issuing challans to people for not wearing masks after the central government had raised concerns over the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city.Consequently, in addition to the personnel posted at police stations on general duty and PCR vehicles, sub-inspector (SI) rank officers of the traffic police were also authorised to challan people not wearing face masks.‘Colonies, markets problem areas’“Colonies and markets are places of primary concern as people tend to ignore the rules more. Roping in market associations and resident welfare associations will definitely make an impact,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, the senior superintendent of police.He added, “People have now started adhering to the safety protocols, but still not wearing masks properly. Anyone wearing the mask improperly by not covering their noses and mouths completely is being checked.”Recently during the hearing of a suo motu plea initiated by the Punjab and Haryana high court, Chandigarh assured the court that people not covering their mouths or noses properly with face masks would be treated at par with those not wearing masks at all, and liable to the same punitive action.As per the data provided by the police, maximum challans were issued for violating social distancing in various markets. Since January this year, the police have challaned 13,546 people for not maintaining social distancing, 4,337 for not wearing masks and 2,509 for spitting in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10000-challaned-in-april-for-covid-violations-in-chandigarh-101619909036125.html

The positivity rate, in a matter of concern, has remained above the 30% mark for 12 days now. Experts recommend a positivity rate below 5%, for an infection to be considered under control in a region.Essential activities, including the sale and supply of food items, groceries, medicines, etc, are allowed during lockdown. There will be no restrictions on the movement of health care workers, frontline workers, government staff, judicial officials, journalists and those seeking medical attention. Services provided by self-employed persons such as plumbers, electricians and those engaged in repairing of water purifiers; courier services; shops that sell educational books for students; and those selling electric fans are also allowed with a valid e-pass for movement.In the last one week, Delhi has recorded at least 25,000 cases daily and a positivity rate of over 30%. Saturday’s numbers took the city’s total tally to 11,74,552 and death toll to 16,559.Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Saturday launched a portal — delhifightscorona.in/donate — for people around the world to donate funds or medical equipment. “Indian citizens and the diaspora have always been at the forefront of helping governments deal with calamities in the country.

02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University defers polling of all constituencies of senate||Panjab University on Saturday decided to postpone the polling dates of all the constituencies of the senate, the apex governing body of the varsity.“Considering all aspects, it becomes infeasible to hold the senate elections on the dates already notified, hence the competent authority has decided to postpone the elections of all the constituencies for the time being,” read the order issued by PU registrar on Saturday.The varsity has said that the new polling schedule will be issued separately after taking into account the latest Covid guidelines of all concerned states—Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.The development comes a day after the varsity postponed the May 3 (Monday) elections after the Punjab government advised it keeping in view the pandemic.Last month, the Himachal Pradesh government also withdrew the permission given to the varsity to set up polling booths in the state for the registered graduate constituency.The polls for the election of six members to the PU senate from the constituencies of faculties were earlier scheduled to be held on April 26, but these were later postponed to May 19.HC had pulled up PU V-C for delay in pollsThe polling schedule was issued by PU last month after the high court had pulled up vice-chancellor Raj Kumar for the delay, asking the varsity to conduct the polls within two months.Ex-senator Navdeep Goyal, who is contesting from faculties, said, “Keeping in view the present circumstances, it is a wise decision taken by the university.”“We understand the sensitivity of the situation and nothing is more important than human life. We hope that elections will be held as soon as the situation allows, unlike last year when the elections were postponed arbitrarily and without any justification,” added another ex-senator, Ashok Goyal.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of PU in which 47 members are elected from various constituencies. The four-year term of the last senate had ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled to start in August last year, these were postponed twice by V-C Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. The varsity is presently functioning without a governing body.The term of the syndicate, too, had ended on December 31 last year, followed by those of the faculty deans on January 31 without selection of their successors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-defers-polling-of-all-constituencies-of-senate-101619903275163.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Dusty winds cause Chandigarh’s air quality to drop||Even as traffic remained minimal on roads due to the weekend curfew, the city’s air quality deteriorated from satisfactory to moderate category following dusty winds on Saturday evening.Recorded at 94 (satisfactory) at the monitoring station in Sector 25 at 6pm on Friday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) went up to 186 (moderate) at 6pm on Saturday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, and between 51 and 100 satisfactory, which may cause breathing discomfort among sensitive people. Between 100 and 200, the AQI is considered moderate, and can trouble people with asthma, lungs and heart diseases.“The AQI shot up on Saturday due to dry winds with lots of dust. This is temporary and it will return to below 100 in a day or two,” said Debendra Dalai, member secretary of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.Rain expected on MondayWhile a western disturbance was active in the region till Saturday, the India Meteorological Department has predicted clear skies in the city on Sunday. But on Monday, there is a chance of light rain up to 20mm owing to another western disturbance. Thereafter, Tuesday will remain cloudy.Following the windy weather, Saturday’s maximum temperature dropped from 39.8°C on Friday to 37°C, which was normal. However, due to the cloudy skies, the minimum temperature went up from 22.2°C to 25.3°C, four notches above normal. In the next three days, highs and lows of 36°C and 25°C are expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dusty-winds-cause-chandigarh-s-air-quality-to-drop-101619903215841.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Hospitals sound alarm again with oxygen perilously short||The oxygen crisis in the national capital worsened on Saturday, with hospitals across the city sounding the alarm as their stocks ran low, on a day when at least 12 people died at Batra Hospital after an 80-minute disruption in oxygen supply.Saturday’s crisis was largely due to another shortfall in Delhi’s supplies, with the Capital once again not receiving its allocated quota of medical oxygen. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the day said Delhi received only 312MT out of its allocated share of 490MT on Friday. This shortfall, he said, has held up the state’s plan to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients.Among the hospitals that ran perilously short of oxygen on Saturday were the state government-run Guru Teg Bahadur and Rajiv Gandhi hospitals. Officials said the two received emergency supplies in the “nick of time.”“We had all our faculty members and resident doctors lined up to give oxygen to patients using small cylinders and even manually in case the hospital ran out. The tanker arrived just in time,” said a senior doctor from GTB Hospital.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19A doctor from Rajiv Gandhi hospital, which is treating 350 patients on critical care beds, said, “We only have ICU beds in the hospital. If the oxygen were to run out, we would not have been able to save all the patients. We have a hand-to-mouth situation with oxygen every day.”Though the hospital has been allocated nearly 13MT of oxygen a day, officials said it doesn’t receive that amount.Oxygen quotas have been “rationed” due to supply shortages, said several hospitals.“The biggest bottleneck is that Delhi requires 700MT of oxygen daily but was allocated 490MT, which never comes. Our requirement (depending on the number of ICU and non-ICU beds) was assessed to be 6.5MT but we were allocated only 4.9MT because of this shortage. In the meantime, because we have more patients, our needs have gone up to 7MT. We can’t refuse patients crying out for help,” said Dr Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director, Batra Hospital.With the government maintaining a reserve of 11MT to resolve crises in hospitals, and allocating 16.8MT for refilling cylinders for hospitals, ambulances, and individuals, the quota of the hospitals had to be reduced further by 7MT, as per an April 29 order on oxygen quotas.Dr CM Bhagat, medical director of Bhagat Chandra hospital in Palam, said, “I am managing with just 50% of the quota. The refiller I have been linked to caters to other hospitals, which need 19MT oxygen. But the firm gets just 8.5MT of supply.” The hospital ran out of oxygen on Saturday evening and managed patients with low-pressure oxygen from a small oxygen generation plant it has. The hospital had to remove two patients from high-flow oxygen systems and manually pump air for five patients on ventilator support.“We have assigned 3 D-type cylinders from Mayapuri Response Point to the hospital. Officials of Bhagat Chandra Hospital are rushing to collect it,” tweeted Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha.Meanwhile, Sant Parmanand hospital said constantly changing linkages to refillers also posed a problem. “We have to run from one refilling station to another. We need more cylinders as several beds have been added to increase capacity for Covid-19 patients. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that oxygen reaches us.”Kejriwal said the shortage has resulted in hospitals across the city sending out SOS calls again. “As against 976 MT needed by Delhi, if only 312MT is being provided, how are things supposed to work out?” he said.“It is only because of lack of oxygen that patients are having to wait for hours or even days outside hospitals or other Covid care facilities... If we get our full quantum of oxygen today, at least 9,000 oxygenated beds will be ready in Delhi within 24 hours,” he said on Saturday.Meanwhile, in another order, the state asked retailers and districts to ensure that procurement or refilling of oxygen cylinders by individuals is allowed only after checking their ID, the patient’s ID as well as production of a doctor’s prescription prescribing medical oxygen to the Covid-19 patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-sound-alarm-again-with-oxygen-perilously-short-101619901555318.html

Since April 1, the district has admitted a total of 40,849 students in its government primary, middle, high and senior secondary schools. The maximum enrollments were seen in Class 10 with 2, 585 students followed by Class 5 with 2, 336 new students. This data was shared by the state education department during a virtual meeting with the district education officials and nodal officials appointed for enhancing enrolment in the state. As per the education department, teachers left no stone unturned to convince parents to send their wards to government schools. From going door-to-door to organising nukkad nataks, the teachers adopted novel methods to maximise enrolments. Special focus was laid on highlighting the facilities available at these government schools, besides the achievements of its existing students.At Government Senior Secondary School, Sekhewal, where 300 of the total 317 new students enrolled this year are from private schools, principal Naresh Kumar said the recent renovations at the school made a lot of difference. “Our school now has a new block with 10 classrooms. We organised special school visits for parents and showed them the latest additions to our facilities. We have comfortable benches for students, projectors in all rooms and many other facilities at par with private schools,” he said. At Government Senior Secondary School, Basti Jodhewal, 340 of the 357 new students are from private schools. The school’s strength has gone up to 1, 891 from 1, 534 last year. School staffers show the wayAs per the education department officials, around 206 teaching and non-teaching employees have led by personal example and got their own children admitted to government schools. The department has decided to reward them for their initiative.Pandemic effectTeachers say many students also shifted from private schools due to the financial troubles their families are facing due to the pandemic. Government schools offer free education up to Class-8 and charge a nominal fee from senior class students. ‘Will continue efforts’District education officer, secondary, Lakhvir Singh, said, “School principals and teachers have come up with innovative ways such as using the public address system and holding nukkad nattaks to make people aware of the improvement in school infrastructure and the quality of education offered in government schools. Principals have been instructed to provide textbooks to the newly enrolled students at the earliest.”Former district education officer, elementary, Rajinder Kaur, and DEO Jaswinder Kaur, said, “Our district has achieved this feat due to the hard work and team spirit of all officials, teachers and principals. We will continue with our efforts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-tops-state-in-enrolling-private-schools-kids-to-govt-facilities-101619901895073.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||In April, 16 healthcare workers contracted Covid daily at Chandigarh PGIMER||As many as 500 health workers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research contracted Covid-19 in April – working out to 16 people a day, putting tremendous pressure on the already hard-pressed workforce. A total of 1,720 health workers of the institute, including doctors, nurses and sanitary staff, have been infected since the pandemic broke out in March last year, with April accounting for around 30% of that number amid the unprecedented spike in cases.Institute’s doctors say not all cases came from staff working in the Covid-19 wards, where proper safety protocol is followed. But, often they cannot take adequate precautions due to the heavy rush in the emergency block. “Almost all hospitals in the vicinity have restricted their emergency services, diverting a huge patient load to our institute. Amid this crisis, it’s not humanly possible to take all precautions, as the staff’s priority is to save lives. Yet, irrespective of all protocols, there is a huge chance of getting infected in the hospital set-up,” said Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson and professor at the hospital’s administration department.According to Dr GD Puri, head of Covid management committee at PGIMER, on most days, staff was working almost 15 hours to provide care to the Covid patients. The surging cases are not only pushing the under-training doctors into extra shifts, but also impacting their training and practice, as more workforce is being diverted to Covid duties. “The case surge has burdened not only the medicine and anaesthesia specialities, which mainly deal with Covid care, but also other specialities not routinely involved in it. This has hampered training of resident doctors,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of Resident Doctors Association at PGIMER. While the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, does not maintain a record of its staff testing positive, around 40 workers at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, are currently in isolation. “Our focus is to provide psychological support to the positive staff. If a worker tests positive, it impacts the morale of their colleagues as well,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department. More nursing posts soughtOverburdened nurses have written to the UT administrator for more posts to deal with the deadly Covid wave. “AIIMS, New Delhi, has around 2,350 beds and 5,800 nurses, whereas PGIMER has 1,948 beds, but only 2,572 nurses. This is taking a heavy toll on us,” stated Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary of hospital’s Nursing Welfare Association in a letter to the UT administrator, seeking 1,500 more nursing posts from the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-april-16-healthcare-workers-contracted-covid-daily-at-chandigarh-pgimer-101619901656550.html

The victim, identified as Amandeep Singh of Giaspura, a student of Class 11, was out for a walk with his friend on Thursday morning when the incident took place. His friend, Sunil Singh, said three bike-borne men waylaid them and tried to snatch Amandeep’s phone. “He resisted and tried to run away but the trio chased him on their bike and stabbed him in a bid to snatch the phone,” said Sunil. As the teen lay on the road bleeding profusely, another morning walker, Nanhi Bano, came forward to help and wrapped her dupatta around Amandeep’s waist to stop the bleeding. Sunil, meanwhile, rang up Amandeep’s parents who reached the spot and rushed him to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital. The teen was then referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, where he succumbed to his injuries on Saturday after fighting for life for two days. Following his death, the family lodged a police complaint. Cops are scanning the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area to trace the accused. Daba station house officer (SHO), sub-inspector Manjinder Kaur said the entire incident was captured on CCTV, but the miscreants’ faces were not visible. Police are now trying to read the number plate on their bike. The victim’s father Mukesh Kumar said he could not inform the police right after the incident as he was caught up with his son’s treatment. Police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code against the unidentified miscreants. Confusion over jurisdiction between three police stations After being informed about the incident, police from three police stations – including Daba, Division number 6 and Sahnewal reached the spot. Cops of all three police stations claimed that the area where the boy was assaulted does not fall within their jurisdiction. Later, the Daba police lodged an FIR and initiated an investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teen-succumbs-to-stab-wounds-inflicted-by-mobile-snatchers-101619900875047.html

A number of government centres had to stop the drive on Saturday afternoon as these ran out of the vaccine stock. Residents were asked to return and inquire again on Sunday. In all, 13, 085 eligible residents got jabbed on Saturday while 53,4,027 residents have been vaccinated in the district till now.As per the health department officials, they are left with only around 2, 200 doses of vaccine for Sunday and there is no certainty over the arrival of fresh stock. While the plans to vaccinate residents above the age of 18 have already been delayed due to shortage of vaccine doses, the administration is also struggling to meet the requirements for residents aged above 45. The vaccination drive will not take place in rural areas and sub-divisions, and will only be carried out at limited sites in the city areas on Sunday. Earlier on April 27 too, the department had run out of stock and only 2, 949 people got the jab against the daily target of vaccinating 18,000 residents. Due to shortage of both the vaccines, only the second dose of Covaxin will be administered at four government centres on Sunday, while Covishield will be administered at nine sites. Some of the vaccination sites for Sunday include Civil Hospital, civil surgeon’s office complex, Mother Child Hospital near Vardhman mills, Model Gram dispensary near old Krishna Mandir, urban primary health centres in Dugri and Jawaddi, Haibowal dispensary, among other points.Before the shortage disrupted operations, the district health department had been conducting the vaccination drive in over 300 government/centres/sites in the district. The shortage had forced the health department to suspend the supply of vaccines to private hospitals in mid-April. Residents visiting the government centres for vaccination have also been facing a harrowing time. Sumita, a resident of Model Town, said, “I went to inquire about the vaccination at Model Town dispensary for my father around 2:30pm on Saturday but the staff said they ran out of stock around 1:30pm. They asked us to come on Sunday. The administration has been encouraging residents to get vaccinated, but they have failed to make the required arrangements.”District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said, “The supply of vaccine was not received on Saturday. We have around 2, 200 doses for Sunday and are in contact with the state government for supply, but there is no certainty as of now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-left-with-just-2-200-doses-for-sunday-uncertainty-over-arrival-of-fresh-stock-101619900515451.html

Active cases climbed from 1,034 on April 1 to 2,655 on April 30 while the recovery rate dropped from 90% to 86%.The positivity rate touched 25% to 30% on some days, which was the highest-ever in the district. Authorities also doubled the number of tests conducted in April.On whether any relief is in sight, an expert in the field, who did not wish to be named, said, “Cases are likely to continue to rise and fatalities will also be reported in May. There might be some respite by the end of the month. However, it is too early to comment.” Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has constituted a committee, which will monitor and supervise the system and check macro-containment zones.

That does not seem to be happening. People who require oxygen support should leave in eight to 10 days subject to the condition of the individual patient, unless the disease worsens,” it said adding “however, it appears that there is choking of beds.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that the government had issued an order to all the hospitals on the procedure to be followed for the discharge of the patients. However, the same is not being followed.He said he could not initiate action or raise this point because he does not have the data.“Our order is not being followed... We should have data because people are under fear...,” argued Mehra. The court noted that while 10% people fall severely ill after getting infected with the virus, only 1% is likely to require greater attention and ICU admission. It said that it isn’t clear as to whether the transition of patients from the ICU to oxygenated beds and further is taking place.The court asked the hospitals to give the data to the amicus curiae who would analyse it further and assist the court on May 6, the next date of hearing. It also asked the Delhi government to update its portal on the number of admissions and discharges every day without fail.It also said that the portal displaying the availability of beds should be updated by bifurcating the beds in the categories of oxygenated and ICU beds, with or without ventilators.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals, had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city. During the proceedings, the bench also sought to know as to why the Delhi government was resisting the help from the Army when the situation had gone out of hand.“Do we say that you don’t want to? The Army has their own machinery, it works at its own level. They are also importing things from Germany.. They will help and take responsibility....Because looking at the past 10 days, we don’t know if (900+MT) would fructify,” said the bench adding “the augmentation could be a collaborative effort with the army so that resources are not wasted”. Mehra said the city government is not resisting the army aid and it is being considered at the highest level. The query was posed by the bench after senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal told the court that the Army can be brought to help the Capital amid the Covid-19 crisis.The bench also said that there is a need for the hospitals to set up their own oxygen plants after several of them came running in SOS conditions, citing shortage of oxygen. It said that even though none had contemplated such a situation, there is a need to have oxygen plants with the hospitals. The suggestion ensued after S Bankata, executive director of Batra Hospital, informed the court that his hospital had run out of oxygen supply for one and half hours and there has been loss of lives.“This is a lesson to be learnt that hospitals should set up their own oxygen plants. We know that everyone wants to keep their profits high, but these are essentials. Maybe you can have 10 rooms less but this is irresponsible,” the court said.Mehra also contended that there is leakage in the tankers being given by INOX, which could lead to loss of lives. However, advocate Aseem Chaturvedi, appearing for INOX, said that they do not have any more tankers.Mehra also informed the court that one Gandhi Hospital on Friday made a false statement about not receiving a single oxygen cylinder for the last 48 hours, despite getting one too many.The hospital’s owner submitted that there was some miscommunication between the management and their lawyer and that there was no intention to make a false statement. The court warned that such false claims shall not be made in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-orders-hospitals-in-delhi-to-submit-details-of-all-admissions-discharges-after-april-1-101619900394447.html

02-05-2021||Other||Delhi Police helpline to now address cheating, harassment complaints||New Delhi: Taking cognisance of media reports and social media posts claiming that ambulance service providers are overcharging and cheating in the name of providing oxygen cylinders and life-saving drugs for treating Covid-19, the Delhi Police on Saturday said the Covid helpline launched by them a fortnight ago will now address calls and complaints regarding all such illegal activities.The city police have already registered two cases of overcharging by ambulance drivers. In one such case registered at Sarita Vihar police station in southeast district, a person was arrested and his ambulance seized on Saturday for allegedly charging ₹8,500, nearly ten times more than the actual rate, for shifting a patient to Holy Family hospital from Apollo hospital -- a distance of 3.5kms. Another case was registered at Sonia Vihar police station in northeast Delhi after a receipt of ₹10,000 charged by an ambulance service provider for a 4km journey was widely circulated on social media, said police. The Delhi Police helpline 011-23469900, which has 10 lines to facilitate the movement of people falling in the exempted categories and resolve issues related to issuance of e-passes, receives more than 500 calls every day.From Saturday onwards, it will also be responding to calls related to ambulances overcharging Covid patients or their relatives, harassment at cremation grounds and frauds offering help in getting beds in hospitals or Covid treatment, providing oxygen cylinders and life-saving injections such as remdesivir. People can also call on the helpline to report about other malpractices by unscrupulous elements. “Victims and informants can also call on the helpline to report about fake medicines and injections that are being sold to needy people as authentic life-saving drugs. Besides, complaints can also be made on black marketing and hoarding of oxygen cylinders, essential medicines, and equipment used in Covid treatment,” said spokesperson for Delhi Police Chinmoy Biswal.About the cheating case registered at at Sarita Vihar police station, deputy commissioner of police (southeast) R P Meena said on April 30, a man named Irshad filed a complaint and alleged that ambulance driver Pramod Kumar (30) was demanding ₹8,500 for shifting his relative, who contracted Covid-19, to Holy Family hospital from Apollo hospital.“A decoy customer contacted the driver for shifting a patient within a range of 5km, for which Kumar demanded ₹9,500. After bargaining, he agreed at ₹8,500. He was immediately arrested for extortion and cheating and his ambulance was also seized,” said the DCP adding that Kumar confessed that he wanted to make quick money by cashing in on the existing Covid-19 crisis. In the second case in which the police are yet to make any arrest, a case of extortion was registered after a man, identified as Satish, informed Sonia Vihar police on April 30 that he came across a tweet about a private ambulance service charging ₹10,000 for a 4km journey. DCP (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain said that to verify the allegation, Satish contacted the ambulance service and requested for an ambulance to shift a patient from Sonia Vihar to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital. “The person whom Satish contacted demanded ₹15,000. Thus, the allegations mentioned in the tweet turned out to be true. Satish approached police and provided a print of the tweet that he came across on Twitter,” said the DCP. “We registered a case on Satish’s complaint. The person who demanded an exorbitant rate for providing an ambulance was identified as Devender from Bhalswa Dairy. In view of prevailing situation and in public interest, the ambulance has not been seized but its photograph has been taken as a record,” he said. Police have also seized the bill book containing the original receipt, a copy of which was widely circulated on social media.With regard to black-marketing of remdesivir and overcharging by ambulances, Delhi chief minister Kejriwal responded, “I just want to say that had we received the oxygen supply and were able to create beds, then an official system could have been prepared. One could also have received the medicines prescribed by the doctors there.” “Now, anyone is laying their hands on whatever they are getting in front of them…The enforcement and police teams as well as teams of the Delhi Government are catching hold of all those engaged in black marketing. The only way to tackle this is by increasing the number of beds on a large scale, in particular, the oxygen beds,” said the chief minister. He added, “Whoever is falling ill due to Covid-19 needs oxygen in the first place… As soon as the oxygen levels of a patient reach 88-89 and oxygen is immediately provided to them, their lives can be saved. But people are unable to get oxygen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-helpline-to-now-address-cheating-harassment-complaints-101619899194406.html

Now, I will never get another opportunity to meet the legal luminary who passed away on April 30. It was a painful parting as the former attorney general of India had been a father figure for two decades. Sorabjee was a distinguished authority on law, an erudite and apolitical scholar with encyclopedic knowledge, a prolific writer, jazz lover, ardent protector of freedom of speech, the protagonist in the fight for personal liberty and a human rights watchdog. He had a keen interest in poetry, literature and architecture as well.Brimming with instant wit and humour, Sorabjee lived life to the fullest. He was a gifted mimic and loved receiving gifts. Age for him was just a number and nothing dampened his exuberant spirit. He was always game for a chat, case discussion, legal analysis, joke, or serious debate. Sorabjee never slowed down.Never deterred dissent As a lawyer, I share treasured memories with him from international conferences across the globe, court appearances, events at the India International Centre, book releases, discussions, seminars, fiery debates and creative writing. No subject belied him. Be it a street in Perth, a conference hall in London, a hotel lobby in Hong Kong, or in a bookshop on the Gold Coast, lively discussions ensued in the middle of nowhere. He respected all views and opinions and never deterred dissent.We published nine books with his blessing, the last of which was released on August 29 virtually. He was always encouraging and happily provided a foreword, preface, or speech during the book release. He never missed an event, and his wheelchair was no deterrent.

He was fair to opponents, respectful to judges, and polite and gentle in courts.

Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said on Saturday the facility is likely to be functional within three weeks. “Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will construct the temporary structure near Raman village. A team of doctors and paramedic staff will be supported by the Indian army. We are working to make the project operational soon,” said the DC. HPCL-Mittal group managed-Guru Gobind Singh Refinery has committed to providing land and basic facilities for the hospital near its plant, about 45 km from Bathinda city. When functional, it will be the largest state-managed medical facility for coronavirus patients in southern Punjab. “As per the plan, the upcoming facility will be equipped to treat Covid patients in need of oxygen support. The location has been identified near Raman to have a sufficient supply of oxygen from the refinery. It may be expanded if the need arises in the future,” added the DC. Official sources at the refinery said work to augment industrial oxygen-producing facility at the plant into medical-grade gas is underway on priority. Following a spurt in infections in the last month, Bathinda is now rated among the six worst-hit districts of Punjab. With 653 new cases reported on Saturday, the number of active Covid cases has reached 5,141. As many as 13 Covid-related deaths were reported on Saturday. In the second half of April, 6,969 new cases and 101 deaths were reported. Similarly, other districts of the region also witnessed a sharp surge in Covid cases in the past one month with Bathinda leading among seven districts of the south Malwa belt. Finance minister Manpreet Badal on Saturday took stock of preparedness in government and private hospitals of Bathinda district. He assured hospital managements and patients to provide oxygen and other medical support to the Covid care institutes. Meanwhile, the local administration on Saturday directed 26 private hospitals to prepare 664 additional beds exclusively for Covid patients. The official spokesperson of the administration said 512 beds will be kept for patients needing oxygen support whereas the hospitals will reserve 152 for critically ill patients requiring ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/100bed-makeshift-covid-hospital-to-come-up-in-bathinda-in-3-weeks-101619898956156.html

The recovery was around 130 kg and 75 kg for the corresponding periods of 2020 and 2019, respectively.Officials of the BSF say prolonged foggy season was the main reason behind the increase in attempts to push drugs into India. “This year, the fog engulfed the border areas till March end anti-national elements across the border took advantage of it. Also, the water level of the rivers and their tributaries along the border remained high this year, paving the way for the smugglers to push in contrabands into the Indian territory,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named.He said, “Our troops remained extra vigilant and most of attempts were thwarted. We were also successful in catching a Pakistani smuggler.” On April 8, a Pakistani national, who was trying to push in a heroin consignment into the Indian territory near Khemkaran border in Tarn Taran district, was apprehended. With the arrest of Ajmad Ali (19) of Lahore, the BSF had also seized 21-kg heroin and two smart phones from the area. Same day, a Pakistani smuggler was neutralised by the BSF near border outpost (BoP) Kakkar in Amritsar district. From the spot, 22-kg heroin and two AK-47 rifles were also recovered. During these operations, the BSF had also identified two Indian smugglers, including one Jagdish Singh Bhura, who lives in Belgium and has been involved in many terror activities in India.A senior Punjab Police official said, “Besides breaking the supply chain of the drugs in the state, our personnel have been ensuring to attach the assets of the drug smugglers. Due to the increased vigil and strictness of the Punjab Police, there has been a huge shortage of the drugs. Seeing the supply chain broken, desperate Pakistani smugglers leaving no stone unturned to push in more contraband into India. However, with the help of the BSF officials, we have strengthened our second line of defence along the border, and every suspect is monitored.”The seizure of the BSF is different from the recoveries by the Punjab Police. The 22-kg heroin that was seized near the Kakkar BoP was in the kitty of the Punjab Police as the operation was on the basis of Amritsar-rural police’s input.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-seized-205kg-heroin-this-year-highest-for-same-period-in-5-years-101619898597417.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Love, upside down||At Shanti Kunj Park in Chandigarh’s Sector 16, walkers cannot help but be dazzled by colonies of the Indian flying fox or the Indian fruit bat hanging from large trees in dozens. They make one hell of an unending racket during the day. These large bats can be seen flying in waves over the Rose Garden at dusk like endless formations of bomber aircrafts reducing Berlin to rubble during the hellish nights of the World War II. A voracious fruit eater that forages on guava, mango and litchi orchards located in the countryside adjuncts of the tricity, these bats also help themselves to an assortment of fruit to be found in bungalows’ gardens in the heart of the spaced out urban habitation.It is currently breeding season for this mammal and a female will deliver but one pup after an evolved, expressive and vigorous sexual session with the dominant male. Dominant males establish sexual privileges over a harem of 8-15 females and engage in vicious territorial fights to ward off sniffing Don Juans. The sexual habits of bats have been recorded by field scientists as inclusive of a male performing cunnilingus on the female and the latter reciprocating with fellatio while copulation is underway. Male bats are recorded as grooming their sexual organ before copulation.All these practises serve to lengthen the period of copulation between these fox-like mammals endowed with boundless promiscuity and libido. Couple that with known longevity, a bat in captivity survived nearly 32 years. For all the seeming upside-down discomfort of their existence, it is evident bats have done exceedingly well in their romps among tree rooftops!The tricity region sports an abundance of bat colonies because of the presence of mature trees (especially of the ficus preferred by these creatures), wild and cultivated fruit trees and a chain of check dams, including Sukhna Lake, that serve as perennial water sources for bats to skim over, quench their thirst and regulate body temperature. They can fly long distances to forage at night: a study in Brazil recorded fruit bats flying 200km to find their favourite food! A grace in Sukhna air While veering towards the regulator-end, walkers at the Sukhna Lake may have noticed the most graceful of bird flights, as if they were sailing and bobbing in the infernal air. Migratory whiskered terns are white birds adorned with a black mask, grey-black underparts and they undertake regular forays over gently rippling waters and dripping labourers pruning lotus weed tops. They stage an appearance at the Sukhna in April and May. The march of summer has bestowed upon this species a tuxedoed breeding plumage — splashes and enclaves of black or grey that offset the bird’s predominantly white colouration of winter gone by. Terns prefer the Sukhna in large numbers during those summers when it is drying up as they rest and roost on mudflats and silted isles. As the lake is currently brimming with water, only a dozen terns have arrived and they have colonised two small pieces of driftwood near the regulator-end. The terns don’t let any other avian species sit there though among themselves they regularly quarrel and jostle for space. They throw hoarse abuses and threats at each other while grabbing balcony seats in the driftwood’s limited capacity hall! I leave it to the inimitable descriptions of bird behaviour penned by Dr Salim Ali to capture the essence of Sukhna’s endearing winged tourist: “Flies gracefully back and forth over a marsh, bill and eye directed intently below for signs of life. Plunges into water for fish or stoops on insects or crabs on the ground and bears them away in its stride. Although possessing webbed feet, terns hardly ever alight on water....When not hunting they rest on a rock or mudbank on their ridiculously short legs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-love-upside-down-101619898475618.html

But with small eateries remaining shut due to the pandemic and the restrictions, people from all walks of life avail this service,” he said.He said people also support him in his endeavour and donate rice and pulses so that he continues to serve the needy.Recalling an incident, Kapoor said a beggar, who used to get food from him, had given him a bag containing some clothes saying that they should be given to some needy people after his death.“I took the bag home. After his death, when I opened it, I found that he had kept ₹25,000 cash inside along with the clothes, which he had not mentioned earlier,” he said.Kapoor says he has been running this service in memory of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, who he says had visited Nagpur in 1512 and provided langar service to the local tribals.He says that he dreams to run the ‘langar sewa’ for the needy 24x7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-man-provides-langar-on-wheels-to-needy-during-pandemic-in-nagpur-101619898415736.html

However, the government has not responded to date despite a reminder letter on April 8. “It is therefore requested that the matter be expedited, and an action taken report be furnished within seven days positively. It is requested that till the case is decided by the commission, status quo of the case may be maintained,” the letter reads. In its April 8 letter the state was told that a complaint had been received on non-implementation of reservation in promotions in the case of SC employees working in courts, including judicial officers and the commission has decided to investigate it. The commission had sought a response from the government, which reportedly wasn’t done.Between March 22 and April 8, the government has notified promotions of 20 judicial officers to state superior judicial services and 40 odd more judicial officers were given promotions on April 7. Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006, provides for reservation in promotion for SC category employees — 14 per cent in the case of Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’, and 20 per cent in the case of Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ services. Vijay Pal Singh Mattu, a Amritsar based complainant lawyer, who had approached the commission in March, says, “even as the law was passed in 2006, it was never implemented, in the case of judicial services and for other court employees.” The communication from the commission says it has taken a serious view of the state government not replying to its communication. The chief secretary should take notice of the case and in case commission does not receive reply from the chief secretary within the stipulated time, the commission may exercise the powers of civil courts and issue summons for appearance in person or by representative before it, the communication says, seeking response within seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/national-commission-seeks-report-on-quota-in-promotion-to-judicial-officers-in-punjab-101619898295201.html

Big Outcry, No Outcome.” He shared another video clip of the chief minister’s recent interview to a web channel in which he said the law would take its own course and that he could not interfere in the probe by the special investigation team.In another tweet, the MLA from Amritsar East said it was not acceptable to blame the Punjab and Haryana high court verdict quashing the probe report by the Punjab Police’s special investigation team into police opening fire at people protesting the desecration of a religious text in Faridkot in 2015.“People of Punjab did not elect the high court judge. Blaming the verdict for what is the failure of the executive authority will not be accepted. My stand yesterday, today and tomorrow - Justice for Punjab’s Soul...

02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: The gem that is literature in the age of gists||“You don’t know what the Inshorts app is?” my brother asked me, incredulously. “No,” I replied gingerly, “What is it about?”“It is a phone app for daily world news, summarised in all of 60 words. Please don’t tell me you are reading entire newspapers!” he exclaimed, in the same cynical tone. “I try to”, I said, guilty as charged. The application may be an efficient way to quickly catch up on news, but whatever happened to reading the good old newspaper cover to cover, paired with a cup of chai?Admittedly, news on the move is a good idea in today’s busy times, but this brutal massacre of long texts and lengthy books has left me a tad heartbroken. There is a growing demand for quick, short and concise reads. However, I feel that literature should not be subjected to a massacre of any kind!This textual annihilation and stagnation of literature reminds one of the profound words of the erstwhile king of short stories Sadat Hassan Manto. The power of an atom was not discovered, it was always there. If an atom is misused or unused, the power of the atom cannot be called weak or dead. Similarly, Manto has likened the atom to literature. Literature has an “innate vitality”. If one does not read it, the gem is still there — powerful and enlightening on its own. If society moves away from literature and books, it by no means indicates the enfeeblement of literature, but points towards the enfeeblement and stagnation of society itself. Manto could not have been more right about it.Simply sharing the gist of a classical piece of writing will be as bland as sharing the binary outcome of a cricket match, without having watched it! In an age of information galore, attention spans are narrowing. We prefer gists. Long texts are becoming repulsive. Also, there is so much that demands our attention now! Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations is fighting a losing battle against the millennial expectations.Some of us have a natural affinity towards books. However, reading does not always come naturally to us. At times, it needs to be gently introduced, just like a slice of say, orange fruit. The moment you bite into its citrus flesh, there is a burst of flavour. It takes a moment to relish its refreshing tang. It is only then that one begins to savour it, and proceeds to peeling it further, revelling in its juicy goodness. Books, for some of us, may feel like drudgery, a monumental project. However, when words begin to paint a picture before our eyes, and whisk us to lands afar, books become blissful haulage. When words strung together form magical sentences which suddenly resonate, they become one’s companions. On days when nothing seems right, books envelope, and provide a refuge like none other.Literature has something to offer to each one of us. There is war and history for my father. There are never enough self-help books for my sister-in-law. There is fantasy fiction for my daughter. There is coming-of-age literature for me. There is political history for my spouse, who is slowly moving from audio to paper. He has tasted the orange for sure!Last week, on April 23, we observed the World Book Day. Let’s give the truncated reading apps a rest, and pick up a newspaper, or even better, a book. Whether or not you are a reader, literature just awaits to be unbosomed.(The writer is a Chandigarh-based contributor) seeratsandhu25@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-gem-that-is-literature-in-the-age-of-gists-101619897696427.html

Reviewing the Covid-19 situation of 11 districts, Sidhu said people have misconception that they are suffering from the seasonal viral and typhoid, but when they reach hospital due to breathing complications, they are diagnosed with Covid-19. Expressing concern, he instructed civil surgeons to intensify the screening drive in villages as 58% of deaths have been registered in rural areas. The minister said that considering the high case fatality rate (CFR) in the state, there is also need to keep close watch on the functioning of private clinics/RMPs in villages. He said senior medical officers must ensure Covid testing of every single symptomatic persons who are getting treatment from such clinics. If any private health facility has not shared the information concerning the symptomatic persons on routine basis, they must be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act for violating Government‘s guidelines, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ramp-up-screening-of-symptomatic-patients-punjab-health-minister-101619897695050.html

A spokesperson of the taxation commissioner’s office said that the previous highest monthly revenue from GST was ₹1,216 crores in July 2019. GST revenue in April 2020, when the covid-19 outbreak had led to the first lockdown was a meagre ₹156 crore. The spokesperson added that in April 2019 (a normal year), the GST revenue was ₹1,088 crore and compared to this, Punjab has seen a growth of 36% with sectors like telecom, iron and steel, electronic goods, cement, petroleum products (which attract the GST) making important contribution to the revenue earned for the particular month. In addition to GST, Punjab also collects revenue from Value Added Tax (VAT) and Central Sales Tax (CST), with major contributors under this head being alcohol for human consumption and five petroleum products which are outside the ambit of GST.

The family members were seen weeping inconsolably at the hospital, which is located in the Sidhra area.Those who lost their lives are Irshad Ahmad Hamal, Haider Ali, Manjeet Singh and Bitta Kumari Kher.Though the J&K government denied the allegations, ASCOMS principal Dr Pawan Malhotra admitted that the hospital faced some hiccups in oxygen supply on Saturday morning, but denied any shortage.“There was shortage of cylinders this morning. We had informed the government and it intervened. , We had tried to procure them last night. Our requirement is 350 cylinders per day and yesterday, we had 294,” said Dr Malhotra.“We had apprised the government of the status of oxygen at the hospital on Friday itself. For the last three days, we have not been admitting Covid patients as we were not being able to cope with the load. But, those who had already been hospitalised, were being taken care of,” he said.Dr Malhotra said that the kin of all four deceased were apprised of the serious condition of the patients and that they may not survive. “We have 32 more patients on oxygen support. The hospital has not taken in any new patients for the last three days. We had given admitted patients the option to take voluntary discharge, if they wish to,” he added.Dr Malhotra said that Kher and Haider Ali had tested Covid negative, but their lungs had suffered extensive damage. “Their lungs were not functioning independently. Hamal and Manjeet Singh were Covid positive and they too, could not survive,” he added.However, the families of the deceased patients outrightly denied the claims of the principal and said that the hospital kept them in dark about the status of oxygen supply. They also accused doctors and nursing staff at the Covid ward of negligence.One of the protesting relatives said that their family member was undergoing treatment at the hospital for the last 17 days, but died due to non-availability of oxygen.Meanwhile, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Saturday clarified that no patient has died due to shortage of oxygen supply at ASCOM hospital, as the supply is being replenished regularly, as per requirement raised.“Four deaths reported in Batra hospital Jammu today (Saturday) occurred because of routine medical reasons, not because of shortage of oxygen,” said a statement of the administration on its Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-covid-patients-die-at-jammu-s-batra-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-crunch-101619896677926.html

Of this, 999 (67.3%) had co-morbidities, while 425 (32.7%) were non comorbid.The most common comorbidities among the deceased include diabetes mellitus in 499 cases (49.9%), hypertension in 459 (45.9%), chronic kidney disease in 111 (11.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 84 (8.4%). Those who lost their lives to the disease include 970 (65.4%) males and 514 (34.6%) females. The data also reveals that 90% of those who died were in the age group of 45 and above.Out of 362 Covid deaths in the state from April 14 to 30, 67 people had received the first dose of the vaccine while only two of those who died had received the second dose.Both the cases were reported from Kangra district and the duration between getting the second dose and deaths were four and 16 days, respectively. Thus, in both these cases, the deceased had succumbed to the disease before development of effective immunity, a press communiqué by the health department states.Meanwhile, a government spokesperson said that since more than 90% of those who have contracted the disease are in home isolation, it is important to have adequate knowledge of self-care procedures.He said proning was one such technique which is extremely beneficial for patients with breathing difficulty, especially during home isolation. It improves ventilation and keeps the breathing easy, he added. Regular monitoring of SpO2, along with other vitals like temperature, blood pressure and blood sugar, is important during home isolation, he added.“Proning is required only when the patient faces breathing difficulty and SpO2 dips below 94,” the spokesperson said.“Avoid proning for an hour after meals. Another alternative for patients under home isolation is regular alterations in lying position. This helps improve ventilation status and blood oxygen levels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-67-patients-who-succumbed-to-covid-in-himachal-had-co-morbidities-health-dept-data-101619896676673.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Grim milestones: J&K sees steepest rise in Covid cases in April||More than 45,123 Covid cases were reported from Jammu and Kashmir in April, the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. The month also saw 289 deaths in both regions of the UT.In March, J&K had recorded 4,519 infections and 37 deaths. April saw an almost eight-fold increase in cases and 7.8 times more deaths, compared to last month. This has forced officials to devise a new strategy to curb the spread of the disease.The number of active cases also rose exponentially and reached 28,359 by April 30, officials said. Most of these were added after February 9, when the UT had the lowest active case tally of 593.As many as 1,45,441 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 83.54 %. In the first fortnight of February, the recovery rate was 98%.From an all- time low of 43 cases on February 8, the surge became pronounced by mid-March. The spike got steeper in April, with over 1,200 to 2,000 fresh infections being reported daily since mid-April. On April 30, 3,532 cases were recorded, which the highest single-day spike.Dr Javaid Malik, professor and head of department of chest medicine at SKIMS Medical College, Bemina, said that the cases are rising as the virus is mutating . “This is happening across the country and J&K is no different,” he said. He added that the cases will rise for some more time, before it starts declining again.“It will also depend on whether people follow SoPs and lockdown protocols. If the cases continue to rise, then the government should go for an extended lockdown,” Malik added.Following the surge, hospitals in J&K have started adding more beds and oxygen plants, as the officials apprehend more cases could come in coming days.Earlier, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) in Srinagar, which is the Valley’s largest tertiary care hospital, and other medical colleges, decided to stop all non-emergency surgeries and admissions to cater to the increasing rush of Covid patients. Even the routine OPDs were shut down and the administration began online consultation for patients.Dr Salim Khan, professor and head of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, said that the cases have gone up due to high rate of transmission. “Compared to last year, transmission rate is high this time. The lockdown can help flatten the curve, or else there will be huge transmission among the population.”In March, the UT had recorded 4,519 Covid-19 infections, 1,935 in February and 3,535 in January. As many as 37 people succumbed to the virus in March, 21 in February and 53 in January.The peak of the first Covid wave was in September last year, when the UT had witnessed 37, 372 cases and 478 death.Choudhary Mohammad Yasin, mission director of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), J&K, said that officials are working overtime to control the disease. “Hopefully, things will get better in the next few weeks,” he said.Many people, however, blame the government for throwing gardens open to the public, especially Tulip Garden, which sees a huge rush of locals and tourists. Many say this is one of the reasons for the rise in cases in Kashmir. “The government did take some decisions in haste, especially holding Tulip festival in the middle of the pandemic, when cases were on rise across the country. So, that’s one of the reasons for spike in cases,” said Dr Seema, a resident of uptown Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grim-milestones-j-k-sees-steepest-rise-in-covid-cases-in-april-101619896674718.html

NIA contended that the report cannot be taken into consideration at this stage for quashing of the case against him. In an affidavit in reply to Wilson’s petition, the federal agency said that the report does not form part of the charge sheets which are filed by the respondent (NIA) and Pune Police. “It is settled position of law that documents which are not part of the charge sheet cannot be relied by the petitioner, and as such, there is no question of looking into the report of M/s. Arsenal Consultancy, and as such, the entire contention of the petitioner deserves to be rejected as the same are based on the report which does not find place in the present charge sheet,” the affidavit stated. NIA maintained that if at all the report can be considered, it can be done only during trial. “If at all the petitioner wants to rely upon the same [Arsenal report], the only avenue available to him is at the time of leading evidence. The petitioner can very well lead evidence in respect of the same and then prove their case [without admitting that the said case is genuine],” the affidavit stated. Wilson has moved HC in February for quashing of the case against him on the basis of the Arsenal report, which stated that the computer system of the accused was attacked with a malware and the attacker monitored the system for a period of about 22 months, starting from June 22, 2016. The attacker, according to the Arsenal report, had created a hidden folder on Wilson’s laptop on November 3, 2016, and last modified it on April 16, 2018. The pen-drive and other external devices connected to the laptop were also compromised and the malware had synchronised the same. On the basis of the report, commissioned by the American Bar Association, Wilson claimed that the attacker had control over the computer and used virtual proxy server (VPS), making it difficult to identify the exact internet protocol and identity of the attacker who had allegedly planted a letter on the laptop, which was being relied by NIA to build a case under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Wilson has not only prayed that the FIR and charge sheet filed against him and other co-accused be quashed, but also sought an order to set up a special investigation team (SIT) headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge to conduct a forensic analysis of the of the electronic evidence, claimed to have been collected by police against them, and to compensate them for their wrongful detention in the case. NIA has denied the allegation that Wilson was falsely implicated in the case “by planting of false evidence” on his laptop. “There is no question of accepting the contention of the petitioner regarding planting of false evidence or fabricating of the evidence,” stated the affidavit. “Going by the case of the petitioner himself that the alleged attack had taken place even before the FIR (first information report) was lodged, it is for the petitioner to explain as to how this attack has taken place when the device was in his control. As such, the petitioner cannot blame some other person, leave aside independent agencies like the present respondent,” it the affidavit added. Wilson and others have been arrested in connection with the offence registered by Vishrambaug police station in Pune on January 8, 2018, on the basis of a complaint lodged by a local builder, Tushar Damgude. The builder had alleged that members of banned outfit Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Kabir Kala Manch spread hatred through provocative songs, plays and speeches during the Elgar Parishad conclave held at Shaniwar Wada on December 31, 2017. The provocation led to the violence at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, Damgude had alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-report-citing-proof-was-planted-can-t-be-considered-now-says-nia-101619896554342.html

The murder case was also transferred to the federal agency on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in both the cases.According to NIA, Mane has played a role in Hiran murder case. He was present at the criminal intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch on March 2 and 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia.NIA officers claimed that Vaze had assured the trader that he will get him out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after he refused to take the blame and get arrested in the case.NIA has also claimed that it was Mane who had made the last call to the victim around 8.30pm on March 4, and had drawn him out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. The next day, Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Retibunder near Mumbra, Thane, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf.While seeking an extension for Mane’s custody, NIA had on April 28 informed the special court that on March 4, Mane had picked up Vaze from Kalwa railway station, and later, the duo had picked up Hiran in a four-wheeler. Mane then snatched Hiran’s phone and dropped him along Ghodbunder Road with Vaze.It is, however, not yet clear as to who killed the Thane trader or how he was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-cop-sunil-mane-remanded-in-judicial-custody-in-mansukh-hiran-murder-probe-101619896434334.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||1,004 in 18-44 age group get the shot in Mumbai||A total of 1,004 citizens in the 18-44 age group were vaccinated in Mumbai, the first day of the third phase of the Covid-19 inoculation drive, according to state health department data.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, 2,500 people in the 18-44 age group will be vaccinated on Sunday. The 2,500 slots were open for booking from 7pm and were filled by 8pm, said the officials. Vaccination for the 45+ age group stays suspended owing to shortage of doses and will resume only after getting vaccines from the Central government, confirmed the officials. Late on Friday, the BMC had announced it would open five centres from Saturday for the 18-44 age group with limited doses (all Covishield) available, even as the ongoing vaccination drive for those above 45 years was suspended for three days in Mumbai due to inadequate supply. The 1,004 doses were made available to the BMC by state government. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Friday announced that vaccination for the 18-44 age group will begin from May 1, as scheduled, but with limited slots due to scarcity of doses and it would be gradually increased after the state government manages to procure more doses. In Mumbai alone, the BMC has an estimated 9 million people between the ages of 18 and 44, who would need vaccination through public and private vaccination centres. Expectedly, people were keen to get themselves vaccinated as early as possible. According to BMC officials, within 90 minutes after its announcement on Friday night, all slots were booked. The five centres where vaccination began at 1pm are Nair Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, and the BKC’s jumbo facility. Each centre vaccinated 200 beneficiaries each. Vaccination in the 18-44 age group is being done only at these five centres due to shortage of doses, BMC said in a statement on Saturday. The statement said, “BMC is making all arrangements to vaccinate maximum beneficiaries.” According to BMC officials, vaccination for 18-44 years of age group will be done only on basis of appointment through the Centre’s Cowin portal, and no walk-in vaccination will be conducted. The vaccination duration will be from 1pm to 6pm. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We will start vaccination for 45+ age group only after getting at least 100,000 vaccine doses. On the other hand, the vaccination for 18-44 age group for now will continue with the available vaccine stock.” According to BMC officials, it has around 19,000 doses of Covidshield in its stock for vaccinating 18-44 age group, and this will be used for vaccinating on an appointment basis only. 43-year-old Ajay Maurya, an IT professional from Kandivli who took the vaccine at Cooper Hospita,l said, “I came to know last night at around 11.30 pm that vaccination is going to start from tomorrow, and this is when I started to try for getting an appointment. I was continuously trying to get appointment for two hours after which I got one at around 1.45 am. My experience was very good, and the arrangements were very good at Cooper Hospital as people are allowed only with appointments.” Maurya added, “There was not much rush as compared to the rush there for 45+ age group vaccination. There were around 50 people in the queue, which is bearable. I along with my wife both got vaccinated. I wanted to get the vaccine since I wish to start going to my office soon. I know the vaccine will not be 100% helpful, but it will at least protect me from getting severely infected, and hence I feel all should get the vaccine.” Another, 34-year-old Ambika Poojary, a teacher, received the jab at Rajawadi Hospital on Saturday. Poojary, a resident of Sion, said, “Though my work is going to be online for next few months I was waiting to get vaccinated since long. This was one of the reasons I stayed up and booked my appointment at around 2.15am.” Poojary added, “My experience at the vaccination centre was good and we reached the centre at 7.45am, considering my husband had got a slot of 10am, that was cancelled later. There was a long queue for the vaccination, but I feel the overall experience was good, and I have not experienced any complications post vaccination. I also urge all citizens who are eligible to go and get vaccinated.” While all appointments got booked within hours after giving appointments was started, several citizens took to social media expressing their displeasure over not being able to book appointment for vaccine. A user, Sanjay P, said: “Unable to see any vaccination slots in Mumbai, for all other cities like Pune, Nagpur, slots are available. Not sure what’s the problem with Cowin app for only Mumbai city specifically.” Another Twitter user Gunjan Lahiri said, “Why are the vaccination centres not being updated on the app? I heard there are five sites in Mumbai that are vaccinating the 18+ but when you search, it says “no vaccination centres available for booking.” However, BMC officials said today was a token start of the vaccination drive. It will start in full fledged manner once adequate stock arrives. Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar told reporters on Saturday morning that citizens should not rush to the vaccination centres unless they have been given a slot. “If you have registered but have not received a message, don’t go to the centre and crowd for no reason,” she said. The civic body has also appealed to citizens to wear double masks if they are going for vaccination. 22 year old Andheri resident, Priyanka Minda who got vaccinated at BKC said, “My experience with getting an appointment and getting vaccinated both was very smooth. I managed to get the appointment within five minutes and also during vaccination there was no queue or crowding. It was done with proper Covid protocols and social distancing.” Minda added, “The reason for taking it on the first day is because earlier when vaccination started for 45+ age group, there was no rush earlier, and later everyone started flocking. I wanted to avoid getting vaccinated in rush and so opted for it. Today or tomorrow everyone has to get vaccinated.” Another 34-year-old Andheri resident Pankaj Ahuja said, “My work nature is such that I have to meet a lot of people and hence it is better I take the vaccine soonest. We have been doing testing, tracing and treating since a year now and it cannot be the solution ultimately we all should get vaccinated. My experience at Cooper Hospital was very good and there was not much crowding too A 22-year- old Andheri resident, Priyanka Minda, who got vaccinated at BKC, said, “My experience with getting an appointment and getting vaccinated both was very smooth. I managed to get the appointment within five minutes and also during vaccination there was no queue or crowding. It was done with proper Covid protocols and social distancing.” Minda added, “The reason for taking it on the first day is because earlier when vaccination started for 45+ age group, there was no rush earlier, and later everyone started flocking. I wanted to avoid getting vaccinated during the rush and so opted for it. Today or tomorrow, everyone has to get vaccinated.” Another 34-year-old Andheri resident, Pankaj Ahuja, said, “My work nature is such that I have to meet a lot of people and hence it is better I take the vaccine as soon as possible. We have been doing testing, tracing and treating since a year now and it cannot be the solution. Ultimately we all should get vaccinated. My experience at Cooper Hospital was very good and there was not much crowding too.” Meanwhile, vaccination for 45 years and above could not be held across the state for the second day as the state is yet to get supply of vaccine doses from the Centre. In a release issued by the ministry of health and family welfare informed on Saturday that they have allocated around 2,327,510 doses for the first fortnight of this month.“We have received the allocation letter from the Centre but don’t know when we are going to receive the stock, said a senior official privy to the development.“No centre across the state has the stock and thus the drive could not be conducted on Saturday. We are waiting for the supply and will resume the drive in no time,” health minister Rajesh Tope told HT.(with inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1004-in-18-44-age-group-get-the-shot-in-mumbai-101619895654198.html

Police said the accused were allegedly selling each injection for ₹35,000.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the accused, Anshuman (31) and Kartik (24), told police that they had allegedly procured the fake remdesivir injections from two persons, Akarshan from Noida and Anil from Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar. Police are on the lookout for the latter two suspects.According to the DCP, the accused allegedly procured each injection for around ₹9,000 and had already sold more than eight such fake medicines in Paschim Vihar, north Delhi and Rohini over the past few days.Around a fortnight ago, companies that manufacture remdesivir injections had lowered the price of the injections on the government’s request. As per the revised rates, the injection is available at price range of ₹899 to ₹3,490. However, as the demand for the injections soared due to the steep rise in Covid cases, people began hoarding remdesivir, leading to an acute shortage of the injections in the market. Currently, black marketeers are selling the injections to desperate Covid patients and their relatives for prices ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹40,000, senior police officers said.The Shahdara district police on Friday received information that Anshuman would come near Cross River Mall near Anand Vihar around 8 pm to deliver injections to a customer. Accordingly, a trap was laid and Anshuman was caught with an associate Kartik after they arrived in a Honda City car, said DCP Sathiyasundaram.“Anshuman was carrying 10 remdesivir injections in a polybag while Kartik had seven. After verification, all the injections were found fake as the company’s name mentioned on the vials does not exist,” said the DCP, adding that they were now looking for Anil and Akarshan.The crime branch had recently busted a syndicate manufacturing fake remdesivir vials in a factory in Uttarahand’s Kotdwar and selling them in black market through agents. Seven people, including the owner of the factory, were arrested between April 23 and April 29 from Delhi and Haridwar and a total of 198 fake remdesivir vials were seized from them.Police are currently probing if the fake medicines recovered on Friday are from the same manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand or are part of another syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-arrested-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-17-vials-recovered-101619895594230.html

Police said the incident happened around 4 am when the errant driver was returning home from a private hospital in Gurugram where his wife, a Covid patient, is undergoing treatment. He was arrested from the spot, police said.The constable, identified by his first name Munshilal, was checking and prosecuting lockdown violators while on night picket duty. The constable was sitting on a chair when the Honda CRV car hit him and dragged him along the pavement and the road for nearly 40 metres. The car also damaged a temporary tent set up on the pavement for the police personnel on duty at the check post, senior police officers said.The driver, identified as Samit Yadav from Munirka, allegedly told police that he was tired and had dozed off while the vehicle neared the check post. Since he was returning from a Covid hospital, police officers made him wear a PPE kit before taking him to the Vasant Vihar police station and isolating him in the premises.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the mishap came to light around 4 am when the police control room received a call that constable Munshilal was hit by a vehicle at the Al-Kauser police picket, following which a team from the Vasant Vihar police station was sent there.“A white Honda CRV had badly damaged the picket, the tent erected for police staff and a motorcycle belonging to Munshilal, who was also dragged by the vehicle for 30-40 metres on the road by the vehicle. Munshilal was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he died during treatment,” DCP Singh said.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 279 (rash driving or riding in a public way) and 304A (causing death by negligence) and Yadav was arrested. His car was impounded.Police said that Munshilal was posted at the Vasant Vihar police station since August 2020. He is survived by his wife and three children, who are all married. The family originally hail from Alwar in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/constable-on-picket-duty-crushed-to-death-after-techie-dozes-off-at-wheel-101619895534650.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC tells Centre to ensure Delhi gets its oxygen quota||Anguished at the death of eight Covid-19 patients — four more deaths were reported later— at Batra Hospital in the city, the Delhi high court on Saturday gave the Centre a midnight deadline to ensure the allocation of 490 metric tonnes of medical oxygen reaches the Capital. Failing this, the court said it will initiate contempt action against the central government officials concerned.“Water has gone above the head. Now we mean business. Enough is enough…Do you mean we will shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi?,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said when the Centre’s counsel said the issue of oxygen crisis is also being heard before the Supreme Court, which will make its order public next Saturday.“We direct the central government to ensure Delhi receives its allocated supply of 490MT positively today [Saturday], by whatever means. Considering the fact that Delhi is not an industrial state, and does not have cryogenic tankers of its own, which can be requisitioned under the Disaster Management Act – like other States have done, it falls upon the central government to arrange the tankers as well...,” observed the bench.The bench also asked the Centre to ensure they make cryogenic tankers available for the city, while noting that Delhi has not received the 490MT of oxygen that it has been allocated even once. It directed two central officers to be present on Monday, when the matter will be heard next, if the orders are not complied with.It also declined the Centre’s request to defer the order till Monday for half-an-hour. “We have passed an order. You comply with that. That’s the end of it,” the court remarked.The directions came after Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of Batra Hospital, told the court that his facility ran out of oxygen for one-and-a-half hours on Saturday. He said a doctor was among the eight Covid-19 patients who died due to oxygen shortage. He said that as the court heard the case, time was running out for other critically ill patients at the hospital.During the proceedings, the court was also informed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, who appeared for the Delhi government, about an SOS message from Vijay Bidhuri, a city officer, which read that the city’s oxygen reserves were exhausted.In the message, which Mehra read aloud during the proceedings, Bidhuri said there was minimal supply from two firms — Linde and Air Liquide — on Saturday. Mehra said somebody needs to pull up the suppliers, alleging that they are diverting supply “under pressure.”“My officers will have a nervous breakdown. Our tankers are not given priority and they keep on standing for hours and hours. We need to know what is going on behind the scenes. You are actually killing patients by not giving it,” he said.He also informed the court that the city on Friday received only 312MT of oxygen, as against the Centre’s 490MT allocation.Advocate Amit Mahajan, the standing counsel for the central government, said, “Whatever is coming is good enough”. The bench, however, slammed this response. “We will not hear that what is coming is good enough. [Solicitor General Tushar] Mehta had said it, and we rejected it. This is not enough”.Mehra said the Delhi government can add more beds for Covid-19 patients, for which it will need 956MT oxygen.The court asked Mahajan to look into the matter and said, “Sort this out. Inform your officers that Linde is not supplying.” When Mahajan said Linde has to explain, the court said, “But you made the allocation. It falls on you. You have to do it now.”The court also asked the Centre why four cryogenic tankers that were meant for Delhi, but have been held up by the Rajasthan government, not been released despite the court’s earlier orders. It directed the Centre to take necessary steps to fulfil the assurance from S-G Mehta on April 26 that the tankers will be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-tells-centre-to-ensure-delhi-gets-its-oxygen-quota-101619895474221.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||Vax drive for 18-44 age group begins in 27 districts in Maharashtra||Maharashtra government on Saturday kicked off its vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group on a limited scale due to a shortage of vaccine. It was a symbolic start as it coincided with the formation of the state in 1960 on May 1, which is observed as Maharashtra Day. The vaccination drive was launched in 27 districts across the state. Rest nine districts will start from Sunday.The state vaccinated a total of 11,492 beneficiaries till 6pm at 132 centres, officials said. All vaccination centres were run by the state government or municipal bodies and vaccination were free.In Mumbai, 1,004 doses were administered at five vaccination centres.The nine districts where the drive could not be started are — Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sundhudurg, Osmanabad, Akola, Washim, Wardha, Chandrapur and Gondia.The state government has planned to cover seven days with over 300,000 doses. It has directed district administrations to open a maximum of five centres and vaccinate a limited number of beneficiaries daily so that a week can be covered and the next stock can be arranged by that time to continue the drive.The drive was started after the Serum Institute of India (SII) provided a stock of 300,000 Covishield vaccine doses on Friday. The state is looking to get more stock from SII as it has assured to provide a stock of around 1.4 million doses this month. Similarly, Bharat Biotech has assured to supply 400,000 doses of Covaxin for May, officials said.Expanding the nationwide drive, the Centre threw open vaccination for all adults from May 1, asking the states to inoculate the 18-44 age group by procuring doses from the open market.Around 60 million population of Maharashtra comes under the age group of 18-44 that will require 120 million doses to get them immunized from the virus. The state has already declared to provide free doses of the vaccine for all adults up to 44 years of age at government-run centres. It will cost the state exchequer ₹6,500 crore. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.On Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced starting the drive from May 1. He was keen on launching it considering the foundation of the state.“We had issued a purchase order for 300,000 doses for Covishield to SII against which the stock was received on Friday. It was distributed among all the districts to launch the drive. The firm has provided the stock for ₹300 per dose and the state has spent ₹9 crore for it,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they have received around 300,000 doses with the help of which the drive was started at limited centres across all the districts of the state. “We have directed the district administration to ensure the stock will last for seven days. To ensure this, we have divided all the 36 districts into three categories based on their population — major, medium and small. The districts coming under the major category were given 20,000 doses, medium — 7,500 doses and the districts that came under the small category were provided stock of 5,000 doses. The local administration has been asked to open a maximum of five centres where the drive should be conducted,” he said.However, the state is not aware when they are going to get another stock of doses either by SII or Bharat Biotech. “We have yet to receive any communication either from SII or Bharat Biotech on when they are going to send the next stock,” the official said.On Friday, Tope has said SII has informed them that they can provide 1,400,000 -1,500,000 doses in May whereas Bharat Biotech has assured to provide between 400,000 and 450,000 doses in the next month. “Together, we are expecting to get around 1.8 million doses in May based on which the state can start the drive at limited centres in each district,” the health minister said.On Saturday, the health minister also said that their discussion with other manufacturers is also going on. “The stock of Sputnik doses arrived in the country and we are in talks with them for supply. We are also exploring options for importing other vaccines such as Johnson and Johnson and Zydus Cadila,” he apprised.Meanwhile, people reached vaccination centres in large numbers to get vaccinated which led to crowding at many places across the state including Mumbai. At Ratnagiri, people gathered outside the vaccination centre early morning at 5, only to return without being vaccinated as the drive could not be started due to technical reasons, the officials said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the chief minister has spoken with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about importing the vaccine. “We are not dependent only on Covishield and have booked the stock with Covaxin. We also want to import Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer. CM Thackeray has spoken with the PM and is waiting for his approval. If the Centre allows us to import then things will become smooth,” Pawar told reporters in Pune.He also criticized the Centre for importing vaccine doses to many countries saying that the country may have not been facing a shortage of Covid vaccine if it was not exported to other countries. “There was no need to send the vaccine doses manufactured in the country in the beginning. If that stock of vaccine doses was provided to the people in the country then we may have avoided the shortage of vaccine doses the entire country is reeling with at present,” he slammed.Of the total 11,942 beneficiaries, maximum 1,316 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune, while 1,004 people were immunised in Mumbai. Parbhani too vaccinated 846 beneficiaries, stated a release issued by the state health department.Meanwhile, vaccination for 45 years and above could not be held across the state for the second day as the state is yet to get supply of vaccine doses from the Centre. In a release issued by the ministry of health and family welfare informed on Saturday that they have allocated around 2,327,510 doses for the first fortnight of this month.“We have received the allocation letter from the Centre but don’t know when we are going to receive the stock, said a senior official privy to the development.“No centre across the state has the stock and thus the drive could not be conducted on Saturday. We are waiting for the supply and will resume the drive in no time,” Tope told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vax-drive-for-18-44-age-group-begins-in-27-districts-in-maharashtra-101619892233928.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Senior doctor among 12 dead after Delhi's Batra hospital runs out of oxygen||Twelve Covid patients including a senior doctor admitted to the intensive care unit of south Delhi’s Batra hospital died on Saturday due to an 80-minute disruption in oxygen supply, a top official of the hospital said, underlining that the next 24-48 hours are critical for some more patients whose condition deteriorated due to the disruption.Eight patients including senior consultant Dr RK Himthani (head of the hospital’s gastroenterology department died within minutes of the hospital running out of cylinders. Dr Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of the hospital, had then expressed fears that the death toll could increase.“And, it (deaths) is not going to stop at eight. Once the patient’s condition deteriorates then you cannot salvage that patient. There is a ripple effect, there would be many who must have destabilised by now and the number of deaths will certainly go up,” said Dr Bankata said.By Saturday evening, Dr Bankata confirmed four more deaths and cautioned that some more patients were still critical.For some other patients, he said, the next 24-48 hours are going to be critical.“We have lost lives,” the hospital’s executive director had informed the Delhi high court a few hours earlier when it was hearing petitions on shortage of oxygen supply in the national capital.The judge said the issue should have been raised with Rahul Mehra, who is representing the Delhi government in the high court, before the proceedings began. The court also said that the hospital should learn a lesson and maybe set up its own oxygen plants.According to the hospital, it had raised an alarm with all the government-appointed officials at 7 am after not receiving its allocated liquid medical oxygen. Despite this, the hospital did not receive its oxygen supply and completely ran out of liquid oxygen at 12:15 pm on Saturday.“We have been allocated less quantity of oxygen than is needed, so we are constantly running around to get oxygen every day. We have also been linked to two suppliers both of whom do not deliver the oxygen on time. And, the Delhi government tanker that was on SOS duty reached the hospital only at 1:35 pm despite having been informed at 7 am,” said Dr Bankata.The hospital has currently received 1,000 litres of oxygen from the Delhi government’s SOS tanker, “which is only going to last for another 1.5 hours,” said Dr Bankata.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal described the news of more patients dying due to shortage of oxygen as “very painful”.“These lives could have been saved by giving oxygen on time,” he said in a tweet, reiterating his government’s demand for medical oxygen.“Delhi should get its quota of oxygen. We can’t see our people dying like this any more. Delhi needs 976 MT of oxygen and yesterday received only 312 MT. How will Delhi breathe with inadequate oxygen”.On Friday, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to consider increasing Delhi’s medical oxygen quota from the current 490MT and ensure that supply reaches the Capital. The allotted 490MT, the bench said, has not reached the Capital even once because of logistical constraints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/senior-doctor-among-8-dead-after-delhi-s-batra-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-101619863793181.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi can add 650 critical care beds if oxygen assured at three govt hospitals||The number of critical care beds in Delhi can go up by at least 650 if the Capital is able to assure a steady supply of oxygen at just three government hospitals — GTB hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital and AIIMS. This will be in addition to the 1,200 makeshift ICU beds that the government plans to set up, even as Delhi continues to report over 20,000 new coronavirus cases each day.The uncertainty over oxygen has also forced several hospitals to restrict new admissions, which will also ease up once the supply is restored.The critical care beds include ICUs, high dependency units (also seen as step-down ICUs) and high flow oxygen beds.Delhi has added 116 ICU beds since Thursday, taking the total number of ICU beds to 5,020. However, only 44 were vacant on Friday night -- the highest since April 18 -- as per the government’s Delhi Corona app.The biggest Delhi government-run hospital in trans-Yamuna region, GTB, had to reduce the number of beds allocated for Covid-19 from over 900 to 700 last week because of the oxygen crisis. “No hospital is designed to support critical patients on more than 90% of its beds; we are only admitting critical patients. So, we had to reduce the number of beds as our oxygen plant was running at full capacity. Yesterday, the hospital almost ran out of oxygen at night. We had to stop new admissions,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.The hospital authorities said it can restore over 200 beds if they receive regular supply and additional staff. The Delhi government has allowed all its hospitals to hire doctors, nurses, and other staff, including those who have retired, to take care of critically ill patients. “There is hardly any trained staff left in Delhi; but we are trying to do whatever we can,” the doctor said.Another Delhi government hospital in the same area, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, had to reduce the number of beds from 550 to 350 due to the uncertainty in oxygen supply. “We have just 100 doctors but we have previously run 550 beds with critical patients and we can do it again if we are assured supply of oxygen,” said a senior doctor at the hospital.At AIIMS, the plan to convert non-Covid beds for the treatment of the viral infection has slowed down because of the uncertainty in oxygen supply.“The number of non-Covid-19 patient coming in to the hospital has reduced drastically. So, we are trying to convert 200 to 250 beds into Covid wards. The availability of the oxygen is a big hindrance,” said a senior administrator from the hospital.The Centre has allocated 490 MT of oxygen to Delhi, which has been demanding 700 MTDr Narin Sehgal, Delhi secretary of Association of Healthcare Providers (India) and medical director of Sehgal Neo hospital, said, “SOS calls are being raised by one hospital or the other every 30 minutes across Delhi... People are dying and you don’t give them oxygen?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-can-add-650-critical-care-beds-if-o2-assured-at-three-govt-hospitals-101619819855657.html
