UT’s senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain told the high court that Rule 3.9 Volume 1 (Part I) of Punjab Civil Services Rules is pari materia (two statutes dealing with the same subject) with Rule 24 of Haryana Service Rule (HSR). “The provisions of said rule are being examined and have been sent to the secretary, personnel, Chandigarh administration,” Jain told court to a query raised by the high court during the hearing last week. UT has so far vaccinated 67% of the frontline workers, mostly health officials and police personnel. Will get 20 ventilators in two days: UT Jain also told the court that UT has requested the Centre for 20 more ventilators for Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), 10 for Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH-32), and 14 for Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector-16. The administration has been informed that 20 ventilators shall be sanctioned in a day or two, he told court adding that out of these, 10 ventilators will be installed at GMSH-16 and another 10 will be installed at GMCH-32, Chandigarh. Jain also informed the court that the administration has fixed the upper limit for CT scan/HRCT chest at ₹2,000, inclusive of GST/taxes. However, the court asked UT to reconsider the charges as it felt the charges are on the higher side. The UT further told the court that 174 oxygen concentrators have been received from the Centre and now UT has a backup supply of 100 concentrators. Residents can now even get oxygen cylinders at home through e-permit, the court was told. To a query that security payment of ₹10,000 for an oxygen cylinder is very high, the UT told the court that it will be examined.Now, the court has asked UT to detail on tele-consultancy services being offered to help the residents of the city in Covid pandemic management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandatory-vaccination-of-employees-being-examined-chandigarh-admn-tells-hc-101621361414449.html

In Chandigarh, petrol prices climbed to ₹89.3 a litre from ₹88.31 on May 11 while diesel rates increased to ₹83.17 a litre from ₹82.03 last week. Mohali and Panchkula too saw a price hike of ₹1 per litre over the last week. In Mohali, petrol currently costs ₹95.05 a litre while diesel is at ₹86.41 per litre. In Panchkula, petrol rates crossed the ₹90-mark for the first time to settle at ₹90.52 a litre while diesel too continued to weigh heavy on the pockets at ₹83.89 per litre. No increase in veggie prices The increase in prices, however, hasn’t affected the prices of vegetables much and is unlikely to happen until the next month as per officials of the Sector 26 wholesale mandi. Officials said, “Right now, we have locally grown vegetables that come from nearby places such as Punjab and Haryana, so fuel isn’t a big factor. Some items such as ginger, ladyfinger, bottle guard and pumpkin come from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, but locally grown vegetables are also available so prices continue to stay down.” Officials added that next month, locally grown vegetables will reduce and the city will get vegetables, such as peas and cauliflower, from Himachal Pradesh. If the fuel rates keep increasing, these vegetables will end up getting more expensive at the Sector 26 mandi as well as the apni mandis of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fuel-prices-reach-all-time-high-in-chandigarh-tricity-area-101621361235123.html

They said the government had announced financial assistance of ₹4000 for cremation of bodies and that the funds would be provided by the Prayagraj Nagar Nigam (PNN). Officials also instructed against burial of bodies at ghats in rural areas. The PNN has constituted teams to maintain vigil at the ghats and asked people against burying bodies in the sand, officials said. The municipal body officials fear rains or rising river water levels might wash the sands away, exposing dead bodies, raising fears of infections. Over the last couple of days, police and PNN teams have stopped many people from burying bodies at Phaphamau Ghat, Arail, Jhunsi, Shringverpur and other cremation ghats across the city and in rural areas. SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said police teams had been deployed at the ghats to stop burial of bodies. He said police personnel were warning people of the threats of infections which the buried bodies may pose when river water levels rise. Water police in motorboats is patrolling the river banks to stop immersion of bodies in water, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-prayagraj-nagar-nigam-teams-guard-ghats-to-check-burial-of-bodies-by-riverside-101621361113942.html

The schoolboy had no idea about necessary certificates required to get the insurance and other claims after his father’s death. “A lot of legal work was required to gather necessary certificates and other legal documents. But, it was the Ghaziabad administration that appointed a special officer to smoothen the process of paperwork. The officer not only fast-tracked all the clearances, the government officials came to our home directly to collect the papers. I got all the certificates on Monday. My mother is still recovering from the infection,” Suryansh said. Similarly, 13-year-old Devesh Kumar, who lost his father on May 14, said that the dedicated officer of the district administration helped him complete all the formalities on Tuesday. “I’ll be getting the required certificates and documents tomorrow. I’ve no words of gratitude for the DM,” he said. To help out the families who have lost their only earning members to the infection, the district administration has started a programme named ‘always with you’, in which one dedicated officer will be appointed as ‘prashasan mitra’ to such families. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that as many families have lost their only earning members to Covid-19, the district administration launched the initiative to reach out to the people in distress. “Going to various offices to obtain the necessary nominee or heir certificates needed for claiming insurance money and pension funds, among others, is almost impossible for young children or women in the ongoing corona curfew. So, we decided to appoint one dedicated officer from the administration – ‘prashasan mitra’ -- to ease the process of obtaining necessary certificates,” Pandey said. “The officer has to ensure that the staff of all departments concerned collect the necessary papers from the victim’s family. After that, it is the duty of that officer to deliver the requisite certificates to the dependants within a day or two,” he said. The DM further said that to avail this benefit, the dependant of the family has to send an e-mail to alwayswithyoudmghaziabad@gmail.com, with their address and phone numbers. “After that, we’ll immediately appoint an officer for such families. The officer will have to ensure the delivery of all necessary certificates,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-admin-starts-special-initiative-for-families-who-lost-sole-earning-members-to-covid-101621361054040.html

There have been 21 requests for rescue in April this year compared to eight in April 2020, showed the data. The requests for shelter (temporary rehabilitation) were also higher. There have been four requests for shelter in April this year, while no such request was made in the same month last year, as per the Childline data.Overall, there were 25 shelter requests and 196 rescue calls between April and December 2020. Till April this year, there have been nine shelter requests and 124 rescue calls. Incidentally, GB Nagar had reported just 100 Covid-19 cases (no death) in April 2020, while the number of positive cases in April this year was 15,232 that included 121 deaths.“Most of these cases are related to children being abandoned by their families. Just last week, we were informed about an abandoned six-year-old child with special needs. So far no one has come forward for him. However, we are prepared to handle any such cases,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB Suraksha India, the NGO managing the district Childline.The experts claim that majority cases are coming from rural belts which can be attributed to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in these areas.“The cases of domestic child abuse are also coming to light now. The initial phases of lockdown saw families enjoying that time. However, now the stress has begun to catch up and we are getting calls for abuse from children. At least five cases have already come to our attention in the last two months,” said Prakash.During the current lockdown which began from April 30, at least 80 calls (till May 17) related to the poor nutrition of children have been reported.“The pattern of the infections spread across families puts kids in a vulnerable position and we are working to help out as many as possible,” said Prakash.On April 29, a helpline (9870395200) was issued by the Noida police for volunteers to provide support to children who have either lost their parents to Covid or whose infected families are unable to care for them. “So far, we have more than 70 volunteers who are ready to provide all sorts of support like medicines, transportation, accommodation and even adoption. We are working on measures to identify beneficiaries specially in rural belts where such cases often go unreported. We will rope in anganwadis and village-level units as well for this,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety).The officials said that 10 cases have been reported since April 29 where children were in need of resources. Most of them revolved around food or medicine requirements. “There was one case in Greater Noida where siblings aged 10 and 8years lost their parents to Covid-19. They are now in the care of grandparents and we are working on sponsoring at least their education,” said Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/second-wave-worse-for-children-shelter-and-rescue-requirements-on-the-rise-101621360993952.html

The deaths occur mostly in those women whose condition deteriorates suddenly into severe form of the illness, and that most recover without reporting complications, doctors said. They added that without a proper scientific study, it’d not be possible to establish how widespread the cases were or how the disease was linked to stillbirths.While miscarriages occur between the first and third month of pregnancy, stillbirths -- medically called intrauterine fetal deaths (IUFDs) -- mostly happens beyond at a more advanced stage after the second trimester (24 weeks). Gynaecologist Dr. Manisha Ranjan said that about 10 percent of her patients since April reported sudden IUFDs.“Last time, none of our Covid pregnant patients had suffered IUFDs. However this year, not just me but a number of my colleagues too have reported this and miscarriages among these patients. Covid-19 is causing severe vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) among pregnant women which is leading to IUFD cases where the suddenly the patient is losing their baby even in the third trimester,” said Dr Ranjan, Consultant Gynaecologist & Obstetrician from Motherhood Hospital, Noida.She added that maternal mortality rate too has also increased. “Patients’ condition deteriorates suddenly. I lost two patients in the last one month this way,” she said.Dr Neha Mishra, Gynaecologist at Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida also agreed.“We haven’t seen many cases of miscarriages among Covid-positive pregnant women but it seems that it is affecting the fetus in the advance stages of pregnancy,” she said. “We have seen three cases of IUFD since April. We lost two Covid-positive women who were in last trimester too.”Lack of oxygen was another reason was a reason that could contribute to the deaths, said Dr Aradhna Singh, Gynaecologist at Fortis Hospital, Noida.“It is not that all pregnant patients are suffering from severe form of Covid, there are several who developed just mild symptoms and their babies turned out fine too,” said Dr Aradhna Singh. “If the mother is unable to get oxygen, the baby also doesn’t get it which leads to stillbirths. I have had three such cases.” At Yashoda Hospital & Research Centre, Nehru Nagar, the gynaecology department head reported six cases of IUFD. “In three cases, the fetus died in the fifth or sixth month, while the rest died in the eighth or ninth month,” said Dr Shashi Arora, head of department of obstetrics, gynaecology & IVF and vice chairperson of the hospital.In March, in a research paper in the medical journal The Lancet, doctors reviewed of 40 studies from 17 countries and found that maternal deaths and stillbirths had risen by a third. The authors pointed to a disruption to services due to lockdown and the fear of attending healthcare facilities.Dr. Ranjana Becon, Gynecologist at Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad said more studies were required.“There is no empirical evidence right now to establish the connection between Covid-19 and these deaths, but Covid seems to be the only reason why healthy pregnancies are ending like this,” said Dr Becon, adding that there had been five IUFDs at the hospital.“Yes, incidents of IUFDs among Covid-posititve pregnant women have increased this year by 5-10 percent. Stress or raised level of D-Dimer which causes thrombosis (formation of blood clots) in vessels leading to pregnancy loss could be a cause. However, more evidence based research is required to establish this,” said Dr Deepa, senior gynaecologist at Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stillbirths-higher-among-covid-positive-pregnant-women-in-second-wave-101621360933971.html

During last few months, police have traced many persons who have posted their videos or photo on social media sites with illegal firearms and initiated action. “Social media cell of police remains active round-the-clock and monitors different social media sites closely. It has not only helped curbing rumours but during past few months many persons who have posed their pictures or videos with illegal firearms on social sites have also been traced,” said SP Crime Ashutosh Mishra. During past some months dozens of arrests have been carried out and the firearms have been recovered from them, he said. “There are many youths who post their photo and videos with firearm just for fun but there are many others whose motive was to create terror among locals and increase their influence. Many of them have past criminal records as well,” SP Crime added. “As soon as the social media cell of the police alerts us about any photo or video, we immediately start tracing the person, he said. Most of the persons who have been arrested recently were from rural areas who have posted their photographs or video with firearms on social media themselves or someone has made them viral out of enmity, he said. Some cases *Around a week ago, a video of newly elected village head Amit Kumar has gone viral in which he was seen firing shots with country made pistol in an inebriated state. Meja police lodged an FIR and arrested the village head. *Earlier, a photograph of a youth posing with a licensed gun at Civil Lines bus station during lockdown period was circulated on social sites. Police arrested the youth with the gun whose license was in the name of another person. *On Monday, Kaundhiara police has arrested two youths Atul and Dharmendra who were seen firing shots at a marriage in a video which they posted on their social media accounts. *Photographs of two youths posing with a country made firearm on facebook has also gone viral few days back.

18-05-2021||Kolkata||CM wants to revive Bengal’s Vidhan Parishad after 52 years; Left, experts oppose||Barely 12 days after being sworn in as the chief minister of West Bengal for the third time, Mamata Banerjee on Monday cleared a cabinet decision to form Vidhan Parishad, or the Upper House legislative council of the state assembly, which she promised before the polls. Banerjee had said that eminent people and veteran leaders who were not nominated for the assembly elections would be made members of the Vidhan Parishad. Bengal has 294 assembly seats. Since the strength of a Vidhan Parishad cannot be more than a third of the Vidhan Sabha, or legislative assembly, Bengal can have 98 members in the legislative council. The chief minister’s decision has been questioned by political experts and Left leaders who see this as a pointless exercise that will add to the burden on the state exchequer. Incidentally, Banerjee, who lost at Nandigram, and Amit Mitra, who has become finance minister without contesting the polls, must return to the assembly. Since Vidhan Parishad members can become ministers, Mitra is likely to be inducted in the Upper House, said Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders aware of the development. At a virtual meeting of the state cabinet, which took place while two senior ministers and a legislator were in the custody of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Narada sting operation case and Bengal was witnessing demonstrations, Banerjee told senior bureaucrats, who also attended the meeting, to expeditiously prepare a draft bill. TMC leaders said that with a two-thirds majority in the assembly, the party can easily pass a resolution. Only six states - Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra - have Vidhan Parishads right now. Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, Bengal’s first chief minister after Independence, formed the Vidhan Parishad in 1952 and it continued till 1969 when the second United Front government abolished the Upper House by passing a Bill. Vidhan Parishad members are elected by civic body members and elected legislators. The governor can nominate some members as well. Bengal’s last Vidhan Parishad had 75 members, of whom nine were nominated by the governor. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has only 75 MLAs in the Bengal assembly against the TMC’s 213, did not react to the development. The Left parties, which, like the Congress, did not win any seat, opposed the idea. “According to Article 169 of the Constitution, the Parliament has to pass a bill for the creation of Vidhan Parishad and the President’s assent is also mandatory,” said Rabin Deb, a CPI(M) central committee member who served as the chief whip of the Bengal assembly during the Left Front rule. Deb argued that Banerjee and Mitra can easily contest any two of the five seats where polls will be held. Two seats in Cooch Behar and Nadia districts are vacant as the winning BJP candidates resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats. Two candidates at two seats in Murshidabad district died of Covid-19 before the elections were held and the TMC’s winning candidate at Khardah in North 24 Parganas died of Covid-19. Mitra, incidentally, had won from Khardah in the last two polls. “There is no need to form the Vidhan Parishad. The chief minister simply wants to accommodate more people and add to the state’s financial burden. It is another dole. Vidhan Parishad members get the same salary and perks as MLAs elected by people. Like the Rajya Sabha, a Vidhan Parishad also has a chairman and deputy chairman,” said Deb. “Right now, our priority is to save our supporters from post-poll violence. Our party has not discussed this issue yet,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.Forward Bloc, the party freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose formed in 1939 after quitting the Congress and which is a part of the Left Front, is opposed to the formation of the Vidhan Parishad right now. “We are not opposed to the idea in principle but why do it in such a hurry? The Covid pandemic has affected the state’s economy in a big way. People need the government’s support. Why should taxpayers’ money be spent on Vidhan Parishad members? The last Vidhan Parishad was dissolved because it had outlived its purpose and become an easy way out for people who did not want to contest polls,” said Naren Chatterjee, state secretary of the Forward Bloc.Amal Kumar Mukherjee, veteran political scientist and former principal of Presidency College, said, “The legislative council has practically no relevance in the legislative procedure.” “The council’s power is very limited. During Bidhan Roy’s tenure, members of the legislative council were chosen on the basis of their great achievements. For example, the great linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterjee was made the chairman of the council. Gone are those days. Now, everything is determined by politics. I don’t think there is any necessity for a legislative council because it will only agree to whatever is decided by the assembly. Further, it will add a tremendous expenditure. The government, however, cannot form it unless the Parliament gives its consent,” Mukherjee added.Deb said Banerjee first came up with the idea in 2011 after ousting the Left Front government but backed out in the face of opposition from other parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cm-wants-to-revive-bengal-s-vidhan-parishad-after-52-years-left-experts-oppose-101621360094638.html

Of these, more than 50,000 teachers have not received their salary till date and quite a few of them even succumbed to Covid-19 after they contracted infection during panchayat poll duty, the UP Primary School Teachers Association claimed on Tuesday.Accepting the fact that there has been an inordinate delay in distributing salary to newly appointed teachers, the minister of state for basic education (independent charge), Satish Chand Dwivedi, said the problem is that universities are taking a lot of time in verifying marksheets of these newly recruited teachers.“We have verified high school, intermediate and TET marksheets of the newly appointed teachers, but their graduation and B Ed marksheets are to be verified by respective universities from where they pursued the course. Due to Covid-19, universities are working with fewer staff. Hence, there’s a delay in verification of documents,” he said.“I had expressed my displeasure over the slow pace of verification of documents for newly recruited teachers that is a hurdle in giving salaries to 69,000 assistant teachers recruited last year. I asked officials to expedite the work,” the minister said. He said instructions were issued to pay arrears to teachers who had passed away.According to the UP Primary School Teachers Association, newly appointed teachers get about ₹40,000 per month. It will be an additional load of ₹2.76 billion on the state exchequer.Association president Dinesh Chandra Sharma had made a suggestion that the basic education department take written undertakings from teachers but distribute their salary.To expedite the process, the minister has now asked officials to take written undertakings from newly recruited teachers that if in the verification process their documents are found to be fake then they will return the entire salary to the state exchequer without question.In a review meeting held on Tuesday, the minister ordered action against the Basic Shiksha Adhikari and account officers of Ghazipur district for lapses in salary disbursement of teachers. The action was initiated during divisional level meetings with officials of Varanasi, Vindhyachal and Prayagraj. He said that strict action will be initiated against BSAs for not issuing last payment certificates to teachers who were transferred to other districts.Dwivedi said that he had even issued clear instructions to all departmental officials to expedite payment of salaries to newly recruited teachers and those transferred to different districts. The minister held a virtual review meeting at the divisional level with officials on Monday.He stressed on the payment of pension, general provident fund of retired teachers after reviewing the status of action against teachers who had joined service on fake documents. The minister asked officials to lodge FIR and initiate the process of recovery from them.Keeping in mind the recent Panchayat polls, the minister asked officials to reach out to the newly elected village heads and seek their cooperation for Operation Kayakalp in schools.The teachers association further alleged that despite being allowed to work from home, primary school teachers in various districts, including Lucknow, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Banda, Basti and Hardoi, were being deployed at integrated Covid control rooms, which was a threat to their health.The minister directed that pregnant teachers and those having small children or undergoing treatment should not be deployed for duty by the district administration.Primary school teacher Ramesh Kumar Yadav, 28, died battling Covid-19 on April 23 in Sultanpur. He was among the 69,000 who had got a job when fresh recruitments of assistant teachers were made. The wait for the job had been a long two years as the matter of recruitment had gone to court. Yadav passed away without even getting his first salary. He had been pressed into the panchayat election duty.He was posted at Primary School Adampur, in Sultanpur, in December last year. His family fears he contracted the infection during election training and his condition worsened soon after election duty on April 19.Sunil Kumar Singh, a resident of Jaunpur, passed away on April 24, also without getting his first salary. He got posted at a primary school in Hardoi and was called in for panchayat poll training and election duty.For 40-year-old Sunil, it was his first government job as he was appearing in several competitive exams. He had not got married and was waiting to land a government job before he took the plunge, said Satish Singh, his elder brother, who lit the pyre.It took the state government two years to wrap up the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers in government primary and upper primary schools across the state. Posts were advertised in December 2018 and the state government could complete the appointment only in December 2020, after a long-drawn legal battle in the high court and Supreme Court after candidates filed a lawsuit.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had distributed appointment letters to select new recruits in October and December and even interacted with them while others received them from local MLAs, MPs and ministers in the Yogi government in their respective districts. The CM had even advised them to do their duty sincerely and should not come with a request seeking a transfer to their home districts at the time of distributing the appointment letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delay-in-salary-to-newly-appointed-69-000-teachers-verification-of-marksheets-by-varsities-reason-for-delay-minister-101621359913956.html

18-05-2021||Noida||Cyclone Tauktae’s impact: Noida to see good rainfall||Noida: The city on Tuesday witnessed light rain under the impact of cyclone Tauktae, which made landfall in Gujarat on Monday night, and after weakening considerably, is currently moving inwards towards the National Capital Region. The drizzling brought down the Noida’s maximum temperature by seven degrees Celsius to 30.6 degrees, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting good rainfall on Wednesday. According to IMD, the maximum temperature will hover around 30 degrees Celsius in the next two days. “Moderate rain at most places in northern region with isolated heavy rains over Delhi-NCR has been forecasted for Wednesday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. An advisory issued by IMD said Tauktae and its remnants would interact with a western disturbance trough, creating an interaction zone. This weather phenomenon is likely to form above Delhi and adjoining areas, resulting in heavy rainfall in the region. According to weather analysts, there are chances of intense rainfall over parts of NCR, including Noida, as an induced effect of cyclonic circulation over northern Rajasthan. “Low pressure cyclonic circulation due to the induced effect of cyclone Tauktae will meet the western disturbance, leading to rain in the region. The effect is likely to last till May 20,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. Cyclone Tauktae intensified into an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” and made landfall on Gujarat coast late Monday with wind speeds between 150kmph and 160kmph. On Tuesday, Noida recorded maximum and minimum temperatures at 30.6 degrees Celsius and 27.8 degrees Celsius respectively, against 37.7 degrees Celsius and 25.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 30.8 degrees Celsius -- nine degrees Celsius lower than the season’s average and 22.3 degrees Celsius, the season’s average, respectively. Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad saw improvement on Tuesday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Tuesday was 108 against 177 (both ‘moderate’) a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 79 (‘good’) against 202 (‘poor’) a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 122 (‘moderate’) on Tuesday against 238 (‘poor’) a day earlier. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve in coming days. “Surface winds are southwesterly and moderate. Thunderstorms with gusty winds are likely at isolated places with isolated dust peaks for shorter time period. Overall AQI is forecasted to marginally improve and stay in the low end of moderate to satisfactory for next two days,” said a SAFAR statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cyclone-tauktae-s-impact-noida-to-see-good-rainfall-101621359793883.html

18-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt forms teams to identify migrant workers who want to return home||The state government has formed multiple teams across Delhi’s 11 districts to identify migrant workers who want to return to their home towns or villages due to the ongoing lockdown in order to make necessary arrangements for their travel, a senior Delhi government official said. The move comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide dry ration and meals to labourers in the National Capital Region (NCR), as well as to ensure they have transportation if they wish to return home. The Delhi government has, to this effect, now directed districts to compile a list of workers who wish to go back home. “Each team comprises a revenue official, labour inspector and a police official. We have formed three to four teams in each district. The teams are visiting spots like construction sites to speak to migrant workers. We are asking people to register if they want to return home,” said a senior revenue department official aware of the matter . In south-west Delhi, officials are surveying all construction sites and clusters where a large population of migrant workers is present. “The labour department is telling us where the surveys should be conducted. So far, we have not come across anyone who wants to return home. Those who wanted to leave have already gone, since the railways and buses were operational during this lockdown,” said a senior revenue official. With the lockdown in Delhi gradually being extended, this time till May 24, migrant workers said they fear that the curbs may continue for a while. “Some people we met at the construction site didn’t want to go immediately but they said they might leave if the curbs are extended for a longer period,” said an official. Apart from the survey, the teams are also telling migrant workers about hunger relief centres made in each district to provide food to people. In East Delhi district too, officials said none of the workers they have spoken to said they want to return. “Our teams are going to construction sites, pockets where migrant labourers are staying. So far, no one has come forward. We will continue this exercise till the time lockdown is in place,” said a senior official. Officials managing the government’s helpline for migrant workers, which was made operational last year, said the number of calls increased after the Delhi lockdown was announced on April 19. “But a majority of callers are asking about financial assistance, renewal of their membership [for the construction workers board], and for such things,” said a helpline operator. The Delhi government has also asked those who have employed migrant workers in the past year to register with the labour department. “Every inter-state migrant worker will be issued a passbook by the contractor, which shall have details of employment and shall be provided other benefits as provided in the Inter-state Migrant Workmen (regulation of employment and condition of service) Act, 1979,” read the public notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-forms-teams-to-identify-migrant-workers-who-want-to-return-home-101621358054681.html

Earlier, the board asked the schools to submit the marks by June 5. The deadline has now been extended till June 30. In view of this, the results which were going to be announced by June 20, will now be delayed. This year, the board exams for Class 10 were cancelled as the country was reeling under an unprecedented second wave of Covid-19. Instead, the board announced a revised assessment method to evaluate the students. The Delhi government’s education department on May 5 requested the CBSE to review its timeline for the Class 10 results as several teachers employed at government school were engaged in Covid duties and many of them tested positive for the infection.In a notice issued on Tuesday, CBSE controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “Keeping in view the pandemic situation, lockdown in states and safety of teachers, and other staff members of the affiliated schools, CBSE has decided to extend dates.”The CBSE portal for the uploading of marks will now open from Thursday. Board officials, however, denied commenting on the next possible date for the announcement of the result. “The board will inform once the next date will be decided,” an official said. Under the revised marking scheme for Class 10 students will be evaluated based on their performance in unit tests, half-yearly examination, and pre-board examination conducted by schools. Along with tabulation of scores, the board also directed schools that if any candidate has not appeared in any of the assessments conducted by the school, it may conduct an offline/online or a telephonic one-on-one assessment.Delhi government’s education department officials welcomed CBSE’s decision.“The extension will give proper time to schools to calculate marks and upload them without any errors. It won’t affect the academic session for Class 11 as well. While the majority of the private schools have already started their academic session for Class 11, it will begin in the government schools from the first week of July,” said a senior department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbseextends-deadline-results-of-class-10-to-be-delayed-101621357933847.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Protest over shifting ventilators: Court orders accused to make contribution to Covid care fund||Granting bail to four Nuh residents accused of assaulting and obstructing government officials from doing their duty, a Mewat court on Monday ordered the accused to deposit ₹5,000 each in the Red Cross Fund of the Nuh deputy commissioner under the Covid care head.In his order, additional sessions judge (ASJ), Mewat, Prashant Rana said the exemplary cost is being imposed on the accused so that in future, no person obstructs work of frontline workers during the pandemic and the damage caused by the accused in delaying transportation of ventilators is compensated to some extent by their contributions towards Covid treatment of citizens.As per court orders, allegations against the accused were that they objected to shifting of 10 ventilators from Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati (SHKM) Government Medical College, Nalhar to Rewari and Palwal.The accused were arrested for allegedly rioting, armed with deadly weapon, wrongful restraint, assault to deter public servant from duty, attempt to murder, negligent and malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life, criminal intimidation on May 4.“The ventilators were being shifted on government orders. Apparently, the accused obstructed shifting of ventilators and a few of the accused pelted stones. Three police officers received injuries. No property was damaged, as told by the investigating officer present in the court. No injury dangerous to life, was suffered by any person. Also, the allegations of snatching by causing hurt or wrongful restrained, are not made out,” the court said.“Which of the accused inflicted the stone injury, is doubtful? Around 70 accused are there, and five injuries were caused. Prima facie, attempt to murder and snatching is not made out at this stage. Apparently, offence committed by applicants was obstruction in official duties. The accused have no criminal antecedents. They are in custody since May 4. The trial of the case will take time and no purpose will be served, if the accused are further kept in custody. The accused deserve to be enlarged on bail,” the ASJ court said.The ASJ said conduct of the accused in obstructing shifting of ventilators to other districts, however, is not only prima-facie illegal but also highly unethical.“They may have done the said obstruction on account of sentiments towards their district. However, in times of pandemic, regionalism should not prevail in the mind of any citizen. Since the accused delayed shifting of ventilators to other districts, for two hours, they deserve to be rectified by way of appropriate costs,” ASJ Rana said.Allowing their bail application, the court said the accused will be released from custody subject to their furnishing personal bonds of ₹50,000 each.“They will also deposit ₹5,000 each in the Red Cross Fund under the Covid care head and the duty magistrate will issue the release warrants after receipt of Red Cross contribution by the accused, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protest-over-shifting-ventilators-court-orders-accused-to-make-contribution-to-covid-care-fund-101621357875277.html

Under the campaign, residents of 30 villages in six gram panchayat blocks of Rae Bareli district would be provided Covid medicines, oximeters, thermometers and ration kits along with oxygen support in Covid care centres. Poet Pankaj Prasun said, “ I tagged my tweet for need of oxygen concentrators for rural masses to Sonu Sood and Dr Kumar Vishwas. The latter retweeted it, saying ‘Sonu Sood, please send three oxygen concentrators for the poor or else I will arrange from Ghaziabad.’ Within a few minutes Sonu Sood tweeted: ‘ Be assured , it will reach! Just send me your address (samjho pahunch gaya , aap pata bhejo).’” He said, “I was surprised to see a busy Bollywood actor reacting to our tweets within five minutes. You all know there is only one L3 hospital in Rae Bareli. There is a long wait in other hospitals which are either L1 or L2. But during Covid everyone has felt the importance of oxygen in saving lives. That’s why these oxygen concentrators would be very important for the rural masses. “ He said , “I turned Covid positive on April 7 during which time I realized how difficult it is to get treated for Covid . During the recovery I kept on thinking about the way I can help those who are living in rural areas, and I came up with this idea.” He said, “With limited resources we have selected six gram sabhas of Sahjaura, Lohra, Raula, Domapur, Mustafabad Belhani, Mau Garvi, Govindpur and Merui under which around 32 villages would be covered. We will request the authorities to allow panchayat bhawans and schools for Covid care centres, from where we can distribute our ration kits, medicine kits , thermometers, oximeters and provide oxygen.” Pankaj Prasun said, “When I tweeted to Kumar Vishwas for help, he immediately responded by donating Covid care kits for the campaign. He said the real ‘dharma’ of poets was service and that his team would remain in contact with me.” Dr Kumar Vishwas said , “ It’s an honour to serve humanity.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi announced that the vaccination process for the youth would have to be paused starting next week as the city is left with Covishield's stock for only three more days while Covaxin is already out of stock. Centres administering vaccines to the youth will be temporarily shut from next week, she added.Also read| Vaccines to be ‘at least partially’ protective against variant from India: Fauci"For the 18-44 age bracket, we have been reiterating a number of times in the past few days that Covaxin’s stock is almost over, and Covishield’s stock is left only for 3 days. We can vaccinate those between 18-44 only for the next 3 days, that is until this week only. Starting the next week, vaccination for the youth will be halted due to shortage of vaccines," Atishi said while presenting the vaccination bulletin during the video address.She appealed to the Centre to provide sufficient vaccine doses for the people in the age bracket of 18-44 years citing the critical impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the younger generation.Atishi also praised the Centre for supplying a fresh stock of 60,240 doses of Covaxin on Tuesday for people aged above 45 years, healthcare and frontline workersAlso read: Will my Covid-19 vaccine first dose effect last for 6 months? Experts say yesAtishi made a humble appeal to the centre to supply sufficient vaccines for those between the 18-44 age group as the second wave saw a lot of young people getting critical, and their vaccination is imperative to protect people. After the new supply, Covaxin's stock for people over the age of 45 years and healthcare and frontline workers is left for two days, while Covishield's stock will last for four days."A meagre population of 7 lakh youth between 18-44 have been inoculated with the first dose.

They approached the police and filed a complaint on May 10, alleging that the body was misplaced and the hospital authorities have no answers to how the corpse disappeared from the mortuary.“We are taking a legal opinion on the family’s complaint. The hospital authorities are also conducting an enquiry. We are waiting for their enquiry report also. Further legal action would be taken accordingly. The patient was taken to the hospital by family members but she was declared brought dead on April 16. Her family members were also Covid positive so they could not claim the body then,” said Rohit Meena, additional deputy commissioner of police (central). Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital, said. “A committee of three senior doctors, the additional medical superintendent, mortuary in-charge, and another senior doctor, has been set up to look into the matter. We will be able to tell what happened once the committee submits its report in a couple of days.”The two brothers of the dead woman, Dipika, were present in the hospital when the doctors pronounced her dead and had seen her body while it was being shifted to the mortuary. But the disappearance of her body has strangely led to some of her relatives believe that she could be alive.“My parents and some relatives still believe that a miracle would happen and Dipika would return home alive. My heart also wishes for that miracle, even as my mind says she is gone,” said Dipika’s brother, Saurabh Kumar.Dipika lived with her parents and brothers at their Shastri Nagar home near Geeta Colony in east Delhi. She ran a consultancy firm along with her brother Siddharth Kumar. The coronavirus hit the family in the first week of April.According to Kumar, his parents were shifted to a private hospital in east Delhi but she could not get a bed in at least four local hospitals because of the huge rush of patients. Dipika got a bed in a private non-Covid hospital in Noida but as her Covid test report came positive and her condition was deteriorating, she was referred to any Covid hospital, he said.“We brought her to Lok Nayak hospital. The doctors declared her brought dead. Her body was shifted to the mortuary and we were asked to claim it in two-three days. But we could not come as all of us were Covid positive and our condition was not good,” said Kumar.The parents recovered and returned home on April 23, but the two brothers informed them about Dipika’s death only on May 4, as they did not want to give them a shock. The elderly couple then asked their sons to claim her body and perform the last rites.“We went to the hospital mortuary on May 7 and received Dipika’s death certificate. The hospital staff asked us to visit the mortuary and identify my sister’s body, as that was the last opportunity to see her face. Many bodies were shown to us but none of them was of my sister. Her corpse was missing. They sought time to look into the matter and asked us to come two-three days later,” he said.The family members visited the hospital again on May 10. When they were told that the body could be found, they filed a police complaint.“We first lost our sister and now because of the hospital’s mistake we are not able to perform her last rites. The hospital authorities say that there was a possibility that some other family may have cremate my sister’s body. I want them to find that family so that we can thank them for performing her last rites. But the authorities are not able to find the family as well,” added Kumar.According to another doctor from the hospital, “It is not unusual for family members to not claim bodies of people who die of Covid-19. In such instances, the hospital ensures that the cremation is done. In this case, the family came looking for the body almost a month after the demise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/body-of-woman-who-died-of-covid-goes-missing-from-lok-nayak-mortuary-family-files-police-complaint-101621357454400.html

Though the state government has exempted industrial activity from corona curfew , production and maintenance work has been affected in almost all units. Industrial lobby bodies have also pointed out that the state government has not accepted some of their demands, making it tough for them to continue running their units. “As transport services are off the roads, industries are finding it difficult to procure raw material and send finished products to stockists,” said Manmohan Agarwal, senior vice president, Indian Industries Association (IIA). “We have requested the state government to exempt transport companies from the purview of corona curfew. Unless offices of transport companies are allowed to open, there will be no movement of trucks on roads. In such a scenario, industries cannot be run,” Agarwal added. “If the situation continues like this, we will be left with no option but to shut down our units till the situation normalises,” he added. Industrialists pointed out that units in Noida were working at minimum capacity. A disrupted supply chain and low work force have reduced production to bare minimum at industrial units in Noida, Meerut and some other parts of the state. “The government has issued a GO (government order) permitting industrial activity even in this second wave of Covid-19. But workers have left for their homes, fearing the pandemic,” said Rajiv Bansal, national secretary, IIA. He pointed out that the workforce had shrunk to 5000 from 50,000 in Noida even when factories were not shut. As all shops are closed except for those related with essential items, industrialists are finding it hard to get maintenance work done in their units if there is any technical problem. “We have also requested the government to allow all essential shops related with industries to open at least for two days in a week so that maintenance work may be carried out, if required,” pointed out Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-impact-msmes-want-temporary-closure-of-units-101621357453808.html

Statues of both these saints were taken by bus to Pandharpur last year, with only few warkaris on board. “Last year, it was a major exception and we all understood the seriousness of cancelling the ari and not gathering millions of people together. A similar situation has occured now, but there is a strong feeling from various Warkari organisations and groups that this year, the walking tradition should be continued. With all the restrictions and rules of the government, we are ready to go to Pandharpur walking, but it should not be cancelled,” said Rajabhau Chopdar, president, Chopdar foundation and one of the organisers of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Pakhi.Before the pandemic, annually at least 0.4 million warkaris join several dindis (groups) with the Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram palkhis, which start from Alandi and Dehu, respectively. There are around 250 registered dindis which follow the palkhi on its way to Pandharpur. Dindis from across Maharashtra start coming to Alandi and Dehu a week before. Anil Maharaj Gawade, head of a dindi from Satara district, said, “Warkari community is always been patient and follows all the rules and regulations given by the state. The wari itself is so well planned and disciplined that there is no need to give any instructions to warkaris. The sentiment is that the tradition should continue, with a limited number set by the government.”Recently, an online meeting was held by both the Alandi and Dehu Mandir trust members, with leaders of the warkari community. An official meeting is to be held with the state government officials now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/warkari-sentiment-leans-towards-pilgrimage-not-being-cancelled-this-year-101621353013630.html

During the meeting, the critical care expert informed the PM about their journey so far in the ongoing battle with Covid-19, that included treatment of about 2,000 patients at the facility, besides limitations in terms of equipment and manpower. “I informed him about our work and also the difficulties we faced during the period. We have received 100 ventilators through the PM Cares Fund, besides oxygen concentrators and high flow equipment. While the other equipment are working fine, 45 of 100 ventilators could not be used due to technical faults,” said Dr Bhattacharya. Following this, the Prime Minister’s Office swung into action with Dr Dr Bhattacharya receiving a phone call from the former soon after the meeting ended. “I was asked for the details of the nature of snag the ventilators developed. I shared all details with them,” Dr Bhattacharya said. The RIMS doctor, however, said the faulty machines did not have an immediate impact on the health care system at the centre, as there were already around 100 functional ventilators at the hospital.Besides, he also apprised the PM about manpower shortage at the state government’s institution and suggested ways to meet the crisis by training science stream graduates. “Paramedical and support staff are key in running the institutions. We need at least three to four times more support staff here than we currently have. I suggested that we can utilise science graduates as support staff after three weeks’ training,” Dr Bhattacharya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/almost-half-of-pm-cares-ventilators-faulty-rims-doc-tells-pm-modi-101621352654195.html

They claim that the lab charges ₹2,500 per scan for Covid patients and ₹3, 00 for other cases. PMC has fixed the rate between ₹1,500 – ₹1,600 for these scans. The civic administration, under the then municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar, has set up the centre to providing facilities like X-ray, blood tests and other scans at affordable costs to residents. According to the complaint, the lab has been overcharging for scans since the past 18 months. Corporator Ravindra Dhangekar said, “The space for setting up the diagnostic lab has been provided by the hospital and PMC pays for its cleanliness and power bills. So, the lab has to provide services as per the affordable cost suggested by PMC. The health department is indifferent to the cause of the citizens and has paid little attention towards the issue.” PMC assistant health superintendent Dr Sanjeev Wavare said, “We have received the complaint that the lab is overcharging from patients despite our directions. We are looking into the compliant and strict action will be taken if the inquiry finds any anomaly.” Meanwhile, the lab incharge, who did not wish to be named, said, “We are charging as per PMC rates.

Earlier, May 31 was fixed as the deadline for wheat procurement. However, the primary agriculture cooperative societies and Vyapar Mandals, the agencies authorised to purchase wheat from farmers on the MSP, could meet barely 13% of the procurement target of 7 lakh metric tonnes. “As on Tuesday, the agencies have procured nearly 91,000 MTs of wheat. We hope to procure nearly 2 lakh MTs in the next couple of weeks,” cooperative department secretary Bandana Preyashi said after the CM’s review on wheat procurement. The food and consumer protection department (FCPD), in consultation with agriculture and cooperative departments, had upgraded the wheat procurement target from 1 lakh MT to 7 lakh MT in view of huge registrations by farmers and frequent reports about distress selling by them. “However, abysmally slow pace of procurement highlights gap between words and action of the government. Farmers are being compelled to sell wheat at throwaway prices,” said Raj Kumar Sharma, head of the farmers’ wing of Bihar Congress. Officials said the CM had to intervene after he was informed that only 15,000 out of total registered 1.70 crore farmers could avail of the benefits of MSP so far. “The state produced around 65 lakh MTs of wheat this season against 60 lakh MT last year,” said agriculture secretary N Saravana Kumar. Preyashi, however, defended the progress in procurement, saying it was being done in difficult times when the state has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Last year, only 4,000 MTs of wheat could be procured,” she said. Vijay Kumar Mishra, a marginal farmer of Bikramganj in Rohtas, said farmers were disappointed as primary agriculture credit societies (PACS) were not purchasing wheat, citing cash crisis. “In the absence of official procurement, farmers are being forced to sell wheat to local middlemen at ₹1,200-1,500 per quintal, much lower than the MSP, which is over ₹1,700,” said Mishra. A senior officer FCPD said the maximum procurement was recorded in Kaimur, where farmers sold around 7,113 MTs of wheat to Pacs, followed by Rohtas (6,644 MT) and Begusarai (6,535 MT)). Arwal and Sheikhpura are the worst performing districts, recording procurement of 334 MT and 337 MT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wheat-procurement-poor-deadline-extended-till-june-15-101621352593583.html

Now, the second wave is very severe but the government wants to hold it only because of Constitutional obligation,” he said.The TDLP decided to hold a parallel mock assembly simultaneously with the state assembly session to expose the failures and misdeeds of the Jagan regime all through. Former finance minister and MLC Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that the government had no intention of holding a meaningful discussion in the assembly on public issues like Covid-19. “Even if the TDP attends the session, the chief minister and his ministers would not give any chance for them to speak in the House. As usual, the YSRC would bulldoze and suppress the voice of the Opposition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tdp-to-boycott-budget-session-of-andhra-assembly-on-thursday-101621352534401.html

The AG said that the government would examine to what extent it can follow the guidelines of the Centre on its own, as it could also have financial implications. Expert committee report The bench also sought to know the action taken on the recommendations of the three-member expert committee, constituted by the Centre on the directive of the Patna HC to examine the status of oxygen supply in the hospitals. The bench was informed that the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) had taken corrective measures in the light of some adverse remarks by the committee, especially with regard to oxygen audit. Appearing for the PMCH, PK Shahi said that by the first week of June, PMCH would have its own oxygen generation capacity to cater to around 2,000 patients. The court sought affidavit regarding the current status in big hospitals mentioned in the report. Bio-waste disposal The bench directed the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to file a detailed affidavit regarding bio-waste collection/disposal and steps taken for sensitization of the people. Former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay also raised the issue of delay in issue of death certificates. The bench said the issue of death registration was already being looked into and government would give its detailed reply. The court had on Monday expressed its displeasure over apparent inconsistency in figures of death in Buxar provided in the affidavits filed by the Patna division commissioner and the chief secretary and sought the figures of the entire district to be furnished since March 1. The court said that this would apply to all the districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-keeps-up-heat-will-go-down-to-every-district-101621352418688.html

According to police, the suspects posed as self-help groups on social media and offered medicines, oxygen and hospital beds to lure potential victims.According to Nalanda superintendent of police Hariprasath S, the four arrested on Tuesday were identified as Mithlesh Kumar, Deepak Kumar, Sharawan Mahto and Pankaj Kumar. He said 13 ATM cards, nine cellphones, a laptop and ₹20,000 in cash was seized from them. The matter came to light when one Sharad Chandran of Dwarika Vihar in Delhi lodged a complaint on May 4 with the Delhi Police, alleging he was duped of ₹23, 950 unidentified people selling oxygen cylinders. He said he transferred the money to the accused, but the latter started ignoring his calls and messages. The SP said the Delhi Police team had been camping in Nalanda for the last three days. The police said most of the SIM cards used by the accused were registered in West Bengal but their locations showed at Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura and Jamtara in Jharkhand. “During investigation, the four accused confessed they had undergone ‘training’ for cyber fraud in Nawada and Jamtara,” said the police. The Delhi Police have lodged 372 FIRs and arrested 91 people so far from different locations, including from Bihar. According to the Bihar Police, five persons were earlier arrested in two raids at Danapur and Barh in the state capital and handed over to the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-vultures-4-more-arrested-in-nalanda-turned-over-to-delhi-cops-101621352418079.html
18-05-2021||Other||After HC rap, Bihar to reverify Covid deaths||PATNAA day after the Patna High Court flagged inconsistency in death figures related to Buxar, the state government Tuesday decided to reverify Covid deaths during the 14-month pandemic period.“This has to be done on a war footing within 10 days,” Bihar’s additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said on Tuesday. A bulletin released by the state health department on Monday had put the Covid toll at 3,928 so far. On Monday, the HC had expressed its displeasure over inconsistency in figures of death in Buxar, mentioned in separate affidavits filed by the state’s chief secretary and the Patna divisional commissioner. It had asked the government to verify facts from all sources before placing it in the court. “Else, it will amount to filing false or incomplete affidavit,” the bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice Sanjay Kumar had said. The HC had also asked the government to clarify if the reported deaths were of people suffering from Covid-19, besides ascertaining the age group of the deceased. The state health department on Tuesday sent detailed instructions to district magistrates, civil surgeons, directors of AIIMS-Patna and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) to verify from all sources the deaths having taken place at their respective institutions or at the district-level. Addressing media persons here on Tuesday, Amrit said all medical colleges and hospitals had been advised to set up a committee, comprising the principal, medical superintendent and head of the department of medicine, to examine all records and verify deaths arising out of Covid-19 or otherwise. The same had to be done by the civil surgeon, the additional chief medical officer or any doctor authorised by the civil surgeon at the district-level. “We have asked the district magistrates (DMs) and civil surgeons to set up a committee to verify all deaths at the district level within 10 days, beginning Tuesday,” said Amrit. The district committees had also been tasked to visit private facilities, which were allowed to treat Covid-19 patients, and verify deaths. Amrit said there were five sources of information about death of Covid-19 patients — those dying under home isolation, at Covid Care Centres, District Covid Healthcare Centre, dedicated Covid hospitals and patients on way to a facility. Authorities responsible for each had been activated to verify deaths, he added. “The government wants to have a clear picture on the deaths at the panchayat and block level, district-wise, geographical area and region-wise. It also wants to ensure that the affected family should be supported. The motive is simple. If any person dies of Covid, his/her name should be with us; we should have the right figures. Families of such people should not be deprived. At the same time, we want to check for false claims,” said Amrit in response to a question behind the motive of the exercise. The state government had last year announced a compensation of ₹4 lakh to the kin of those who die of Covid-19. Vaccine allocationThe Centre had allocated over 10.45 lakh doses of vaccine against coronavirus for the age group of 45 years and above. These vaccines will arrive between May 21 and June 1, said Amrit. He, however, did not share the number of vaccines available with the state as on date. Sources said many districts had exhausted their vaccine stock and shut vaccination centres. Amrit also parried a question whether all such vaccination centres would remain shut for the next three days till the state receives its first tranche of vaccines for 45+. He said a proposal had been received that the state would get 6,89,250 doses of Covishield for the 18-44 years age category between May 20 and 24. Community kitchensThe state government had decided to operate at least one community kitchen in each of the total 534 blocks spread across 38 districts in Bihar. Relatives of Covid-19 patients under home isolation could take packed food from such centres. These will also provide milk to children at these community kitchens. Amrit said the number of community kitchen had been scaled up from 119 on May 5 to 432 on Tuesday. Centres of excellenceThe health department Tuesday declared the AIIMS and the IGIMS in Patna as centres of excellence for treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus. Amrit also said the state government had requested the Centre to include molecular genomics laboratory at the IGIMS among 10 such existing laboratories in India for genomic surveillance of Covid-19 in the region. He said the Centre had also agreed to the state’s request to use Liposomal Amphotericin B injection, used in kala-azar patients, to treat cases of mucormycosis. “We have already distributed some vials of the injection to some of the hospitals,” he said. The number of cases of mucormycosis had risen to 56 in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hc-rap-bihar-to-reverify-covid-deaths-101621352417280.html

On Tuesday, the price of petrol was Rs98.82 per litre and the price of diesel was R89.01 per litre. “It is a mystery how fuel rates were stable during the election phase last month and the now started again.

Fuel prices started to increase from May 4 in the city. The price of diesel has also reached new highs and the transport sector is affected because of that. A protest against the fuel price hike was staged by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday. Prashant Jagtap, city president, NCP, slammed the policies of the central government for this price hike. “The price of petrol which was Rs72/litre in 2014 has reached the verge of Rs100/litre now. Diesel has become more expensive and LPG is also out of the budget of common people. Edible oil prices have touched new heights.

It is an expensive proposition and with the museum being closed for almost a year-and-a-half, it seems a tough task,” he added. The objective of International Museum Day (IMD) is to raise awareness about the fact that museums are an important means of cultural exchange, enrichment of cultures and development of mutual understanding, cooperation and peace among people. “Due to intermittent lockdowns, the number of visitors has come down to drastically. However, we are maintaining our periodical activities of conservation, preservation of artefacts and various exhibits, where cleaning and fumigation is done regularly. We have good collection of geological samples for students of Geology. Adventure sports, hiking, mountaineering, and scuba diving equipment will be exhibited with due information, with models of physiology imbibed with a light and commentary combination; such as when we eat food how it moves in the human body. We have various ideas and plans to be executed in the near future, but museums need to open to get visitors,” said Rajiv Vilekar, director, Mahatma Phule Museum. The Babasaheb Ambedkar museum has always been a crowd puller. “We are exploring the idea of making an app specifically for the museums of Pune city, where the public can gain information about major museums in the city.

18-05-2021||Pune||Decongestion process begins as jail capacity in Maharashtra reaches 2020 limit||The second round of decongestion process at Maharashtra prisons has begun in May based on the recommendation of the High-Powered Committee (HPC) which was formed based on Supreme Court’s direction in March 2020. Until Monday, a total of 83 inmates from all over the state prisons were released in the second round. Of the 83 released, 64 are from Taloja jail while five are from Yerawada prison and rest from others. In the second wave, six prisoners and one prison staff succumbed to the virus. Last year, seven prisoners and eight staff members succumbed to the virus. Of the total 3,818 prison staff, 3,252 have been vaccinated. Of the inmates, 2,722 have been vaccinated. A total of 41 temporary prisons were established in the state in 2020. The Covid-19 regulations prescribed for jail inmates across the country have mirrored the condition outside the jail premises since the beginning of the pandemic. Be it the first wave, isolation centres, Covid care centres, or vaccination, procedures parallel to that of society have been laid down for the inmates. As facilities such as jumbo hospitals started coming back to life in light of the second wave of Covid-19 in India, the process that was a shot of life in the arm of the jail system - decongestion - also has started seeing the light of day. The HPC includes Justice AA Sayed of Bombay High Court and executive chairman of Maharashtra State legal authority; Sunil Ramanand, additional director-general of Maharashtra prisons; and Anand Limaye, additional chief secretary for appeals and security at Maharashtra home department. In the meeting of the HPC on May 11, the HPC decided to restart the decongestion process as cases started rising and the jail population was over 34,000 which is close to its highest overcrowding limit of over 36,000 even after the release of over 10,000 inmates in the first round. The Bombay High Court in its order on April 29 and the Supreme Court in its order on May 7 had directed the state HPCs to meet again in order to re-initiate the decongestion process. Based on the high court’s direction, during the hearing of suo moto public interest litigation (PIL), the HPC for Maharashtra was reconstituted on May 4. “From the data placed before us it is seen that the prison population was reduced from 36,061 as on March 31, 2020,to 26,379 as on July 31, 2020, due to temporary release of eligible prisoners pursuant to the decisions of the High-Powered Committee (HPC). After July 31, 2020, however, this figure of 26,379 steadily increased each month and as on April 30, 2021, the prison population has reached 34,224. The data also shows that as on May 11, 2021, the total prison population is 34,733 of which 29,186 are under trial-prisoners and 5,547 are convicted prisoners,” read a part of the observations made during the HPC meeting on May 7. The maximum capacity of all the jails put together is 23,262. Since the HPC decision was made in 2020, the courts in Maharashtra have 12,751 pending bail applications pending as on May 7. Besides these applications, the applications which were rejected last year will also be allowed to make fresh applications without any implications of their last application. These applications have to be decided upon before May 20, according to the HPC. Decongestion in 2020 The decongestion process in 2020 was held in three phases - one for under-trials, one for convicts in cases less than seven years jail term, and one for convicts in non-serious cases with more than seven years jail term. The first phase of releasing under-trials started after a state-level High Powered Committee (HPC) had laid down rules for choosing who should be released. The second decision was issued on May 8, 2020, and the third on May 11, 2020, by the same HPC. In the first phase, 5105 prisoners were released; in the second phase 2, 686 prisoners were released; and in the third phase, 3,081 prisoners were released. Overview of Maharashtra prisons The state of Maharashtra has the highest number of jails and sub jails in the country, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The state also has the second highest number of central jails in the country. Maharashtra has a total of 64 jails. The 64 jails include nine central jails, 28 district jails, four sub-jails, one women’s jail, one borstal school, 19 open jails, one special jail and one uncategorised jail. At the end of 2018, Maharashtra jail capacity was 24,095 - 22,830 male and 1,265 female - while the occupancy was 35,884 -34,264 male and 1,620 female. Overall, the jails were 148.9% occupied. Therefore, the jails in Maharashtra were housing 11,789 more people than they are equipped to. The maximum overcrowding among all jails in Maharashtra was in central jails at 170.70 per cent with 25,333 inmates residing in space meant for 14,841. Therefore, the Central jails were housing 10,492 inmates more than its capacity. Which also means that major portion of the overall overcrowding was concentrated in central jails of the state. The nine central jails include Aurangabad Central Jail, Arthur Road Mumbai Central Jail, Taloja Navi Mumbai Central Jail, Yerawada Central Jail, Nagpur Central Jail, Amravati Central Jail, Nashik Central Jail, Thane Central Jail, and Kolhapur Central Jail. To function at its capacity, the central jail population needed to decrease by 10,492. However, the nine central jails collectively managed to shed overcrowding by only around 6,500. The overcrowding in central jails was followed by district jails which were housing 8,680 inmates in the space meant for 6,938 inmates - 125.11% capacity. In women’s jail, the capacity was overflowing at 159.16% with 417 women living in space meant for 262.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/decongestion-process-begins-as-jail-capacity-in-maharashtra-reaches-2020-limit-101621349893530.html

It helps to a smaller extent,” said an official from the state water irrigation department. With monsoon expected to arrive on June 1 in Kerala and prediction of normal rainfall makes the situation better for water storage in dams. “Currently, we have enough water stock in dams, and the monsoon predicted arrival is on regular time so the city will not face any water shortage,” added the official. During the second week of May, water was released from Khadakwasla for the summer crops. It was the second time in a year when water was released for irrigation. “The activity of releasing the water will continue until the first week of June.

When will this nightmare end?||PUNE Distraught families of those who have recovered from Covid-19 are now left facing another health challenge, Mucormycosis, colloquially referred to as “black fungus”. The steady rise in the number of cases of Mucormycosis is leading to a shortage of the drug Amphotericin, required for the treatment. Supply of the drug is now being restricted by district administration and is not freely available in the market. Ketan Bagade, son of Pramila Bagade, who is admitted to the Sahyadri multispeciality hospital, said, “My mom was Covid-19 positive on April 30, and got discharged from a government Covid centre in Baramati on May 7. A few days after being discharged she started complaining of a swelling and pain near the nose and cheeks. She was diagnosed with Mucormycosis. Bagade says that’s when they admitted her to the Pune hospital.“The hospital said that she will require five doses of Amphotericin B Liposomal injection. On the first day the hospital provided her the injection, on the second day we were asked to get it and we arranged for it. On the third day, again the hospital arranged for it; however, now they have asked us to get it from outside. We contacted a few chemists and they said that off-the-counter sale of the drug is restricted. We went to the collector’s office and they said that only the hospital can procure the drug,” Bagade adds. Bagade also said that the hospital estimated the treatment cost, without the injections, to be ₹six lakh. He said, “My mother needs about five doses every day for another seven days, so she needs 35 vials. Each dose costs Rs7,000, so the injections alone cost about ₹2.45 lakh.” Another such patient who recently lost his father to Covid-19, had to travel from Nanded to Pune to be with his mother who is fighting Mucormycosis. Suraj Telang’s mother is admitted to the Poona Hospital, and he is now looking for the injections. Telang said, “My mother finished her surgery on Tuesday and doctors had said that she would need about four injections every day before the surgery. My mom tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22, along with my father. However, my father lost his life to the infection on March 28. A few days later, my mother started complaining of a pain in the tooth and gum, and then in the sinuses, with a swelling on the cheeks. We took her to the hospital and she was diagnosed with Mucormycosis.”Telang added, “We have lost all our savings in paying hospital bills. I lost my father to Covid-19 and now, my mother is struggling from Mucormycosis. When will this nightmare end? We are trying every possible source available to get the drug.”“We even went to the collector’s office but no one is giving any right answers,” he added.Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble hospital, said, “We are facing a severe shortage of the drug. After saving our patients from Covid-19, we might lose them to Mucormycosis, because there is no drug available. These patients also need ICU beds for a longer period. If we do not ramp up our facilities and make sure medication is in the right place, we may lose more lives for no reason.”On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that in case the cost of treatment for Mucormycosis is more than the allowable insurance cover, under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the excess cost will be borne by the the State Health Guarantee Society.Under the MPJAY scheme, medicines for Mucormycosis will be given free to patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-lost-my-father-to-covid-now-my-mother-is-struggling-with-black-fungus-when-will-this-nightmare-end-101621348933452.html

18-05-2021||Delhi||'God bless this country': On Covid-19 situation, Delhi high court says officers living in ivory towers||Covid-19 has not spared even a single family and still central government's officers are living in "ivory towers" oblivious of ground realities, observed the Delhi High Court which on Tuesday was of the view that manufacturing of Sputnik V vaccine in India is giving an opportunity to the nation staring at shortage of vaccines.“God bless this country”, was another remark of a bench of Justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla which castigated the Centre for not being alive to the pandemic situation that is taking so many lives.The bench said the collaboration of Panacea Biotec with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing of Sputnik V vaccine should be seen as an opportunity to ensure its usage here and in such matters instructions are to be taken from the highest authorities that too within 30 minutes.It said "no one is applying its mind" when there is an opportunity for the government to get millions of vaccines and it should use this as a window.“Otherwise, deaths will continue to happen. Every day you are castigated by each and every court and still you are not awake.“Which bureaucrat is giving you instructions. Is he not alive to the situation? God bless this country. That is why we are facing this situation. In such matters instructions are to be taken from the highest authorities that too within 30 minutes,” the bench said.It added, “Does your officer not see so many deaths are taking place in the country and we are short of vaccines. Your client is not alive to the situation.”The bench, which was critical of the Centre's stand on the issue, said “You (government) are so short of vaccines and you are not taking it through. May be it is an opportunity for you. Don’t be so negative. It is like a raging fire and nobody is bothered. You people don’t understand the larger picture or what.“Tell your officers it is an opportunity for you, don’t lose it. No one is applying its mind. The virus has not spared any single family. Your officers are living in ivory towers,” the bench said.The high court’s observations came while hearing a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec seeking to modify a July 2020 order, by which the firm had undertaken not to prosecute further the execution proceedings instituted by them in relation to an arbitral award, running into crores of rupees, passed in its favour and against the Centre.The company, in its fresh application, sought release of the arbitral award saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Covid vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.The bench said “This court is of the view that in today’s time there is acute shortage of vaccines in India and the collaboration of applicant (Panacea Biotec) with RDIF gives India an opportunity to ensure that the vaccine manufactured by the applicant is used for sale in India.”The court issued notice to the Centre and asked it to examine the plea and file a reply within a week and listed it for hearing on May 31.The company, represented through senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, said, “If the awarded amount is not released…, the whole process of manufacture of vaccine at the fastest pace may get derailed and delayed which will not be in the larger interest of humanity.”Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing the Centre, submitted that the manufacturing of Sputnik V will not benefit the country as it will be for global supply by RDIF.He claimed that certain misleading statements were made in the plea and there was no urgency as the vaccines are to be sold outside India.The Centre was also represented through advocates Rajesh Ranjan and B S Shukla.Sethi, however, responded that no manufactured vaccines can be exported without the government’s consent.He said these vaccines are meant only for Indian use and it will benefit the government as the firm is one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines which supplies domestic and international markets.On the Centre’s objection to the plea, the bench said the government is short of vaccines and this company says they are willing to manufacture and deposit 20 per cent of sale proceeds in the court, so it should be taken as an opportunity.The application was filed in a pending appeal of the Centre challenging a single judge’s order dismissing its petition on a limited point of limitation period.Before the single judge, the Centre had challenged the arbitral tribunal’s award which was in the favour of Panacea Biotec and Bharat Biotech International Ltd and Serum Institute of India relating to an earlier agreement for pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines in 2010.In its plea before the division bench, Panacea Biotec mentioned that Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech are also exporting Covid-19 vaccines to various countries and now there is huge shortage of vaccines which is not readily available for citizens of the age of 18 years and above, though officially it has been declared that they are eligible for vaccination since May 1.“It is one of the greatest challenge the humanity is facing which can only be overcome by vaccination and by following other protocols. Unless timely steps for manufacture of Covid-19 vaccine are taken, the death toll can go up to astronomical figures,” it said while maintaining that 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V vaccine for the global market would be manufactured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/god-bless-this-country-on-covid-19-situation-delhi-high-court-says-officers-living-in-ivory-towers-101621341981948.html

She asked chief minister Yogi Adityanath to resign, HT has learnt.While addressing the media on Tuesday, the Congress MLA said “The current UP government has proved to be truly incompetent and have lost their right to govern the state. Morally, the UP chief minister should resign and if they fail to do so, I urge the honourable Governor to dissolve this government.” She further said that the government failed to provide the people of the state with security and a healthy environment.In her address, she defined the Yogi-led government using ‘3Ds’. “ This government is based on denial, destroying of evidence and data manipulation.” She launched a scathing attack when she said the situation in the state would have been far better if the government paid attention to the crisis instead of trying to hide it. She further accused the government of disrespecting the dead by not allowing their close ones to perform their last rites respectfully.Mishra pointed out that earlier the Lucknow Municipal Office was responsible for issuing the death certificates, however, now the CMO has taken over. She questioned the reason behind such a move. “I believe this decision has been taken to hide the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in the state” she opined.In the same virtual address, AICC spokesperson Supriya Srinate brought forward the Covid-19 figures in the state. She revealed that the state’s official death tally shows 2,268 deaths in the state capital. She said, “However, the official figures also show that 7,890 death certificates have been issued in the capital during the 45-days from April 1 to May 15. Additionally, we found that 5,970 death certificates had been issued between February 15 to March 31.” She questioned the discrepancy and accused the UP state government of underreporting the Covid-19 figures.Aradhna Mishra also pointed out discrepancies in the government’s official numbers. She pointed out that a large number of people have lost their lives at home due to lack of hospital beds, she claimed that this is missing from the official records.“The number of death certificates issued in a district will always be higher than the total number of confirmed Covid deaths there. Covid is not the only cause of death. Secondly, not all the death certificates issued in a particular period would indicate them as the deaths that have happened in the same time frame. Many times people apply late or wait for a suitable time for obtaining a death certificate. So, such a gap should not be assumed as a discrepancy,” said a senior state government official in Lucknow. Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said the death certificates of all Covid-19 patients must clearly mention the coronavirus disease as the cause of the demise and kins must not face any problem in obtaining them. The chief minister said this at the Covid review meeting in Lucknow.“The district magistrates and chief medical officers (CMOs) across all districts must ensure that kins of any deceased (died of Covid or non-Covid causes) must not face any problem in obtaining death certificates. If the death has happened due to Covid, then the certificate must clearly mention it. If need be, then necessary government order regarding this can also be issued,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-govt-hits-back-after-cong-points-out-discrepancy-in-up-s-covid-19-numbers-101621343833889.html

On Monday the district had recorded 7 Covid-19 deaths.Seven deaths were recorded in Bokaro, followed by six in Hazaribag, four in Dhanbad and three in West Singhbhum.Two fatalities each were reported from Chatra, Garhwa, Giridih, Gumla, Ramgarh, and Simdega.Jamtara, Khunti, Koderma, Latehar, Palamu, and Saraikela recorded one death each.No deaths have been reported from six of the 24 districts in the state during the last 24 hours.The six districts are Deoghar, Dumka, Godda, Lohardaga, Pakur, and Sahebganj.A look at the health bulletin of the state suggests that prominent cities of Jharkhand like Ranchi, East Singhbhum with headquarter at Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Dhanbad, and Hazaribag are witnessing high Covid-19 cases, while relatively backward districts including Chatra, Gumla, Latehar, and Pakur are logging a lesser number of infections.Battling a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave, the state government has extended the lockdown till May 27.Restrictions with stricter provisions, including seven days mandatory quarantine for people visiting the state, are now in place.Altogether, 77,88,630 samples have been tested for Covid-19 in Jharkhand thus far, including 52,887 since Monday, it added.The mortality rate in the state remained higher at 1.42 per cent as against the nation's 1.10 per cent.In a bid to protect its citizens from the deadly virus, the Jharkhand government had on May 14 launched a free vaccination drive for people in the age group of 18 to 44 years.Over 1.57 crore people in the state are in the 18-44 years age bracket.The state government could not roll out the inoculation drive for these people from May 1 as it was facing a shortage of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-reports-2-507-new-cases-of-covid-19-60-more-fatalities-101621342872137.html
18-05-2021||Jaipur||Cong MLA who rebelled against Gehlot in 2020 sends resignation letter to speaker||Jaipur/Barmer: Congress legislator Hemaram Choudhary, a sharp critic of Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, resigned from his state assembly seat on Tuesday. Choudhary said he had sent his resignation letter to chief minister Gehlot and assembly speaker CP Joshi but refused to explain the trigger for the move.“I have submitted my resignation to the speaker, CP Joshi and CM Ashok Gehlot. I had resigned earlier, but it was not accepted. I have been MLA for two-and-a-half years, and have done enough politics. I will speak on the reason behind the resignation, once it is accepted,” 73-year-old Choudhary said.A state assembly official said Hemaram Choudhary’s resignation was received through email and action will be taken in line with the rules.Hemaram Choudhary,, a six-time MLA from Gudamalani in the Barmer district, was among the 19 MLAs who rebelled against Ashok Gehlot in the summer of 2020. Sachin Pilot fronted the revolt that threatened to lead to the exit of the Gehlot government before the Congress leadership brokered Sachin Pilot’s truce with Gehlot.Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara reached out to the Congress MLA soon after and expressed confidence that he would withdraw his letter. “Hemaram is a senior and respected leader of our party. I have spoken to him after the information about his resignation as MLA. This is a family matter, it will be resolved soon,” Dotasara tweeted.This is the second time since his election in the December 2018 state polls that Hemaram Choudhary has sent across his resignation letter. He had first resigned in 2019 during the first session of the reconstituted assembly, reportedly because he was miffed that Gehlot did not induct him into his council of ministers. He was pacified by senior leaders and later withdrew.Hemaram Chaudhary, who was revenue minister in Gehlot’s cabinet in 2008-2013, had offered to quit before the 2013 elections over differences with another MLA over shifting of the oil refinery site from Lilala to Pachpadra in Barmer.A senior Congress leader said Hemaram Choudhary,has had differences with local leaders and had indicated his unhappiness that his recommendation on issues such as transfer and posting of local officials were not acted upon though requests from other MLAs were accommodated.Political analyst Manish Godha said he would wait for Hemaram Choudhary,to clarify if local problems led him to send his letter or if his letter was the precursor to another political crisis. “The possibilities of pressure politics can also be ruled out as the disgruntled faction is asking for a cabinet shuffle and political appointments,” Manish Godha said.The Bharatiya Janata Party said Hemaram Choudhary’s resignation letter reflected that there was no internal democracy within the Congress and a senior leader was ignored to an extent that he puts in his papers. “If this is the situation, I don’t know when the government’s ship may sink,” Deputy leader of opposition in the assembly, Rajendra Rathore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-mla-who-rebelled-against-gehlot-in-2020-resigns-from-assembly-101621341973781.html

Announcing a series of relief measures, Kejriwal said the families that have lost their primary breadwinner will also get ₹2,500 monthly.Kejriwal said the poor, who do not have ration cards at this point and need subsidised food grains, will be entitled to get them and that a system will be put in place in two days to enable that. He added the relief measures await a formal Cabinet approval and can be notified for implementation only after that.“Common people have been facing a lot of difficulties because of the pandemic. Many of them have lost their loved ones. Several children have lost their parents. Several elderly people have lost their children on whom they were dependent. We cannot replace these lives or reduce their grief. We are only trying to help them, for which we have four announcements,” said Kejriwal at an online briefing.“First, Delhi has a large number of people who are poor but still do not have ration cards. They too will be eligible for free ration being distributed by the Delhi government.” He said people won’t have to show income certificates to avail ration. “Second, families who lost relatives because of Covid-19 will get ₹50,000 ex-gratia. Third, families which have lost their breadwinners to Covid-19 will be entitled to an ex-gratia pension of ₹2,500 per month over and above the ₹50,000 ex gratia.”Also Read | Black marketing of Covid drugs: Here’s what 9 politicians told the Delhi PoliceKejriwal said the money will be credited to the accounts of the spouses in the cases where those who have died were married and that of parents of those who were unmarried. “Fourth announcement is for children who have been orphaned. It includes those who lost both parents to Covid-19 as well as children who lost their only surviving parent to Covid-19. Such children will be entitled to ex-gratia assistance of ₹2,500 per month till the age of 25 and their education will be free – taken care of by the government.”Kejriwal said his ministers have been discussing the measures for the last few days and the finance management to enable these schemes. “People must be wondering where the money will come from. Six years ago, you voted for an honest government. With our anticorruption model and efficient management of resources, we have saved money on many fronts.

The government said that the UT saw more than a threefold increase in its oxygen capacity since April 01, 2021.“From 15,000 LPM on 1st April, installed capacity of oxygen plants in the UT has increased to 50,000 LPM on 17th May 2021,” J&K’s department of information and public relations (DIPR) said in a tweet.“Prompt effort by the administration substantially augments the capacity and availability of medical oxygen in the health facilities of Jammu and Kashmir to serve the public,” it said.The claim comes after advisor Baseer Khan received a consignment of seven oxygen generation plants from Germany on Monday.Khan said that with the commissioning of these seven plants, the oxygen requirement across the hospitals in J&K will be almost fulfilled and will cater to the daily requirements.Among the seven plants, five have a capacity of 1000 LPM each while two plants will have a capacity of 1500 and 600 LPM respectively.Khan said that the supporting infrastructure for the oxygen plants is almost ready and it is expected to be installed commissioned within a few days.“Medical oxygen has become an important commodity in the fight against this pandemic and with the commissioning of these oxygen generation plants, the oxygenated bed capacity of the hospitals will be greatly enhanced,” he said.“The government is keeping a keen eye on the developments and is taking adequate steps to augment its capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jammu-and-kashmir-s-oxygen-capacity-sees-three-fold-increase-government-101621340713989.html

When the police were not able to end the protest, they opened fire killing three people. Six villagers are still missing. Those who are killed are Uika Pandu from Teemapura, Bheema Ursam who hails from Gundam, and Kawasi Waga from Sudwa village. At least 18 people are injured with bullet injuries,” said Rahul Madvi, a villager, while talking to the local media. The locals claimed that three villagers died in Monday’s firing while six are missing and 18 got injured. However, the police claimed that they are yet to identify the deceased and injured. Meanwhile, human rights activists and tribal leaders of Bastar demanded strict action against the officers who ordered firing on Monday and a high-level probe into the matter. Madvi claimed that all three who died were farmers and not Maoists. “The whole thing started when policemen started beating people with lathis and they started running behind. Suddenly, some heard firing and then entered the forest... Later, three were found dead. Since the protest started, they were beating us with lathis,” said another villager, who did not wish to be named. On May 14, villagers from around 10-12 villages began their agitation against the Silger police camp which became operational on May 12. “We don’t want police camps here, instead we want schools, doctors and other basic things. As soon as the camp opens the tribals are tortured and booked under false cases. In coming days, we will be falsely implicated in Maoist cases and would be sent to jail,” said Nandaram Markam, a villager. Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist working in the Bastar region, demanded an enquiry and FIR against the officers who ordered the firing on villagers. “The police and security forces in Bastar are forgetting that they are accountable to the citizens. If the higher officials in the police hierarchy cover up their subordinates’ crimes, shouldn’t they also be seen to be complicit? What has occurred is very serious. An impartial enquiry should be conducted as soon as possible and FIRs should be lodged against those responsible for the order and action,” said Bhatia. Inspector-General of Police, Bastar Range, Sunderaj P, refuted the allegations and claimed that Maoists were taking the villagers as their shield during the protest. “This was a Maoist-compelled protest against the police camp because they don’t want camp in their core area. The protest ended on Sunday night but the Maoists forced the innocent villagers to return on Monday,” said Suderaj claiming that the identification of the deceased is underway but the police have reasons to believe that they were Janmilitia members of CPI (Maoists). Denying the claims of police assault, the IG said that first aggression and fire came from the Maoists of Jagargunda and Pamed Area Committee who were hiding among the villagers and the police was forced to fire in return. The Silgar camp is located eight to ten kilometres away from the site of the Maoist attack that took place on April 3 in Sukma district where 22 security personnel were killed. Tribal leader Soni Sori said that the opening of camps amid the pandemic is not justified both for the tribals and the security forces.“I will comment over the exchange of fire only after meeting the villagers but there is no need of camps in Bastar now,” said Sori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-day-after-3-died-in-police-firing-in-sukma-villagers-say-their-protest-was-peaceful-101621339635073.html
18-05-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: To live to 80, #love30... kmph, that is||Need for Speed. Fast cars. The Rat Race. The city that moves. We’ve glorified speed. Sometimes speed is essential – ambulances can save lives. Rapid response to crises is crucial. But, speed is known to kill:-The likelihood that a pedestrian will die if hit by a car travelling at 30 kilometres per hour (kmph), is less than 10%. -The certainty that a pedestrian will die when hit by a car moving at 50 kmph is more than 80%. Speeding on roads may be causing more than 67% of the deaths in cases of road accidents in India. The speed permitted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in urban areas is 70 kmph. However, urban roads in our cities can’t be designed for 70 kmph, like highways. No wonder, globally, India has the worst record on road safety. The message of the UN Global Road Safety week, from May 17 to May 22, is “Love 30”, signifying that 30kmph, maximum, should be the default speed in residential areas. Road safety advocates Pranjali Deshpande, Ranjit Gadgil and Harshad Abhyankar, suggest a few key measures, to be taken up jointly by PMC, PCMC, traffic police and highways authorities. 1) Safe pedestrian paths and crossing facilities, speed control by traffic calming measures like raised pedestrian crossings, change of road texture, rumble strips and use of roundabouts, as recommended by the Transport Research and Injury Prevention Programme (TRIPP) at IIT Delhi.2) Special safety features and designs based on the road hierarchy for different kinds of roads, and zones which require a higher degree of care, such as schools and hospitals.3) Review road safety in every ward, with neighbourhood groups, and especially with children, women, people with disabilities, pedestrians and cyclists; and introduce signage and traffic calming measures. 4) In line with the recommendation by the UN and WHO, speed limits on roads in Pune should be 30 kmph or lower.5) The speed limit on arterial roads may be increased to 40 or 50 kmph, after a road safety audit and implementing safe road design and management systems to prevent fatalities.6) Widespread publicity of the speed limit.7) Widespread and effective enforcement by Traffic Police.It is appreciable that the municipal road department has already initiated construction of pedestrian crossings at certain locations. Such measures must be in place on priority as they help to save lives. TRIPP suggests that the 30 kmph limit in residential areas may be enforced by the judicious use of speed breakers and roundabouts. Arterial roads may have 40 to 50 kmph limits, enforced by road design and police monitoring. Service lanes along all four-lane highways and expressways should be constructed for use by low-speed and non-motorised traffic. In some time, when lock-downs are lifted, can the city that emerges be a slightly slower, friendlier, more humane city? Many of us have faced so much loss already. The lockdowns have also slowed the pace of life. We want to move forward, post-Covid. Yet, let us not lose the lessons from last year - when lockdowns were lifted, there was a surge in road accidents. Roads with lighter traffic and poor lighting, with speeding vehicles, may be the most dangerous post-lockdown.This time, if any safety measures can be constructed in advance of the re-opening, that would be best. Otherwise, when lockdowns are lifted, traffic calming measures with barricades can be used as an immediate measure on city roads and highways, to be followed by proper road safety measures. Our political leaders, the municipal administration and Traffic Police must show us the leadership we need to save lives through a city-level road safety strategy followed by concerted action. A “safe system” approach to road and traffic management with all relevant authorities acting together to enable mobility without deaths and serious injuries is what Pune urgently needs. Speedy adoption of this approach will save lives!Those interested in joining initiatives by local NGOs may get in touch with this writer for taking up and strengthening neighbourhood road safety plans and actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-to-live-to-80-love30-kmph-that-is-101621339335622.html
18-05-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand hospitals warned against masking Covid-19 deaths, data||Uttarakhand hospitals’ failure to report at least 200 Covid-19 related deaths has led to a warning by health experts against the “masking” of data, saying, it’s continuation could adversely affect the fight against the pandemic in the hill state.The warning comes after the state health department noticed that at least five hospitals and health facilities treating Covid-19 patients didn’t report at least 200 Covid-19 deaths to the state control room in violation of the protocol.Baba Barfani Hospital in Haridwar didn’t report 65 Covid-19 deaths between April 25 and May 2; district hospital Rudrapur too hid as many deaths between April 28 and May 7; Military Hospital Roorkee didn’t report 28 deaths over the last one year; Covid care centre in Raipur near Dehradun didn’t report 27 deaths between April 26 and May 16 and BHEL Hospital Haridwar didn’t report 15 deaths between April 29 and May 12, according to the health department.Baba Barfani Hospital was the first to be issued a notice for under reporting of deaths following which, other hospitals came forward with details of unreported Covid-19 deaths, said officials.Health experts have termed the practice very dangerous. Secretary of Indian Medical Association’s Uttarakhand chapter, Dr Ajay Khanna, said, “Masking of Covid-19 data, especially of the deaths, should be shunned at any cost. The data from the hospital as well as the government should be transparent because it will enable the doctors and experts to fight the virus more efficiently.”He pointed out that even the WHO has warned against it. “Reporting them transparently and factually will help in implementing the cardinal principle of test, track and treat, essential to contain the infection,” Dr Khanna added.Another IMA functionary Dr DD Choudhury, who is the national vice president of the body, said, “The most essential thing in the fight against the virus is data. It should not be fudged or hidden at any end because science is based on data and facts.”The Congress party claimed the state government was hiding Covid-19 data to cover-up its “failure.”“It’s not just the hospitals but also the government, which has been hiding the data to cover up its gross mismanagement and failure. It is playing with the life of people to improve its public relation by portraying that everything is under control when it’s not.”The state health department said that the hospitals claimed that “they had been reporting the deaths manually but not on the Covid portal.”Uttarakhand Covid Control Room’s chief controlling officer Dr Abhishek said they have issued a notice to Baba Barfani hospital seeking to know why it didn’t report the deaths on a daily basis.“All the hospitals in the state have been told to ensure they provide detailed figures of admissions and deaths on a daily basis to the control room. If anyone violates the protocol..., then action would be taken against them, including cancellation of the registration,” he said.According to the state health department bulletin, Uttarakhand’s Covid-19 tally stood at 291,005 on Monday, when 3,719 fresh infections were reported along with136 deaths over the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hospitals-warned-against-masking-covid-19-deaths-data-101621337953627.html

18-05-2021||Pune||Army officer arrested for recruitment paper leak in Feb sent to police custody||PUNE: A Lieutenant Colonel-rank army officer arrested for his alleged involvement in the army recruitment question paper leak case has been remanded in police custody till May 25. The officer, identified in court documents as Lt Col Bhagat Preetsingh Sartajsingh Bedi, was remanded in police custody by Pune’s additional sessions judge SR Navander on Tuesday.Lt Col Bedi is the third serving army officer - the other two hold the rank of Major - to be arrested in two cases related to the question paper leak. In all, 12 people have been arrested.A senior Pune police officer said the army had handed over Lt Col Bedi, 44, to the police after its internal inquiry established his alleged role. “An internal inquiry was conducted by the Indian Army and then he was handed over to us,” said Pune’s assistant commissioner of police, crime, Laxman Borate.Borate said the police needed his custody to recover the mobile phone that the officer had used to allegedly leak the question paper. He said the army did hand over the mobile phone that the officer was currently using but this wasn’t the one that he used to leak the question paper. “We have to recover that phone”.The army’s recruitment exam, scheduled to be held on February 28, was cancelled at the last minute after the army’s military intelligence team and the crime branch of Pune police carried out a joint operation that revealed question papers of the common entrance exam for recruitment of general duty soldiers were being sold for ₹4-5 lakh.Borate said Lt Col Bedi was arrested after he was named as the source of the question paper by Vira Prasad Kotiswamy, 41, a storekeeper posted in Delhi. Kotiswamy was arrested on May 15 and is also in police custody.Public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal said Lt Col Bedi had breached protocol that required him to not use his phone.“He was the presiding officer on the committee that decides on the matters related to the question paper. A CD is provided to the presiding officer and the password is also provided to open the CD. The use of phones is not expected in this process. He used his phone and sent the question paper,” said PP Agarwal.Lt Col Bedi’s lawyer Sudhir Shah, however, insisted that Lt Col Bedi is innocent and his name hadn’t even appeared in the charge sheet filed by the police. “The case was registered on March 1. The charge sheet has been filed. But his name does not figure in the charge sheet,” said Sudhir Shah.The Pune police had filed two FIRs, one at Vishrantwadi police station and the second at Wanowrie police station, on March 1 for the leak that led to the cancellation of the recruitment exam. Nearly 30,000 aspirants were scheduled to appear for the exam across 40 centres.Two Major-rank officers, Major Murugan Thangavelu,47, and Major Vasant Vijay Kilari, 45, were arrested earlier in the Wanowrie case apart from Kishore Mahadev Giri , 40, of Baramati; Madhav Sheshrao Gitte, 38, of Sappers Vihar colony in Pune; Bharat Lakshman Adakmol, 37, from Pune’s Pachora; Gopal Yuvraj Koli, 31, of BEG Centre in Dighi; and Uday Dattu Auti, 23, a resident of BEG Khadki.

The gurdwara management added that their charity had received massive support from both Hindu and Muslim communities, making it a truly humanitarian effort transcending the boundaries of religion. The Alambagh Gurdwara said it received several oxygen cylinders as ‘zakat’ from Muslims during Eid, while Hindus too have donated oxygen cylinders apart from ration kits and hearse vans. Zakat is a form of obligatory charity, which Muslims believe cleanses and blesses their wealth.“The pandemic has brought all the communities closer. Muslims have donated oxygen cylinders to us during Eid. While the Loha Vyapar Mandal has donated several cylinders, the Lucknow Jewellers’ Association has donated ration kits. Sandeep Singh Anant has donated a hearse bus to the gurdwara,” said Nirmal Singh, president of Alambagh Gurdwara. He said the gurdwara in turn had donated more than 800 oxygen cylinders and 4,000 ration kits so far. “With help pouring in from all communities, the ‘oxygen langar’ will start in Unnao Gurudwara on Tuesday and [it] will also begin soon in Ayodhya and Sitapur this week,” Nirmal Singh added. Langar, a word associated with community kitchens serving free food in gurudwaras, is also being used to indicate free distribution of life-saving oxygen cylinders to Covid patients. To avail the benefits, residents will have to give an application to the gurdwara with the doctor’s prescription, Covid and pathology reports, Aadhaar cards of both the patient and the attendant on WhatsApp numbers 9554822225 and 9670888333. Along with medical oxygen, the Alambagh Gurudwara management has also arranged for home delivery of food for Covid-19 infected patients. “We have prepared kits of 10 kg wheat flour, 4 kg rice, 2 kg pulses, 2 kg ghee, 1 kg oil, spices of 4 kinds and a salt packet weighing 1 kg. We deliver kits to the needy, but they have to provide details like aadhaar card, ration card, so that we can keep a record of the beneficiaries.” “We will continue to provide oxygen to Covid patients till things normalize,” he added.Uttar Pradesh on Monday reported 285 coronavirus deaths as 9,391 fresh cases surfaced, taking the state’s infection tally to 16,28,990, a government bulletin said.

Hospitals are still reporting full ICUs as Delhi reported over 20,000 cases daily for 16 consecutive days during the current surge in infections in April.The number of hospitalisations in the city reduced to 15,500 on Monday as per the government’s daily health bulletin.“With fewer new cases being reported now, overall, the situation in hospitals has improved. The wards, oxygen beds, and emergency department are freeing up. However, the ICUs continue to be full. And this is because the duration of hospital stays for those who enter the ICU once is about three weeks. The ICU occupancy is likely to start going down in another 10 days or so,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent, Holy Family Hospital. He added the higher mortality during the second wave was mainly because hospitals were overwhelmed.Also Read | 270 doctors have died of Covid-19 in second wave of pandemic: IMAThe ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients went up from just over 3,000 on April 12 to 6,376 as of Monday evening. There were 5,150 ICU beds on May 3, when the highest number of hospitalisations were reported.There has been an increase in the CU beds in Delhi government-run hospitals such as Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, where the number of beds had to be reduced at the peak of the wave because of the shortage of oxygen. GTB Hospital increased its beds from 750 on May 12 to 1,150 on Monday evening. They include 800 ICU beds. The Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital had 350 beds in the May first week. The number went up to 475, including 325 ICU beds, on Monday. Beds have also been added to the extensions of Lok Nayak Hospital and GTB Hospital.Several private hospitals have also increased the number of ICU beds. The government has also added 250 oxygen beds to its Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka.Dr SCL Gupta, medical superintendent, Batra Hospital, said for the last four to five days, the occupancy at the hospital has gone down by around 20%. “However, the ICU situation is still bad; most of the patients continue to need extensive care.”A doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital said they only have the most critical patients admitted to the hospital ICU. “...most of the others have been discharged.”The number of beds for Covid-19 patients has also increased from just over 21,000 at the beginning of the month to 27,610 on Monday evening. The additional beds are mostly in Covid Care Centres that can manage mild to moderate cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-700-icu-beds-in-delhi-vacant-hospitalisations-also-drop-govt-s-corona-app-101621323673271.html

18-05-2021||Patna||Bihar doctors requested to donate more to help doctors dying of Covid-19||Doctors in Bihar have been requested to donate generously to help families of doctors dying due to Covid-19, following a moderate collection of ₹11 lakh from the state. The Covid Martyrs Fund set up by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has collected ₹1.94 crore till May 13 and disbursed almost half of it-- ₹80,00,000 to the families of eight doctors, including one from Bihar.“Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. Actions speak louder than words. Please donate generously to IMA Covid Martyrs Fund,” IMA’s Bihar chapter appealed on May 13.Gujarat, with ₹45.95 lakh and Delhi with ₹35.34 lakh, are the two top donors followed by Maharashtra- ₹30.07 lakh, Kerala- ₹19.29 lakh, Haryana- ₹18.20 lakh and Uttar Pradesh- ₹16.47 lakh that have contributed more than Bihar. Many states including Telangana- ₹2.54 lakh, Punjab- ₹1.01 lakh, Uttarakhand- ₹5,000 and West Bengal- ₹500 have made even smaller contributions, shows IMA data, available till May 13.IMA president-elect Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh accepted that mobilising funds had not been easy.“We are trying to persuade our doctors to contribute generously,” he said.“Given the paucity of funds, the IMA shortlists beneficiaries based on the recommendation of its respective state unit. Families of two more doctors from Bihar are in the queue to receive the compensation of Rs10,00,000 each,” he said.The senior vice-president of IMA’s Bihar chapter Dr Ajay Kumar said only a dozen odd doctors out of the 10,000 registered IMA members in Bihar had contributed to the corpus so far.“Dr Devi Ram, a physician in Purnia, has contributed ₹5 lakh, the highest from Bihar so far,” he said.Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of IMA-Bihar, suggested IMA's "questionable" credibility could be the reason for the lukewarm response."IMA is a social organisation of doctors that has been hijacked by a group of people who do not have mass appeal. This is the reason their appeal has either no meaning or less bearing on its members," said Dr Prasad.However, former president of the state IMA, Dr Sachchidanand Kumar, held a different view. "Doctors are farsighted and even willing to spend money when it comes to furtherment of their personal gains. However, they have a myopic vision when it comes to contributing to the cause of someone else," he said.At Least 121 doctors in Bihar, including 39 in the first wave last year and 82 in the second one this year, have died till Monday, May 16, due to Covid-19, said Dr Kumar. Only four of these have got compensation from the state government so far, amplifying the problem, he adds.He also rued the fact that the Centre was not considering ex-gratia for private sector doctors. “Of the 121 doctors who have died so far, around 70 are from the private sector,” said Dr Kumar.The Center has given ₹50 lakh insurance cover to doctors fighting Covid-19, while the state promised an ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh to Covid victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-doctors-requested-to-donate-more-to-help-doctors-dying-of-covid19-101621320133273.html

An FIR under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against Umang Singhar on the basis of his recorded conversations/chat history with the woman and her son’s statement, police said.Bhopal’s deputy inspector general of police, (DIG), said the woman and the MLA had planned to get married but she decided to end her life instead due to regular fights with the politician. “The woman had been living in the MLA’s bungalow for the past 20 days while he was visiting his assembly constituency of Gandhwani in Dhar district,” additional superintendent of police (ASP) Rajesh Bhadoriya said.He added that the house help employed at the Congress leader’s Shahpura bungalow first discovered the body and informed the police. Police claimed it recovered a suicide note from the woman’s articles accusing Singhar of anger issues and lack of clarity on some matters.Statements of the woman’s 20-year-old son, her mother and the Congress leader, have been recorded. Her son told police that his widowed mother met Singhar on a matrimonial website in September last year and they decided to get married. An engagement ceremony was held in December last year.“They met many times in Bhopal and at the woman’s home town in Punjab in the past few months. Recently, she told her family she was in depression due to regular fights with Singhar,” the ASP said. Singhar is separated from his wife.MLA said it was heartbreaking for him to lose such a “dear friend”. “I am cooperating with the police in the investigation but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government is doing dirty politics on this [issue].” BJP leader and MP home minister Narottam Mishra said the police will take further action on the basis of investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-congress-mla-booked-for-abetment-of-woman-s-suicide-at-his-bungalow-101621315212746.html

A controversy has broken out over the governor using the interregnum between two governments to accord his consent; in the normal course of events this consent would have been needed from the speaker of the assembly. “The CBI has to seek sanction from the assembly speaker to file a charge sheet against a member of the House.

18-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Florence Nightingale’s street||Delhi has all sorts of lanes, all over the place.And then there’s Florence Nightingale Lane in Green Park—reminding us of the need for nurses in these grim days of pandemic.The street suitably houses the Trained Nurses’ Association of India; the sprawling building features an outdoor painting depicting Nightingale—walking past a row of filled hospital beds carrying a lamp.The other side of the road sports expensive private homes, some of them with three stories. Many have huge glass windows through which the afternoon sun shines so brilliantly that you might well imagine a getaway resort. Some of these rooms on the upper floors have no curtains, and clearly reveal the furniture inside. One house has a gigantic frangipani tree peeping out of its gate. Another is decked with tall, handsome Ashokas. Then there’s a mansion with the national flag at the top. Many homes also cultivate lush little plants streaming along their length. The shadows of their leaves along border walls tremble gently in the breeze. It’s akin to watching some silent film filled with hidden meaning.Do the residents of these splendid dwellings feel secure enough not to worry that much about their livelihoods during the lockdown? Can they afford to live in self-isolation far into the future?There’s no one to immediately ask. The only folk you find on this street are smartly uniformed guards stationed outside residences. On the porch of one particular house the young guard chit-chats with a stray dog.Towards the end of this enchanted road is the sudden sight of a blooming amaltas tree generously covered with golden flowers. You’re reminded of that fairy tale where anything the king touches turns into gold. The scene is even more glorious because the sky is deep blue and the street is empty (lockdown!). And now appears a man with a cylinder on his back. He is a “mosquito terminator”. The man stands by a drain under the tree and starts spraying the insecticide into it, oblivious to the tree’s noisy beauty.Outside the nurses’ building is a large plaque commemorating 2020 as the “year of the nurse & midwife”. But history will mark it more as the time as when coronavirus entered our lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-florence-nightingale-s-street-101621298198101.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Court reserves order on plea to halt Vista work||Richa Bankaricha.banka@htlive.comNew Delhi The central government on Monday told the Delhi high court that the petition seeking stoppage of the partial redevelopment work on the Central Vista is an attempt to halt the project with oblique motives.Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioners, on the other hand said the Centre was trying to shoot the messenger instead of focusing on the message of health, life and safety. Terming the project as the “central fortress of death” instead of the Central Vista, Luthra said its deadline could be pushed to December 30 instead of November 30.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh reserved its judgment on the petition seeking a stay on the ongoing construction at Central Vista Avenue amid the Covid pandemic.The Central Vista project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate ministry offices.The court was hearing a plea by Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, seeking to halt the ongoing partial redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue which includes both sides of Rajpath where Republic Day celebrations are held.While solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the plea was nothing but a “ facade of PIL created to disguise something which they wanted to stop under one pretext or the other”, Luthra said the construction does not fall in the essential category.Luthra said exceptions were made for this project and permission was also sought to ferry workers during the peak of the pandemic in April. He said 180 vehicles were given the green signal to transport workers, which has also been admitted by the Centre, but documents have not been given to the court.“They accept that it is a limited challenge but chooses to attack the messenger and the message is health, life, and safety, not only ours or theirs but everybody’s…,” he submitted.Luthra clarified that the petitioners do not intend to halt the project but it is for the current phase of the pandemic.He argued that no document of willingness by the workers was produced even when the Centre submitted that certain workers expressed willingness to stay put on the worksite. Luthra showed a photograph of April 24 to the court highlighting there is no bed, no bedding and no person in the tents.He referred to a media report and said that seven workers were shoved in one room, adding that if there are residential accommodations for the workers, then the same have to be shown.Rebutting the arguments, SG Mehta said the workers are staying on site and the petitioner had suppressed facts. He submitted that there is a medical facility at the site and workers will have access to something that will otherwise not be available to them.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, for Shapoorji Pallonji, agreed with the submissions of the Centre and said that all facilities are being provided to the workers. After lengthy arguments, the court reserved its judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-reserves-order-on-plea-to-halt-vista-work-101621295943009.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||5 rescued from fire at Dwarka building||Five members of a family were rescued from the first floor of a two-storey building in Dwarka after a fire broke out in its basement in the early hours on Monday. The family was trapped as some vehicles parked in the basement caught fire, blocking their escape route.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that while a detailed inspection is awaited, a preliminary investigation suggested a short circuit may have sparked the fire.Officials aware of the matter said the DFS control room received a call around 1.30am, reporting that some people were trapped in a house due to a fire in Dwarka Mor; four fire tenders were rushed to the spot initially, and two more were sent later. “Our team found that the fire had sparked from the basement of the residential building. Since there was only one entry and exit point, they could not leave the building,” said Garg.He added that one group of firefighters focused on containing the blaze, while another team tried to rescue the trapped family.“Wearing hazmat suits, our men tried to enter the building through stairs but it was not possible. We then set up a ladder up to the balcony of the first floor and our men climbed up to assist the family and bring them down. All five of them were brought down one by one safely using the ladder. None of them were hurt,”said Garg.In August last year, three members of a family, including a 12-year-old boy, had to be rescued from their east Delhi flat after a fire broke out on the ground floor. The vehicles had caught fire, blocking the only escape route. “People must ensure that vehicles are not parked near electricity meters, particularly in buildings that do not have an alternate escape route. People must also get the wiring of electricity meters checked by qualified professionals every year,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/5-rescued-from-fire-at-dwarka-building-101621295850265.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: As hospital beds free up, Delhi goes easy on plan to create more temporary facilities||The Delhi government has eased up on creating more temporary Covid care centres (CCCs) across the national capital, as new cases continued to decline on Monday, resulting in more hospital beds freeing up for those in need of them.Delhi on Monday recorded less than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases for the first time in nearly 42 days. A total of 4,524 new cases were recorded in the national capital in the past 24 hours, pushing the cumulative tally to 1,398,391, the health bulletin said.The positivity rate -- the proportion of samples returning positive among the total tested -- dropped further to 8.42% on Monday, which further underscores the trend that the outbreak is receding.A day earlier, Delhi’s positivity rate was 10.4%. Last month, the positivity rate at one point crossed 35%. The daily death toll, however, rose from 262 recorded on Sunday to 340 on Monday, as per the health bulletin.Going by the steep spike in Covid-19 cases in the city during the two-week period between April 18 and May 1, when cases had averaged over 23,000 daily, the Delhi government chalked out a mega bed augmentation plan to create an additional 10,500 beds (including 1,000 ICU beds) for Covid-19 treatment.Of these planned 10,500 beds, nearly 4,340 have either been made operational or were to be set up as on Monday.But the occupancy in these temporary CCCs has fallen sharply because of increased bed availability in hospitals.At the peak of the crisis, only 13.6% of Delhi’s Covid-19 beds were empty (16,942 occupied and 2,666 vacant) on April 20, according to figures -- in reality, most people said they were unable to find beds. Six days later, the city completely ran out of ICU beds, data showed.On Monday, however, Delhi had 11,696 Covid-19 beds vacant of the total of 27,560 beds. The city also had 877 of 6,575 ICU beds available, as per the Delhi government’s Corona app.“A 1,000-bed facility was being built on war footing in north Delhi’s Burari area, on the campus of Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission. The facility will be ready by this week, but its opening has been put on hold for now. We are keeping everything ready so that in case there’s a new wave or a sudden spike in cases, we will just need to organise the medical staff and the facility will be ready overnight,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.The official clarified that this facility is separate from the other 1,000-bed Covid care centre that was opened on May 3 at the ashram of Sant Nirankari Samagam in Burari. As on Monday, 142 of the 1,000 beds were occupied in that facility.The Yamuna Sports Complex CCC, for example, has 800 operational Covid-19 beds of which only 65 were occupied as on Monday.“Until three to four weeks ago, this centre was jam-packed like all other facilities in the city. But, now there are barely three to five admissions daily. If cases surge again, we can expand this centre to 1,000 beds anytime; everything is ready,” said a senior official of the Shahdara district that manages the centre, asking not to be named.Similarly, the 460-bed CCC at Commonwealth Games Village has 460 operational beds of which only 63 were occupied as on Monday. This centre was also scheduled to increase its total beds to 1,000. The expansion has been put on hold for now.The Sardar Patel CCC, built in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur on the campus of Radha Saomi Satsang Beas, was planned to accommodate 5,000 beds, but that too has been put on hold for now. “At least 500 beds are operational now and we have another 500 ready. But the occupancy has decreased. If needed, we can scale up to 5,000 beds in phases. But that is not required at the moment,” said one of the managers of the facility, requesting not to be named.Around three weeks ago, people were queuing up for hours and even days outside this centre to get admitted. A few families had even said that their Covid-positive loved one had died while endlessly waiting to be admitted.Apart from the above mentioned CCCs, the 1,000 ICU beds at two centres built on Ramlila grounds in east and central Delhi have also been made operational.With the number of cases on decline and the pressure on hospitals reducing, doctors say that they are able to take better care of patients.“The mortality was very high in the initial phase of the current wave because hospitals were overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients. The doctors and nurses had no time to constantly monitor each patient. That has improved now,” said a senior doctor from a big private hospital, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-cases-decline-delhi-govt-puts-on-hold-move-to-add-more-covid-beds-101621297345775.html
18-05-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka mulls over Covid-19 lockdown extension||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday said that his government is mulling over the extension of lockdown in the state amid spike in coronavirus cases.While addressing the press meet briefly, Chief Minister said, "We are still discussing regarding extension of lockdown. Anyway, the imposed lockdown will remain imposed till 24th May. After two-three days, we will discuss and decide the extension of lockdown."As per the state health bulletin yesterday, the state logged 38,603 new Covid-19 cases and 476 deaths in the last 24 hours.Also, the state health minister took cognizance of the black fungus cases being reported in the state.Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is now a noticed disease and hospitals should report it to the government, said Karnataka Health and Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar on Monday, adding that it is illegal to hide it."Black fungus is a post-covid complication. Those who have uncontrolled diabetes and use high dosage of steroids are vulnerable to this. Those who undergo organ transplantation and have immunocompromised conditions like HIV are also likely to contract this. Such category of people should be more cautious," the Minister warned while addressing a press conference here.Meanwhile, the state is also bracing with the likely effects of Cyclone Tauktae.One person was killed and over 70 houses got damaged in Uttara Kannada district due to cyclone Tauktae on Sunday, informed the Karnataka Government."In 5 taluks of Uttara Kannada, 71 houses, 76 fishing boats and 271 electric poles were damaged.

18-05-2021||Delhi||MAMC's beloved Bhandari Bhaiyya dies after serving canteen for 25 years||On any regular day, the department canteen of Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) would echo with vociferous requests for tea, snacks and lunch -- all addressed to Bhandari Bhaiyya. Whatever time of the day, Bhandari Bhaiyya would always be there, taking orders and passing on full plates with a shy smile.Since May 11, the MAMC canteen has been bereft of that smile. Babulal Bhandari (Bhandari Bhaiyya), (49) a canteen server for nearly 25 years, lost his battle to Covid-19. Current and former students, many of whom are senior medicos in top hospitals, are now raising money to help Bhandari’s family in Nepal.Alumni members of MAMC said Bhandari started showing symptoms of Covid-19, including respiratory distress, cough and temperature, from May 2 but his RT-PCR test came back negative on May 4. On May 8, he had to be admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital after his condition deteriorated. On May 11, he died of a cardiac arrest prompted by Covid-19, according to hospital records.“He (Bhandari) had been serving at MAMC’s canteen for a long time. He was there when I completed my MBBS. He greeted me with so much warmth whenever I went there. He continued to relentlessly serve the medical fraternity even during Covid,” said Dr Himanshu Meena, resident doctor, paediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, who graduated from MAMC in 2012.The MAMC canteen, where Bhandari worked caters to doctors and medical students from four affiliated hospitals, including the adjacent Lok Nayak Hospital, which is the largest Covid-19 facility. While medicos are equipped with safety gear, supporting staff like Bhandari, who is in regular contact with these front-line workers, are left with scant protection, even though they are also at high risk.An internal newsletter of MAMC, ”Trending Now in MAMC”, posted on Sunday, “Through the years, he had formed a personal bond with everyone who had ever set foot in the canteen...He would be missed dearly by everyone he crossed paths with.”In an interview to that newsletter in 2017, Bhandari had said he worked 12-hour shifts, without any holidays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mamcs-beloved-bhandari-bhaiyya-dies-after-serving-canteen-for-25-years-101621295638340.html
18-05-2021||Gurugram||Tension in Nuh after 27-year-old, on way to medical store, beaten to death||A 27-year-old man was killed and his two cousins injured after a group of about 15 men attacked them with sticks and guns while they were on their way to Sohna from Nuh to buy medicines on Sunday night. Police on Monday said they have arrested six men so far and booked 8 others on charges of murder and rioting.While the police said the motive for the attack is unclear, the family of the deceased, Asif Khan, alleged that the suspects were former members of Khan’s gym and they had a fallout with Khan over some issue. They, however, did not reveal what the issue was, police said.Meanwhile, some locals have claimed that the assailants had forced Khan to chant a Hindu religious slogan before fatally attacking him. But the police refuted the claims and said the complaint by Khan’s family did not mention any such angle.However, in view of the claims, police deployed over 100 personnel in and around Khan’s village, Kheda Khalilpur in Nuh, to prevent any law and order situation.According to the police, Khan used to run a gym in Sohna. On Sunday, around 8pm, he left from Nuh for Sohna in his car, along with his cousins, Rashid and Wasif.Narender Bijarnia, superintendent of police (SP), Nuh, said around 15 men on motorbikes and cars started following the trio. They hit Khan’s car from the rear and forced him to stop, after which they assaulted Khan and his cousins with guns and sticks next to a plywood factory near Atta village in Nuh, he said.“Khan’s cousins Rashid and Wasif, who sustained injuries in the attack, managed to escape but the suspects took Khan to the outskirts of Sohna. His body was found later that night in Nagli village,” the SP said.“Both groups had fought in the past also and that issue was resolved. But on Sunday, the suspects were more in number and attacked the three cousins and killed one,” Bijarnia said.Once news of Khan’s death reached his family, his relatives and villagers protested on Sohna road on Sunday night seeking the arrest of his murderers. Police later said a special investigation team was formed on Sunday night to arrest all suspects.Rashid Ahmad, Khan’s cousin and a social activist and lawyer from Nuh, said Khan had no personal enmity with the men who attacked him. “He used to run his gym and the suspects were members of his gym but due to some tiff, they had stopped coming there and bore a grudge against Khan,” he said.Hasan Khan, an uncle of the deceased, said the suspects had forced them to stop their car and also pelted stones on them when they tried to speed away. “They requested the attackers to let them go as they had to buy medicines for an ailing relative but they did not pay any heed. They had come with the intention of killing Asif,” he said.Police registered a case under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder), 323 (causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), and 365 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of Arms Act at the Rozka Meo police station on Monday.The body was handed over to the family members on Monday after the post-mortem examination and the protesters were assured of justice, following which the blockade was removed, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-man-on-way-to-medical-store-killed-101621294760998.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Oxygen concentrator case: Delhi Police get Navneet Kalra’s custody for 3 days||The Delhi Police on Monday said businessman Navneet Kalra, who has been charged with hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices, was hiding at a farmhouse owned by his in-laws in Gurugram, along with his family. He was arrested from there by a police team late on Sunday evening.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal on Monday said a team from Maidan Garhi police station caught Kalra and then handed him over to the crime branch, which is investigating the case. He was produced before the magistrate in the Saket court on Monday.Metropolitan magistrate Archana Beniwal sent Kalra for three days of custodial interrogation after the Delhi Police said his custody is required to unearth the whole nexus and conspiracy behind the black marketing and know the trail of money transaction. Kalra will now be produced before the court at the end of his police remand on May 20.Kalra’s lawyer Vineet Malhotra said his client’s bank details, mobile phone, laptop and gadgets were already available with police and that his custodial interrogation was not required. “Remand must be granted only in cases of real necessity. For what purpose do they need custody? They need to know the trail? They can get any information they want from me. Request for the police remand is absurd,” Malhotra said.Kalra was allegedly on the run since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular between May 5 and May 7. A Delhi court on Thursday refused to grant protection from arrest to Kalra, following which he moved the Delhi high court. The high court on Friday also declined to grant any interim relief to him.Five persons, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, chief executive officer (CEO) and three senior officers of Matrix Cellular, were arrested since the recovery of the concentrators. All five were later released on bail while the case was transferred to the crime branch for further investigation, the police said.While granting bail to the accused on May 13, the court said “no prima facie case under section 420 IPC is made out against the accused, at least from the contents of the FIR”, adding it was unable to understand the offence they had committed.Investigators said multiple teams were conducting raids in Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand to arrest Kalra, who left his house in Chhatarpur along with his family members soon after the raids at his restaurants. They said he left without his driver and drove the car himself.A senior police officer associated with the probe said the south district police on Sunday received information that Kalra was at a farmhouse in Gurugram. The information was checked and the location of the farmhouse was established. Around 8pm, on Sunday, a team from Maidan Garhi police station raided the farmhouse and arrested Kalra. His two cars – a Range Rover and a Thar jeep – in which he and his family members had left their Delhi home were also found parked at the farmhouse, the officer said.“The farmhouse is owned by Kalra’s in-laws. We questioned Kalra and he told us that he had been there since May 5, the day 419 oxygen concentrators were seized in the first round of raids at his Nege & Ju restaurant and the office of Matrix Cellular. We are verifying Kalra’s claims regarding his presence at the farmhouse since May 5,” said the officer.Police also said they also recovered Kalra’s two mobile phones from the farmhouse. Both were switched off. Investigators said they will analyse the call records and may send the phones to a forensic lab to find out of any “important and crucial data related to the case”.Another police officer privy to the development said Kalra’s in-laws may also be asked to join the investigation and if required, they may be booked on charges of harbouring a fugitive.“Kalra has told us that he never stepped out of the farmhouse. Also, except him and his family members nobody else was staying there. We are now trying to find out how they were arranging their daily household needs. Was anybody helping them with such items is also a part of the probe,” the second officer added.Police have alleged that for each concentrator, Kalra and his partners made a profit of at least ₹55,000. The concentrators were bought for ₹14,000-15,000 each and sold at ₹70,000-75,000. Police said since October, they had bought nearly 7,500 concentrators and more than 2,000 concentrators were sold in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-concentrator-case-delhi-police-get-navneet-kalra-s-custody-for-3-days-101621293413870.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Fix formula for MRP of oxygen concentrators: Delhi HC to Centre||The Delhi high court on Monday sought to know why the Centre was not fixing a formula to decide the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of oxygen concentrators even as devices were being black marketed and sold at exorbitant prices.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said that the government can fix a principle to decide the MRP of the concentrators after the Centre’s counsel said it was not possible to fix prices because the devices come from various exporters who may stop supplying to India if the rates were fixed.The high court said it was not asking the government to fix a price in rupee or paisa, but to fix a principle on which oxygen concentrators will be charged. The government should understand that if this is not an extraordinary circumstance where it should intervene, then what will be, the high court added,The court suggested fixing a formula like the landed price of the product, plus duty charge, plus 15% profit margin.“There has to be some limit to it (the price). It cannot be limitless. Tomorrow some Chinese manufacturer will say he will sell it at 5X rate, it cannot be allowed…” the court said.It added: “As a government, it is your responsibility that people are actually able to afford the product and not have to pay through their nose. They can’t be taken for a ride. Shortage of a product cannot be taken advantage of. Should you not think of the consumer?”Central government’s counsel Kirtiman Singh and Amit Mahajan had said the landed price was ultimately determined by the exporter, and it was not possible for the government to fix the prices as there are different concentrators in the market with different prices, sizes, and names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fix-formula-for-mrp-of-oxygen-concentrators-delhi-hc-to-centre-101621290158304.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 pandemic not a selling point, says Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday said that political parties cannot make the ongoing Covid pandemic a “selling point” and that they have no business buying medicines and hoarding them to earn some goodwill while also slamming the city police for their shoddy probe into allegations against politicians from different parties that they were hoarding Covid medicines and oxygen cylinders.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also said that political leaders are expected to surrender their stocks to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Delhi government, for use by the poor and needy persons at government hospitals. “Since it is being projected that the medicines are held for public charity, we expect that as responsible citizens, people (political leaders) will not procure these medicines for political gains,” the bench said.The court’s observations and directions came after the Delhi Police submitted its preliminary investigation report in which it had given a clean chit to nine politicians, including BJP MP Gautam Gambhir, Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president BV Srinivas and Dilip Pandey of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who faced allegations of hoarding oxygen cylinders and essential medicines.On May 7, the court directed the police to carry out an investigation in the alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders even as it refused a CBI probe, on a plea by Deepak Singh, who runs an NGO, Hrudya Foundation.Reacting to the clean chit to the accused by the police, justice Sanghi said, “We are not accepting this position….This is completely unacceptable. Political parties cannot make this pandemic a selling point. How could they purchase it without prescription? You have to act with responsibility. They have no business buying medicines and hoarding them to earn some goodwill. Now it seems that you are not interested in getting out the truth.”Expressing dissatisfaction over the police investigation, the court directed the city police to go into specifics of the case.“You had to go into specific allegations. If some political leader is advertising some medicine free of cost, where is he getting it from? There are reports of shortages in supply. Does he hold a licence to hoard and distribute? How can you be so slack about it?” the court remarked.“Just because some political figures are involved, this is no reason to not investigate. Your force should stand up, you have a duty towards the people. You have to understand this. People all over are suffering,” the court said, asking the police if they realise how many people have died due to lack of medicines, which, allegedly, were being hoarded by some people.Advocate Virag Gupta, appearing for the petitioner, said that no action has been taken against any of the politicians and cited the example of Gambhir who had distributed Fabiflu tablets. Fabiflu is an anti-viral drug which is used to manage the symptoms of Covid-19.During Monday’s hearing, advocate Sanjay Lao, standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal), for the Delhi police, sought further time from the court to complete the investigation. Highlighting BJP MP Gambhir’s reply to the police, Lao said that the lawmaker procured the medicine through his foundation which is attached to the Garg Hospital in east Delhi’s AGCR Enclave. Citing Gambhir’s reply, the lawyer said the medicines were procured by a doctor of the hospital.Justice Sanghi intervened saying, it was prima facie difficult to believe that a doctor was getting the medicines in bulk when there was an overall shortage in the market and people were paying high price for the drug.“We find it difficult prima facie to believe… How can a chemist give it to a doctor? It’s not the monetary factor. It’s not about seizure. If a case is made out, you can seize. We will not direct seizure as it’s a legal exercise. We are appealing in good sense and as good Samaritans that this should not go and they should go and surrender it with the DGHS,” the bench said.The court further directed the Delhi Police to conduct a “proper investigation” in the matter and do the needful if a case is made out to register an First information Report (FIR). It asked the police to file a status report showing how medicines were procured in “such large numbers by a few persons”.The matter will now be heard on May 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-pandemic-not-a-selling-point-says-delhi-hc-101621289531342.html
18-05-2021||Kolkata||Standoff as Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s ministers held by CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday arrested two senior West Bengal ministers, a legislator and a former Kolkata mayor on charges of bribery and corruption, triggering fierce protests by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and a six-hour agitation by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.A special CBI local court granted bail to all four accused -- urban development minister Firhad Hakim, panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee, Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee -- but the Calcutta high court stayed the order late on Monday. The case will be next heard on Wednesday.The four leaders were arrested from their residences in the morning and charged under Section 120b of the Indian Penal Code (criminal conspiracy) and sections 7 and 13(1)(a) 13(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act for charges related to the 2016 Narada sting operation bribery case.Shortly afterwards, Banerjee rushed to the CBI’s office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata and left after nearly six hours. “Mamata told CBI officials that she should also be arrested,” said a TMC leader aware of the developments.Also Read| Mamata Banerjee inducts 43 ministers: Check full list of portfoliosThe case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting, conducted by online news portal Narada News, purportedly caught several senior TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company.“The CBI has today arrested four then (former) ministers, government of West Bengal, in a case related to the Narada sting operation... it was alleged that then public servants were caught on camera while receiving illegal gratification from the sting operator,” CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said in Delhi.TMC alleged that CBI was acting on orders by the BJP, which recently lost assembly elections in West Bengal to Banerjee’s party. TMC won 213 seats and BJP could only manage 77.TMC pointed out that two key people shown in the sting -- party vice-president Mukul Roy and Bengal leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari -- had switched to the BJP and weren’t among those arrested on Monday.Also Read| Narada case: No social distancing as TMC workers protest ministers’ arrest“We condemn this. The BJP is not being able to accept the humiliating defeat and hence trying to take revenge. Why isn’t Mukul Roy, vice president of BJP, being arrested? He was also seen in the Narada sting operation,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.Roy moved to BJP in 2017 while Adhikari switched in December 2020.As Banerjee sat on a dharna inside the CBI office, hundreds of TMC workers gathered outside in protest. Some protestors hurled bricks, shoes and bottles at central forces guarding the CBI office. TMC supporters also blocked roads with burning tyres and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Law is taking its own course. BJP has nothing to do with this,” said Samik Bhattacharjee, BJP spokesperson.TMC also claimed procedural lapses in the arrests.Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee said that the arrests were illegal and undemocratic as his permission was not taken. “The speaker’s prior permission is necessary to arrest a legislator and before submitting charge sheet. CBI, however, didn’t take any permission. It is illegal and unconstitutional,” said Banerjee.The federal agency, however, said it sought the permission of West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on May 9. The charge sheet against five accused people, for whom prosecution sanction was received, is being submitted, said Joshi. The fifth accused is Indian Police Service (IPS) officer SMH Mirza, who is out on bail.Banerjee took oath as chief minister for the third time on May 5.Dhankhar condemned the violence. “Total lawlessness & anarchy. Police and administration in silence mode. Hope you realize repercussions of such lawlessness and failure of constitutional mechanism,” he tweeted.In the high court, the matter was virtually hear by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee for nearly an hour after which the bail of the four leaders was stayed. “We were not made a party to the hearing. We have not received the court order. We were kept in the dark. We will plan our next over after going through the order,” said Anindya Raut, advocate and TMC leader.Till the next hearing, the four leaders will be lodged in Kolkata’s Presidency Correctional Home. A huge contingent of Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force was deployed outside the CBI office at Nizam Palace and Presidency Correctional Home. TMC workers assembled in thousands at both locations on Monday night.Also Watch| Stone pelting, baton charge amid TMC protest against CBI in Kolkata﻿The Congress and the Left backed Banerjee but Communist Party of India (Marxist) Rajya Sabha MP, senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, said: “The arrests were not illegal.

If it has nothing to do, then no permission is required.”Mathew Samuel, chief executive of Narada News, said his fight was against corruption. “It was a long wait. Finally, I got the result...My question is what happened to Suvendu Adhikari? He also received the money from me. It was recorded and handed over to CBI. Justice has to go everywhere in same manner,” said Samuel.Hakim said the arrests have stalled Covid-19 work in the state, which is under lockdown to arrest surging infections. “My colleagues who bent down to their pressure tactics and joined BJP are spared from the arrest today and harassment by CBI,” he said.Mitra thanked Banerjee for her support. “Justice will prevail.#khelahobe (game on),” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/standoff-as-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-s-ministers-held-by-cbi-101621286031169.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Covid in Delhi: 160 oxygen concentrators given in 2 days, says health minister||A total of 160 oxygen concentrators were provided by district administrations to Covid-19 patients in the national capital in the past two days under an oxygen bank scheme announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday, with an aim to enhance oxygen support for patients in their residences, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said.The highest number of concentrators were distributed by the north district (28), followed by south-west (26) and west (25). In the south-east, south, New Delhi, central and north-east districts, 10, 11, 21, 15 and 14 oxygen concentrators were distributed respectively. The fewest so far – two, three and five – were distributed by north-west, east and Shahdara districts, showed the data shared by Jain in a tweet.“All 11 districts have 200 oxygen concentrators ready under the scheme. But they can only be given on the prescription of a doctor of a Covid-19 hospital under the currently applicable protocols,” said a senior official, who asked not to be named.In April, Delhi witnessed its worst health crisis during the pandemic as hospitals ran short on oxygen on a daily basis, and were unable to procure the lifesaving gas on time amid limited supply. Some critical Covid-19 patients lost their lives for want of oxygen, according to doctors.Also Read| Delhi: As vaccine stock runs low, Sisodia calls for transparency in allocationBut the oxygen situation has eased considerably over the past week, with fresh Covid-19 cases declining in recent days, more beds freeing up in hospitals, and the Centre increasing the daily oxygen supply to the state.On Monday, Delhi had 35,141 Covid-19 patients in home isolation, while 10,918 fresh discharges were made by hospitals. New cases continued to decline, reporting 4,524 infections and a test positivity rate of 8.42%.Kejriwal said oxygen concentrators under the scheme can be availed of by both patients in home isolation, and also those discharged from hospital who have been advised oxygen support for a few more days, by calling on the government’s central Covid helpline number 1031.Under the new scheme, Delhi government doctors are supposed to stay in touch with all those who are given oxygen concentrators from these banks. Once the patient recovers, the concentrators will be taken back, sanitised, and handed over to the next patient.Also Read| Delhi's daily Covid-19 cases drop below 5,000 for first time after April 5Once a concentrator is assigned, teams are meant to deliver the machine in two hours, and a technician is also supposed to accompany the team and explain to the patient and caregiver how the machine is to be used.The scheme was launched in collaboration with Ola Foundation and GiveIndia.“We are expanding our O2forIndia Initiative in partnership with Ola Foundation and launching it in Delhi this week.

18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Inapt Covid behaviour, virulent strains behind sudden spike in deaths in Jammu:Experts||A three-member panel of experts, which had come to Jammu to ascertain the cause for the high mortality rate in the division, attributed the surge in deaths to Covid-inappropriate behaviour and the presence of three virulent strains from the UK, South Africa and India (B.1.617) in the region. The team comprised Dr Mahesh Waghmare, deputy director (microbiology), National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi; Dr. Pranay Kumar Verma, deputy director of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) at the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi; and Dr Navneet Sharma of PGIMER, Chandigarh. Waghmare said, “While the lockdown will definitely help contain the virus, Covid-apt behaviour is indispensible. We found that people were not following the norms stringently, which has led to the high positivity and mortality rate in the region. Earlier, the region had the South African and UK variants and now we also have the highly infectious Indian variant as well.” Delay in hospitalisation contributing to high fatality rateThe team found that the mortality rate within 24 hours of hospitalisation was 30% while 12% patients were being brought dead to hospitals. “This shows people are reaching hospitals at a very late stage, which is contributing to the high mortality,” Waghmare said. The Indian variant is primarily responsible for the surge in cases in Jammu division, said experts. In March, the UK variant was found in 60% of the 434 samples sent for genome sequencing. In April, it dropped to 47% while the B.1.617 variant’s prevalence increased from 5.8% to 38%. The Indian variant has now overtaken UK strain in Jammu division. Experts suspect that the Indian strain is now contributing to at least 50% cases. Waghmare conceded that the government was ill-prepared for the sudden surge and there were insufficient critical care beds in the region. He suggested strict police patrolling during concession hours to check overcrowding and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Both preventive and curative aspects have to be adhered to in earnest but the greater responsibility lies with the people,” he added. “We may be lacking in infrastructure but we are augmenting it. Doctors and paramedics are on the job 24x7. Following sudden spike in deaths, a massive door-to-door sampling has also been initiated in Jammu,” a local official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inapt-covid-behaviour-virulent-strains-behind-sudden-spike-in-deaths-in-jammuexperts-101621282272108.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||J&K’s grimmest day yet as virus claims 73||Jammu and Kashmir witnessed another grim day on Monday with 73 people losing their lives to the novel coronavirus, the highest-ever daily fatalities since the outbreak, taking the overall death toll to 3,222.The UT also recorded 3,344 fresh infections, taking the UT’s Covid count to 2,47,952. Of the 73 deaths in the UT, 54 were reported in Jammu division and 19 in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 1,926 are from Kashmir, 1,418 are from Jammu, while 76 were travellers.May has turned out to be deadliest month for J&K as the monthly toll touched 940. With 71,869 infections, the month also clocked the highest number of cases so far. Around 48,437 patients have recovered this month. Officials said with 613 cases, Jammu had the highest number of new infections, followed by 495 in Srinagar, 376 in Budgam and 228 each in Anantnag and Udhampur. The number of active cases has reached 50,852, officials said. Most cases have been added after February 9 when the UT had the lowest active case tally of 593.Dr Lenah Bashir, lecturer microbiology, Government Medical College, Srinagar, said cough, cold, loss of taste and smell, and fatigue were mild symptoms while breathlessness indicated severe infection. “Severe symptomatic patients should be shifted to the hospital for treatment and monitoring,” she said.She said that double mutant strains of SAR COV2 are showing heightened infectivity and evading the immune systems, hence increasing mortality. “Previously,infected people have a greater chance of re-infection due to the double mutant,” she said.92 inmates test positive for COVID-19 in two prisonsNinety-two inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 in two prisons of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Monday, and asserted that all the positive cases are asymptomatic and have been isolated in separate barracks.The latest detection in Udhampur and Kupwara district jails through special Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) screening pushed the active cases among inmates to 115 out of a total of over 4,570 prisoners in all the jails, officials said.The special drive in the two jails was carried out nearly two weeks after a prominent separatist leader and chairman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, who was lodged in Udhampur district jail under Public Safety Act, died of Covid at a government hospital on May 5.J&K gets 7 new oxygen plants from GermanyJ&K on Monday received seven new imported oxygen plants from Germany with a cumulative generation capacity of 7,100 litres per minute (LPM). The oxygen plants were carried by an Indian Air Force aircraft from Munich in Germany and reached Srinagar Airport in the afternoon. “New Oxygen Plants including 5 of 1000 LPM, one of 1500 LPM and one of 600 LPM capacity will further add 7100 LPM to the existing availability,” Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha said in a tweet. He said this will hugely augment oxygen supply to the health infrastructure in the UT.“My deepest gratitude to Hon’ble PM @narendramodi for providing 7 Oxygen plants to JK UT. With his intervention, these Oxygen plants were airlifted by @IAF_MCC from Munich, Germany and safely landed at Srinagar Airport today at 12:45PM,” the LG added.Construction workers given aid

The section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been added to the FIR registered on October 12, 2015, at Bajakhana police station, a day after the SIT arrested six Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda followers for sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari village. The SIT led by inspector general of police (IGP), border range, Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, on Sunday arrested Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny; Nishan Singh, Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola; and Pardeep Kumar, all resident of Kotkapura; Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village and Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village. While seeking seven-day police remand, the SIT produced the accused before the court of judicial magistrate Faridkot Tarjani, who sent them to police custody till May 21. Accused had plan to do another sacrilege in 2015: SIT The SIT had told the court that 150 torn pages of a bir of Guru Granth Sahib, which was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015, were found scattered near a gurdwara at Bargari. “This act was carried out by the accused. During the investigation, it has been revealed that there were 100 more pages torn from the holy book and the accused had plan to do another sacrilege at Hari Nau village in Faridkot district in 2015. Those pages have not been recovered so far, so their custodial interrogation is required for that purpose as well,” SIT added. Dera followers’ counsel Vinod Kumar Monga argued that the CBI has already given them clean chit in these cases but SIT has arrested them without any evidence. However, the SIT claimed that they have sufficient evidence against the accused in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bargari-sacrilege-6-dera-men-sent-to-4-day-police-custody-101621282151773.html

Earlier, they had assembled outside the deputy commissioner’s office where their indefinite protest has been going on since January 4. They also held a march from the DC office to the minister’s residence.The aspiring teachers ended their protest after a written assurance of a panel meeting with the education minister on May 24 at Chandigarh.Sandeep Sama, senior vice-president of the union, said that their two members have been protesting in Patiala for the past 58 days. “However, the government is not paying heed,” he added. Sama said the government announced 2,364 posts for ETT, but the education department was considering BEd candidates for these vacancies. The protesters demanded that 10,000 more vacancies for ETT-qualified teachers be advertised and only qualified candidates from the category should be considered for these posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aspiring-teachers-gherao-punjab-school-education-minister-s-residence-in-sangrur-101621281912680.html

A Jammu resident, Kunal Shrivatsa, who was one of the recipients of the contradictory messages, said the revised norms had been announced on May 13 but he and his family had booked a slot on May 12. “Dear Kunal Shrivatsa, Your vaccination is scheduled for 22-05-2021 01:00PM-04:00PM at KOT BHALWAL. Your booking reference ID is 14230350723762 and your 4 digits secret code for vaccination is 3762 – CoWIN,” read the first message, received on May 12. “Dear Kunal Shrivatsa, scheduled vaccination on 22-05-2021 is cancelled, Inconvenience is regretted. Reschedule on cowin.gov.in,” read the second message, received on May 16. Centre had said pre-booked appointments will not be cancelled Notably, on May 16, the Union health ministry had said, “Online appointments, already booked for the second dose of the Covishield vaccine, will remain valid and the same will not be cancelled on Co-WIN platform.” It, however, said requisite changes have now been made to the CoWIN digital portal, as a result of which further online or on-site appointments will not be possible if the period after first dose date for a beneficiary is less than 84 days. Financial commissioner health and medical education Atal Dulloo said slots had been rescheduled as per revised norms. While Dulloo said more supplies were on their way to J&K, a senior health official said the UT was facing shortage of vaccines. No vaccination in Valley in 5 days Kashmir valley had recorded no vaccination on Sunday in a striking contrast to the Centre’s claims of despatching vaccines on a daily basis. The health bulletin says none has been vaccinated in the last five days. “It seems the government’s exercise of re-scheduling the gap from first dose to 12 to 16 weeks is either because it has run out of vaccines or production has not been scaled up to the requisite level,” said Naveen Mattoo, a Kashmiri Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-vexation-contradictory-messages-leave-j-k-s-45-group-baffled-101621281911564.html
18-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi: As vaccine stock runs low, Sisodia calls for transparency in allocation||As vaccine stocks in the city for all beneficiary groups continued to dwindle on Monday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged the central government to ensure supply of more doses for the 18-44 age group, make the statewise vaccine allocation system more transparent, and give advance estimates of supply for the months of June and July so that appropriate vaccination strategies can be drafted by the city government.On Monday evening, according to the government’s vaccine bulletin, the city had less than one day’s stock of Covaxin and five days’ stock of Covishield left for the group that comprises health care workers, frontline workers and individuals aged 45 and above.For the 18-44 years category, the government has already run out of Covaxin stock – leading to temporary suspension of around 140 centres last week – and had about four days’ stock of Covishield doses left.While the Delhi government is scheduled to receive 283,970 doses of Covishield and 98,890 doses of Covaxin between May 21 and 29 for health care workers, frontline workers and individuals aged 45 years and above, no vaccines are expected to arrive for the 18-44 years group till May 29, shows a separate set of government documents seen by HT.Also Read| Delhi's daily Covid-19 cases drop below 5,000 for first time after April 5In a press briefing on Monday, Sisodia said: “We have limited vaccine doses for beneficiaries belonging to the 18-44 years group. We may have to shut our centres. The central government is unable to provide us with adequate doses for this age group.”In a statement issued later, the deputy CM said, “In a letter addressed to the Delhi government, the central government has committed to distribute 3.83 lakh doses for 45+ age group, however the same provision has not been extended to the 18-44 age group. This is a grave issue that requires immediate attention of the Centre. At the very least, they should match the doses for 45+ citizens and distribute 3.83 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group as well.”The statement added” “I have written a letter to the central government today requesting their support on three key matters. First, to make vaccine doses available for citizens between 18-44 years, just like they have given us doses for citizens above 45 years… My second request is to make allocation data of vaccines transparent and open to the public… Allocation data on how many vaccine doses have been administered to which state and for which age group, should be open to the public. We also need to know how many vaccine doses are being sent to private and government centres. (The) central government should be transparent in its vaccine allocation data, just like it has increasingly shown transparency in oxygen allocation in every state.”Central government officials did not respond.According to a formula shared by the Centre with the Supreme Court on May 9, state governments will altogether have access to 25% of the total vaccines produced in a month for vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group. By that system, states collectively will be given 20 million doses to inoculate their 18-44 age group population from the roughly 80 million vaccines doses expected to be produced this month, which essentially leads to fixing of quotas on a pro-rata fashion for states based on their population size in the 18-44 age group.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todaySisodia further said in the statement: “The third request pertains to communicating information on (the) number of vaccine doses that will be administered to us in the months of June and July, just like how we have received information for the month of May. This will help us in planning our vaccination programme, so that we can make a streamlined system of how many centres will be equipped with vaccines and how centres will be managed.”On Monday, Delhi also opened its government schools for vaccination of people aged over 45 years – which was so far happening only at dispensaries and hospital premises – with an on-site registration facility.“We began vaccination drive for 18-44 and 45+ citizens in a rapid manner and from today, we have started moving vaccination centres from hospitals and dispensaries to Delhi government schools with the introduction of walk-in facility for citizens above 45 years. As of now, this programme is working successfully and we hope that we can expect support from the Centre on this,” he said.Also Read| Covid-19: 5th phase of lockdown begins in Delhi as positivity rate down to 10.4%According to Monday’s vaccine bulletin, the government said that more than 4.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Delhi since the roll-out of the drive on January 16 – of which around 1.06 million were second doses.Delhi, by electoral roll data, has a total adult population of around 15 million. The shortage of vaccines adds up to concerns for people who have their second doses due in the coming days.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “People should take the second dose in time. Even if there is a delay, they should still take it at the earliest. But delay in taking the second dose would lead to compromise with the potential immunity provided against Covid-19 by the concerned vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-as-vaccine-stock-runs-low-sisodia-calls-for-transparency-in-allocation-101621280696037.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Construction of water treatment plant begins at Patiala’s Ablowal||The much-hyped canal-based water supply project worth ₹503 crore has been initiated with the start of construction work of 115 MLD water treatment plant at Patiala’s Ablowal village on Monday.Member of parliament from Patiala, Preneet Kaur, laid the foundation stone at an event organised by the district administration. However, Covid restrictions and guidelines went for toss as no social distancing was observed at the venue.The project aims at channelising the water distribution system, besides assisting in controlling depleted underground water table due to the traditional tubewell system.It is one of the dream projects for Patiala. In 2006, the project was proposed to ensure round-the-clock water supply, but the project got buried under piles of official documents for over a decade, before regaining pace after Captain Amarinder Singh came to power in 2017.Preneet said the project includes water treatment plant of 115 MLD (million litre per day), a clear water reservoir of 17.28 MLD besides storage and sedimentation tank of 236 MLD at Ablowal village.“Nearly 5 lakh people of the city would get 24x7 uninterrupted clean water supply through this project. The work of this important project would be completed within the stipulated time by Punjab water supply and sewerage board and Larsen and Toubro company,” she added.As per the details, the multi-crore project has been divided into two phases. In the first phase, at least 35 cusecs of water will be fetched from Bhakra canal, stored and treated on 32 acres at Ablowal. In the second phase, water fetched from Ghaggar-link canal will be treated accordingly.Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said currently, the city’s demand of 33 cusec water is being met with 134 tubewells, but due to the over 30 years’ old system, 60% water is getting wasted. “The two-phased project is being set up keeping in mind the year 2051, when population of the city is expected to be doubled. This project will then provide 63 cusecs water,” Bittu said.In 2019, the Union ministries of finance and urban development had given a green signal to the MC’s canal-based water supply system project, which was to be carried out as a joint venture by the state and the central governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/construction-of-water-treatment-plant-begins-at-patiala-s-ablowal-101621281851655.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||191 ventilators lie unused in HP for want of skilled staff||At least 191 medical ventilators received from the Centre during the first Covid-19 wave last year under the PM Cares Fund are lying unused in Himachal Pradesh due to the lack of trained staff to operate them besides technical reasons. Till last year, the hill state had only 52 ventilators in its health institutions, including medical colleges. In June last year, the state received 574 ventilators from Chennai, including 178 portable ones of which 405 are functional. “All ventilators received from the Centre were distributed to the hospitals,” said Ramesh Chand, the deputy director, health, who is the nodal officer for procurement. “We have received ample personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and masks from the Centre,” he says. The ventilators were distributed to different hospitals for installation. Some hospitals installed them, anticipating the requirement, while a majority of them, particularly the district and zonal hospitals, remained reluctant to install them. The health department has now hired a private company to install the ventilators. A majority of the 191 ventilators are lying unused for want of the medical gas pipeline system and other accessories needed to operate them. Thirty ventilators were given to Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Shimla; 19 to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Shimla; and 10 to Kamla Nehru Hospital. Five ventilators each were given to hospitals in Rohru and Rampur. Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, got 42 ventilators and 15 went to Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College, Chamba. Ten ventilators were given to hospitals in Palampur, but they were not installed and five were dispatched to the hospital in Nurpur, while 15 ventilators were given to the zonal hospital in Dharamshala. The ventilators given to the Palampur hospitals were later shifted to Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, as the hospitals did not have doctors who could operate them. The health department has a shortage of skilled technical staff, including anaesthetists to operate the equipment. Stock unused, returned to Centre While the stock is lying unused, high-load health institutions, such as Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Tanda, and Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College, Nerchowk, are facing shortage of ventilators. RPGMC, Tanda, has 72 ICU beds and all of them are occupied as on May 16. Similarly, LBSGMC has also exhausted its 50-ICU bed facility. Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, has 45 ventilator beds of which 38 are occupied. According to health department sources, the state received 250 more ventilators from the Centre around two months ago, but these were later returned. While the health authorities claimed that these were portable ventilators and were meant for another state, the sources said that the Centre recalled these ventilators as they were lying unused. Foreign aid reaches Himachal Himachal Pradesh has received medical equipment to fight the pandemic from various countries. Among them are 96 large oxygen cylinders from Finland, 25,000 viral transport mediums (VTMs), mask and PPE kits from Kazakhstan; 288 large oxygen cylinders from Singapore; and 25,000 rapid testing kits from South Korea. Earlier, 50 ventilators from Switzerland, 41 from Spain, 20 from Canada, 10 large ICU ventilators from Egypt were received. Shimla has got 150 large oxygen cylinders from England, 283 small oxygen cylinders from Kuwait, 100 small oxygen cylinders from Korea, 185 cylinders from Taiwan, 596 remdesivir injections from the US and 80,000 masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/191-ventilators-lie-unused-in-hp-for-want-of-skilled-staff-101621281611591.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy transplantation to begin on June 10 in Punjab||The Punjab agriculture department has decided to advance the start of paddy transplantation in the upcoming kharif season. The decision to begin the sowing on June 10 came considering the shortage of labour due to ongoing pandemic. The decision will also facilitate staggered paddy sowing so that social distancing protocols could be maintained. The state authorities are cautious as the virus has spread its tentacles in the rural areas of Punjab. In 2020, the paddy sowing had begun on June 13 and in 2019, it was mandated to start paddy transplantation from June 20 in a bid to conserve subsoil water which fulfils 85% irrigation needs in the state. The Punjab government had passed a legislation to ensure that all farmers adhere to the transplantation schedule, but it was left with no options but to advance the process due to the pandemic. “We have no other option right now. There is acute labour shortage, so we have decided to advance the paddy transplantation,” said SS Sidhu, director, agriculture. The state government’s legislation that paddy wouldn’t be sown before June 20 outlines that late transplant is complemented by monsoon and there is not much dependence on the subsoil water. However, in 2019, when the campaign for parliament elections was going on, Punjab CM, on the demand of farmers, had announced to advance the process by a week to June 13. By an estimate of state agriculture department, 12.5 lakh labour heads are required to sow paddy in 30 days’ time frame. “But so many people to transplant paddy in the state are not available,” Sidhu said. Paddy is a major kharif crop in state, which is expected to be sown across 70 lakh acres in the forthcoming season. In the previous seasons, PAU had been taking a stand for not changing transplant schedule keeping in view acute fall of subsoil water table across the state and a report by central ground water board asking state machinery to regulate water usage.However, this year, PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon said that Covid crises are worsening and the virus is spreading fast in the rural Punjab. “This is the least we could do to help our farmers,” he V-C said.Direct seeing of rice on 30 lakh acresThe agriculture department has decided that out of total area of 66 lakh acres under paddy in the ensuing season, direct seeding of rice will be done on at least 30 lakh acres. In the previous season, 12.5 lakh acres were under the DSR method. “The trials conducted in the previous season have shown good results, and we are ready to increase the area,” said the director.The department has pegged the area under premium quality basmati paddy at 13 lakh hectares, an increase of one-third in total area. The sowing of aromatic variety begins from first week of July and that of DSR from the mid of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-transplantation-to-begin-on-june-10-in-punjab-101621281551671.html

18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Harassment allegations against Channi: Women commission chief threatens to go hunger strike if govt doesn’t act||Punjab State Commission for Women chairperson Manisha Gulati on Monday threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike if the state government fails to act on a clarification sought by her in harassment allegations by a women IAS officer against cabinet minister Charanjeet Singh Channi. In November 2018, the IAS officer had accused Channi of harassing her even as no formal complaint was lodged in this regard. The development comes in the wake of Channi holding a meeting with a cabinet colleague and Congress MLAs, including Navjot Singh Sidhu, over alleged mishandling of the sacrilege and police firing cases by the Amarinder Singh-led government. “Despite several reminders, I have not received any reply from the government and now I am being held guilty by a section of the officers for not taking action. I am not answerable to the government but to the women of the state,” she said in a press conference in Chandigarh, asking the government to file a time-bound reply to a fresh communiqué sent by the commission. “The matter can be taken up even 10 years after its occurrence. The government should know how powerful the (women) commission is. In case anything happens to me, the government will responsible,” she said. “In 2018, I had taken suo motto action and sought clarification from the then chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh about the matter. I had sent a reminder also but there was no reply,” added Gulati. “The CM had then given a statement that the minister has sought forgiveness. No one accuse me of being hand in glove with the minister and not taking action against him. I have never spoken to him. I will campaign in the 2022 state polls and make public aware as how women in the state are treated,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harassment-allegations-against-channi-women-commission-chief-threatens-to-go-hunger-strike-if-govt-doesn-t-act-101621281374394.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Programme to detect sick patients floated in Barnala||Amid surge in Covid cases in Barnala villages, Pendu Sanjeevani Committee — a community-based programme — has been launched for timely medical intervention at grassroots level, subdivisional magistrate Varjeet Walia said on Monday.The SDM said that early proactive detection of all sick patients in the villages, facilitating their testing, ensuring medication, daily monitoring of vitals and timely referral to Level-2 facilities in case of health deterioration are the core principles of the committee which comprises registered medical practitioners (RMPs), health workers, patwari, guardians of governance (GoG), and volunteers. The programme was launched from Chananwal of the district. “Daily door-to-door health survey began on May 14, a day after the launch. This included recording of vitals such as body temperature, SPO2 levels, heart rate and symptoms experienced. Total 16 people with Covid-19 symptoms were identified on May 15. Of the identified sick patients, 11 underwent Covid tests,” he added. As per this programme, daily village health survey reports will be provided to chief health officer and senior medical officer. They will categorise all patients in the village under Level 1 and Level 2 stages.“The idea is that the committee members will first identify non-tested patients and then motivate and counsel them for testing and isolation. Body vitals of such patients will be recorded daily in the survey, which will help us gauge the medical condition of the patients who do not come forward for testing. Suitable medical treatment would be given to these L1 or L2 patients. This model would result in reduction of fatalities in villages,” the SDM added. Panels formed to tackle Covid in Patiala rural areas
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab set to engage RMPs to combat Covid in rural areas||The Punjab government has decided to rope in registered medical practitioners (RMPs) in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic in rural areas of the state. In a video conference, chief secretary Vini Mahajan on Sunday asked the district administrations and health department officials to chalk out a plan to improve rural outreach across the state. Officials said RMPs, also referred to as quacks by medical professionals, may prove helpful in convincing residents in villages to get themselves tested for Covid-19 and follow the medical protocol. According to estimates, Punjab has nearly 70,000 RMPs working in cities and rural pockets. The RMPs do not have medical degrees but practice medicine, predominantly in peri-urban and rural areas. “They might be criticised by various sections but the RMPs can play a significant role a time when the pandemic has spread aggressively in rural pockets and people are hesitating to get tested,” said a senior health official.Mansa was the first district to engage RMPs to contain the spread of virus in villages.Bathinda deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said a special outreach drive with RMPs on board will commence in the district from Wednesday. “The RMPs will be members of a group of health workers contacting residents in the rural belts. They will not treat any patient but will take stock of health condition of people and report to the health authorities for further action,” he added.In the predominantly rural belt of south Malwa districts, there has been a spurt of infections and mortalities. On Monday, Fazilka had 10 villages declared as containment zone.Fazilka civil surgeon Parminder Singh said the health teams will be strengthened by engaging RMPs and they can help in reducing the burden on over-stressed hospitals.“People in villages hesitate in sharing their health status with officials but they feel comfortable with RMPs. They share a bonding with these practitioners and we can make use of their relationship in enhancing health surveillance effectively,” he said.Ramesh Kumar Bali, president of the Medical Practitioners Association of Punjab, a union of RMPs, said he recently discussed the issue of roping in RMPs with health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and the chief minister’s adviser Sandeep Sandhu.“More than 60,000 RMPs in Punjab have at least an experience of 10-years and they can be engaged for mass awareness at villages. The RMPs have the largest network of healthcare at the grassroots level. Our team can motivate people to go for isolation and taking vaccination by removing misconception about the pandemic,” said Bali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-set-to-engage-rmps-to-combat-covid-in-rural-areas-101621281372486.html

In a video clip that was purportedly shot during the raid, Nirbhai is seen talking on phone. His “servant” Ranjit Singh was arrested, the police said. Excise department officials said the raid was conducted early morning on a tip-off. Three drums were also recovered from the spot. A case was registered against Nirbhai and Ranjit Singh under sections 61-1-14 of the Excise Act at the Bhikhiwind police station. “We had information that Nirbhai was involved in bootlegging. He is a panchayat member but claimed himself to be village sarpanch. We didn’t know how he escaped from the spot,” said Inspector Jatinder Singh of the excise department.Kacha Pakka police post in-charge sub-inspector (SI) Lakhwinder Singh, who was part of the raid, said, “We nabbed Ranjit but Nirbhai managed to flee.” It was the police team that allowed Nirbhai to escape from the spot, it is learnt. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said, “I will check if the accused was present at the time of the raid.”An excise official said, “We even got a call from MLA Bhullar’s personal assistant who asked us to oblige Nirbhai.” MLA Bhullar said, “I do not know why he kept such a large quantity of liquor at his residence.” About his photos with the accused, he said, “He is from my constituency and it’s normal to get photographed with people from one’s area.” In another raid in the village, the team arrested Nishan Singh, also a Congress worker, after 400-kg lahan and 20 litre illicit liquor were recovered from his premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lahan-illicit-liquor-seized-from-congress-mla-aide-s-house-in-khemkaran-101621281313702.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||3 SITs on task, focus back on sacrilege, police firing cases||With Punjab heading for elections early next year, the politically sensitive cases of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and subsequent police firing in Faridkot district’s Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 are back in the spotlight as three special investigation teams (SITs) have been tasked with expediting probe to take these cases to their “logical conclusion”.The investigation into these cases was put on the fast track last week by the state government with the SIT headed by inspector general of police SPS Parmar probing the sacrilege cases arrested six followers of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda for desecration at Bargari. The SIT led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav that was formed on May 8 to probe the Kotkapura cases also started inquiry after visiting the firing site, besides taking case records in possession from the local police station. On May 15, the government also formed a three-member SIT headed by IGP (Ludhiana range) Naunihal Singh to probe the Behbal Kalan firing case. As the issue of delay in justice in the sacrilege and police firing cases is echoing within the ruling Congress, many senior party leaders have been critical of the state government’s handling of the matter. Amritsar (East) MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu has been continuously hitting out at chief minister Amarinder Singh accusing him of protesting the Badals with “nefarious intentions”.Since 2015, two judicial commissions and five SITs (including two new SITs constituted this month) have been formed by the state government, besides a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which had given clean chit to the accused dera men.The previous SITs have pointed out “conspiracy” following a series of sacrilege and police firing incidents. The SIT headed by SPS Parmar is looking into the three FIRs registered at the Bajakhana police station in connection with sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. The first case pertained to the theft of the bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village near Kotkapura in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. The second was the putting up of derogatory posters at Bargari on September 25, 2015; and the third was the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the bir were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari on October 12, 2015. The Parmar-led SIT had put focus on the third FIR with the arrest of the six dera men and this is for the first time that arrests were made in this case.Before the CBI officially started inquiry after being handed over probe into the three sacrilege incidents by the previous Akali-BJP government, a three-member SIT headed by former IG Ranbir Singh Khatra had arrested more than 20 dera followers, including Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019, in connection with two other sacrilege incidents in 2015 and rioting in Punjab in 2011. The SIT claims the dera followers had confessed to the crime.In July 2019, the CBI had filed a closure report in three sacrilege cases, saying it could not find any proof against the accused. The Congress government, however, took back the cases from the CBI and handed over the probe to the SIT led by Khatra. In July last year, the SIT named jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, national committee members of dera — Sandeep Bretta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri — as accused and filed a chargesheet against seven sect followers (including five arrested by Parmar-led SIT) in a case relating to the theft of the ‘bir’. But later, all were released on bail.On the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s order quashing all the reports submitted by SIT headed by (now retired) IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, the state government constituted new three-member SIT headed by ADGP Yadav. As per information, SIT is going through the previous investigation and looking into all the legal challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-sits-on-task-focus-back-on-sacrilege-police-firing-cases-101621281312673.html

Also, the state is yet to fully open vaccination drive for the 18-44 age category. According to reports from various districts, there was a hue and cry at most of the vaccination centres for the second consecutive day with a large number of people returning home without a jab. On Sunday, there were only 5,200 doses available for the 45-plus category, which, on Monday, came down to 4,200. Punjab is left with only a few hundred doses of Covishield and Covaxine that senior health officials say will suffice only for those seeking the second dose on Tuesday. Even as state government is left with around 1.5 lakh doses of Covishield for the 18-plus category, the quota has been reserved for families of health workers and the construction workers, falling in this age criteria. The Centre will send 75,000 doses for 45-plus category on Tuesday which are likely to reach the vaccination centres by the same evening. Director, health and family welfare, GB Singh, said because of the shortage of the vials, the vaccination for 44-plus category could not take place on Monday as well. State finally orders one-lakh Covaxine doses The Punjab government, which till now was dithering from purchasing Covaxine, on Monday booked an order of one-lakh doses with Bharat Biotech. Earlier, the focus of the government has been on purchasing Covishield from Serum Institute of India (SII) and it didn’t make purchase of Covaxine citing its high price and the availability of Covishield with almost same efficacy at much lower price. “Many other states booked both Covaxine and Covishield and their supplies from the private manufactures for the 18-plus category is better than ours,” a health department official said. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Hussan Lal, said Covaxine is being purchased for the employees working in different industrial units. “Many industrial units have requested us to make the purchase for which they will contribute,” said the principal secretary. He said the vaccine supply may be better ease in coming days as the private hospitals of the state are also likely to get 2-lakh doses by the end of this month.

The decision was taken in the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. The lockdown, which was to end on Tuesday morning, will now continue till 5am on May 25.A UT spokesperson said the decision was taken “so that the gain of plateauing of case load due to the lockdown is not lost (sic).” The move comes in the backdrop of strong opposition from the business community, which was demanding some relaxations, such as implementation of the odd-even formula for opening non-essential shops. “It is a tough time for traders, as we have to pay taxes and give salaries to our staff too even though our shops continue to remain closed,” said Sanjeev Chadha, general secretary, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal. “Why can’t markets in the city open on the odd-even format, as in Mohali?” Chandigarh Beopar Mandal president Charan Jiv Singh said they will hold peaceful protests from Wednesday, which will be launched from the market in Sector 23. Kamaljit Singh Panchhi, president, Chandigarh Traders Association, Sector 17, also opposed the move, and demanded a relief package for the city’s traders. Vyapar Sadan president Arvind Jain sent a list of suggestions to the administrator on how markets can be opened in a phased manner to prevent overcrowding. DC to meet trader bodiesIn order to assuage the business community, the deputy commissioner will meet the representatives of various associations to solicit their views and suggestions regarding relief that could be provided to them due to losses being suffered during the lockdown. Badnore appealed to the landlords of small residential houses to voluntarily reduce house rents for the lockdown period, in order to give relief to their tenants, who have lost their income, and prevent their migration. Even Punjab and Haryana governments had extended the lockdown on Sunday. It will remain in force till 5am on May 24 in Haryana and till May 31 in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-to-continue-in-chandigarh-till-may-25-101621280172441.html
18-05-2021||Chandigarh||Jakhar denies VB probe against party leaders||Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday denied the rumours of vigilance probe against party leaders, asserting that there was no truth in them. Reacting to Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh’s charge of a threat call by the chief minister’s political secretary, Jakhar said that he (Pargat) was a role model for the youth and the party respected his sentiments. “The main agenda is to save the people from Covid-19 and to punish the perpetrators of sacrilege incidents that happened during the previous government,” the PPCC chief said, denying the vendetta politics charge. He said the Congress was against using the constitutional institutions to settle scores and it was unthinkable to do so against its own MLAs. ‘Sandhu says he made no threat call’ Jakhar also said that Capt Sandeep Sandhu, political secretary to chief minister, himself had made it clear that he never made any threatening phone call to the legislator. “It appears to be more a case of misunderstanding than a threat. If he (Sandhu) made such a call and said those things at someone else’s behest, it is indeed a matter of probe,” he added. He also urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to investigate the propaganda regarding vigilance probes against party leaders as it was tarnishing the image of the party. These mischievous rumours were being spread to divert attention from the pandemic and bringing the culprits in sacrilege incidents to book by completing the probe quickly, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jakhar-denies-vb-probe-against-party-leaders-101621279873177.html

He added that the disease should not be compared to Covid-19 or believe that it can transmit in the same fashion as Covid-19.In a bid to contain the spread of black fungus across the state, the government has formed a specialised task force comprising ENT specialists, microbiologists and other senior officials from the government that will be headed by HS Satish, the head of the department for ENT at state-run Victoria Hospital.The new infection comes amid a raging Covid-19 pandemic that has thrown life out gear in the state as well as the country for over a year now.The disease is said to appear in those persons who have immunocompromised conditions like cancer, HIV and other problems, the minister said. Sudhakar said that even Covid-19 infected persons with uncontrolled diabetes and are given higher steroids can contract the disease.“The fungus enters through the nasal cavity in persons with low immunity. Then it will attack eyesight. One should get treatment immediately after it enters the nose. It is learnt that the water used in humidifiers in hospitals is causing this. (An) experts panel has been set up to find out the exact cause of this disease. Measures will be taken after the expert committee submit its report,” Sudhakar said. “This is a notified disease and all private hospitals, ENT specialists should inform the government if such cases are discovered. This information cannot be kept private and must be informed to the government. Hiding it from the government is against the law,” the minister added.Drugs like Amphotericin B are used to treat the disease. The supply of the drug, however, is controlled by the centre and it has so far allocated 1050 vials to Karnataka, the minister said, of which the state had received 450 till date.Several states in India have reported a high number of black fungus cases that has added to the panic amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Sudhakar said that the government has placed orders for around 20,000 vials of the medicine along with two other drugs, which are also effective against black fungus.The minister said that at least five centres across Karnataka which includes Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubbali, Kalaburagi and Shivamogga will start opening by Thursday to treat people who contracted the disease.Sudhakar said that the new task force will also try to determine the source of the infection. Both Covid and Black fungus patients are treated free of cost, he added.CN Ashwath Narayan, the deputy chief minister of Karnataka and chairperson of the state’s Covid task force on Monday called on ‘Global Innovation Alliance Partner Countries’, to partner with the state in exploring possibilities of procurement of drugs, specifically like Amphotericin B that is critical for treating Black Fungus infection, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.He also asked these countries to partner with Karnataka in new technologies like nano medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, 3D Printing, Cloud Computing etc, with the approach of establishing a better health monitoring system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-forms-task-force-on-black-fungus-so-far-identifies-97-cases-in-state-101621279872095.html

18-05-2021||Chandigarh||CM’s political secy threatened me over phone: Pargat Singh||The rift in the ruling Congress in Punjab took a nasty turn when party MLA Pargat Singh on Monday accused Capt Sandeep Sandhu, political secretary to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, of threatening him for speaking his mind on the sacrilege and police firing cases. Pargat, who has been critical of his own government’s mishandling of the probe into these cases, alleged that Sandhu threatened him over the phone on Thursday night. “Sandhu said he was conveying the chief minister’s message that papers have been collected against me and I should be ready to face action. I asked him thrice whether the CM had told him to say these things and he (Sandhu) confirmed it,” the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA said at a press conference at his flat here. The two-time legislator said he told Sadhu to convey to the chief minister that he (Pargat) was ready to face any consequences. “I later even asked him if he has given my message to Capt, he confirmed that he has. If this is what one has to face for raising the sacrilege cases, power purchase agreements, illegal mining and probe into irrigation scam, so be it. I am ready to face any kind of probe. They can do whatever they want,” the former India hockey captain said, adding that he had informed Punjab Congress Sunil Jakhar about the threat call. While Sandhu did not respond to calls or text messages, no statement was issued by the chief minister’s office (CMO). Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa termed the incident as extremely distressing. “I stand with him (Pargat) and his democratic right to speak about issues affecting Punjab. This continuous attempt to browbeat party MLAs for raising their voice must stop,” he tweeted. The Congress MLA’s serious allegations have left the state government red faced. Considered close to former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Pargat has been critical of the Amarinder Singh government’s handling of the sacrilege and police firing cases. After a meeting the chief minister held with party MLAs three weeks ago, he had hit out at the state government, stating there was perception among the people that Amarinder and Badals were hand in glove. Both Sidhu and Pargat had also held a meeting with some ministers and MLAs critical of the chief minister which did not go down well with the CM’s camp. At his press conference, Pargat also said the threat call from the CM’s aide had left him dejected because he had never expected such a thing. He also raised questions over the vigilance probe initiated against close associates of Sidhu and the bid to rake up a two-and-a-half-years old case of alleged harassment of a woman IAS officer against cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi who has also been discontented over the legal setback in the Kotkapura police firing case. “The misuse of agencies for arm-twisting and carrying out political vendetta must be stopped. Such threats will not work. They need to give up such tactics,” Pargat said, calling BIS Chahal, adviser to CM, the de facto DG of the State Vigilance Bureau. The MLA also denied that there was any attempt by them to form a group or camp in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cms-political-secy-threatened-me-over-phone-pargat-singh-101621279751416.html

On Tuesday, the disturbance in weather is likely to start from the southern parts of Haryana and move towards Chandigarh. Orange is the second highest alert issued by the IMD, asking people to be prepared.Speaking about this, IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said, “Though the cyclone will break once it hits the coast of Gujarat, the circulations in the atmosphere will continue to move northwards owing to pressure differences. The winds, however, will be reduced in speed and are likely to go up to 50km/h. The activity will remain active in the city till Thursday and we can expect dry weather again from Friday onwards.”Sharp decline in temperature likelyThe maximum temperature is likely to remain around 27°C on Wednesday and Thursday. Even on Monday, the maximum temperature is likely to stay around 35°C due to cloudy weather and light rain of upto 20mm. The temperature will, however, start rising again from Friday onwards.The maximum temperature in the city went up from 39°C on Sunday to 40.7°C on Monday. The minimum temperature went up from 21.6°C on Sunday to 22.6°C on Monday. In the next three days, the maximum temperature is likely to remain between 35°C and 27°C, while the minimum temperature will remain between 22°C and 20°C.High western disturbance activity in city this yearBesides the cyclone, the region has also seen higher than average activity of western disturbances for this season. Speaking about this, IMD Chandigarh director AK Singh said, “What’s interesting is how these systems came one after the other in the past few days, which doesn’t happen around this time. We have had about six western disturbances affecting the region this year in April and May. Last year the number was around three.”Singh added that unlike the Indian monsoon, western disturbances are harder to predict: “They arise primarily due to temperature differences between the Arctic latitudes and the temperature latitudes. More such systems are expected in the season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cyclone-taukate-chandigarh-to-feel-the-impact-too-101621279511438.html

Dr Puri on Monday shared with the UT administrator that the institute was getting most patients in critical condition, who were referred there from various district hospitals in the neighbouring states.The expert, who also heads the Covid-19 management committee of the premier tertiary care institute, said: “Most patients in PGIMER are critical and the first reason could be that they are reaching here late. Second, they have already been given treatments in district hospitals or are left untreated.”“The third reason, which we are observing, is the irrational use of steroids, which is proving fatal,” he said.Steroids are medications which are used for reducing inflammation. Calling their use a “double-edged sword”, Dr Puri said: “We do not give steroids to treat viral cases. However, it was in September last year when the UK’s recovery trial showed benefits for Covid patients who were given steroids.”But that does not mean that doctors can give steroids without using rationality, he said. “What’s happening is that local physicians are coming up with various theories; they think if there is shortage of oxygen beds or other medicines, then why not give steroids before the disease worsens,” said the expert.Steroids can prove fatal“What they don’t realise is that if given without hypoxia (a condition in which the body or a part of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply), it can be harmful or even fatal for a patient,” he said.Dr Puri said that they do not give steroids in the first phase when viral replication is happening, because it may stimulate the virus and exaggerate its harmful effects, like dropping of oxygen and interference with the immune system.He said that it’s in the later stages (second week) when a patient has hypoxia and there are after-effects of the infection like inflammation. At this stage, steroids are to be given but with proper caution.“The dosage, timings and stage at which steroids have to be given is very crucial. One can not just advise steroids. Also, long-term usage of steroids in Covid-19 patients can also lead to secondary infections like black fungus,” Dr Puri said. He said that a team of PGIMER had been regularly educating physicians in the region on the judicious use of steroids.Currently, there are 368 Covid cases at PGIMER, of which 95 belong to Chandigarh, 140 to Punjab, 62 to Haryana, 27 to Himachal Pradesh and 44 from other states. There are 78 ventilators in PGIMER, of which 67 were occupied till Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/earlystage-irrational-use-of-steroids-worsening-covid-cases-pgi-expert-101621279451552.html

He had been released on parole due to the pandemic outbreak. The accused, Mohan Singh, 45, who is a resident of Maharajgunj of UP, had allegedly killed the victim, Megha Malhotra, 30, for money. After the crime, he fled to Basti district of UP from where he was arrested on Sunday. Police said the accused had planned to flee to Nepal from there. During initial interrogation, the accused told the police that he had painted the doors and windows of the woman’s house some time ago. During the stint, he had seen the woman keep some cash in the almirah and hatched a conspiracy to rob it. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “The accused deliberately left the painting work incomplete. On May 10, when the woman called him again to finish the pending work, the accused, who had figured out the family’s daily schedule, waited for the victim’s husband, Karan Malhotra, to leave before he turned up at the spot.” “When he was convinced that the woman was alone, the accused tried to snatch the woman’s handbag.

Was released on parole due to pandemic Jamalpur station house officer (SHO), inspector Kulwant Singh Malhi said after finding out about the painter and his past criminal record, police started zeroing in on him and nabbed him from Uttar Pradesh. He added that the accused had earlier murdered a 39-year-old woman, Poonam, and her 17-year-old domestic help, Chhottu, in Shastri Nagar of Model Town on May 22, 2003. The accused was convicted in the double murder case and awarded life imprisonment. However, due to the pandemic, he was released on parole in June 2020. The accused then started living in a rented accommodation in Heaven City in Badal Colony of Mundian Kalan. As per the police, his landlord is also facing trial in criminal cases. The crime The victim, Megha Malhotra, was found murdered in her house at May 10. The neighbours were the first to learn of the incident after they were alerted by the victim’s toddler son’s cries. They immediately rang up the victim’s husband who rushed home and informed the police. The case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) with Section 303 (murder by life-convict) of the Indian Penal Code. Police will be attaching a copy of the judgment in the 2003 double murder case with the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/double-murder-convict-out-on-parole-held-for-choking-another-woman-in-ludhiana-101621279337363.html

The patient, Paramjit Singh, was suffering from severe pneumonia due to Covid-19 when he was admitted to the hospital on April 26. He died on May 14.The probe panel comprising the local sub-divisional magistrate, deputy superintendent of police, and senior medical officer on Monday submitted its report to the deputy commissioner, recommending strict action and booking the hospital authorities under sections 51 (b) and 58 of the National Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act.Grave lapses in medical recordsIn its report, the committee stated that there was overcharging and grave lapses in medical record management by the hospital authorities.The inquiry report mentioned the rates charged by the hospital to be “exorbitantly high”. It also said that the hospital didn’t have National Accredited Board of Hospitals (NABH) certification.The rates they are charging for an ICU bed with ventilator are not as per the norms issued by the Punjab government, the report stated.The claims made by the hospital that the patient was being treated as per medical protocols also fell flat as the hospital could not produce any treatment record of the patient. In fact, the entire medical record management system was found to be faulty.The hospital authorities’ argument that they had given LAMA (left against medical advice) to the patient’s family to shift the patient to another hospital could not be established as the hospital failed to produce any documentary evidence in this context. Even the basic Covid care guidelines like wearing of PPE kits by the sanitation staff were not adhered to, the report mentioned.Moreover, the panel was not provided with the stock register and the payment receipt records were also not maintained. No payee PAN detail entries were made for any transaction above ₹1 lakh.Hospital denies negligenceThe panel report reads, “New Lifeline Hospital Zirakpur failed to show before the committee NABH certificate, stock register, patient’s summary/ treatment record, LAMA summary/ discharged certificate. In view of above, it is ascertained that there was medical negligence on part of the hospital, and the only treating doctor, Munish Goel, cannot be ruled out as no record pertaining to treatment has been put herewith.”Even the behaviour of Dr Munish Goel, the only treating doctor of the hospital is not as per his profession, as he has been found to be very rude and violent towards patients and their attendants, the report adds.However, the hospital’s managing director, Parveer Goyal said they cooperated fully with the committee members and provided all the documents they required. “We are again saying that allegations levelled against us are baseless,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/overcharging-probe-panel-indicts-zirakpur-hospital-101621279211620.html

Consumers also opposed the proposal for changes in the existing tariff slabs arguing that doing so would automatically increase per unit rates of electricity for consumers under various categories. The UPERC may announce new tariff by the month end after holding two more hearings. No direct tariff increase is expected though the UPPCL has sought tariff revision through backdoor like one by proposing reintroduction of the regulatory surcharge system that the commission had abolished two years ago and changes in the tariff slabs.Raising the regulatory surcharge issue, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad Avadhesh Kumar Verma said the proposal was illegal and demanded the UPERC to reject the same. He said the UPPCL had proposed regulatory surcharge because he had been demanding the commission to reduce the power tariff since the UPPCL had overcharged ₹19,537 crore since 2000 as also admitted by the UPERC.He said the power tariff for urban and rural consumers had gone up by 84% and 500% respectively during the last nine years. Verma also questioned the discoms’ proposal for change in tariff slabs on the ground that the UPERC rejected similar proposal last year. He claimed that discoms had projected their annual expenditures on a higher side to get tariff increase, though indirectly.Other consumers Sourabh Srivastav and Yogesh Agrawal suggested that cross-subsidy should not be increased and regulatory surcharge should not be levied.

However, fate had some other plans,” said the distraught widower.As the ashes continued to pile up, they increased the number of lockers from 30 to 59, but amid the stream of Covid deaths in May, these, too, were quickly filling up, said Pankaj Sharma, a priest here.Panic, Covid fatigue to be blamed Ranjodh Singh, president of Ramgarhia Educational Trust, that manages the crematorium, attributed the delay in collecting ashes to multiple causes.“For one, in several cases, even the family members of the deceased are infected and have to remain in isolation. Others may get stuck in the rigmarole of arranging an NOC and Covid negative report to be available for the cremation, which may take a long time due to the rush at testing centres,” said Ranjodh, also a city-based industrialist.“One can hardly blame the bereaved families, who run from pillar to post arranging beds and treatment for their loved ones, only to see them losing the battle to the virus. Even before they can tide over the shock, they are pushed into rituals and formalities of cremation, leaving them completely fatigued,” he added.According to a volunteer, who is part of the team conducting last rites of unclaimed bodies at the crematorium, the number of people abandoning their deceased kin for fear of contracting the virus has also been increasing with the rise in deaths, which also left ashes piling up.Those not collected for weeks on end are eventually immersed in water bodies on behalf of the families. Recently, municipal corporation secretary Jasdev Singh Sekhon cremated some of such unclaimed bodies and helped immerse the ashes at Gurdwara Katana Sahib.“We remind relatives in attendance to collect the remains within four hours after the last rites to allow the other cremations to continue without a hitch. Yet some fail to comply, so the ashes are placed in the lockers,” said Sharma, who has also been spending the night at the crematorium, with the pyres sometimes burning into the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-crematorium-lockers-filling-up-with-unclaimed-ashes-of-covid-victims-101621278851425.html

A number of unidentified corpses were found floating in the river in Ghazipur and Ballia districts last week.Through public address system, cops also made announcements advising villagers against dumping the bodies into the Ganga. During patrolling, cops fished out seven bodies from the Ganga in Varanasi, 15 in Ghazipur and eight each in Chandauli and Ballia districts. They later cremated the bodies. The cops also held meetings with locals in villages located along the Ganga apprising them of the state government’s decision to provide ₹5,000 financial assistance each to poor people who are unable to carry out cremation of their near and dear ones. At Buxar ghat, Unnao, which was in news recently when several bodies were found buried at the riverbank, cops have set up a police outpost to make sure there is no dumping of bodies into the river. Prashant Kumar, additional director general of police, law and order, said 34 police teams had been pressed into service in Ghazipur district along the Ganga banks for round-the-clock patrolling in shifts to prevent disposal of bodies into the river. “Patrolling has also been intensified in those areas of Ballia and Ghazipur districts, including Zamania and Gahmar, which share their border with Bihar. The cops have also made arrangements of firewood for cremation of bodies at all ghats in Ghazipur district,” added Kumar. In Varanasi district, three teams of Jal Police are patrolling the Ganga in shifts and keeping a watch on ghats to prevent disposal of bodies into river. In Kanpur, Chandauli and Fatehpur districts also, intensive patrolling is being carried out to prevent dumping of bodies into the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cops-start-patrolling-ganga-to-prevent-dumping-of-bodies-101621278851896.html

They scanned the barracks and also questioned the jail officials. The ADGP said the video seems to have been recorded on May 2 or 3 and uploaded later by one of the inmates. He added that the cops are probing how the liquor had reached the jail premises. The statements of jail officials have also been recorded. The ADGP said that if the involvement of any jail official is found during investigation, stern action will be taken against the erring official. One of the inmates caught in the viral video is self-proclaimed gangster Manwinder Singh alias Nikka Jattana of Jattana village of Mansa. Jattana had been caught using a mobile phone in jail in June 2020 as well. PK Sinha maintained that Jattana has not been categorised as a gangster by Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU). Sinha said Jattana and his accomplices had been brought on production warrant by the Division Number 3 police on June 12, 2020 in connection with a firing incident outside the house of Rishav alias Nannu, who faces an attempt to murder case. Both Jattana and Nannu were lodged in the Ludhiana central jail at the time. Jattana had taken responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post. According to the police, the accused had uploaded the post from jail. As per information, around a week ago, jail officials had recovered a mobile phone and hookah from the jail on May 9. Instead of investigating the matter, police lodged an FIR against an inmate Neeraj Kumar. Past controversy On April 20, Rajiv Arora, superintendent of Ludhiana central jail, was suspended for welcoming Punjabi singer Karan Aujla and giving him VVIP treatment. Karan Aujla along with his friends had visited Ludhiana central jail on April 8 and met jail superintendent Rajiv Arora in his office. The matter had reached the ADGP after it came to light that the security officials did not check if Aujla and his friends were carrying mobile phones. Arora was replaced by Balkar Singh, who was superintendent at Gurdaspur jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/booze-in-ludhiana-central-jail-adgp-dig-visit-for-investigation-101621278671328.html

The house belongs to a Canada-based NRI who had rented out a portion of the house to Jaipal and his aides and the rest to some other tenants. The villagers alerted the police after coming across the posters of the assailants. The villagers identified Baljinder Singh alias Babbi as one of the tenants and informed the police. The villagers also told the police that they had seen Babbi and others many times moving in and out of the house. The accused had not come to the house since the killing of the cops. The police searched the house and found some belongings of the assailants. Senior superintendent of police (SSP, Ludhiana Rural) Charanjit Singh Sohal said the police came to know that the accused shifted to the house in November 2020 and the owner didn’t go for police verification of the tenants. Search operation launched Police have initiated a search operation to locate Jaipal and his aides at Alamgir village and surrounding areas after an input that they were hiding there. The police cordoned off the village on Monday and sealed all the roads connecting the village. The search operation was on when the report was Monday late night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/asis-killing-gangster-jaipal-aides-were-living-on-rent-at-nri-s-house-for-six-months-101621278551937.html

The two leaders jointly made the announcement at party’s office in Mohali. Dhindsa is president of the new outfit and Brahmpura is its patron. The new political outfit was formed after the dissolution of Brahmpura-led SAD (Taksali) and Dhindsa-led SAD (Democratic) on April 19, and according to a spokesperson of the party, the launch of the new oufit got delayed due to ongoing wave of the pandemic. “The organisation structure of the party will be announced soon,” said Dhindsa after a meeting with Brahmpura. Speaking to the media, Dhindsa asked SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal to clarify his party’s position on accepting donations worth ₹12 crore by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) from Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan who “supported” genocide of Sikhs in 1984. Bachchan donated ₹2 crore in cash and ₹10 crore in the form of diagnostic machines. Dhindsa also sought details of donors from Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and DSGMC. The party leadership also paid condolences to former Akal Takht jathedar Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti, former Akali Minister Inderjit Singh Zira, former journalist and MLA Jarnail Singh, Abay Singh Sandhu (nephew Shaheed Bhagat Singh), Sant Baba Chota Singh, former minister in the centre Raghunandan Lal Bhatia, along with other prominent persons who passed away recently.

While launching the Ganga Yatra from Bijnor district on January 27, 2020, the CM had announced several development plans for areas of 27 districts along 1,358 km stretch of the river Ganga. Construction of cremation grounds was part of this plan.The urban development and panchayat raj departments were tasked with the job to complete this project. “In the past 15 months, only 20 percent of the work could be completed against the target,” said an official of the panchayat raj department. In the previous Samajwadi Party government too, a provision of ₹13.23 lakh per cremation ground in areas along the Ganga was made. Later, this was revised to ₹24 lakh per cremation ground. Manoj Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, panchayat raj, has issued instructions to earmark cremation grounds for Covid and non-Covid bodies in villages. Singh has also assured that the state government will make all arrangements for cremation of bodies if family members of the dead are unable to do so due to financial constraints. In Awadh and eastern region of Uttar Pradesh, there is a tradition of giving ‘river burial’ (Jal Samadhi) to unmarried people in some communities. “Recovery of large number of bodies from the Ganga can also be attributed to this tradition. Earlier, this was a rarity. But amid the pandemic, large number of deaths have taken place,” said lawyer and social activist Kaushlendra Singh who is based in Nanpara in Bahraich district. “In this pandemic, many young people have died and their bodies have been given river burial as per the tradition,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cremation-grounds-along-ganga-banks-project-moving-at-a-snail-s-pace-101621278190921.html

18-05-2021||Mumbai||Class 10 exams cancelled: Bombay HC directs boards to reply to PIL on assessment methods||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) board to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL), raising concerns over the assessment methodology to be adopted for students following the cancellation of Class 10 board exams by the state government in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the PIL filed by a Pune-based retired professor, Dhananjay Kulkarni, was informed by advocate Dr Uday Warunjikar that the state government’s May 12 decision to not conduct Class 10 exams across all boards would have an adverse impact on students during admissions to Class 11 (first-year-junior college) and would create confusion and chaos.As the state government had also announced to devise a formula to assess the students but has not done so yet, Dr Warunjikar submitted that if it was left to the various boards to come up with marking patterns, there would be no uniformity in the evaluation, which could further affect the state board students at the time of admissions to Class 11.It was further submitted that while the state planned to conduct Class 12 exams for nearly 1.4 million students, not holding the exams for over 1.6 million Class 10 students was not justified. In light of these submissions, Dr Warunjikar stated that apart from seeking the quashing of the state government’s decision, the petition also sought directions to the Centre to come up with a uniform assessment policy for all boards with a proper formula for evaluation and curb any confusion among students.Advocate Sandesh Patil for the Central government informed the court that while the CBSE board was under its control, the ICSE board was an autonomous body and state was responsible for conducting SSC exams. Hence, it was not possible to take a common decision for evaluation. He further added that an evaluation system has already been issued for Class 10 students of CBSE board which could be sorted by other boards as well.Advocate Kiran Gandhi for the state submitted that the petition was ornate as the Maharashtra government had issued a resolution allowing the board to make changes in rules pertaining to the new evaluation and assessment system. As the state board was yet to formulate the rules and alternate marking method, the PIL should be disposed of. Gandhi added that the state board’s examination committee would come up with a formula which would be sent to the Maharashtra government for final approval.After hearing submissions, the court asked the Centre and the respondent boards to file affidavits in reply to the PIL and posted the hearing to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-exams-cancelled-bombay-hc-directs-boards-to-reply-to-pil-on-assessment-methods-101621278073896.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||As cases drop, number of covid tests halved in Mumbai||With a constant decrease in the number of daily Covid-19 cases reported in Mumbai for the past two weeks, the tests conducted in the city have also almost halved. While an average of 50,000 tests was conducted per day in Mumbai during mid-April, they have now come down to an average of 20,000-25,000 daily. Officials have attributed the decrease in the number to fewer people coming forward for a test. Experts believe that Mumbai needs to continue testing more people. They also believe that it is too early to tell if the second wave is declining, but the city must not assume that the threat of Covid-19 has passed. About 35%-40% of the tests conducted per day are rapid antigen tests, which on an average have a lower positivity rate than RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests. On Sunday, Mumbai conducted only 17,640 tests, the results of which were revealed on Monday. Of these, Mumbai reported 1,232 cases with a positivity rate of 6.9%. Mumbai also reported 48 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 3.8%. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 5,916,245 tests. The total number of positive cases in Mumbai is 689,062, with a cumulative positivity rate of 11.9%. The average positivity per day in Mumbai has now dropped to 6% to 8%, down from 20% and above seen in mid-April. Positivity rate is the number of positive Covid-19 cases reported as a percent of the total tests done. By mid-March, Mumbai had started conducting at least 50,000 tests a day and on some occasions up to 55,000 tests. Experts and authorities believe the second wave started around March 11. On April 4, Mumbai reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day – 11,204 – of 51,319 tests conducted, revealed BMC data. By April 20, the daily tests dropped to below 40,000. For the past five days, Mumbai has been conducting lower than 30,000 tests per day. However, on all these days Mumbai reported less than 2,000 cases, with a positivity rate of 6% to 8%. The steady decline in cases reported per day is in no way indicative of the larger picture that the second wave may soon pass, experts say.Dr Om Shrivastav, who is a part of Maharashtra government’s Covid task force, said, “We can’t look at Mumbai in isolation. The cases have come down, but cases in the rest of the state or country have not. So what happens when restrictions are lifted? To say that the second wave is declining, we should wait till the end of September at least and then take a relook at the figures and decide.” Experts also believe that the city needs to keep up high testing numbers despite the lower positivity rate. Dr Rahul Pandit, another member of the task force, said, “I have always said we need to keep testing in large numbers even if the number of cases per day begins to drop. We may record lower positivity rate during this time, but until we have a positivity rate below 5%, testing in high numbers is a better strategy.”“This can be done by contact tracing in large numbers during the first 24 hours. We can target areas which have reported a higher number of cases, for example certain wards or localities in Mumbai. Eventually, we will not report cases in clusters and will see isolated positive cases. Even though numbers show an improvement in the situation, we cannot consider this and become slack.” Dr Pandit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-cases-drop-number-of-covid-tests-halved-in-mumbai-101621278073321.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay designs prototype to reuse oxygen for patients on ventilators||A team of alumni and researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have built a breathing device that can reduce wastage of oxygen when a Covid-19 patient is put on assisted breathing support such as ventilators. The prototype, called ‘reBreather’, is a semi-closed circular breathing system that will allow patients to breathe in unused exhaled oxygen. Covid-19 patients with severe breathing trouble are put on ventilators that can supply oxygen through a combination of nasal cannula and mask at a flow rate of up to 50 litres per minute. However, the lung can only absorb one litre of oxygen in a minute. The rest of the 49 litres (L) are breathed out or wasted. The researchers have used an existing technology of reusing exhaled oxygen— commonly used in diving and mountaineering systems — to cut down on this wastage. “At a time when oxygen is in short supply across the country, this mode of recirculating oxygen can help save lives,” said Santosh Noronha, assistant professor, department of chemical engineering, IIT-B, who is one of the 15 members of the team behind reBreather. The prototype has been designed by the staff, students and alumni affiliated with Tata Centre for Technology and Design, department of chemical engineering, and Nex Robotics—a start-up by alumni of the institute.According to the calculations by the team, this recirculation of oxygen can reduce the number of cylinders required by a critical patient from nine to almost one per day. This calculation is based on the assumption that a cylinder holds 7,800L of pure oxygen. “It is a good system on paper and we [doctors] are quite excited about it. However, it has to be put into use in a hospital set up before we can be sure of its working,” said city-based infectious diseases specialist Om Shrivastav, who was not a part of the project. A healthy human inhales 5L of air in a minute, of which one-fifth or a litre is oxygen. The human lungs can absorb only a quarter of this, which is 250 millilitres (ml). This may increase when the person is performing an activity or is ill. For every 250ml of oxygen absorbed, the lungs breath out 225ml of carbon dioxide. reBreather is a semi-closed circular breathing system with an inlet section which pumps in fresh oxygen from an oxygen cylinder or a centralised oxygen system in hospitals. The oxygen flow rate is set on the cylinder with a flow meter. An adjustable venturi valve is given at the input to allow for external air to be automatically pulled in based on the desired oxygen flow rate. A one port mask is attached to the patient. The exhaled air is fed to a container which has medical-grade soda lime. This soda lime selectively absorbs carbon dioxide from the exhaled output and allows the rest of the air to pass through to the inlet section of the system. The soda lime changes colour once it has exhausted its capability to absorb carbon dioxide and can be replaced. “Soda lime is the only consumable item in the system. We are working on modifying the designs further so that this can also be regenerated,” said Noronha. The technical details of the system have been made public under Creative Commons to grant access to healthcare workers across the country.“So far the system has been tested on healthy volunteers. We are planning to start a clinical trial soon. However, as approvals for clinical trials take time, we have made our system public so that if anybody wants to use it in the meantime, they can do so. It is an existing technology used in diving and mountaineering systems,” Noronha added.A single unit of reBreather cost the team around ₹10,000. “As most of it is plastic, the unit can be sanitised and reused. So it is mostly a one-time expense,” Noronha said.City-based pulmonologist Lancelot Pinto said, “When we breathe ambient air, we breathe air with a concentration of oxygen that’s about 21%. The air we exhale tends to have an oxygen concentration of 17%. This applies to healthy lungs. When lungs are affected [by infections or chronic lung diseases], they become inefficient at transferring oxygen, and we add supplemental oxygen so that the higher concentration of inspired air will create a steeper gradient for the oxygen to move across damaged alveolar membranes. However, this extraction is likely to be sub-optimal, resulting in a reasonably high concentration of oxygen in the exhaled air [higher than room air]. If an efficient method were created to reuse this oxygen, enrich it further to match the need while removing the carbon dioxide exhaled, it would be a very promising step in conserving the use of supplemental oxygen, which has become a precious resource.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-designs-prototype-to-reuse-oxygen-for-patients-on-ventilators-101621278070944.html

According to BMC officials, as the patients were already shifted to nearby hospitals, they will now look at the repair and maintenance work required to keep the jumbo centres stable for the upcoming monsoon and also the third wave. BMC officials said that there was no damage to any of its jumbo centres but it would like to undertake several maintenance works as a precautionary measure. Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean, Dahisar jumbo Covid centre, said, “We now have the time and chance as the patients have already been shifted and the daily caseload has gone down in the city. We will carry out necessary structural work and conduct a fire audit as a precaution. The jumbo centres were made for a temporary period but now that we know that this [pandemic situation] will continue for the next one year, we need to be better prepared and planned. We still have to face the monsoons and third wave during which these jumbo centres will play a crucial role in handling Covid-19 patients.”The three jumbo centres have more than 3,000 beds. Overall, the city has six jumbo centres with a total capacity of around 9,000 beds. Three more jumbo centres are coming up in the city amid fears of a third wave between July and September.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “On Monday also, our focus was at the jumbo centres and we ensured that there was no waterlogging outside any of them.

Additional chief secretary (health department) Pradeep Vyas has confirmed the development.Amid the depleting vaccine stock, the state administered 99,323 doses till 9pm on Monday, pushing the tally to 20,089,580. The state has so far fully vaccinated 4,256,962 beneficiaries.Mumbai, Pune and Thane are the leading districts that have administered the highest number of doses. Mumbai has administered 2,892,457 so far, of which 731,904 are second doses, while Pune district has given 2,617,059 doses of vaccines, of which 544,902 are second shots. In Thane district, 347,710 beneficiaries are fully vaccinated, followed by 261,138 in Nagpur, 216,998 at Kolhapur and 199,985 beneficiaries in Nashik district.According to senior health department officials, Maharashtra is expecting fresh stock of doses from the Centre. “We are expecting the stock by tomorrow [Tuesday],” said state immunisation officer DN Patil, adding that the state, however, does not know how many doses it will receive.Health department officials said that the current stock would last only for about a day or two. “We have about 300,000 Covishield doses and around 80,000 Covaxin vaccines distributed across the state. Due to the cyclone alert, the vaccination drive was not in full swing in many coastal districts, including Mumbai. The current stock will last us for about a day or two,” a senior official said.Patil added that with the increase in the interval between the two doses of Covishield, the pressure on the administration has reduced. “However, our focus is now to vaccinate more people as and when we receive the stock,” he said. On Monday, the Mumbai civic body had suspended vaccinations in view of predictions of heavy rainfall and gusty winds due to cyclone Tauktae. Mumbai will restart its vaccination drive on Tuesday. However, vaccinations will resume only at selected centres, a list of which will be published by the civic body. Walk-in registrations for senior citizens getting their first dose will be permitted, however they will only be administered Covishield vaccine. Citizens aged above 45 who are getting their second dose of Covaxin as well as for the differently abled citizens can also walk into their nearest vaccination centre, get registered on the spot and get vaccinated, on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday this week, only those who have registered on the CoWIN app can get their vaccine shots. “Vaccination to resume at selected centres on 18 & 19 May’21. The list of CVCs for tomorrow shall be uploaded later tonight.

18-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra issues guidelines for handling rising mucormycosis cases||Taking cognisance of the rise in cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, among recovered Covid-19 patients, the Maharashtra government on Monday issued detailed guidelines over its symptom, medical investigation, prevention and treatment protocol. The state has asked for strict glycemic control during management of Covid-19 patients which means blood sugar levels must be continuously controlled for all patients while systemic steroids are to be used only in patients with hypoxemia.The guidelines have been issued to reduce morbidity and fatality among mucormycosis patients as the state believes its occurrence is triggered by the use of high doses of steroids to treat Covid-19 and in uncontrolled diabetes cases.The guidelines include strict infection control measures including cleaning and replacement of humidifiers. It states that sterile normal saline should be used in the humidifier bottle and changed daily and masks should be disinfected daily. “Local public health laboratories should be asked to take swabs of humidifiers, masks, tubing and common touch areas for culture of mucormycosis,” stated the order issued by Ramaswami N, commissioner, health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), Maharashtra.Doctors have been asked not to miss warning signs and symptoms and also not to consider all cases of blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, especially in the context of immunosuppression and Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators, it further said.It also described signs and symptoms of mucormycosis comprising pain and redness around eyes and nose, fever (usually mild), epistaxis (bleeding from the nose), headache, cough, shortness of breath, blood vomiting and altered mental status.“During discharge of the patients, advice about early symptoms or signs of mucormycosis such as facial pain, blockage, excessive discharge, loosening of teeth, chest pain and respiratory insufficiency,” it added.Maharashtra has over 400 cases of mucormycosis with around eight to 10 fresh cases daily. “We are getting a few cases of black fungus, around 8 to 10 cases, on a daily basis. On Sunday, around 14 cases were reported across the state,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-issues-guidelines-for-handling-rising-mucormycosis-cases-101621277952776.html

18-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone effect: Mumbai airport shut for 11 hours, sees 56 cancellations||Cyclone Tauktae forced Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to stop flight operations for 11 hours on Monday. The city airport, which operated flights in the morning, saw seven flight diversions due to gusty winds. Airport sources said, it was the first time the airport remained completely closed for 11 hours due to bad weather. CSMIA spokesperson said, “With the announcement of the cyclone alert, CSMIA had closed all flight operations with effect from 11am to 10pm on May 17, 2021. The airport has so far witnessed seven diversions. In the wake of the alert, a few airlines have decided to cancel services to Mumbai. CSMIA has registered cancellations of 34 arrivals and 22 departures.” As status of flights kept changing, CSMIA advised passengers to connect with the airlines before leaving their homes. Among the diversions, a SpiceJet flight was diverted to Surat, one IndiGo flight returned to its origin airport at Lucknow and an IndiGo flight was diverted to Hyderabad, airport officials said. According to airport sources, 38 flights were operated to/from CSMIA before it shut operations. A pilot, who took off from CSMIA on Monday, said, “The weather was not conducive for flight operations even in the morning. However, flights were taking off around scheduled time due to lesser air traffic.”A senior AAI official said, “Gusty winds are dangerous for aircraft arrivals. Hence it is better to pause flight operations till weather gets better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-effect-mumbai-airport-shut-for-11-hours-sees-56-cancellations-101621277891511.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Electricity, water supply affected in some parts of Thane||Shahad, Murbad, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath and Badlapur areas witnessed power cuts for more than 30 hours due to the gusty winds and rainfall caused by Cyclone Tauktae. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) officials said the overhead wires in these areas make it difficult to provide continuous power supply during bad weather. Water supply has also been affected in many areas of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) due to lack of power supply. MSEDCL officials said they received more than 150 calls regarding fallen electricity poles and trees falling on electric wires in Ambernath, Badlapur and Murbad areas. A team of electricity board officials have been working round the clock from Sunday evening to Monday night to resolve the issues. Anil Kamble, public relation officer of MSEDCL, said, “We have been getting so many calls about fallen electric wires and poles due to the heavy wind. Wind pressure is so high that even if we repair the wire and pole, they break again within a few hours. There is tremendous pressure on the team owing to the current situation and we are working round the clock. The disaster management team has small manpower therefore it is taking time to remove fallen trees from wires and poles.” Several houses were also damaged. Sunil Burman, a resident of Ambernath (East), said, “We do not have electricity from Sunday evening and do not even have water also. All of us have called water tanker for a day. Every year Badlapur, Ambernath and Murbad areas face electricity issues as most of electric poles or wires are affected.” An MSEDCL official said, “Electric wires in these areas are all overhead wires. Taking the cables underground is a huge process, for which we are not getting funds. We have been requesting the authorities to sanction the same, but the process has been delayed further due to the pandemic.” As electricity supply stopped in Shahad, water supply was affected within the jurisdiction of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). A senior official from TMC’s water department said, “Due to electricity supply issues in stem water distribution facility, we could not supply water for some hours on Monday. Although it was restored within a few hours, an overall impact in the flow of the water will be noticed for the next 24 hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-electricity-water-supply-affected-in-some-parts-of-thane-101621277832031.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||IMD’s weather radar goes defunct when needed most, again||The city’s doppler weather radar (DWR) operated by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Colaba became defunct late on Sunday, drawing the ire of several independent meteorologists tracking the path of Cyclone Tauktae which passed by Maharashtra coast on Monday.This is not the first time that the instrument has become dysfunctional at a crucial moment. On December 4, 2017, when Cyclone Ockhi brushed past the Mumbai coast, the radar was not functional. The radar was also not functional on multiple days during extreme rainfall events in June and July 2019, and also on June 1, 2020, about 48 hours before Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Maharashtra. “There are five doppler radars on the west coast, two in Kerala, one in Goa, one in Mumbai and another in Bhuj, Gujarat. While they no longer play as crucial a role in modelling paths of cyclones, DWR’s are important instruments that allow us to map these systems in real time. They are extremely valuable for planning disaster management responses. Unlike the east coast, where cyclones are extremely common, we do not have a very extensive network along the west coast. We need to actively invest in them,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading, England.IMD officials confirmed that DWR had stopped working on Sunday evening, but did not cite reasons for the same. “The doppler radar has run into a technical snag. Technicians are looking into the matter. We cannot say by when it will be up and running again,” said a scientist who did not wish to be identified.Mumbai’s only DWR was installed in 2010 for weather surveillance up to 400kms from the coastline and was first recommended soon after the floods of July 26, 2005. While satellite pictures can be used in lieu of radar images, experts said, the latter is limited in value. “If an x-ray is a satellite image, then a doppler radar is a CT scan. The quality and range of data it gives is simply much better, allowing us to make better predictions about where the cyclone’s spiral banks will be located, where they will bring more rain,” said Deoras.“With radar service not available, it becomes extremely difficult to track rain bands,” said Vineet Kumar, a scientist who researches cyclones in the north Indian Ocean for Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/imds-weather-radar-goes-defunct-when-needed-most-again-101621277830848.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Light rains to continue as Cyclone Tauktae recedes from Maharashtra coast||Moderate rains and strong winds, which began on Monday under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae, are likely to continue on Tuesday as well but with significantly less intensity, according to official forecasts.After touching a record-breaking speed of 114kmph (kilometre per hour) at 2pm on Monday, wind velocity had slowed down to about 78kmph at 8pm on Monday, and is likely to hover between 40 to 50kmph on Tuesday with heavy rainfall at isolated locations in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.“It is the north Konkan region which will continue to see some precipitation while parts of the coast are likely to have seen gale winds touching around 90kmph during the night, but the daytime will see consistent improvement in the situation. In Mumbai, the situation was considerably calmer by 10pm on Monday,” said a meteorologist with India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Not only did Mumbai see record levels of rainfall — 194mm in 12 hours, leading to its wettest day in May yet, it also recorded its lowest daytime temperature for May in at least a decade on Monday at 26.9 degrees Celsius, which was seven degrees below normal.This is down sharply from 37.4 degrees Celsius recorded on Saturday, which marked Mumbai’s hottest May day in at least a decade, due to a dense cloud cover which acted as a heat trap and pushed up the temperature.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, the maximum temperature on Monday is expected to rise to about 28 degrees Celsius and will climb sharply during the week as the cyclone moves away, touching 35 degrees Celsius by next weekend.“Generally cloudy skies with moderate to light rains and drizzles” are expected to prevail till May 19, after which skies will become clearer and sunnier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/light-rains-to-continue-as-cyclone-tauktae-recedes-from-maharashtra-coast-101621277771481.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: 20 local trains cancelled, 50 delayed||Tree falls and falling of loose banners owing to gusty winds and heavy showers from cyclone Tauktae led to cancellation of 20 local trains and delay in 50 on Monday. Mumbai Metro train services were functional, however, monorail services were suspended as a precautionary measure. The BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) also diverted its buses on 72 routes owing to waterlogging on 19 roads, including Hindmata Cinema, Dadar; SV Road; National College, Bandra, Grant Road station road; Gandhi market, Sion; Sheetal Cinema, Kurla West and Navy Nagar, Malad West. On the Western Railway, a tree fall was reported on the railway tracks between Churchgate and Marine Lines, disrupting the services. The services were restored at 8.10pm on Monday. On the Central Railway, a tree branch fell on a local train between Ghatkopar and Vikhroli railway stations on Monday morning. Slow local train services were shifted on the fast line. A loose banner fell on the overhead wires near Chunabhatti and GTB Nagar railway stations on the harbour line. Local train services were also suspended between Wadala and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) after waterlogging was reported at Masjid Bunder railway station. The services were resumed after two hours. Train services resumed at 2.40pm on Monday, but were suspended again after branches of a tree fell on railway tracks between Sewri and Cotton Green railway stations. “Due to gusty winds, tree branches fell on the overhead equipment on the sixth line near Dombivli station. Branches were removed immediately in one hour. No repercussions were felt on mail express or suburban local trains.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway. A plastic fibre sheet came on the railway tracks near Dahisar railway station on the Western Railway. Train services were halted and the fibre sheet was removed. At Umroli railway station, due to heavy wind, the station cover shed fell on the overhead wire at 6.05 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-20-local-trains-cancelled-50-delayed-101621277770925.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: 8 die; 3K houses damaged||At least eight people died, more than 3,000 houses were damaged, while electricity supply and internet connection to hundreds of villages were disrupted as cyclonic storm Tauktae wreaked havoc in parts of Maharashtra’s coastal districts such as Ratnagiri, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Palghar, Thane and Mumbai on Monday. More than 12,500 residents in coastal areas of three districts – Raigad (2,299), Ratnagiri (4,563), Sindhudurg (144) – were shifted to safer places, although they started to return as the cyclone started to recede on Monday evening. Among the six deaths caused due to various incidents related to the cyclone, four are from Raigad, two from Thane and two from Sindhudurg. Nine people from four districts have sustained injuries. Transport to a few villages in Raigad and Ratnagiri was cut-off because of the blockades created by tree falls. Ratnagiri and Raigad districts were badly hit among the coastal districts, with its tehsils like Dapoli, Mandangad, Guhagar, Lanja seeing the most damages. About 1,028 houses and structures, including government offices and schools, received severe damages. Many orchards were damaged in Ratnagiri, known for its alphonso mangoes. A fisherman in Devgad in Sindhudurg lost his life trapped under the vessel anchor during his attempt to save fellow fishermen on a boat on Sunday evening. In another incident, three fishermen are missing from two boats that capsized in Devgad. Besides Devgad, tehsils like Vengurle, Malvan in Sindhudurg witnessed damage to their structures. Hundreds of electricity poles and transformers were damaged owing to the velocity of the wind since Sunday evening, leading to power outage. It also led to disconnection of internet services. Hundreds of villages in Ratnagiri and a few in Raigad saw disruption of mobile and internet services. In Ratnagiri, 357,409 families from760 villages were in the dark till 3pm on Monday. “More than 15 transformers and over 190 electricity poles were damaged across the district. Power supply companies restored the electricity on a war footing in most of the villages, although some villages are still in the dark,” said Datta Bhadakwad, resident deputy collector, Ratnagiri. In Raigad, of the 55 Covid care centres in rural parts, 26 operated on direct supply and 29 on generator back-up after the power outage on Monday morning. In Panvel Municipal Corporation, 44 of the 45 Covid facilities were given direct supply, while one was operational on generator back-up. A total of 1,784 houses were damaged in the district. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the situation was expected to normalise by late Monday evening. “The CM spoke to senior officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and he was apprised about the weather conditions in coastal parts of the state. According to the information given to him, the cyclone was 180km away from Mumbai coast at 5pm and the wind velocity was on the decline, and expected to reach at 70-80 km per hour in few hours. By Monday night, the situation is expected to normalise in Maharashtra,” statement issued by the CMO stated. Higher and technical education minister and guardian minister of Sindhudurg Uday Samant said he has demanded a special package, keeping the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) norms aside. “I have spoken to Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The state had given special package for losses sustained in Cyclone Nisarg last year. Mango growers have sustained huge losses in the middle of alphonso season,” he said. The administrations of these districts have been directed to begin spot assessment of the losses. The officials from the relief and rehabilitation department said the exact quantum of the damage will be known only once the assessments are completed over next three-four days. By contrast, Nisarga, which made landfall last June near Diveagar and Shrivardhan — south of the coastal resort town of Alibag — in Raigad district was a severe cyclonic storm which left at least six dead, 16 injured and nearly 13000 hectares of cropland damaged in northern parts of the state as well as its coastal districts. It also left behind a trail of destruction in Raigad district with power cables snapped, trees and electric poles uprooted, thatched, kutcha and pucca houses destroyed or partially damaged and roads blocked prompting the state to announce a relief package of nearly ₹400 crore to the district alone. Raigad’s guardian minister and minister of state Aditi Tatkare said total restoration of electricity and internet services will take a couple of more days. “All roads connecting to villages have been cleared, but the restoration of electricity may take some time,” she said. According to the statement issued by the energy department, 1,816,744 consumers were affected with disconnection of power supply in seven districts, of which 51% were restored. A total of 210 Covid-19 facilities or vaccination centres were affected, of which power supply has been restored in 82% or 173 units. The power supply of all four oxygen generating plants, which were affected, has been restored. A total of 765 of the 1,124 telecommunication towers affected in cyclone have been restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-8-die-3k-houses-damaged-101621277710890.html

During the day, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar took stock of the situation by visiting several locations followed by guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray taking a meeting with the BMC officials to plan the way ahead.Following the meeting, Thackeray posted on Twitter: “We are doing everything we can to keep you safe. The BMC has begun to clear out fallen trees with every breather we get in the pattern of strong winds and heavy rain. We are working to ensure normalcy at the earliest. Today’s cyclone hit wind speeds of 114kmph, highest ever for Mumbai in any recent records. This is a climatic pattern that we have started studying, along with its maximum impact points, water logging areas and types of trees that are damaged. Our 3 jumbo covid care centres that have been vacated as precautions, will now be taken up for maintenance and repairs over the next 10 days.”Following the shifting of over 500 Covid-19 patients from three jumbo centres at BKC, Dahisar and Mulund, the BMC on Monday said these centres will now remain shut for maintenance. According to BMC officials, they will undertake overall fire and structural audit of the centres to ensure to be prepared for the upcoming monsoon season to align with the anticipated third wave between July and September. However, no citizens from the coastal areas such as Worli, Bandra, Versova and Gorai were shifted owing to the cyclone. According to BMC officials, they had undertaken preparations for shifting of the citizens but there was no such requirement for the same. Hence, we did not shift them.Meanwhile, on Monday, the BMC’s disaster management cell received 4,848 calls for civic emergency owing to the heavy rainfall and high wind speed.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP), slammed the BMC over its monsoon preparedness.Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of opposition in the BMC, said, “Everything got exposed on Monday as there were waterlogging and tree falls across the city. The drainages across the city were cleaned and their silt was kept outside, but after today’s rainfall all the silt went inside the drains again.”SP corporator Rais Shaikh said, “Tauktae cyclone put Mumbai on high alert on Monday and every year crores of rupees are spent for pre-monsoon work, yet we experience overflowing sewage lines. I have requested BMC commissioner to inquire into the same and take action against the officers who have delayed pre-monsoon work.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “What happened on Monday was bound to happen considering the intensity of the rain was too much in a span of four hours when city received maximum rainfall. Between 10am and 2pm on Monday in several areas more than 120mm rain was recorded, and if such intensity of rainfall is received waterlogging may be reported...We had installed water-sucking pumps at 15 locations in the city and five pumping stations were activated. In case of Hindmata, the work for rainwater tunnel work is ongoing and is expected to be completed by June 10, due to which we reported water logging there.”Heavy rain led to power cuts in various parts. The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking, which supplies electricity to the island city, received 60 complaints of power disruptions through the day. There was no major outage, said the BEST in a statement. Suburbs, too ,saw power cuts. Many areas like Andheri (W), Vile Parle, Kalina, Versova and Kurla experienced power cuts. Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) which distributes power to rhe suburbs said its teams rushed to the spot and restored electricity within an hour. “To ensure the continuity of power supply and mitigate any disruptions owing to the cyclone Taukte and heavy rains, team AEML took all the necessary precautions. Our specialized Quick Response Teams were on standby and ensured, wherever there was power disruption complaints, the supply was restored with the minimum interruption,” said an AEML spokesperson.Supply in eastern suburbs like Mulund, Bhandup and Vikhroli too was disrupted in various parts. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) in its press statement said that maximum impact was felt in Sindhudurga and Ratnagiri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-feels-tauktae-s-fury-101621277651550.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: 3 Navy ships on rescue op to save 410 on two barges||The Indian Navy has deployed three warships in high sea for search and rescue (SAR) assistance of two ships — barge P305 and barge GAL Constructor — with 410 people on board, after they were stranded in Bombay High due to Cyclone Tauktae on Monday afternoon. INS Kochi, INS Kolkata and INS Talwar have been pressed into carrying out the rescue operations.The Indian Navy rescued 38 people of the 273 on-board barge P305, adrift off Heera Oil Fields in Bombay High. The search and rescue operation has been carried out by INS Kochi and INS Kolkata in extreme weather conditions and very rough seas. INS Kolkata, which was headed for barge GAL Constructor, had been diverted to attend to the situation of barge P305.Meanwhile, rescue operations for barge GAL Constructor, stuck around 8 nautical miles from Mumbai coast with 137 people on board, could not be started due to extreme weather condition, said a Navy officer.Several other ships have been prepared for disaster recovery task in the wake of Cyclone Tauktae which has wreaked havoc along the west coast of India, said Commander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer (CPRO), Western Naval Command, Indian Navy. The Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) are on high alert as severe cyclonic storm Tauktae passed the Mumbai coast towards Gujarat on Monday. The Navy has kept its flood rescue teams at INS Shikra in Colaba, INS Trata in Worli, Material Organisation in Ghatkopar, INS Tanaji in Mankhurd, and INS Hamla in Malad ready for deployment. The Navy can also operate its Chetak and Sea King helicopters from INS Shikra depending on the weather, said Karnik. He added the Navy was prepared and was on standby as no request had yet been received from the civil administration for immediate help.Timely weather alerts ensured that as many as 4,526 boats from Maharashtra and 2,258 from Gujarat which were out in the sea for fishing have safely returned to the harbours.ICG has also geared up for preventive and response measures along the western coast. ICG ship Samarth, responding to a distress call, rescued 15 crew from a fishing boat named Milad off Goa coast in a swift operation. All crew members are safe, said an ICG official. Apart from that, 40 coast guard disaster relief teams with inflatable boats, lifebuoys and life jackets are on standby along the western coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-3-navy-ships-on-rescue-op-to-save-410-on-two-barges-101621277650927.html
18-05-2021||Mumbai||Worst cyclone to come closest to Mumbai in over 40 years||Cylcone Tauktae, an extremely severe cyclonic storm (ESCS) that passed Mumbai shortly after noon on Monday, was the worst cyclone to have skirted the city in at least four decades leading to a cancellation of flights, bringing sections of the public transportation network to a halt, and disrupting the work from home schedules of residents due to power-cuts and poor mobile connectivity. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed that Tauktae began crossing Mumbai’s latitude at about 12.37pm on Monday, at a distance of about 120-130km from the coast. Independent experts said the cyclone, which intensified into an extremely severe storm early on Monday, was likely the first such category of storm to venture this close to the port city since 1891. By comparison, cyclone Nisarga, a severe cyclonic storm (a category of lesser intensity) that made landfall in the state’s Raigad district last June, glanced 110 km off Mumbai’s coast, but left the city largely unscathed. “It can be safely assumed that in the satellite era -- from 1980 onwards -- Tauktae is the most intense tropical cyclone to venture so close to Mumbai. It is a Category 4 system, as per global standards of the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre whereas Nisarga was a significantly weaker Category 1 tropical cyclone, which in turn had also become weaker by the time it made landfall at the Diveagar coast in Maharashtra,” Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist associated with the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said. “In November 1948, a severe cyclone had landfall north of Mumbai. The IMD doesn’t mention in their cyclone dataset whether it was an ESCS, but it was probably not. So, if that’s ruled out, Tauktae is the first ESCS to come so close to Mumbai since 1891. It is significant because it may be sooner than 100 years before such an incident happens again,” said Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Impact of the storm When it achieved peak intensity off the Mumbai coast, the cyclone itself was traveling at a speed of 120 knots, or 222kmph, as it travelled north-westward toward Gujarat, unleashing gale winds touching upwards of 100kmph in the city.Tauktae’s intensity was felt across the city as residents shared videos of fallen trees, broken power cables and choppy waves in the Arabian Sea as wind speeds of 114 km/hour were reported at around 2 pm by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s weather station at Afghan Church in Colaba. Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) closed all flight operations starting 11 am on Monday and diverted at least seven planes through the day. Airlines cancelled services to Mumbai, including 34 arrivals and 22 departures, and the airport resumed services late Monday night. During the day, nearly 20 local trains were cancelled and 50 delayed owing to the disruption in both the Central and Western Railway suburban train networks, due to waterlogging and tree falls, while the BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) diverted buses on 72 routes in the city due to waterlogging in 19 arterial roads. Eight people were injured in 26 incidents of wall collapses in three separate incidents, while 17 incidents of short circuit and at least 479 tree falls – 158 in south Mumbai alone -- were reported in the city. A wall of house collapsed injuring four members of a family in Borivali east, while in Andheri, a woman was injured when a slab of a wall fell over her. According to the BMC, the woman’s condition is stable, and she is admitted to a private hospital. Two people are feared to have drowned in two separate incidents in Mahim and Madh, where 10 people were stuck in their boats due to the rough seas and coast guards had to go to their aid, the BMC disaster management cell confirmed. Some of the survivors swam back to safety. Power supply was interrupted in many areas like Andheri west, Vile Parle, Kalina, Versova and Kurla. “To ensure the continuity of power supply and mitigate any disruptions owing to the cyclone Tauktae and heavy rains, team AEML took all the necessary precautions. Our specialized Quick Response Teams were on standby and ensured, wherever there were power disruption complaints, the supply was restored with the minimum interruption,” a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) which distributes power to the suburbs, said. Eastern suburbs like Mulund, Bhandup and Vikhroli, which the state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) supplies power to, were also affected. The company later said in a statement said that disruptions were experienced in other districts too, including Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, and that it aimed to restore normalcy by late Monday with a focus on Covid Care Centres and vaccination centres. BMC officials said that south Mumbai was the most hit as the cyclone went from south to north further towards Gujarat, leading to severe waterlogging in areas including Oval Maidan, Warden Road, Colaba as well as low-lying areas such as Hindmata, King’s Circle, and Dadar TT in central parts of the city.Civic activist Nikhil Desai from Dadar said, “Like every year even this year we had water logging in King’s Circle and Hindmata area. Though the rainfall was not expected this early but this shows that we are not prepared for the monsoon like every year. I do not know how much underground rainwater storage tank work is completed, but it is the truth that minutes of rainfall resulted in Hindmata and King Circle’s Gandhi Market got flooded.”Wettest May Mumbai also recorded the highest rainfall for the month of May, with its Santacruz observatory registering 194mm in 12 hours. The last time the city had experienced a wetter May was in 2000, when on May 19, it registered 190mm of rain. Private forecasters recorded close to 276mm and 252mm of rain in Juhu and Worli – both areas close to the sea -- though the IMD did not confirm these numbers separately. The city, however, was spared the fate wrought by the extreme rainfall event (an altogether different climatic event) on July 26, 2005, when it recorded 644mm in a 12-hour period between 8 am and 8 pm, which led to floods and brought life to a standstill. Jayanta Sarkar, meteorologist and head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, said, “At Santacruz weather station, which is representative of the whole city, we recorded the highest rainfall for May ever at 194mm. It is possible that other locations may have exceeded this amount. The same goes for wind speeds. At the IMD’s Colaba observatory today we recorded a maximum wind speed of 108kmph, but it is possibly higher in other locations.” State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray held a meeting with BMC officials on Monday following which he posted on Twitter: “We are doing everything we can to keep you safe. The BMC has begun to clear out fallen trees with every breather we get in the pattern of strong winds and heavy rain. We are working to ensure normalcy at the earliest. Today’s cyclone hit wind speeds of 114 kmph, highest ever for Mumbai in any recent records. This is a climatic pattern that we have started studying, along with its maximum impact points, water logging areas and types of trees that are damaged. Our 3 jumbo covid care centres that have been vacated as precaution, will now be taken up for maintenance and repairs over the next 10 days.”“One does not see a cyclonic storm with such high intensity hitting the coast. Above threshold sea surface temperatures across the Arabian Sea, particularly over east central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea, have kept on strengthening Cyclone Tauktae. Essentially, due to global warming, the tropical storm which would have otherwise degraded to a cyclonic or low-pressure depression prior to landfall can now sustain the strength of very severe to severe cyclonic storms very close to the coast. This change is here to stay, and we might see more devastating storms in the future that are more damaging than even Tauktae,” said Mahesh Palawat, VP Meteorology at private forecaster Skymet Weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/worst-cyclone-to-come-closest-to-mumbai-in-over-40-years-101621277590927.html
18-05-2021||Kolkata||Narada sting case: CBI arrests 4 people, including 2 Bengal ministers||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday arrested three Trinamool Congress legislators, including two cabinet ministers, and the former mayor of Kolkata in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case.Late on Monday night, the Calcutta High Court stayed the bail of all four leaders. Earlier in the day, a special CBI court had granted interim bail to the four leaders. The CBI, however, refused to release them till late in the night, while the agency moved the Calcutta High Court against the order of the special court.The matter was virtually heard by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee for nearly an hour after which the bail was stayed.“We were not made a party to the hearing. We have not received the court order. We were kept in the dark. We will plan our next over after going through the order,” said Anindya Raut, advocate.The next hearing would be held on Wednesday. Till then the four leaders would be lodged in the Presidency Correctional Home. “We just came to know that the bail order has been reversed and stayed by the Calcutta High Court till Wednesday,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of BJP’ unit in West Bengal.Following their arrest chief minister Mamata Banerjee rushed to the CBI’s office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata. She left after nearly six hours.A huge contingent of the Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force was deployed outside the CBI office at Nizam Palace and Presidency correctional home. TMC workers assembled in thousands at both locations.“Mamata told CBI officials that she should also be arrested,” a TMC leader, aware of the development, told the media.The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. “The CBI has today arrested four then (former) ministers, government of West Bengal in a case related to the Narada sting operation... it was alleged that then public servants were caught on camera while receiving illegal gratification from the sting operator,” CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said in Delhi. All four leaders were booked under sections 120b of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 7 and 13(1)(a) 13(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.The TMC alleged that the CBI was acting on BJP’s orders as the party was behaving in a vindictive manner after losing the assembly elections. While the TMC won 213 seats, the BJP could only manage 77 seats. “We condemn this. The BJP is not being able to accept the humiliating defeat and hence trying to take revenge. Why isn’t Mukul Roy, vice president of BJP being arrested? He was also seen in the Narada sting operation,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.Hundreds of TMC workers hit the streets and protested against the arrest of their leaders. Tension mounted when some protestors hurled bricks, shoes and bottles at the central forces, guarding the CBI office. TMC supporters blocked roads with burning tyres, burnt effigies of the Prime Minister.“Law is taking its own course. BJP has nothing to do with this,” said Samik Bhattacharjee, BJP spokesperson. The Speaker of the West Bengal legislative assembly said that the arrests were illegal and undemocratic as his permission was not taken. “The speaker’s prior permission is necessary to arrest a legislator and before submitting charge sheet. The CBI, however, didn’t take any permission. It is illegal and unconstitutional,” said West Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee.On May 9, West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had “accorded sanction for prosecution” of Hakim, Mukherjee, Mitra and Chatterjee. CPIM Rajya Sabha MP, former mayor and senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya however said, “The arrests were not illegal. They have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. While taking cognizance, the court would see whether the crime has anything to do with the work of the assembly or the speaker. If it has nothing to do, then no permission is required.”“It was a long wait. Finally, I got the result. This is a fight against corruption. My question is what happened to Suvendu Adhikari? He also received the money from me. It was recorded and handed over to CBI. Justice has to go everywhere in the same manner,” said Mathew Samuel, chief executive of Narada News, who conducted the sting operation purportedly showing senior Trinamool Congress leaders accepting bribes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/narada-sting-case-cbi-arrests-4-people-including-2-bengal-ministers-101621276691360.html

According to police, information had come in around 2pm on Sunday about the body in a house by the landlord.Police officials said that the body was sent for an autopsy. “The autopsy concluded the cause of death to be an ante-mortem head injury. We have informed the victim’s family and they are on their way,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1.The officials said that one of the suspects, who was the tenant in the Sector 35 house, is also a labour contractor.“At least three people and the victim were hanging out at the place and drinking alcohol. It seems that there was a disagreement, following which Raju was hit on the head by a heavy object by the suspects, after which they fled,” said Verma.He said that the suspects are from West Bengal and some Northeastern state, and it is a possibility that they all fled to their hometowns. “Teams have been dispatched to look for them. A probe is underway and all angles are being explored,” the ACP said.The officials said that a case of murder will be registered at Sector 24 police station once the victim’s family gives a complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-found-dead-in-noida-police-suspect-his-friends-101621274770734.html
18-05-2021||Pune||Stock shortage leads to no vax drive for second consecutive day in Pune||Pune: Officials have confirmed that there would be no Covid-19 vaccination dive on Tuesday which means that the campaign has been halted for two consecutive days. The administration has cited stock shortage for the vaccination disruption. Health officials said that the new stock is likely to arrive by Tuesday afternoon which would be distributed to centres and the drive would resume by Wednesday. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol tweeted on Monday that there would be no vaccination drive at any of the centres on Tuesday as there is no available stock in the city. Similarly, PCMC has also cancelled its vaccination drive due to the same reason. While Pune city and PCMC saw no vaccination drive on Monday, Pune rural saw 711 people get the jab on the day. In Pune rural, none of those aged between 18-43 years received the vaccine. Of the 711, 190 are of Covaxin and remaining Covisheild.Officials said that Tuesday also the drive would continue in rural Pune with the remaining stock.Deputy director of health services Dr Sanjay Deshmukh said, “There was no vaccination drive on Monday as well as on Tuesday it will remain cancelled as we do not have available stocks.

18-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra University to ask govt to allow offline MBBS exams from June 2||Days after state’s medical education minister Amit Deshmukh convened a meeting to take a final call on the pending second-and third-year MBBS exams, officials from the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) are now approaching the state government, seeking permission to commence exams from June 2.The state had said that the exams will be conducted in the first week of June. “As the lockdown in Maharashtra officially ends on June 1 at 7am, we are sending a proposal to the state government for permitting to conduct exams without any further delay,” said Dr Ajit Pathak, controller of examinations, MUHS. “We are ready and so are the institutes. As the lockdown has been extended from May 15 to June 1, we will wait to get guidance from the government before conducting exams,” he added.Usually scheduled to take place in the month of December-January, the second-and third-year MBBS exams were postponed thrice this academic year due to the rising Covid-19 cases across the state. To make use of this time, MUHS in a circular released in the last week of April, asked all its affiliated colleges to start regular lectures and academic activities from the next academic year, even though final exams for the second-and third-year batches are yet to be conducted for the current academic year. “The teaching schedule of the next academic year should continue uninterrupted as these students are carried over to the next academic year, irrespective of the exam results,” stated the MUHS circular dated April 29.The dean and principals of colleges have been directed to ensure strict compliance of Covid-19 safety protocols while conducting academic activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-university-to-ask-govt-to-allow-offline-mbbs-exams-from-june-2-101621265650365.html
18-05-2021||Pune||Mhalwadi, a ‘learning village’ in Pune district||Pune: The Covid-19 has resulted in schools being shut, children out of classrooms, and teaching being undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. However, there are some villages with no internet connectivity. Mhalwadi, a village 50 kms from Pune in Bhor taluka, has found a way to overcome the situation. It has turned its walls into colourful blackboards for students. More than 100 walls in the village are painted with lessons on various subjects. Drawings, formulas, diagrams and other details that are taught in schools are painted on the walls of buildings and homes across the village for the benefit of children. The initiative is taken by Rajesh Bodke from the village. “The students of our village used to study at the zilla parishad school that is closed since the Covid outbreak last year. Their parents are farmers with limited economic means. They do not have smartphones to study online and even the mobile connectivity at the village gets disrupted often. As I also did my primary education at this zilla parishad school, I decided to do something to help the students. I met the school teachers and we came up with the idea to turn the entire village into a school. Accordingly, since the last two months, we have painted over 100 walls across the village with information and lessons for school-going children,” said Rajesh. According to Rajesh, the project was inaugurated on Sunday. “Any student can learn from these information boards and school lessons from anywhere around the village. There are Mathematics formulas, tables, history and civics lessons, body parts information, science related diagrams and other details that student can learn while walking around the village. I have spend around ₹1.5 lakh on the project and am feeling satisfied to do something for my village,” Rajesh said. The village has one zilla parishad school with around 52 students. As schools are closed across the country since March last year, those studying outstation have returned to their hometown, and their count is 50. Appreciating the work of the learning walls, Ketan Patil, a 12-year-old student from the village, said, “Our studies are affected by the pandemic. These learning walls help us to sit and read the information and lessons as a fun activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mhalawadi-a-learning-village-in-pune-district-101621261870243.html
