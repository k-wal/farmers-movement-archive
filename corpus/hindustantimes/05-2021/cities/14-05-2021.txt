The duo was out on bail when they went absconding. Police lodged a first information report (FIR) against Ragini and Mansi Khandelwal after the complainant, Ravi Jaisingh, submitted a written application to the police in March.According to Jaisingh, his acquaintance Rashid Agarwal had introduced him to Raju Naik who claimed to have 41% share in a company named Shree Tirupati Balaji Marine Enterprises Ltd which was based in Kalyan Shipyard and manufactured heavy infrastructure vessels and tug boats.Naik took Jaisingh to the shipyard and asked him to invest ₹50 lakh in the same firm, however, the businessman declined. Later Naik introduced him to Mansi Khandelwal who had 49% shares in the company. Police officers said that Mansi asked Jaisingh to invest the money to own 34% share of the company.“An MOU was also signed by the accused to the effect,” said an officer from Khar police station.Under this pretext, the mother-daughter duo had extracted ₹63.72 lakh from Jaisingh between 2018 and 2020 and then refused to give him the shares in March 2021. Jaisingh then approached Khar police to lodge a complaint. In February the duo was arrested by Andheri Police for allegedly cheating people of crores of rupees on the pretext of investing in shares of shipyard. They have allegedly duped several investors using the same modus operandi.Acting on the complaint, a probe was initiated after which the police learnt that the modus operandi of the women was to ask businessmen to invest in ships, which could attract monthly returns in lakhs and then refuse to give them their share. “Since Ragini and Mansi got bail on April 23, the duo is absconding,” added the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cops-look-for-woman-daughter-booked-for-cheating-investors-101621016519904.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Marathas hope to get their reservation back||The Maratha community is hopeful of revival of their reservation, after the Centre filed a review petition in the Supreme Court (SC) for reconsideration of the order related to states’ powers to list backward classes after the 102nd Constitutional amendment. Community members feel if the top court reviews its verdict on states’ powers, the Maharashtra government can revisit the other grounds on which the quota has been struck down. On the other hand, in the absence of the quota, the community has also started building pressure on the government for implementation of the sops announced for the community. The Centre filed a review petition in the SC on Thursday, pleading it to reconsider its May 5 judgment, which ruled that after the Constitutional amendment in 2018, state governments have no power to draw up their own list of backward classes. The Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. The SC quashed it, stating people from the community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge SC bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment that set a 50-% cap on reservation to a larger bench for reconsideration. The Maharashtra government has appointed an eight-member committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the SC order and recommend the way forward. “If the top court reviews its verdict, confirming that the powers with the state governments are intact, the ball will again be in the court of the Maharashtra government. Currently, in the wake of the SC order, it is dangling between the state and Centre. Now, the state will have to take a call whether to go for the review of the order related to the findings of the Gaikwad committee, which was the basis of the SEBC quota, or conduct a survey again to establish the backwardness of the community. The committee appointed under the retired high court judge can give recommendations to the state on these fronts,” said an official from Mantralaya. Legal experts also see hope. “The Central government has clarified that the state government’s powers related to reservation were intact. Once their claim is admitted, the Maharashtra government will have the options of appointing a fresh commission to look into the backwardness of the community and conduct the survey again, keeping the SC’s remarks in mind. Even the lacunae in the report, pointed out by the court, could be revisited and revised to establish “exceptional and extraordinary circumstances” to accord the reservation. If it is done, there would be no question of following the 50-% cap on reservation,” said advocate Abhijit Patil, one of the members of coordination committee of lawyers appointed for reservation. Public works department minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan demanded the Centre file a review petition in the SC for its verdict on the 50-% cap. “We had demanded the Centre’s intervention for a review of the Indra Sawhney verdict, which caps the reservation to 50%. We had demanded the case be transferred to an 11-judge constitution bench. We again urge the Centre to file a review petition for reconsideration of the cap on reservation,” Chavan said on Friday. Bharatiya Janata Party’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said the state should announce a ₹3,000-crore package to ensure benefits of the other backward classes to Marathas. “Until the reservation is given again, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government should immediately start implementing the benefits and schemes meant for backward classes for the Maratha community. Our government had rolled out the package for the community in the wake of the prolonged process of reservation in 2017,” he said. The community has relaunched its agitation through digital platforms to push for reservation. “We want the state government to take all steps to restore the reservation. The government should tap the legal options available. We have also been pressing for appointment letters to 2,185 youth from the community who have been selected for various posts, but could not get the letters before the stay on reservation. The state should seriously implement the schemes announced to extend the reservation benefits to the community,” said Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathas-hope-to-get-their-reservation-back-101621015919907.html

Now they are blaming farmers’ agitation to hide their own failure to contain the virus,” he added.“This is propaganda of the BJP government to suppress the agitation but the stir will continue till the government accepts their demands to withdraw the Centre’s three farm laws which allow private players in procurement of agriculture produce,” he said.Charuni blamed people from NCR districts who work in Delhi, Gurugram and Faridabad and travel home regularly for the virus spread in villages.“Farmers cannot be blamed for spread of Covid as not even a single farmer was found infected so far at Delhi borders,” he added.Charuni, who is member of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha which has been leading the agitation at Delhi borders since November last year, has urged farmers to continue their support to the protest.Ratan Mann, Haryana president of BKU (Tikait), said spread of the virus is due to failure of the government which has failed to provide even basic health and medical facilities to people.“The protesting farmers are following all Covid norms. The CM’s allegations are false and will not help government to end our agitation,” he added.Meanwhile, Yamunanagar farmers affiliated to BKU (Charuni) and other farm unions burnt effigies of Khattar and state education minister Kanwar Pal at Milk Majra toll plaza on Jagadhari road.They said the government wants to hide its mismanagement in tackling the Covid situation by blaming farmers.BKU district president Sanju Gudiyana said the ruling party leaders organised public rallies in poll-bound states when there was spike in cases but are now blaming farmers for spread of Covid.“They can’t even provide medical oxygen and medicines to patients and want us to be held accountable for the crisis,” the leader said.FARMERS REFUSING TO GET TESTED: VIJState health minister Anil Vij said that due rise in cases in rural areas, the department has made arrangements to screen every villager.He said villagers are cooperating with the teams, but not the farmers.“Farmers are not getting themselves tested. We have sent many health teams to the protest sites and a meeting took place between farm leaders and officials, but the farmers refused to get tested,” Vij said.He added that at a vaccination camp, just 1,900 farmers got the jab in the last 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-leaders-slam-khattar-for-blaming-their-agitation-for-spread-of-covid-101621011600796.html

One of the main proposals is to have an ‘open-book exam’ for this semester. The decision will be taken in the SPPU’s board of examination meeting to be held on Saturday. The first semester examination is being held in online mode for students from first to last year of all the courses. The exam is conducted of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) method in online mode. The university’s own SPPU Edutech foundation company is conducting this exam. While going forward with the second semester exams, other alternative options to conduct exams are been explored by SPPU. Despite the use of proctored test method, there are many cheating cases found in the first semester exams. It was found that students were using other electronic gadgets and internet surfing to give answers in the online exams. Many students have got high marks suddenly, so to make the examination more transparent, new alternatives of conducting the exams are being evaluated. SPPU vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “As the new technology is upgraded, we also need to change the ways of examination. The number of students appearing for the online exams has increased and even the passing percentage has increased drastically. Also, we have found that the number of cheating cases has increased during the first semester. So, we are now going to look for some other alternatives for exam like open book exams for the second semester exams. The final decision will be taken in the meeting which will be held on Saturday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-exploring-option-of-open-book-exams-101621009079651.html

Sanjay Tiwari was told that vaccination was for people above 45 years of age at the centre, but he and 35 others forced the staff to administer them the vaccine,” said Prasad. In their complaint, the three female members of the vaccination team also requested district authorities to shift them from the said vaccination centre in view of their safety and security.As per the complaint, Sanjay Tiwari, health minister Banna Gupta’s personal secretary and office in-charge in Kadma, forced the vaccination team to give doses to 35 persons below the age of 45 years by signing and stamping in columns meant for authorised officers. Prasad filed another complaint late Thursday evening against Tiwari and 25-30 others, accusing them of manhandling, misbehaving, abusing and threatening him. “Tiwari and 25-30 other persons intimidated me again at Kadma New Farm Area vaccination centre Thursday when I reached there around 12.15 pm,” he said.When contacted, Tiwari, however, dismissed the allegations against him by terming them to be concocted and baseless. “I didn’t administer the vaccine to anyone. Who am I (to do that)? Moreover, none from 18-44 years age group can be given vaccine without slot booking,” said Tiwari, conveniently overlooking the fact that no such restriction is there for people above 45 years of age. He also denied intimidating the executive magistrate and said it was some “irate” people who created a ruckus over computer operators reaching late at the centre. “In fact, the operators came at 1.30 pm while people were waiting in the queue since 10am,” said Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/secy-among-36-persons-at-health-min-s-office-booked-for-forcibly-getting-covid-vaccine-101621008239460.html

They will be given the jab in the first session of 9am-11am on Saturday,” Abhishek Kumar, district vaccine manager, said. However, the 10 persons, who were duly registered on Co-Win app, were issued the vaccination certificate.Following the incident, a fresh batch of Covaxin vials were sent to the centre, but the computer operator and nurses allegedly left by 4.32pm, hours before the session ending time of 6pm, said district vaccination nodal officer Dr BN Usha and incident commander at the centre Chandradeo Prasad. However, the computer operator Anay denied the allegation. “We were told to come at 9am Saturday after the vials broke. We still waited for over an hour as we were told another batch of vials were on way. But, the nurses left around 4.30pm after a computer operator called them repeatedly,” one of the 10 registered vaccine beneficiaries Gautam Dubey said.Earlier in the day, the third phase of the vaccination drive in the city started with first dose to one Rekha Singh and Trishit Mazumder at the vaccination center at St Roberts School in Parsudih.

Vaccine is the safeguard against this infection. So, I appeal everyone to come forward to take the jab.”He added, “It is true that coronavirus keeps changing its genetic code and its new variant surfaces. But, we can’t surrender. We will have to fight back by breaking the chain of infection.”Meanwhile, health minister Banna Gupta said the government was fully committed to protect its citizens. “We are working tirelessly to spruce up the health system and even a small loophole is being plugged,” he said.On Friday, the vaccination drive was launched at 496 CVCs set up across the state to inoculate the targeted 27,539 beneficiaries.State capital Ranchi, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic, has the maximum 13.9 lakh population against the state’s target of 1.57 crore beneficiaries in the aforementioned age group. Five CVCs each for Ranchi urban and rural was set up on Friday to inoculate 1,000 registered beneficiaries.“I am quite relieved axed after taking the shot. It’s really needed for the younger generation that can’t stay indoors due to lot of compulsions. However, I know that maintaining adequate Covid behaviour is still vital even after taking the jab to keep the infection at bay,” said 30-year-old Umesh Kumar, a resident of Ranchi’s Kutchery area, who took the shot at SKIPA CVC.Ranchi district, which has targeted to inoculate 1,000 beneficiaries every day, has all its time slots booked till May 20. More than 15,000 people, who have already registered themselves, are waiting for allotment of time slots. “The booking for time slots for dates after May 20 will be opened in a couple of days,” said an official at Ranchi civil surgeon’s office.He added, “The final coverage figures are being calculated but it has been found that Ranchi on Friday reported above 90% vaccination coverage in this group. It has also been noticed that some people, who are residents of Ranchi urban, have booked slots in rural areas in haste. But, they didn’t turn up. This will lead to cancellation of their session. We request everyone to chose the time slot as per one’s convenience and ensure their presence at CVCs. Non-appearance will deprive a needy persons from taking the shot and lead to wastage of vaccine as well.”Besides Ranchi, Dhanbad district, which has the second largest population under the 18-44 age group, targeted to inoculate 4,930 people on Day 1.The third phase of the nationwide inoculation drive began on May 1 in many parts of the country under which citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years are allowed to take the jab. But, it could not be started in Jharkhand as the state was required to purchase the doses from the two vaccine manufacturing companies, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, that produce Covishield and Covaxin, respectively .Against its purchase orders, Jharkhand has so far received 2.34 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin.Pre-registration is mandatory for vaccination in the 18-44 age group, and walk-ins are not allowed under this category for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/vaccination-for-18-44-group-first-day-sees-101621008179485.html

People from villages in Kaimur district of Bihar often use nearby Jamania Ghat in Ghazipur district of UP for cremation of bodies.On Wednesday and Thursday, some of the villagers going to Jamania from Baraura village of Kaimur district for cremation were stopped by the UP police. “They pleaded that they had got instructions not to allow bodies to enter UP for cremation,” said a family member of Hari Kishore Singh who was accompanying his body for funeral. The family had planned cremation at Jamania. Four such families were denied entry, he said.Jamania subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Ghanshyam dismissed the charge. “There is no ban on cremation. Only, people are being asked not to dispose bodies in Ganga as it will pollute the river. Some mischievous elements are trying to portray a different picture and create unnecessary tension between the two states,” he said. The tension between two states mounted after Buxar district administration put a big net to prevent bodies from flowing downstream Ganga from UP into Bihar. Boat patrols even entered UP areas reportedly to see if any body is being dumped in Ganga in night.The Buxar administration has formed a team to keep an account of bodies and from where they are coming. “The bodies are coming from the direction of flow of the river,” said the SDO (Sadar) K K Upadhyay. Three bodies recovered in BhojpurAlthough no body were found in Ganga near Buxar on Friday, three bodies were recovered further downstream near Sinha Ghat in Bhojpur district.“Two bodies have been recovered in a decomposed state,” said Barhara block development officer (BDO) Jaivardhan Gupta. Buxar district magistrate Aman Samir said on Friday that 80% of the bodies fished out at Chausa were covered with shrouds used during cremation. “No body was found wrapped in hospital or PPE kits,” he said. Samir said there are only 30 Covid positive cases in Chausa area while Buxar district has 1,033 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/villagers-allege-problems-in-cremation-as-police-hike-vigil-on-bihar-up-border-101621008119535.html

The state was left with 3,28,530 doses of vaccines for the 45+ population, as per government figures till May 13. After Friday’s consumption, the vaccines were not even enough to last a day if the state were to achieve its average daily vaccination target of 2.50 lakh. The state was left with 1,57,880 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and 1,70,650 doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India for the 45+ age group, as on May 13. Given the fact that the consumption rate of Covaxin was slow, the state was hard pressed to manage future vaccination for this age group, said officials. The state had received an allotment of over 10 lakh doses of vaccines for the May 1-14 fortnight. It was, however, yet to hear from the Centre about the allotment of vaccines for the fortnight beginning May 15. “We are managing with whatever quantity of vaccines is available with us. We are firefighting on a daily basis. Depending on the availability of vaccines, we may have to decrease the number of session sites,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Given the vaccine shortage, the state had already decreased the number of vaccination session sites from 3,000 on May 12 to 1,950 on Friday. “We may have to reduce the vaccination session sites further tomorrow as some districts don’t have the vaccines,” said another officer associated with the vaccination programme of the health department. The health department had slowed down its pace of vaccination and shut down many centres after May 12. Bihar had so far received 7,14,960 doses of Covaxin and 80,62,430 doses of Covishield free of cost from the Centre for the 45+ population. It had consumed 5,57,080 doses of Covaxin and 78,91,780 doses of Covishield. The vaccine wastage was 3.7% in case of Covaxin and 1.4% in case of Covishield, said officials. In contrast, the state had more number of vaccines to inoculate the 18-44 years age group, having 5.39 crore population in the state. It had 5,51,140 doses of the two vaccines, of which Covaxin accounted for 56,120 doses and Covishield 4,95,020 doses. It was only on May 12 that the state had received 5 lakh doses of Covishield from Pune. “The state has made available funds for direct procurement of vaccines from the manufacturers for the 18-44 years population,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional secretary, health. Covid-19 cases go down Bihar reported 7,494 new cases of coronavirus, the lowest single-day cases this month, and 77 deaths on Thursday. The cases have been on a decline over the last three days. Patna reported 967 cases and six deaths during the day, the lowest this month, after recording a high of 3,665 cases on May 6 and 30 deaths on May 2. Purnia contributed 441 cases, Katihar 389, Gopalganj 387, Gaya 350, Muzaffarpur 291, Begusarai 273 and Supaul 268 among others. Bihar’s case recovery rate also went up to 85.38%, the highest this month, after 14,131 people were discharged from different health facilities across the state. Drugs for black fungus not available Liposomal Amphotericin B injection, a specific drug for treatment of cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, was not available in Bihar, claimed the Ruban Hospital, where two cases of the fungal infection were reported on Wednesday. “We have written to the state drug controller to make available the drug for us so that it can be administered to our patients. We did not find the drug anywhere in the state,” said Dr Satyajit Singh, managing director of the Ruban Memorial Hospital in Patna’s Patliputra Colony. Ruban, an NABH-accredited hospital, has been treating cases of coronavirus, and has reported two cases of black fungus as secondary infection developed during the treatment of Covid-19. “A private doctor residing at Rajendra Nagar locality of Patna and suffering from mucormycosis is serious and in intensive care unit. He contracted the fungus as secondary infection during treatment of coronavirus. He was operated upon yesterday for removal of fungus, but is showing signs of multi-organ failure,” said Dr Singh. “Another woman in her mid-40s, with the fungal infection is recovering well,” he added. The number of cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, reported from the state, had gone up to 12, after the two cases at Ruban Hospital and two at Paras-HMRI hospital in Patna recently. Earlier, seven cases of mucormycosis were reported at AIIMS-Patna and one at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shortage-of-45-vaccines-forces-bihar-to-cut-vaccination-sites-101621008060124.html

14-05-2021||Pune||Maratha leaders hopeful after Centre files review petition||After the Central government filed a review petition in the Supreme Court (SC) over the Maratha community reservation verdict, Maratha outfits are hoping to get some relief. Vinayak Mete, Shiv Sangram party leader held a press conference today at Patrakar Bhavan and expressed his views over the new development. “We had filed the petition on behalf of Shivsangram organisation over the 102nd constitutional amendment in the SC and made the Central government party in it. While the central government’s attorney general was personally present and he submitted the affidavit, it was mentioned that even after the 102nd constitutional amendment it is possible to give reservation to a certain section of the society,” said Mete at the press conference. “Taking support of the Shivsangram petition, the Central government has submitted their review petition in the SC. While the state government has done nothing over it and the current Mahavikas Aghadi government is just fooling people. The leaders from all the three parties are only creating drama, confusing the Maratha community and not doing anything in terms of legal fight. Due to the fear that the Maratha community will come on the roads, the state-wide lockdown was extended until May-end,” added Mete. While on May 18, the Shivsangram organisation along with other Maratha organisations is going to protest all over the state outside the district collector and Tehslidar offices which will be called as ‘Ishara Nivedan protest’ and after the lockdown is over, from June 1 to 5 the first huge public protest of Maratha community will be organised in Beed. Maratha outfits will hold a press conference in view of the Centre filing a review petition in the Supreme Court on Maratha reservation. Centre has filed a review petition in the SC challenging its verdict over the 102nd constitutional amendment saying that the amendment has done away with the powers of the state concerning the reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maratha-leaders-hopeful-after-centre-files-review-petition-101621006019337.html

14-05-2021||Pune||No delivery of vehicles on auspicious Akshaytritiya, customers, dealers unhappy||Due to strict lockdown restrictions in the state, all non-essential shops are closed which has impacted the sale of vehicle deliveries on Akshaytritiya, considered to be an auspicious day to bring home a new vehicle. In 2020, there was a similar situation where both the day of Gudhi Padwa and Akshaytritiya went without the sale of new vehicles. This has made showroom dealers and agents furious as their business is completely down. Even the people who had booked their vehicles and were only waiting to take the delivery on these auspicious days are now angry over the delay. “I had booked the car a month back and had planned to take the delivery on Akshaytritiya but suddenly these new lockdown restrictions came, and everything stopped. Our entire family is waiting to take the delivery of our car and hope that these showrooms are allowed to give the deliveries out,” said Mihir Purandare, an IT professional. Even last year when there was a complete lockdown across the country, the two dates of major festivals were missed and there was huge pendency of vehicle deliveries. Similar situation has occurred this year too, when both these days again went into lockdown restrictions and people didn’t receive their vehicle deliveries. A four-wheeler showroom manager who wanted to be anonymous said, “We are receiving calls daily from our customers who have booked the vehicle and demanding for delivery. But as we cannot open the showroom as it is not allowed legally, we tell them to wait till the lockdown is lifted. Still if anyone wants the delivery immediately, we gave them an option to take it directly from our go down without registration.” While the resale cars market is also down and there are no deliveries done this festive period. Atula Jain, owner of Jain Motors said, “All the cars which we got for sale are lying inert and there is no business for us due to the lockdown. We cannot open the shop legally, customers can’t come to choose the cars and no business is being done. The state government should now give some relaxations to do business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-delivery-of-vehicles-on-auspicious-akshaytritiya-customers-dealers-unhappy-101621004099283.html
14-05-2021||Pune||PMC to float global tender next week for Covid vaccine||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to float a global tender next week to procure Covid vaccines for Pune similar to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). After BMC floated a global tender for vaccines, politics over vaccine procurement began in the city. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader of the house in PMC Ganesh Bidkar made allegations that the state government was not allowing the PMC to float a global tender. PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar clarified that there was no need for the state government’s permission. Despite the clarification, Bidkar wrote a letter to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to allow the global tender. Pawar clarified in a press conference that there was no need for the PMC to seek the state government’s permission to float a global tender. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “We have started the process of floating a global tender. The administration is studying the tender documents of BMC. After finalizing the term and condition of global tender, we will float the tender. It will take almost a week. We will try to float the tender next week. In the first phase, we need at least 25 lakh doses.” He further said, “We sent a letter to the city-based Serum Institute to directly purchase vaccines from them. I sent a letter to Serum through e-mail and also spoke to senior officials of the institute. However, they haven’t given any confirmation till date. The city needs vaccines either from the global market or from Serum Institute, what is first, we are ready to procure it.” Aba Bagul, Congress leader in PMC said, “The citizens want vaccines. PMC should have to purchase vaccines from companies or float a global tender. I appealed to all party leaders that don’t politicise vaccination drives. There are lots of issues to take political advantage but spare the vaccine issue and save lives. It is public money and used for their welfare.” Prashant Jagtap, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city president said, “BJP is politicising the vaccine issue. At present, people need vaccines and not politics. When the state and PMC commissioner is saying there is no need to take permission from the state or central government, BJP has highlighted the issue. Now, it has been cleared that no permission is required for the global tender process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-float-global-tender-next-week-for-covid-vaccine-101621004039250.html

The PMC has extended the tender of the JICA project to May 31, 2021. Jagdish Khanore, project head of JICA said, “The tender documents selling date has been extended up to May 31. The actual last date was March 30, 2021. However, due to the pandemic induced lockdown, there are restrictions on movement. Bidders requested the PMC to extend the date of selling documents.” He further said, “Most of the bidder companies are outside the Pune city and they are facing a problem to get documents. The process of the tender is an offline process.” The project was sanctioned by the Central government under the National River Conservation plan (NRCP) in2015.The actual project cost was ₹990.26 crore. However, due to delays, the estimated cost has gone to ₹1,511 crore. Under the JICA project, the PMC will construct 11 new sewage treatment plants (STPs) in different parts of the city to reduce the pollution of Mula-Mutha.

14-05-2021||Pune||College students seek fee reduction due to pandemic situation||Pune: With the next academic year to start soon, many undergraduate and graduate students in Pune have sought the intervention of state education authorities and college management to reduce admission and college fees. Like last year, the students are worried that lockdowns and restrictions have severely hit the financial condition of their families and reducing college education expense is the only way forward for them to continue their studies. “I completed my graduation in Science last year and took a year-long gap due to Covid-19 pandemic. I am planning to take admission for post-graduation this year, but the fees for some courses in private universities and colleges are too high. The state education department should take steps to make college education possible for those from all economic strata,” said students Ketaki Ghanekar. Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will start the second semester from next month. While the exams are taken online due to the Covid situation, admission for new courses will start by August. Kuldeep Ambekar, student and president of Students Helping Hand organisation, said, “Many students come from rural areas and cannot afford fees because of their economic situation. Some have to leave their studies because they cannot pay fees. We have written to the education department to address the issue.” Pratik Mhaske said, “I have completed my diploma in Computer Science and want to purse a graduation degree. I did not take admission last year due to Covid pandemic, but the fees for courses this year is high.” Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar said, “The Covid pandemic has hit education with many students struggling to pay fees. We have received request from students on reducing fees or waiver, but the final decision lies with the state higher education department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/college-students-seek-fee-reduction-due-to-pandemic-situation-101621001699177.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Daughter Courage||This Wednesday morning Washington Post and HT columnist and owner of the digital news network MoJo Story, Barkha Dutt, grief stricken from the loss of her father to Covid-19 a few days earlier and wan and pale from contracting the disease herself, performed a simple ceremony to honour his memory — mixing his ashes into the mud of his favourite rose plant and two evergreen trees in her garden, she knelt in silent prayer to seek his blessings and bid him goodbye. Then, changing into a cotton salwar-kurta, her de rigueur work garb, and duly masked with her PPE kit at hand, she got in her car accompanied by her loyal team, to hit the road again and report on the unfolding Covid catastrophe wreaking havoc across the country.In many ways Dutt could be called a first responder to the pandemic. Ever since March last year, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden all-India lockdown, which had rendered millions of migrant workers jobless, homeless and walking, often with their children, aged parents and belongings on their shoulders, back to their villages, Dutt had walked shoulder to shoulder with them, bringing their unimaginable anguish and pain to the drawing rooms of the world. The journey, which had begun in Gurugram, Delhi on March 27, had seen Dutt travel by road through Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Ladakh among other states. Unlike big traditional news media outlets, Dutt had gone where none would or could, affording her viewers direct access to the heart of the crisis, not its numbers and statistics, but real people, penniless and distraught caught in the vice-like grip of a human tragedy.For instance, it was Dutt in Mumbai, during the early days of the lockdown who had chanced upon an old woman named Lilavati, sobbing and alone outside a railway station. Hers was not a catastrophe directly related to Covid, but a part of its collateral damage. Beaten and abandoned by her children, she’d arrived at the station that day, clutching half a packet of biscuits, in the hope of catching a train out of the city. The ominous silence of the platform and lifeless trains were reminder of the individual, particular anguish behind every statistic. Dutt, for once at a loss for words, had simply wrapped her arms around the weeping woman, wiped away her tears and ensured that she was put on the first available train and securely received.It had also been Dutt’s relentless reporting from the ground which had galvanised a range of individuals to launch initiatives for rescue and relief. Whereas traditional media outlets concentrated on in-studio talking head debates, Dutt, with her one-man rag tag army, was bringing home the crisis one step, one face, one tragedy at a time. New York-based chef Vikas Khanna recalls how it was Dutt’s reporting from a petrol station deep in the hinterland, which had given him the idea to launch his philanthropic mission Feed India and use gas stations as distribution centres. To date, it has served over 54 million meals to the hungry.“My life from March to November 2020 has been a chronicle of graveyards, cremation grounds, hospitals, death, tragedy and loss. I continue to experience the opposite of a lockdown, having been out there and on the road for most of this year,” she said about that period of her life when she had thrown caution to the wind and followed the story to the heart of its sorrow.But it was in the pandemic’s deadly second wave that Dutt has really come into her own. Sensing the oncoming tidal wave, with her reporter’s instinct and almost to the exact day of the launch of her previous year’s OnTheRoad reporting, she returned to the road on March 24 this year, determined to spend the coming months as a traveling itinerant reporter once again.This time, with hospitals morgues and crematoriums overflowing, there had been an ominous urgency and desperation to her coverage. It had been only a few days later while in Mumbai that she’d received the news of her father testing positive for Covid-19 in Delhi. “Keep him in your prayers,” she had posted, from her makeshift studio on a pavement outside a cremation in Ghatkopar, where a weeping man had said to her: “First, there was no space at the hospital, now there’s no space at the shamshan.”“I (will) learn or try to learn to walk that tightrope between being a distraught daughter and a tough, clear-headed, calm professional,” she’d written, as she doggedly continued her relentless reportage.But ultimately the distraught daughter had to return home. Her father’s condition had deteriorated rapidly, and against his wishes, he was advised hospital treatment. Dutt had promised to bring him home in two days. But it was a promise she could not keep. “My father Speedy, kind, gentle, compassionate, lost his battle to Covid this morning.” She wrote on April 27. His last words to her had been: “I’m choking, treat me.”The fact that Dutt had now become part of the story that she’d been reporting for the past year, did not escape her. Putting aside her personal anguish she spoke to the world’s media, telling them how despite her bereavement and illness, it was her duty to soldier on. “All I can do now by way of tribute is to redouble my commitment to giving voice to those who don’t have one. It might be the only correct way to mourn my father.”But such is the climate of hate and polarisation in the country that even in her moment of profound suffering, Dutt’s detractors did not spare her. Her reportage from crematoriums and morgues earned her the sobriquet “vulture” from those who had long hated the guts of this independent, outspoken woman; and her personal tragedy was dismissed by them as “a PR stunt”.“But Barkha’s a karma yogi,” says one among her many admirers, Delhi-based veteran foreign correspondent Padma Rao, who as a cub reporter had hero-worshipped Dutt’s iconic firebrand journalist mother the late Prabha Dutt, a role model for a generation of women. “Poisonous, jealous people can go fly a kite, Barkha will never be stopped. She’s Prabha’s daughter, after all,” she said.And Rao is right. Because not even a fortnight after losing her father, Prabha and SPEEDY’s daughter, untethered and free, once again glides across the Indian landscape, gathering momentum and strength.After all, not for nothing had her parents named her “Cloudburst”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-daughter-courage-101620999540054.html

The state government’s orders came after the Union government on Thursday extended the interval between the two doses from 12 to 16 weeks for the Covishield shot.In a tweet, the Karnataka state health department said, “For the information of [the] Public - The earlier interval of 6 to 8 weeks of time for COVISHIELD vaccination between 2 doses is revised to 12 to 16 weeks.”Citizens are requested not to come to Vaccination centers if they have not completed 12 weeks after the first dose of Covishield vaccine. This revised time interval between 2 doses is applicable only to COVISHIELD and not to COVAXIN vaccine.It further added “Citizens are requested not to come to Vaccination centers if they have not completed 12 weeks after the first dose of Covishield vaccine. This revised time interval between 2 doses is applicable only to COVISHIELD and not to COVAXIN vaccine,” in a subsequent tweet.Earlier on Thursday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare extended the interval between the first and second shot of the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, to 12 to 16 weeks. The extension was made based on the recommendation of the Covid working group, consisting of medical experts.“Based on the available real-life evidence, particularly from the UK, the COVID-19 Working Group agreed for increasing the dosing interval to 12-16 weeks between two doses of COVISHIELD vaccine. No change in interval of COVAXIN vaccine doses was recommended,” the ministry said in a press release.Also read | No vaccination for 18-44 age group in Karnataka from FridayThe ministry highlighted that the recommendations by the expert group were also accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19, headed by Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul, during the group’s meeting on May 12.Initially the two shots were prescribed to be taken with an interval of four to six weeks between the first and second doses. However, on March 22, the Centre had expanded the interval to four to eight weeks, noting that the efficiency of the vaccine is increased if administered with six to eight weeks of interval between the two shots. This has now been further extended to 12 to 16 weeks.Meanwhile, data from the Union health ministry showed that 10,994,304 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, comprising 8,644,671 first doses and 2,349,633 second doses, have been administered in Karnataka as of 7am on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/covishield-second-dose-only-after-completing-12-weeks-from-first-dose-karnataka-government-101620997328700.html
14-05-2021||Kolkata||Centre dilly-dallied over PM-KISAN amount transfer to Bengal farmers: Mamata Banerjee||As farmers in West Bengal received the first instalment of funds under the PM-KISAN scheme on Friday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit out at the Centre, accusing it of dilly-dallying over the transfer of funds to beneficiaries in the state.In an open letter to farmers, Banerjee also said the decision to extend the benefits of the scheme to eligible farmers in Bengal was a result of her governments continuous fight."In 2018, the West Bengal government had started the Krishak Bandhu scheme which went on to become a model for the entire country."After this in 2019, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi was launched. Comparatively, the state-run programme is better because it offers more benefits to farmers... we are planning to add more to our scheme in the near future," she said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday released the eighth instalment of over ₹20,000 crore to more than 9.5 crore farmer beneficiaries under the scheme via video- conferencing.About 7.03 lakh farmers of the state received the first instalment of ₹2,000 in their bank accounts, Modi said.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Home Department later said the state was not invited to be a part of the PM's event."It is clarified that West Bengal did not receive any invitation for the PM Kisan fund release programme today," the department tweeted."Due to demand and actions of CM and GOWB, 7 lakh farmers of West Bengal got their due entitlement, the first instalment of Kisan Samman Nidhi today by direct transfer as per data submitted by State. State will fight for its farmers," it added.A source in the department claimed that the Centre not sending invites for such events has become common practice. "The Bengal government considers today's snub as an insult as there were representatives of other states," he said.Under the programme launched in 2019, the central government is providing ₹6,000 in three equal installments to 14 crore farmers annually. The amount is transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode.Banerjee had on May 6 written to Modi, urging him to call upon the Union agriculture ministry to release the funds to farmers of the state."You all were supposed to get ₹18,000, but have received a very small amount. Even this sum would not have been transferred had we not fought for it.

It is not clear how the prisoner, Anshul Dixit, who shot dead the two gangsters managed to smuggle the 9mm pistol into the prison.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered director general of UP prisons Anand Kumar to send the first report on the incident within six hours and hold a detailed probe into the incident along with the Chitrakoot divisional commissioner DK Singh and inspector general (IG) Chitrakoot K Satya Narain.Police identified the two killed by Anshul Dixit in the shooting as Mukeem alias Kala, a gangster facing 61 criminal cases including the murder of three police personnel, and Merajudden, a close aide of gangster-politician Mukhtar Ansari. The powerful Bahujan Samaj Party legislator was recently brought back to UP from Punjab after the Yogi Adityanath government approached the Supreme Court. Ansari is being held in a jail in the adjoining district of Banda.In his first comments, Anand Kumar conceded there had been lapses by prison officials and vowed to take strict action against the officials concerned. By evening, news came that jail superintendent SP Tripathi and jailer Mahendra Pal have been suspended for lapses in jail security. A departmental inquiry has also been ordered.Santosh Verma, the spokesman of UP prison at Lucknow, said the incident took place shortly after 10am when prisoners came out of their barracks. Dixit suddenly opened fire and killed the two prisoners and held five other prisoners hostage, threatening to kill them.He said jail officials sought help from the police to control the situation. The police team that arrived gunned down Anshul Dixit to rescue the hostages. It has been deployed in the prison for some time to ensure there is no more trouble. The pistol that Dixit used has also been seized by the police.Verma said the accused, Anshul Dixit was transferred from Sultanpur jail to Chitrakoot jail in December 2019. Mukeem alias Kala was shifted to Chitrakoot from Saharanpur jail in March this year; Mukhtar Ansari’s aide Merajudeen was transferred from Varanasi jail barely a week ago.A senior police officer said Anshul Dixit faces over 15 cases including the murder of former Lucknow University Student Union general secretary Vinod Tripathi in 2007.One of the two men who he killed had longer rap sheets. Mukeem alias Kala, who was mostly active in western UP, has over 61 criminal cases registered against him including the murder of three policemen over the last decade. Kala operated extortion rackets in Kairana, Shamli and Muzaffarnagar districts where he mostly targeted businessmen and traders. He is blamed for many businessmen shifting out of this region. Merajuddin has three cases but his claim to notoriety was his proximity to Mukhtar Ansari, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-jail-inmate-shot-dead-2-gangsters-held-5-more-hostage-before-cops-kill-him-101620995281500.html

We are giving them vaccines for free. I appeal to the citizens to come forward and take vaccine jabs to protect themselves and their families," Soren said.He also urged people to join the vaccination drive and help the government break the chain of coronavirus infection in the state.The government commenced the inoculation drive with a stock of 6.48 lakh vaccine doses, an official said."Around 30,000 people in the age group of 18 to 44 years have already registered their names for vaccination. There is a lot of enthusiasm about the immunisation process among people in cities, while residents in rural areas have a reservation for it."The government is putting every effort to make people aware of the benefits of the vaccines," the official said.Apart from requesting people through various campaigns, the government has been promoting awareness drives in tribal languages.The government has allotted 1.34 lakh doses of 'Covaxin' and 1 lakh vials of 'Covishield' for the state capital Ranchi, which has been witnessing the maximum number of new cases and deaths in the last few weeks, he said.According to the official, the government also allocated 39,910 doses for Dumka, 39,730 for Palamu and 32,340 for Giridih.An order for 50 lakh doses of vaccines has already been placed, he said.At present, the first dose of vaccine has been administered to over 27.76 lakh people, including frontline workers and those above 45 years of age, while over 6.39 lakh citizens received the second shot.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 tally in the state jumped to 3,06,248 with 4,991 fresh cases, while the death toll reached 4,290 as 108 more people succumbed to the disease.Altogether, 75,84,831 samples have been tested in Jharkhand for Covid-19 so far.The chief minister said the state is putting every effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, without impacting the delivery of essential services.The government has extended the lockdown-like restrictions with strict provisions, including seven-day mandatory quarantine for people visiting the state, till May 27.Operations of inter and intra-state buses have been suspended, while private vehicle owners are required to obtain e-passes.The government restricted the maximum number of attendees at weddings to 11 with the provision that marriages can be conducted either at homes or at courts.Organising any ceremony during weddings has also been prohibited in the state.The state has already prohibited all indoor and outdoor gatherings of more than five persons.Education institutes and coaching centres have been remained shut and all examinations postponed.

14-05-2021||Other||HC stays Telangana govt order restricting Covid ambulances from other states||The Telangana high court on Friday stayed a circular issued by the state government restricting the entry of ambulances and other vehicles from other states carrying Covid-19 patients into Telangana. A division bench headed by chief justice Hima Kohli issued interim orders to this effect, after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by retired Indian Revenue Service officer Garimella Venkat Krishna Rao. The bench asked the governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and the Centre to file their counter-affidavits within two weeks and posted the case to June 17. While announcing the 10-day lockdown in Telangana beginning Wednesday, the Telangana government issued a circular stating that patients from other states would be allowed into Telangana, only if they have prior tie-up with the hospitals in Telangana for the purpose of Covid-19 admission. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar pointed out in the order that Covid-19 patients from neighbouring states were coming in ambulances and personal vehicles without any prior arrangement with any of the hospitals. “As a result, patients not only lose valuable time moving from one hospital to other, but also potentially spread the infection of different strains,” the order said. It said the hospitals in Telangana should apply in the prescribed format to control room set up for this purpose, furnishing basic patient details. Only then would the control room authorise patients to travel, said the order.Finding fault with the Telangana government order, the high court said patients could seek the assistance of the control room in finding the right hospitals, not for permission. Also Read | EC defers MLC polls in Andhra, Telangana due to second wave of CovidAndhra Pradesh state government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy wondered why the Telangana government was objecting to the entry of Andhra patients, when there were no such restrictions in going to Chennai and Bengaluru for better treatment. In the morning, several ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients from different parts of Andhra Pradesh into Telangana for better treatment in Hyderabad were turned away by the Telangana police at the inter-state borders, stating that they had no permission to enter the state. At least 40 ambulances were denied permission to enter the Telangana at Pullur check-post on the borders of Kurnool of Andhra and Jogulamba Gadwal district of Telangana on Hyderabad-Bengaluru national highway. “We have strict instructions from the higher-ups not to allow any vehicles that do not have e-pass from the Telangana government,” a senior police official of Jogulamba Gadwal district said on condition of anonymity. Kurnool MLA Abdul Hafeez Khan, who came to know about ambulances stranded at the Telangana border, rushed to the checkpost and eventually made alternate arrangements for some of the seriously ill in Kurnool government hospitals. Similar incidents were witnessed at Ramapuram check-post in Telangana’s Suryapet district bordering Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh on the Vijayawada national highway. Telangana state medical and health director G Srinivasa Rao said no patient from other states with a prior understanding with a hospital in Hyderabad and an e-pass from the police was denied entry into Telangana. “Our intention is not to create troubles for any patient from any state. In fact, 45% of the hospital beds in Hyderabad are occupied by patients from other states. Already 80% of the ICU and oxygen beds in the state are fully occupied,” he said. He said the second wave of Coronavirus pandemic had put tremendous pressure on the hospitals in Hyderabad in providing oxygen, medicines and other facilities. “We have the responsibility to cater to the needs of the patients from Telangana as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sans-permit-ambulances-ferrying-covid-patients-stopped-at-telangana-border-101620990299051.html

Tibetan chief election commissioner Wangdu Tsering on Friday declared Penpa Tsering, who is a former speaker of Tibet’s parliament-in-exile, as the winner of the 2021 general election for sikyong (political leader) after he got 34,324 votes in the final round of election that was held on April 11. Also read: Navy to pick 2,000 tonnes of oxygen from UAE, Kuwait and Qatar to battle CovidPenpa Tsering defeated Aukatsang Kelsang Dorjee by 5,417 votes. Dorjee, a former representative of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, polled 28,907 votes. The first round of the election was held on January 3. Tsering had led the first round by polling 24,488 votes. Dorjee had polled 14,544 votes. There were eight candidates in the fray for the post of sikyong in the first round of which Tsering and Dorjee made it to the second round. Born in the Bylakuppe Refugee Camp in Karnataka in 1967, Tsering attended the Central School for Tibetans at Bylakuppe, topping the merit list in Class 12. He did his graduation from Madras Christian College, Chennai, where he majored in economics. Tsering served as the general secretary for the Tibetan Freedom Movement and the Nigerian-Tibet Friendship Association during his college days and later as executive director at the Tibetan Parliamentary and Research Centre in Delhi from 2001-08. He was elected to the 12th and 13th Tibetan parliament-in-exile and served two terms as speaker from 2008-16. Tsering contested the 2016 sikyong election but lost to the outgoing Lobsang Sangay. He was appointed to the North America Representative of the Dalai Lama in 2016 but removed a year later on charges of dereliction of duty after he levelled allegations of corruption against Sangay. He faced an inquiry, and the matter also reached the Tibetan Supreme Justice Commission. Tsering won the case. The chief election commissioner also declared the results for 45 seats of the members in the 17th parliament-in-exile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/penpa-tsering-is-president-elect-of-tibetan-governmentinexile-101620989278873.html
14-05-2021||Pune||Step up vaccination to protect children in possible third Covid wave, say experts||As vaccination has been stopped for the 18-44 years age group from Thursday in Pune city, medical experts note that if elders do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, children may be at more risk. With predictions of the third wave of Covid being more dangerous to children, doctors have suggested that parents and grandparents should get vaccinated as soon as possible to keep the children safe.Dr Dnyaneshwar Mote, a member of the Pune city Covid task force for social action, said that the age group of 18 to 44 years should be a priority to vaccinate.“The beneficiaries in this age group usually go outside for work and other essential things, so the chances of them getting infected is more. Beneficiaries in this age group are also working professionals. Many families depend on them financially. In such cases, they should be the priority,” said Dr Mote.Dr Maheshkumar Lakhe, consultant, Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said that ceasing the vaccination of young people between 18 and 44 years of age, people who are mobile, largely asymptomatic in the second wave, and more likely carriers and transmitters of the virus, can pose a threat of infection to both elderly and children.“Considering that most of the elderly people have received both the doses of their vaccines as their inoculation started early and that no vaccine in India is approved for children yet, makes the latter more vulnerable to contracting the infection from their parents,” he said.“People aged less than 45 years can have children as young as a newborn or a toddler who are far less immune to a novel virus than a teenager or an adult. It is important to step up universal adult vaccination against Covid-19 urgently as global experience indicates a possible third wave that has affected children more, especially in the European countries, vaccinating adult people as much as possible is the best way to safeguard our children from the virus until we have vaccines suitable for them,” said Dr Lakhe.Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of the paediatric department of the Sassoon General Hospital said that parents and grandparents should follow strict Covid appropriate behaviour.“Due to shortage of vaccines, there is a delay in inoculating beneficiaries between 18 to 44 years of age. However, this should not deter beneficiaries who are 45 years and more from getting their jab. Also, Covid appropriate behaviour is a must for all to keep children safe,” said Kinikar.‘Increase gap between two doses of Covishield’On Thursday, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), a central government panel, suggested increasing the gap between two doses of Covishield. As per the recommendations by the panel, the second dose of Covishield should be taken between 12 to 16 weeks. Earlier, this gap was four to eight weeks. The panel, however, did not suggest any change of time for the second dose of Covaxin.The NTAGI recommendations will be sent to the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/step-up-vaccination-to-protect-children-in-possible-third-covid-wave-say-experts-101620989220486.html

14-05-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: What world needs right now is leaders who put people first||He’s my little cousin brother. We speak maybe once a year. Sometimes, once in two years. A medical transcriptionist by profession, Shubhankar Banerjee has a 69-year-old mother, a 30-something wife and a 13-year-old son. He has lost colleagues, friends and acquaintances to Covid-19, but doesn’t think twice when someone calls asking for assistance. Night or day, he responds to every call.Shubhankar lives in a quaint society called Nivedita Enclave in Paschim Vihar, New Delhi. There are 195 flats in that society, and everyone knows everybody else. Covid-19 has hit the society hard. Between April 25 and May 6, the society lost one person every day to the pandemic. They are families that have grown together for three generations in the past four decades - parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, children, grandparents. Now, many of the younger generation are working in other cities or in foreign countries. Shubhankar is one of the younger generation who has stayed back in Nivedita. With many in the society quarantined, elders reach out to Shubhankar and others of the younger generation for help. Some days they run around to get someone to a hospital, other days for medicine, yet other days for a slot at the crematorium.I called him last week to see how he’s doing, and ended up asking why he takes the risk. “Can’t think so much when someone calls in an emergency. If a life can be saved or if suffering can be eased, that’s the only thought. The situation has improved this week, in the sense that it has climbed back from worst to bad,” he said.“Right now, there isn’t much we can do if one falls ill. You can’t go to a hospital because there’s no place there. If you do get a bed in a hospital, there isn’t much they can do except put you on oxygen. Doctors and healthcare staff are under extreme pressure. But, trying and getting to a hospital makes the family feel less helpless - you feel that at least I was able to get my patient to a hospital,” he says in acceptance of the current situation in Delhi.Back home in Pune, April was somewhat similar for Sunil Gate. For those who know Sunil Gate, he’s a go-to person when you are in need. A corporate communication consultant with two decades of experience in different industries, Gate is a connector and a helpful person at heart. Even in an impossible situation, he will usually tell you, “Ruk, mai kuch karta hoon.” Throughout the past few months, Gate has been talking to hospitals, civic officials, business people, media and people in general to try and do his bit, always in the background. April was particularly taxing, with hourly requests for help with hospital admissions, information on how to get oxygen, medicines… May has so far been all about how to get vaccine shots. I have called him for Remdesvir injections and ICU with ventilator, for family and friends. Also in Pune, almost at the outskirts really, there’s a housing society in Kalewadi Phata, called Rhythm that is doing quite a creditable job of keeping its diverse range of cosmopolitan members informed and advised about matters related to Covid-19. There is a competent and well-informed committee led by chairperson Dr Ritu Awasthi, running the society with people from varied backgrounds bringing their expertise to the table. The society works well as a cohesive unit, marshalling resources and connections and as a result, there are sanitisation and fumigation drives regularly. There is a daily flow of information and interaction on the WhatsApp group. The society uses Zoom effectively. For the past few weeks, everyone is busy sharing information and helping each other get vaccination slots. It’s a delight to log into the group and see the level of engagement and ownership from the committee members and residents alike. Many agree that a good bit of the credit for the efficient dissemination of useful information, marshalling of resources, and effective execution of protocols lies with the society’s young secretary, Abhijit Garad. A software manager at an IT firm, Abhijit is patient with opinions, focused on providing data, endeavouring to facilitate plurality of opinions, while providing actionable information. And he has a sense of humour Punekars would be proud of. Earlier this week, a society member asked him if one was allowed to cross district borders. Abhijit replied: “You can get e-pass and travel. You can mention the reason that it has been a year without Kolhapur’s tambada and pandhara rassa, so application should be considered to travel to Kolhapur. Attach a blood report showing less tambada index.”Most of us know at least a few people like Shubhankar, Sunil, and Abhijit. I can think of many others who are quietly doing what needs to be done in cities and towns across the globe. They get on with what needs to be done and keep their sense of humour, balance and sanity intact. They get the job done and are always aware that there’s more to be done. They don’t do it for the accolade or the glory, and are always patient with the inevitable scepticism. They are content to be in the background and have the courage to be centre-stage when things are difficult. They are constantly evaluating matters on merit in the context of the greater good, but always exercising the wisdom of discretion to address individual matters that can redefine what the greater good is.What the world needs right now are leaders like them; leaders who put people first.Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

Moreover, none from 18-44 year age group can be given vaccine without slot booking,” he said.

14-05-2021||Delhi||City folks join hands to feed strays amid Covid lockdown||It’s not only strangers on the Internet lending a helping hand and delivering meals to Covid-hit families but a few good Samaritans in the city are also ensuring stray dogs remain well-fed during the lockdown. With the thought that being compassionate to animals is just as important to being kind to their own pets, city folks are going the extra mile — juggling between work schedules and volunteer work during Covid-19 times to feed and take care of the strays.“Ever since we started the service of providing no-cost meals to Covid-19 patients, my inbox has been full of food requests for strays, especially around Greater Kailash 1, CR Park and Safdarjung Enclave. These areas are near hospitals and people are afraid to step out and feed,” says Majid Khan, a resident of Zakir Nagar. Apart from the localities close to hospital, strays near eateries, offices and shopping complexes are most affected as well. A pet parent to two dogs, and a volunteer Parul Taneja from Faridabad says, “The restaurants and markets were shut suddenly, the strays that used to rely on leftover or waste are now either starving or scavenging for food.”Feeders need to be careful about the human-animal conflict and create a safe environment not only for the strays but also folks living nearby. Taneja adds, “Some people who are new to feeding place the food bowls anywhere but it’s advisable to feed them in the particular spots as also recommended recently by Delhi High Court.” Another animal lover, Anuradha Dogra from Animal Hospital and Shelter, NOIDA also highlights that the strays can be territorial of their space. She says, “There can be three packs at one place. Feed them in their designated territory, else it will end up in a clash.”City individuals were further motivated to step up their initiatives with the news of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik sanctioning ₹60lakh to feed stray animals during the lockdown, a police officer, Chiranjeev Sinha, being conferred the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India Award for feeding stray dogs, monkeys and cows during the lockdown, and a video of Subramaniyan Potty S, another police officer, feeding street dogs even during a busy day at work.Dr Vivek Arora, a veterinary surgeon, says one needs to consider the weather before preparing meals for the strays. He suggest, “The next few months are going to be hot, and food should not go stale before the animals eat it. Paneer and curd are better substitute as they take longer to go bad. But if larger groups are to be fed or the strays are far away from the residential complex – buy animal food in bulk from manufacturers as they also have a longer shelf life.” He also advises feeding cucumbers, carrots and frozen watermelon slices that high in water content to bear the scorching heat. Dr Arora also recommends an inexpensive way to help dogs cool down during summer months. He says, “There can be possibilities of heat stroke and non-availability of water, so one can put cloth or jute bags sprinkled with water to provide some comfort.”Dogra also advises placing earthen bowls filled with water and mentions that feeding time should be either early morning or during sunset as the animals stay hidden or burrowed when the temperature peaks.Experts also suggest volunteers to fix a schedule to be able to feed maximum number of dogs and share the responsibility so that not one individual needs to step out during lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-folks-join-hands-to-feed-strays-amid-covid-lockdown-101620987243231.html
14-05-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka Minister bats for continuing lockdown in state to control Covid spike||As Karnataka continues to battle the second wave of Covid-19, Revenue Minister R Ashoka on Friday batted for the extension of the statewide lockdown, aimed at controlling the spread of the virus.He said, the government headed by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa will take a final call, as the current lockdown nears its end.The state is currently under complete lockdown till May 24."As a citizen of Bengaluru my personal opinion is that it is good to continue the lockdown for a few more days. (Number of cases in the city) has come to 15,000 from 22,000 per day, it is about 7,000 cases less now, it is because of semi- lockdown and complete lockdown," Ashoka, who is also the Vice-Chairman of Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority said.Speaking to reporters here, he pointed to long lockdowns implemented in states like Maharashtra and Delhi among others which witnessed the second wave ahead of Karnataka, and said they are a model for us as the number of cases have been coming down."Three days ahead of the current lockdown coming to an end, Chief Minister will call a meeting where we will share our opinion, looking at the figures that day in the state and whether the number of cases have come down because of lockdown, we will take a decision. The CM will take a decision," Ashoka said, adding he will be sharing his opinion at the meeting.Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the Karnataka government that had initially announced 14 days closedown from April 27, it subsequently imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24, amid continued spike in cases.Stating that no one expected a four-fold increase in the number of cases, Ashoka said, experts had said the second wave will be less compared to first wave, there were media reports too and we too had believed it."It is a lesson for us...the government is addressing the difficult situation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and our government are facing the situation with courage and will stand by the people," he said, as he hit out at the opposition for changing their stands on the lockdown.Speaking to reporters in Bagalkote, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol too said that the Chief Minister will take a final decision on continuing the lockdown."The Chief Minister will take a decision after consulting medical experts and doctors in this regard...they will examine the ICMR advice...no decision has been taken yet," he said.Dr.Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has said that lockdown restrictions should remain in place for another six to eight weeks, in all districts where the rate of infection is above 10 per cent of those tested, to control the spread.According to reports, 29 out of 31 districts in Karnataka have Covid positivity rate of over 10 per cent.While the overall positivity rate in the state as on Thursday stood at 27.64 per cent, case fatality rate (CFR) was at 0.97 per cent.Karnataka on Thursday reported 35,297 new cases of Covid-19, and 344 related fatalities, taking the total number of infections to 20,88,488 and the death toll to 20,712.Total number of active cases stood at 5,93,078.Out of the 35,297 fresh cases reported, 15,191 were from Bengaluru Urban alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-minister-bats-for-continuing-lockdown-in-state-to-control-covid-spike-101620986464563.html

The single-judge bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad also posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday (May 18) after Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing for the Delhi police sought time to file reply and argue in the case.“I am persuaded by the reasons given by the trial court which is a valid ground for me not to grant any interim protection now,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said. Previously on Thursday, restaurateur Navneet Kalra moved the Delhi HC for an anticipatory bail in the case after a trial court dismissed it earlier on the same day.ASG Raju opposed any interim relief to Kalra at this stage in the case and said that this is not a case where such protection could be given. He also sought for more time till Tuesday from the court.Also read | Oxygen concentrator case: Delhi court rejects bail plea of Navneet KalraSenior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Kalra, said that the case is a harassment and also noted that the punishment can’t be given as the fixation of price has not been done for oxygen concentrators as essential commodities.Singhvi also said that the police are visiting relatives of Kalra regarding the case. “They are visiting the house of the brother-in -law of the accused. His father in law is separately being paid courtesy calls. The job of the police, influenced by the press, is not this. Today morning SI goes there, Mr. Raju is now asking for time,” Singhvi said.Delhi police on May 7 (Friday) raided two restaurants in the city’s Khan Market area -- Khan Chacha and Town Hall restaurants -- from where 105 oxygen concentrator devices were recovered. Previously, 419 oxygen concentrators were also found at Nege & Ju restaurant in Lodhi Colony and a godown in Chattarpur that belonged to a private company named Matrix Cellular. Navneet Kalra owns the three restaurants that were raided.Demand for oxygen concentrators swelled during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital as many hospitals ran out of medical oxygen. It was also a crucial part of the medical supplies and aids provided by many foreign countries to help India’s efforts against the pandemic.Kalra has been on the run since the equipment were seized from his restaurants, according to the police. Also, investigators have said that they possess evidence to prove that oxygen concentrators, which were bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, were being sold for prices upwards of ₹75,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hoarding-of-oxygen-concentrators-case-delhi-hc-declines-interim-relief-to-khan-market-restaurateur-navneet-kalra-101620984800124.html

If people don’t help each other in such a crisis, they are already dead,” he said. Prajapati said he has now passed an order that the cremation of people who die of Covid-19, whether in hospital or at home, will be carried out by the administration so that no such incident happens again.

The state blood bank at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has only about 700 units left against its usual stock of 2,500 to 3,000 units. With its depleted stock, the hospital is issuing only about 60 units of blood per day against its usual of 200 -250 units of blood daily. “There have been no camps after the first week of April and only a few voluntary donations per week these days,” said prof Tulika Chandra, HoD, transfusion medicine, KGMU.At Syama Prasad Mukherjee (Civil) hospital, there were only 22 units of blood as opening stock on Thursday while at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, the stock was below 300 units against the normal stock of at least over 700 units.Also Read | As Covid second wave persists, MGNREGS comes to rural India’s rescue, yet againExperts say blood donation is safe and can be done by all healthy people. “By donating blood, you get yourself checked for various disorders. From hepatitis to HIV, all infections are checked in the donated blood while it saves lives as blood components such as plasma, platelets, RBC are separated and issued for different patients,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Healthcity hospital.“At the Lucknow Nursing Home Association blood bank, the present stock is 412 against the normal stock of 650 units,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal of the nursing home cell of IMA.“Voluntary blood donation is key to maintaining good stock in the blood bank as replacement donors (who come and donate to get one unit blood or blood component in exchange) do not add to stock and in some exchange donors, the blood has to be discarded due to infection. Whereas, most voluntary donors are healthy,” said Dr Chandra. Also, blood is donated to the destitute and pregnant women without exchange. However, the KGMU blood bank has now made arrangements to ensure that voluntary blood donors can donate blood in the safest environment and with social distancing.It has made a separate entry for such donors and all couches are placed at a safe distance. “Even if ten voluntary donors come to us, they will be on couches with safe distance between them.

Those who have not received their certificates can write to me at dhs.cspk@hry.nic.in. Their issue will be resolved.”Number of vaccination sites reducedFor those above 45 years of age, the number of vaccination sites has been reduced to five in Panchkula district.

The administration’s teams, led by Barnala sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Varjeet Walia, recovered the cylinders from manufacturing units, repair shops and other establishments on Thursday. Also read: Singapore extends life-line to India in oxygen crisisTo increase the number of cylinders at the administration’s disposal for medical purpose, the deputy commissioner has directed that oxygen cylinders cannot be used for non-medical purpose. “Since the district does not have any oxygen manufacturing plant at present, the administration is sending trucks carrying empty cylinders to Mandi Gobindgarh for refilling. The refilling takes up to 20 hours after which a batch of cylinders is back. The daily consumption has risen four-fold in the last two weeks,” Walia said. The consumption of oxygen cylinders in the district has risen from 50 to 200 cylinders a day in the past fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/barnala-admn-takes-over-125-o2-cylinders-in-non-medical-use-101620969177599.html
14-05-2021||Lucknow||This UP village’s first woman pradhan leads Covid fight||Thirty-three-year-old Rita Varma, the newly elected gram pradhan of Kabirpur, a village on the outskirts of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, has hardly had the time to celebrate her win in the recent panchayat elections.In her win, Kabirpur, popularly known as ‘Band Baja Barat’ village for most of its men being members of brass bands which play music at wedding functions, also found its first woman gram pradhan. However, Verma had to hit the ground running as people in this village started falling ill soon after her election. “Soon after election, several people took ill. Many were suffering from fever, but they were hesitant of getting tested for Covid. It was then I started a campaign to create awareness about coronavirus in my village of around 20,000 people,” she says.“I motivated the residents, especially the senior citizens, about the importance of getting tested so that the infection doesn’t spread further, and precious lives are saved. Due to the steps taken, our village is almost corona-free today.”Also Read | All in a day: 58,000 book slots,10,000 skip jabs in Uttar PradeshHer husband, Umesh Kumar Varma, chips in, “I was taken aback when she expressed her desire to contest the election. You may think she is an average homemaker but she has always been vocal about the problems of poor sanitation, roads and lack of health infrastructure in the village. She created awareness about health and hygiene among the women.”Varma got almost 50% votes and defeated the sitting pradhan by a huge margin. From the very next day, she started her campaign to educate villagers about the importance of Covid appropriate behavior. She formed teams in every lane which keep a check on the movement of residents without masks or those violating social distancing.Next on her agenda is opening of primary health centre (PHC) or a dispensary in Kabirpur. “Presently, anyone who falls sick has to go to Gosainganj for treatment. I have written to authorities for the need of a PHC or a dispensary so that people don’t die due to lack of medical infrastructure. Besides, I have formed groups in every lane to make people aware of the importance of lockdown, social distancing and sanitisation during the present testing times. I have also asked for additional sanitation workers to keep the drains and lanes clean. If I don’t get them, we will perform kar sewa to do it ourselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/this-up-village-s-first-woman-pradhan-leads-covid-fight-101620969057504.html

May God bless his soul. He will always be fondly remembered for his contributions to society," Kejriwal said in a tweet.Singh was suspended from the AAP last year after he posted a blasphemous post disrespecting Hindu Gods on Facebook.He later deleted the post after facing backlash on social media. Singh said it was not him but his son who had put the post using his phone."Aam Aadmi Party is a secular party and has no place in the party of anyone who disrespects any religion. The Sikh community is also very sad with his statement because such misfortune against any community is also against the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji (sic)," the AAP had said in a statement.The decision to suspend Singh was taken in the meeting of the party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC).Singh was elected to the Delhi assembly from Rajouri Garden in 2014. He resigned in 2017 to contest the Punjab assembly elections against former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.A former journalist, Singh had first come into limelight in 2009 for throwing shoes at then cabinet minister P Chidambaram during a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jarnail-singh-will-be-remembered-for-his-contributions-to-society-kejriwal-101620962790676.html

They want land near their facility to be handed over for Covid-related infrastructure. The land can be given to government institutions as per the current policy. However, to allot land to private hospitals or institutions, we need a change or relaxation in the rules.”The plots, officials said, will be licensed for six months on subsidised charges.The agency recently decided to hand over community halls and vacant land parcels to set up Covid care infrastructure. These halls are open to government organisations, non-government organisations, institutions, resident welfare associations, among others.A senior DDA official said, “We have been getting requests for allotment of community halls from various authorities. Now, we have identified 46 community halls across Delhi that are to be allotted on request.”As per a policy drafted by DDA, community centres can be used as Covid wards or care centres, outpatient departments, isolation facilities, medical storage facilities, or others.DDA officials said that while the allotment will be done on a first-come first-served basis, priority will be given to government and local bodies in the event of multiple requests for a site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-to-allot-vacant-plots-to-pvt-hospitals-medical-facilities-for-covid-19-care-101620949016892.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi O2 demand down to 582 MT as Covid-19 cases drop||The Delhi government on Thursday said it has scaled down its requirement of medical oxygen from 700 metric tonne (MT) to 582 MT in view of the receding Covid-19 trajectory in the city, with cases and positivity rates seeing a steady drop over the past two weeks, and consequently easing pressure on the Capital’s health care system.The positivity rate – the proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – continued its sharp decline and touched 14.24% on Thursday, the lowest in a single day in a month, or since April 13. A total of 10,489 new cases were reported on Thursday, the lowest daily tally since April 10, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin.“As of today, the positivity rate has come down to 14% and around 10,400 new Covid-19 cases were reported. Now that cases are reducing, we are seeing a decrease in demand for beds and medical oxygen. When daily cases were peaking around 15 days ago, our calculations, factoring in bed occupancy and active cases, showed Delhi required 700MT of oxygen. But today, after assessment of the Covid-19 situation, Delhi’s oxygen need has been revised to 582MT per day,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a press briefing on Thursday.“As a responsible government, we will give the surplus oxygen to the states that need it,” he said.The development comes as the number of active cases in the city dropped to 77,717 on Thursday, the lowest in 24 days. Just 15 days ago, active cases in the city were hovering close to 100,000 mark – the number peaked at 99,752 on April 28, the highest ever recorded in the city. Active cases – those Covid-19 patients under treatment – is a crucial metric representing the region’s battle against the disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system.With active cases soaring, the Capital’s raging fourth wave had sparked a massive health crisis in the city with reports emerging of hospitals running out of ICU beds, and crucial supplies such as oxygen cylinders with the Centre not supplying the demanded quota of 700 MT. Burdened by the massive caseload from mid-April onwards, several hospitals across Delhi sent out distress calls, resorting even to making appeals on social media websites, as their stocks of medical oxygen dwindled rapidly.At the worst of this crisis, only 13.6% of Delhi’s Covid-19 beds were empty (16,942 occupied and 2,666 vacant) on April 20, while six days after that the city had completely run out of ICU beds for general public, according to government data. Currently, of the total 24,418 beds across the Capital, 18,005 are occupied and 6,413 vacant.This led to the Supreme Court initiating suo motu proceedings starting April 22 in order to deal with the Covid-19 emergency, including the shortages of oxygen in regions such as Delhi. During the proceedings over the course of the past few weeks, the apex court directed the Union government to ensure 700 MT of medical oxygen is supplied to Delhi every day. The Centre had consistently claimed that it cannot supply as much oxygen as Delhi wants. But after days of repeated warnings and prodding by the high court as well as the apex court, Centre managed to eventually increase Delhi’s supply – on May 5, Delhi received over 700 MT for the first time.In between, on April 29, the Delhi government had also revised its demand to 976 MT based on future projections as per its bed augmentation plan, but soon reverted to its old demand of 700 MT after the Supreme Court directions.With the situation improving, Sisodia said on Thursday the Delhi government has also written to the Centre about the city’s revised oxygen demand. He thanked the Centre, the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court for coming to the aid of the people of Delhi in times of distress.On an average, Delhi is now getting 579.25 MT oxygen on a daily basis between May 4 and May 11, data showed.At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20, soon after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expanded the night and weekend curfew protocols into a lockdown. That protocol has now been renewed several times and will stay at least till May 17 in order to further flatten the curve.In the past two weeks, however, the situation in Delhi appears to be consistently turning a corner with the positivity rate and new cases dropping at a steady rate. Average positivity rate has dropped more than 10 percentage points in the past 15 days – from 32.9% for the week ending April 28 to 19.7% in the past week. The rate of new infections, meanwhile, has dropped 44% from peak levels – the seven-day day average of new cases have dropped to 14,206 infections a day in the past week against a peak of 25,294 for the week ending April 23.The reduction in the oxygen demand for Delhi also comes days after the Supreme Court on May 8 ordered an audit of supply, distribution and utilisation of oxygen supply in the national capital. The top court set up a panel comprising All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria, Max Hospital’s Sandeep Budhiraja and an IAS officer each from the central and Delhi governments to conduct the audit.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the oxygen crisis should be taken as a lesson learnt and preparations should continue to face potential future waves of Covid-19, particularly by vaccinating as many people as possible.“Oxygen supply and distribution has fairly been sorted for now. Administrations now know the drill about what is to be done when the demand spikes again. But preparations to face the third wave will largely depend on increasing vaccination coverage. The central government should urgently ramp up vaccine production and imports,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-o2-demand-down-to-582-mt-as-cases-drop-101620938857857.html

Prof Harpreet Singh, dean, ICSR&II (IIT Ropar), said, “Usually the wood costs about ₹2,500 for disposing a body. Therefore, the poor end up disposing partially burnt bodies, or even whole corpses in rivers. Also, a typical Hindu cremation in which a body is put on a three-foot high open air pyre can consume more than 400 kg wood to reduce the body to ashes. Now, this can be done with the help of this eco-friendly cremation cart.”The technology is based on Wick Stove, in which the wick when lighted glows yellow and is converted into smokeless blue flames after installing the combustion air system over the wicks.The cart has wheels and can be transported anywhere without much effort. It has stainless steel trays on both sides for an easy removal of ash. The cart is equipped with combustion air for primary and secondary hot air system. Also, it works on temperature above 1000°C that ensures complete sterilisation. Cheema Boilers managing director Harjinder Singh Cheema said, “We are providing the simplest and cheapest way of cremation, which can be performed with half of the wood required and can reduce the carbon footprint by half. This technology can also be used on LPG using domestic gas cylinders. But changing the mindset of people is an uphill task.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iit-ropar-develops-smokeless-cremation-cart-requiring-less-wood-as-pandemic-rages-101620936592973.html

In view of the shortage, the health department had stopped the supply of vaccines to private hospitals on May 3.So far, as many as 6,15,001 people have received the jabs in the district. On May 11, as many as 10,348 inoculations were carried out while on May 10, as many as 9,656 residents received the jabs.Due to the shortage, the health department has also temporarily suspended the online registration sites for vaccination. District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said, “We had been getting repeated complaints from residents that on reaching the vaccination sites, they find out that the vaccine is not available. So, we have temporarily suspended the registration sites.”Dr Juneja also confirmed that the drive has been suspended on Friday. “We are hoping to receive the fresh stock of vaccines by Saturday,” the immunisation officer said.Munish Dogra, a resident who had visited a vaccination site on Thursday said, “As the online registration process was not working, I visited a vaccination site hoping for walk-in registration but the staff there said they had suspended the drive for the day. They were also clueless about when the drive will resume.”Saurabh Sharma, another resident, said, “At a time when people are dying, the health department has run out of vaccine.

Even as paediatricians and epidemiologists have sought exclusive wards for children, senior health department officials claim that they are managing the situation for now and arrangements for separate facilities will be made as and when required.Experts say as the virus has mutated and chances of its further mutation cannot be ruled out, it can affect children in the coming days. “Early preparedness is the need of the hour to prevent Covid-19 mortality in children and for that dedicated level-2 and level-3 facilities should be identified in government and private health care centres,” said a senior doctor. Dr Harshinder Kaur, an associate professor at Government Medical College, Patiala, said, “We have four children in our Covid-19 ward. The virus is attacking children, including newborns. We would need for paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) and neo-natal ICU. But we are not well-equipped to handle such cases.” “We should make arrangements in advance as schools and colleges will reopen. We have not learnt any lesson from the first wave of the pandemic. A neonate and an adult need different levels of oxygen but it is not possible in the same set-up,” she added. Dr Pyare Lal Garg, former registrar, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, said the government should make adequate arrangements in advance to handle the situation. “There is a large young population in Punjab. It is the need of the hour to make arrangements for the second and third wave,” added Garg.Sangrur civil surgeon Dr Anjana Gupta said children are being kept in home isolation when they are found positive. “If needed, we isolate them under the supervision of paediatricians,” she added. Barnala civil surgeon Dr Harinderjit Singh Garg said there is no separate facility for children suffering from the virus in Barnala. “Children will be isolated in the same wards where other Covid patients are getting treatment.”Director (health and family welfare, Punjab) Dr GB Singh said, “We will earmark beds for children if the need arises. But at present, they will be cured in the same isolation centres. We will see if the third wave attacks children,” he added.In Sangrur district alone, 76 children in the 0-10 age group and 342 youngsters aged between 15 and 20 have been tested positive so far this year. Also, a 15-year-old hailing from Barnala district succumbed to the virus at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, last month, health department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-has-no-dedicated-wards-for-children-infected-with-virus-101620936413076.html

14-05-2021||Chandigarh||New Punjab Prison Rules to focus on safe, secure custody of inmates||The Punjab cabinet on Thursday gave its nod to Punjab Prison Rules, 2021, under the Prison Act 1894, thus superseding the archaic and outdated jails manual. The cabinet noted that the provisions of the Punjab Jail Manual, 1996, had become archaic with the passage of time and there was imminent need to update it in the changed scenario of modernisation, prison computerisation and latest laws. The virtual meeting was chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. A spokesperson of the chief minister’s office said the Punjab Jail Manual, 1996, primarily focused more on safe and secure custody of prisoners. The newly drafted Punjab Prison Rules, 2021, lay emphasis not only on safe and secure custody of prisoners but also on other aspects, such as welfare, corrections and aftercare, which have emerged as equally important in modern times. “In order to ensure effective surveillance, safe custody and prevention of escapes, new security parameters have been introduced in the new rules. For lodging of high risk prisoners such as gangsters, drug offenders, terrorists, radicals, etc, ‘prisons within prisons’ - high security enclosures/zones – have been created,” the spokesperson said. The infrastructural requirements of these enclosures have been defined. These shall be equipped with wireless sets, alarm system, dedicated power back up, hand-held and doorframe metal detectors, video-conferencing facilities, closed-circuit TV cameras, X-ray baggage machines, body scanners, and any other modern electronic security devices. A multi-tier security grid has also been placed for better monitoring on the high security zones, according to an official release. For reducing recidivism, ensuring successful rehabilitation and social reintegration of released convict prisoners, a framework for aftercare assistance has been incorporated in the new rules. This will cover many aspects, such as assistance in employment/entrepreneurship, medical treatment, marriage, renting a house, etc. Similarly, various other provisions incorporating use of technology for a more efficient and effective prison administration have been added. On the hardware side, provisions for use of modern security equipment and surveillance gadgets have been made, including artificial intelligence enabled CCTVs, motion sensors, mobile jammers, siren/alarm system, body scanners, X-ray baggage scanners, touch screen kiosks for inmate details, etc. On the software side, provisions for deployment of Prison Management Information System, trial through video conferencing, e-wallet, e-office, e-procurement, Integrated Criminal Justice System (ICJS), etc. have been made. A new provision for a grievance redressal system in every prison, which will provide every inmate the legitimate opportunity to voice his/her grievances, has been incorporated in the new rules. Under this system, compliant boxes shall be installed at different locations in the prison. A provision for electronic communication such as video conferencing has been made so that the inmates can hold face to face interviews with family/friends or legal counsel, according to the spokesperson. The cabinet also gave post-facto approval for the procurement of hospital material and consumables worth ₹152.56 crore by the departments of health and family welfare, medical education and research and police for effective management of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-punjab-prison-rules-to-focus-on-safe-secure-custody-of-inmates-101620935933053.html
14-05-2021||Chandigarh||PU moves high court seeking stay on judgment over senate polls||Panjab University (PU) has approached the high court challenging the judgment which had in March asked the varsity to hold polls within two months. The appeal was taken up by the bench of Justice Ritu Bahri on Thursday wherein appearing for the varsity additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain told the court that on April 16, poll schedule was announced for April 26. Thereafter, this notification was revised and election was rescheduled for May 19. However, Punjab government had put in place restrictions due to Covid-19 situation in which there was a strict provision that not more than 20 people be allowed in any event. A total of 3,75,500 voters are there which are spread across six states and keeping in view the present situation, it is not possible to hold the election, the court was told. Appearing for respondents, senior advocate RS Cheema, too, did not dispute the facts presented by the varsity on Covid situation. The court adjourned the matter till July 8 stating that situation would be reassessed on the adjourned date. It was on March 23 that the high court had criticised the role of PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar and a single judge bench had directed the university to hold senate polls within two months. The high court order came on the plea of seven former senators, who had moved court on December 22, seeking directions to hold governing body polls. The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, had ended on October 31, 2020. Elections were to take place in August 2020, but varsity deferred it citing Covid-19 as the reason for the same. The single judge bench had observed that provisions on governance have been “thrown off to the winds” and university was being run as a “one-man show”. PU in this appeal says the March 23 judgment was not only contrary to facts but also contrary to three division bench judgments of high court wherein decisions on various steps taken in view of pandemic were upheld by the court in the matters of admissions and others. The court was also told that the directions are untenable because the varsity is bound to follow restrictions/prohibitions imposed by the respective states during the pandemic. There is no evidence in entire writ petition as to how a particular person has been unduly benefitted or prejudiced by the varsity decision of deferring polls, the university says, further stating that findings against the vice-chancellor that he appeared to have acted on political considerations are unwarranted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-moves-high-court-seeking-stay-on-judgment-over-senate-polls-101620935812621.html

A helpline number (9577744447) was also issued for booking the free rides.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal had then announced that the senior citizens who had booked vaccination slots could call for the vehicles, which would pick them up from their homes and drop them back after the vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/free-pick-and-drop-facility-to-jab-centres-remains-a-non-starter-in-ludhiana-101620935752826.html

Even pursuing agriculture is a pain, as the fields and houses get flooded during monsoon every year,” said village sarpanch Pal Singh.“The villagers did see a ray of hope when member of Parliament Manish Tewari visited us in 2019 and assured all basic amenities, but nothing has changed even two years down the line,” he added.For even the smallest of ailments, villagers are forced to travel huge distances. “There is no medical facility either in the village or in the nearby areas. When my wife got a fever, I had to take her on my bicycle to the nearest hospital,” said Kashmira Singh, a villager.None of Kashmira’s three daughters studied after Class 10, while his only son also struggled to clear Class 12. Now, his daughters stay home and his son takes up menial jobs.“We have met so many officials for the village’s development, but the government has done nothing to ensure the villagers live fulfilling lives. There’s not even a part-time veterinary doctor to look after our cattle,” said Nirmal Singh, another villager.When contacted, Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain said he will seek a report from the district development and panchayat officer (DDPO) and also visit the village. “The report will help kick-start work on ensuring basic amenities in the village,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-forgotten-200-year-old-mohali-village-is-still-awaiting-21st-century-life-101620935696861.html

The decision was taken during the cabinet meeting, which also approved the purchase of Covaxin for industrial workers, for whose vaccination, the industry has expressed willingness to pay. The state government has ordered only Covishield vaccine so far for the 18-44 age group, but with this decision, decks have been cleared to place orders for Covaxin too, according to an official spokesperson. Reviewing the vaccination status and availability in the state, the cabinet said it was necessary to source vaccine globally. Since the COVAX facility offers the best prices, the state should make an attempt to join the same for procuring vaccines from the international markets, it decided. The suggestion for joining the COVAX was given to the cabinet by Dr Gagandeep Kang, who heads the Punjab Expert Group on Vaccination. COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, abbreviated as COVAX, is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization. Already, about a dozen states, including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi have decided to issue or floated global tenders for procurement of Covid vaccines. In a brief presentation, health secretary Hussan Lal informed the cabinet that of the 30 lakh Covishield doses ordered by the state government, Serum Institute of India (SII) had so far confirmed 4.29 lakh, of which 1 lakh doses had been received. He said that for the 45+ age group, the last tranche of 1.63 lakh doses of Covishield was received on May 9, taking the total to 42,48,560. As many as 3,45,000 doses were given to the armed forces, while the total vaccination utilisation stood at 39,03,560, he added.

The sessions will be visible in the CoWIN portal two days before to each scheduled session. Initially, vaccination sessions will be held on May 17, 20, 24, 27 and 31.The state has received 1,07,620 doses of Covishield vaccine from Serum Institute of India, Pune. Beneficiaries can register themselves and schedule their appointment for vaccination on the CoWIN portal, he said, adding that no beneficiary will be entertained on the vaccination site without an appointment. Registration and scheduling of the vaccination centre and time can also be done through Arogya Setu app.Bank staff, teachers on Covid duty added to priority groups Bank employees, teachers on Covid duty, HRTC drivers and conductors have been included in the priority age group for vaccination. Fuel-pump operators, public distribution system depot holders, chemists, Lok Mitra Kendra staff, employees in Child Care Institutions and workers of the pharma Industry have also been added to the group.Beneficiaries in the priority groups must get themselves certified from the department concerned for vaccination, he said. State failed to take scientists’ warning seriously: CPIM The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM) on Thursday asked the state government to make adequate preparations to combat the virus. “Scientists had forewarned that the new variant was a super spreader. It seems the government and its agencies underestimated and undermined the forewarning and instead adopted the ‘wait and watch’ approach, said CPI(M) state secretary Onkar Shad. “Preliminary analysis of the virus’ behaviour and its socio -economic impact on Himachal indicates that despite the virulent strain, the density of population in the state creates conditions ,in which spread of the virus can be kept under control,” he said. On the state’s high Covid fatality rate, Shad said factors such as delay in medical treatment, the government’s failure to trace and test the infected, an unscientific outlook, fear of being stigmatised, failure to provide uninterrupted supply of oxygen, shortage of staff and scarcity of life saving drugs were responsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/18-vax-come-may-17-himachal-slots-to-be-visible-on-cowin-101620935153670.html

The surging virus cases have hit the pharma hub in Himachal Pradesh’s Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh (BBN) industrial area hard as the cost of raw material has trebled due to the ban on international cargo flights and delayed clearance by China, prompting pharma industry stakeholders to ask the Centre to set up a national-level task force to monitor the prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The issue was raised during Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s meeting with the captains of the pharma industry on Thursday. The industry has asked the state government to relax lockdown to facilitate enhanced production. “We are ready to bear the cost of vaccination. The government should vaccinate the entire industrial work force in Himachal,” said Rajesh Gupta, president, Himachal Pradesh Drug Manufacturers’ Association (HDMA). Industrialists have asked the government to ply buses in industrial areas of Himachal bring back workers. They said that they were willing to bear double the transportation cost for its workforce. Known as ‘Asia’s pharma hub’, due to the large number of pharmaceutical units in the hill-state, Himachal had produced a major chunk of the 50 million hydroxychloroquine tablets shipped to the United States of America during the first wave. Amid nationwide shortage of health infrastructure, Thakur urged the industry to set up manufacturing units for medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators and vylinders. Additional chief secretary industries Ram Subhag Singh said ESI Hospital, Kala Amb, will be inaugurated at the earliest. He said construction of the 220 KV substation at Kala Amb in Sirmour district will also start soon.Director-cum-commissioner industries Hansraj Sharma said, “So far, the state government for ensuring the industry’s production goes uninterrupted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hps-pharma-industry-in-a-fix-amid-labour-raw-material-shortage-101620934972916.html
14-05-2021||Chandigarh||To check misuse of oxygen, Chandigarh begins auditing hospitals||As the demand for oxygen in the city goes up and reports of misuse of medical oxygen pour in, the UT administration has started audits of all private hospitals being provided oxygen from Chandigarh’s quota.The action comes after UT officials discovered that some private facilities were consuming excess quantity of oxygen, with one private hospital reportedly using as many as 400 cylinders per day.Senior doctors from government hospitals had observed that it was almost impossible to consume such a quantity even if all the patients were on ventilators. For managing medical oxygen supply in the UT, they said the consumption of each private hospital will be examined with regard to its capacity and beds reserved for Covid patients.The central government has fixed Chandigarh’s daily quota of medical oxygen at 20 metric tonnes (MT), to be utilised for Government Medical College and Hospital at Sector 32, Government Multi-Speciality Hospital at Sector 16 and the Covid hospital at Sector 48. Private healthcare institutions are also being catered to from this quota. The private facilities are mostly dependent on medical oxygen through cylinders. These are also used in ambulances and while shifting the patients from one ward to another. The nodal officer for oxygen in Chandigarh, Yashpal Garg, in the orders issued for the oxygen audit, said, “Considering acute shortage of oxygen, the distribution of oxygen cylinders has been rationalised and a daily quota has been fixed for each of the private hospitals.”Accordingly, private hospitals have to share information regarding the number of beds and oxygen cylinders procured by them from approved private vendors.Garg has directed the hospitals to provide the information for the period between April 1 and May 5 within three days.Further, a PCS officer, Jagjit Singh, has been assigned the charge to coordinate with the hospitals regarding availability of beds and oxygen supply.The administration has also decided that a team of senior doctors from GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 will visit private and government hospitals to educate and sensitise them on optimum utilisation of oxygen. Garg said a team led by Jagjit Singh on Wednesday had visited Landmark Hospital, Mukat Hospital and Healing Hospital. On Thursday, the team visited the City/Apollo Hospital, Kare Partners Hospital and Santokh Hospital. On May 14, the team is scheduled to visit the Eden Hospital. Next week, the team will also visit the mini Covid care centres and government hospitals, said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/to-check-misuse-of-oxygen-chandigarh-begins-auditing-hospitals-101620934912619.html

14-05-2021||Chandigarh||Shamlat land illegal occupation: Govt losing ₹20 cr yearly as 9,500 acres encroached in Doaba, Majha, says report||The government seems to have turned a blind eye towards illegal occupation of 9,500 acres of shamlat land (village common land) in eight districts of Doaba and Majha regions, which fall under the Jalandhar division. In Punjab, there is around 1.70 lakh acres of shamlat land. The Doaba region has four districts of Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, while Majha has Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts. HT accessed a report compiled by collector, panchayat lands, and divisional deputy director of Jalandhar division, Jagwinderjit Singh Sandhu, which says around 9,500 acres of shamlat land worth ₹2,000 crore is under encroachment with the “connivance” of rural and panchayat development department officials. The report underlines a loss of at least ₹20 crore per annum to the exchequer vis a vis if the government had leased it out as per rules. The report was submitted to additional chief secretary of the department Seema Jain in March this year. Among the eight districts, highest 4,000 acres were encroached in Kapurthala, 1,426 acres in Jalandhar, 1,044 in Amritsar, 926 in Gurdaspur, 701 in Hoshiarpur, 646 in Tarn Taran, 534 in Shaheed Bhagat Singh and 137 in Pathankot districts. On May 12, Sandhu wrote to district development and panchayat officers of Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur, highlighting that around 1,800 acres of common land in their respective districts was under encroachment due to the connivance of department officials. He also directed that in case the encroached land is not auctioned this year or case not filed for removal of encroachment in the collector court, panchayat officers’ responsibility will be fixed. “You are directed to vacate the encroached shamlat land and any delay will be taken as serious lapse,” says the letter. Rural development and panchayat department, director, Manpreet Singh Chattwal, said, “We have directed all our field officers to vacate the encroached panchayat land. We have removed encroachments from panchayat land in almost every block of the state. We have been doing mapping of the panchayat land across the state and will build a consolidated database of the common land.” Additional chief secretary Seema Jain said she has formed a committee under the divisional deputy director of the department, Jalandhar, to examine encroachments and prepare a report within two months. “We will take action on the basis of the report after the approval of rural development minister,” she said, adding the committee will also keep the Punjab and Haryana high court order in mind as per which no eviction can take place till June 30. Rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said the department vacated a large number of encroachments which led to hike in the revenue of the department. Bikkar Singh, general secretary of Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee, said a lobby of politicians, officials and influential people didn’t want encroachments removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shamlat-land-illegal-occupation-govt-losing-20-cr-yearly-as-9-500-acres-encroached-in-doaba-majha-says-report-101620934493810.html

14-05-2021||Lucknow||All in a day: 58,000 book slots,10,000 skip jabs in Uttar Pradesh||The beneficiaries not turning up at Covid-19 vaccination centres after booking slots on the CoWin portal for their jabs have added to the worries of the Uttar Pradesh health and family welfare department.As many as 58,000 people in the age group of 18-44 years registered on the CoWin portal for the vaccination drive organised in 18 districts of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday but only 48,000 of them turned up to get the shot against Covid-19 while 10,000 stayed away, said a health department official.The doses were dispatched to the vaccination centres according to the number of registrations.Additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad said after the second wave, a large number of people wished to get the Covid vaccine to protect themselves and their family members from infection. Many of those who registered on the portal and did not turn up were denying others the chance to get the vaccine. “Medical experts have made it clear that vaccine builds immunity. Even if a person gets infected after getting the dose, the recovery is fast,” he said.With the launch of the vaccination drive for the people in the age group of 18-44 years on May 1, 2.16 lakh people have received jabs in 18 districts of UP so far. The state government has procured three lakh doses of Covaxin and another 3.50 lakh doses of Covishield. The state government is likely to get extra doses from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Pune-based Serum Institute of India on Friday (May 14). The drive for 18+ people will be extended in the remaining districts next week, he said.Director general (Family Welfare) Dr Rakesh Dubey said misconception was being spread on the social media regarding the Covid vaccine even though top medical experts had made it clear that it was safe and the only weapon to fight the Covid-19 infection.“It seems that due to misleading information spread on the social media, young people are shying away from vaccination even after booking slots on the portal. The state government has launched a mass awareness about the utility of the vaccine,” he said.The slowdown in vaccination has been also witnessed among the beneficiaries above 45 years of age after the start of the second wave. Several beneficiaries are not turning up after booking the slot on the portal.Till early April, on average three lakh vaccine doses were given to the beneficiaries daily in the state. On April 12, a record five lakh jabs were given in 75 districts. On April 21, Uttar Pradesh crossed the 1 crore vaccination tally with 92.44 lakh people getting the first dose and 16.89 lakh people receiving the second dose till then. The data released by the health and family welfare department indicates a slump in the daily dose from 3 lakh to 1.50 lakh to 2 lakh doses. Till May 12, a total 1.40 crore people have received the jab in the state. While 1.11 crore got the first dose, 29.35 lakh people received the second one too, said a health and family welfare department officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/58000-book-slots-10-000-skip-jabs-in-up-101620934432028.html
14-05-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu’s oxygen infrastructure to be audited, augmented||Amid spiraling coronavirus fatalities across the Jammu region, the Jammu and Kashmir government has said that it will augment the oxygen generation infrastructure in the division. Apart from the recently commissioned oxygen generation plants, many units are already being installed at different hospitals across Jammu province, an official said, adding that amid the increased demand and augmented capacities, authorities have started a comprehensive audit of oxygen requirement, supplies and availability. 15K LPM plants for GMCH Jammu Secretary tribal affairs and Covid in-charge of containment efforts in Jammu province, Dr Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said the government has sanctioned 15,000 LPM capacity oxygen generation plants for Government Medical College, Jammu, and its associated hospitals against which 6,100 LPM capacity plants have been commissioned in the last two weeks and a letter of intent (LOI) has been issued for 2,500 LPM capacity plants while efforts are on to procure units of other capacities as well. In Samba, Rajouri and Reasi, oxygen generation plants of 1200 LPM, 3000 LPM and 1200 LPM capacities have been approved against which an installation of 1,000 LPM each had been commissioned last week. In Doda, installation of an 750 LPM plant is underway and additional capacity of 2250LPM will be augmented. In Kishtwar, a letter of intent has been issued for 1,500 LPM capacity whereas in Ramban, installation of 1,000 LPM plant has been initiated and a letter of intent issued for another 500 LPM plant. A 2,250 LPM oxygen generation plant has been installed in Kathua while a letter of intent has been issued for installation of two oxygen plants at Poonch and Mandi of 2,200 LPM and 2,00 LPM, respectively. In Udhampur, a 1,000 LPM plant is under installation and letter of intent has been issued for another 2,000 LPM. Chief engineer MED Naresh Khajuria along with technical team are making efforts to ensure timely commission of oxygen generation plants. Dr Choudhary said the oxygen audit will help to peg the requirement at maximum bed capacity of hospitals, corresponding oxygen supply needed, availability of oxygen generation plants, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. The oxygen war room working under supervision of Jammu director industries and commerce, Jammu, Anu Malhotra is operating round-the-clock to ensure minimising turn around of cylinder refill and rushing the supplies to hospitals with equal focus on hospitals in far flung areas. 800 more O2 supported beds added in Jammu The government has added nearly 800 more oxygen supported beds in Jammu in a week to augment the existing bed capacity, as a part of ongoing capacity building of hospitals in wake of rising cases of Covid-19 reported over the last month. Meanwhile, bed capacity in two major private hospitals has been increased by 60 beds. There are now 3,283 oxygen supported beds in Jammu. Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha 6 had set a target of bed capacity enhancement of 1,325 beds, of which 800 has been achieved in a week. As many as 148 beds have been added to Government Medical College, 34 to GMC Kathua, 80 to GMC Doda, 30 to GMC Rajouri, 438 to hospitals managed by the directorate of health services, 30 to ASCOMS Sidhra, 30 to Narayana hospital Katra. Ventilators lying unused in rural areas being sent back to GMCH Jammu Ventilators given to Jammu and Kashmir under the PM CARES Fund, which have been gathering dust in rural hospitals, will now be brought to Government Medical College and Hospital, Jammu for optimum utilisation. Balvinder Singh, a social activist said J&K had received around 400 ventilators under PM CARES Fund and most of them were sent to community health centres, primary health centres and sub district hospitals despite knowing that these institutions do not have the required infrastructure to install these ventilators and make them functional. To run ventilators 24x7 electricity, interrupted oxygen supply, trained technicians and at least two anaesthetists are required. The managing director of Jammu and Kashmir Medical Supplies Corporation Dr Yashpal Sharma has now issued instructions to the health directors to send such unused ventilators from peripheral institutions in rural areas to the government medical college and hospital in Jammu. Since Wednesday around 35 ventilators from rural areas have been sent to GMCH Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammus-oxygen-infrastructure-to-be-audited-augmented-101620934372705.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A tree in the temple||This small Hanuman temple stands in a sprawling yard here in south Delhi. A peepal tree’s sharp-tipped leaves make a jungle of shadows on the temple’s back wall.But the compound has another peepal, a larger one, and more luscious, in the front. Its branches soar above the fourth floor windows of adjacent buildings. It would take at least three people to embrace the trunk completely.This morning the yard is empty. A woman enters. She is wearing a green sari, and an orange mask. Her head is modestly covered by the sari’s pallu. The woman takes off her slippers and, instead of heading inside the temple, she turns towards the front yard peepal. She climbs on to the small cement platform built around the tree. The woman is carrying a small kamandal (cup), filled with water, in one hand, and two agarbattis (incense sticks) in the other. She brings her palms together, bows her head, and murmurs an inaudible prayer. Now she reverently pours the water out of the kamandal by the trunk, lights the agarbattis and tucks them at the base of the tree.“I’m a housewife,” the woman says. Introducing herself as Sunita, she talks of her husband, a priest in a temple nearby. Turning her gaze towards the tree, she cranes her head upwards, as if surveying the thicket of leaves. “Peepal is sacred... I come here every morning for pooja (prayer).” She gestures towards the several red kaleva threads wound about the trunk. Falling quiet for a few moments, she speaks again: “Trees give oxygen.” The fact that so many people in the city have died of Covid due to the shortage of oxygen in the hospitals goes unsaid, but it seems to lurk in the very air.The woman now enters the temple.Meanwhile, the sun’s rays shoot through the tree, get entangled in the dense foliage, and break into several zigzagging streams of light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-tree-in-the-temple-101620934098569.html

For instance, the state blood bank at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has only about 700 units left with it against a normal stock of between 2,500 to 3,000. Due to the lack of stock, KGMU is issuing nearly 60 units of blood per day these days. Normally, it gives between 200 and 250 units of blood every day. “Voluntary blood donation and camps have gown down considerably. In fact, there have been no camps after the first week of April while there are only a few voluntary donations per week these days,” said prof Tulika Chandra, HoD, transfusion medicine, KGMU.At Syama Prasad Mukherjee (Civil) hospital, there were only 22 units of blood as opening stock on Thursday morning while at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, the stock was below 300 units against the normal stock of at least over 700 units.Experts say blood donation is safe and can be done by all healthy people. “By donating blood, you get yourself checked for various disorders. From hepatitis to HIV, all infections are checked in the donated blood while it saves lives as blood components such as plasma, platelets, RBC are separated and issued for different patients,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Healthcity hospital.“At the Lucknow Nursing Home Association blood bank, the present stock is 412 against the normal stock of 650 units,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal of the nursing home cell of IMA.“Voluntary blood donation is key to maintaining good stock in the blood bank as replacement donors (who come and donate to get one unit blood or blood component in exchange) do not add to stock and in some exchange donors the blood has to be discarded due to infection. Majority voluntary donors are healthy,” said prof Chandra. Also, blood is donated to the destitute and pregnant women without exchange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/blood-banks-stock-depleting-as-camps-donations-see-marked-decrease-101620934011984.html
14-05-2021||Other||Record 1031.43 MT of oxygen supplied in UP||A record 1031.43 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen was supplied to medical colleges, hospitals and oxygen refilling centres across UP in the last 24 hours.National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Ayog lauded UP model of oxygen supply. In a tweet, the NITI Ayog said, “The Uttar Pradesh government has established oxygen hubs and developed dashboard–Oxytracker through which tankers can be tracked in real time. This allows quick and smart allocation of oxygen. The result is that 1,000 MT of oxygen has been lifted instead of 250 MT before.”Giving this information, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who is monitoring the oxygen supply across the state from the control room set up in the home department, said with the sudden spike in Covid cases, the state government started working to stabilise the situation as quickly as possible and stop it from getting worse.“Oxygen being one of the most critical elements for clinical treatment had to be managed at a war footing. The state government focused on the most important metric-location of assets and managing the movement of assets to carry as much oxygen as possible with an underlying focus on optimisation,” he said on Thursday.Within 24 hours, the state government activated the teams all over the state and other sourcing states like Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha to intercept the trucks carrying oxygen cylinders, deployed an application that was downloaded on smart phones which were placed in each truck without disturbing its ongoing route for live locations. The GPS device was not used as it would have taken four days to install it and would have meant loss of lives at an exponential scale, he said.Uttar Pradesh worked on stealth approach- speed and scale. Key macro decisions were taken to deploy the rail network to bring oxygen supplies from the eastern states to UP and airlift empty cylinders with the help of the Indian Air Force, using airports located at Agra, Hindon and Lucknow for refilling, Awasthi added.The information of oxygen supply was fed into live dashboard which displayed all the trucks carrying oxygen and helped the decision makers address the allocation gap smartly and swiftly to stabilise the firefight for the oxygen supply, real time information on tankers and their movement being the most critical element of the oxygen supply chain was displayed using the dashboard. The dashboard called Oxytracker was used to visually flag the efficiency of the entire fleet with one sweep of the eye, he said.The UP government created five major hubs in UP— Modinagar, Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi— as primary hubs while Gorakhpur and Bareilly were developed as secondary hubs for optimising the entire oxygen supply chain, Awasthi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/record-1031-43-mt-of-oxygen-supplied-in-up-101620933772548.html
14-05-2021||Chandigarh||Of 4,500 inmates in J&K jails, 23 have tested positive||JAMMUAmid the raging coronavirus pandemic, Jammu and Kashmir has 4,572 inmates lodged in 13 jails, of which 23 have tested positive for the virus. Outgoing DG (prisons)VK Singh said, “Among them 21 are in Kathua district jail, one in Central Jail, Kotbhalwal and one in District Jail Jammu. Necessary medical care is being provided to them.” “At present, 635 inmates are lodged in Central Jail, Srinagar, which includes 27 female inmates. There are no Covid positive cases in the prison,” he said, directing the staff to ensure strict adherence to standard operating procedures to prevent spread of Covid. Singh said, “At present, 219 inmates are under quarantine in prisons across J&K as new prisoners undergo mandatory Covid testing and quarantine for 14 days.” Last year, after a high-powered panel was formed by the Supreme Court to depopulate prisons in view the pandemic, the Jammu and Kashmir prison authorities had released 20 inmates on special parole. “The parole continues. It was extended for eight weeks and we are into seventh and eighth week,” said Singh. DIG Prisons Sultan Lone said, “We have 22 asymptomatic and one symptomatic Covid inmates.” Inoculation to start soon “Initially, there was confusion over inoculating prisoners across India because Aadhaar Cards are mandatory to get the jab. However, the Centre intervened and now they can be inoculated without them. We have written to the state immunisation officer Dr Saleem-ur-Rehman. They will not be taken anywhere and will be inoculated in the prisons,” said Lone. Rehman said though the prisons are overcrowded, all possible measures have been initiated in view of the pandemic. In the Hiranagar sub-jail, which is holding centre for illegal Rohingya immigrants, all 221 inmates have tested negative. Release political prisoners: CPI (M) CPI (M) leader Mohamad Yousuf Tarigami on Tuesday said that Kashmiri political prisoners lodged in various jails within and outside the Valley must be released as unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases across the country has put their lives in congested jails at risk. Supreme Court recently directed the high-powered committees to consider release of new prisoners by adopting the guidelines of the National Legal Services Authority to decongest jails. Hundreds of Kashmiri prisoners, including some teenagers are languishing in jails within and outside J&K for years now. Health conditions of some Kashmiri prisoners, lodged in Tihar and other jails outside the Valley, have deteriorated in recent times and if they are not released it could prove fatal for them due to rising virus cases. Some of them are aged and suffer from multiple ailments. In the absence of proper medical assistance, these prisoners feel helpless and are in distress. It would be prudent to release all prisoners, at least on parole, keeping in view the alarming situation due to Covid-19. There are also prisoners who have minor offences against them and whose detention order has been quashed multiple times by the courts. The Government has failed to prove charges against several people arrested under the Public Safety Act (PSA) and other such laws. They should be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/of-4-500-inmates-in-j-k-jails-23-have-tested-positive-101620933713210.html

If these cargo carriers are originating from outside the state, these may be allowed to enter into the state with a negative RT-PCR test, which will have to be issued from up to a maximum of 48 hours before the time of entry into Maharashtra and which will be valid for 7 days.” mentions the guidelines.All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has stated that the RT-PCR report takes 48 hours and cargo between Delhi takes 72 hours to reach Maharashtra.“The provision must be revisited and rectified in all practicality. It would have been prudent if a rapid antigen facility is created at border check-posts free of cost.

14-05-2021||Mumbai||Second Covid vaccine dose: Maharashtra govt’s first priority||A day after announcing the suspension of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group, Maharashtra inoculated 338,400 people above 45 years on Thursday, as it prioritised administering the second doses for beneficiaries. Amid the delay in supply of doses by the Centre and manufacturers, not only has the inoculation of younger citizens been halted, but it has slowed down for those above 45 years. Of the 338,400 people inoculated on Thursday, 210,040 got their second dose, while 128,360 were given their first shot. The state government on Wednesday suspended the drive for the 18-44 age group, so as to divert the jab to the second doses for those above 45. The state government diverted the vaccines it purchased for the 18-44 age group due to the shortage of vaccines supplied by the Centre for beneficiaries above 45 years.Health minister Rajesh Tope said on Thursday the state has requested the Centre for more vaccines. “We have more than 2 million people due for their second doses. We have diverted around 1 million doses, including 300,000 procured by the state for 18-44 years category, to enable the second dose within the stipulated time. We expect the Centre to supply the additional stock of 1 million doses to make up for the diversion and also supply additional 1 million to ensure inoculation of people waiting for their second shot,” he said. He said the state was not complaining about the short supply by the Centre as they are aware about non-availability of vaccines. “But we expect better management of the jabs by the centre by monitoring the due period of the beneficiaries. The responsibility of providing adequate stock of the vaccine for second doses of 45-plus beneficiaries lies with the Centre. We do not want to politicise the issue, but putting facts in the public domain is necessary,” he said.The health minister said that not only Maharashtra, but even Karnataka, too, was compelled to suspend the third phase drive (18-44 years age group).Though the state government has decided to give priority to the second dose for those above 45 years, many districts administered first doses to the people in the category. “Maharashtra is expected to receive another stock of more than 500,000 doses in a day or two, till which we have stock that can last for two more days. As the Centre has now extended the period of second dose of Covishield to 12-16 weeks from 6-8 weeks, we expect demand for the second jab to reduce a bit,” said an official from the health department. Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said, “About 80% of the doses were used for the second doses for 45+ citizens today. In the next two days, we will further reduce the percentage of inoculation for first dose. Once we get the stock, we can think of resumption of inoculation for the 18-44 age group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-covid-vaccine-dose-maharashtra-govt-s-first-priority-101620933351919.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Protect doctors, staff from assault by kin of Covid patients: HC tells Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the state to furnish details of first information reports (FIR) registered against persons who were guilty of assaulting doctors and other staff amid the ongoing pandemic. The court held it was the responsibility of society and authorities to protect the doctors and other medical service providers who are working tirelessly. The bench also noted that doctors and medical staff should not be made scapegoats for lack of drugs or oxygen not being supplied by authorities.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dr Rajeev Joshi through advocate Nitin Deshpande, was informed of instances of assault on doctors by the kin of patients. The petition stated that Maharashtra witnessed a maximum number of such instances of violence and the government had failed to implement legal provisions including those under Maharashtra Medical Service Person and Medical Service Institution Act, 2010 to curb such incidents.“We have to protect doctors, and medical services providers at this hour, especially when they are tirelessly working for us under stress. As a responsible state, we will fail in our duty if we do not protect them... It is of paramount interest. They are saving society,” observed the bench. Additional public prosecutor Dr FR Shaikh for the state submitted that in cases of relatives or acquaintances of patients assaulting doctors and hospital staff the provisions of the 2010 Act and Indian Penal Code were being applied. The court then asked the state government to comply with the assurance given to the HC in 2016 regarding providing police protection in hospitals and installing CCTV surveillance and directed the state government to inform it about the status of its implementation. The bench also asked the association of doctors and medical consultants to give their suggestions for proper implementation of the said legal provisions and asked the government to respond by May 18.Meanwhile, the court while hearing a PIL filed by Lokshahiwadi Balasaheb Sarode Smriti Prabodhan Upakram through advocates Asim Sarode and Ajinkya Udane which sought proper disposal of medical waste was informed that the state should also be directed to provide special masks for speech and audio impaired people for their identification. The bench then directed the state government to ensure that all district collectors and municipal commissioners observed the proper implementation of disposal of medical waste from Covid-19 related treatment across all hospitals in Maharashtra. The bench stressed the need for authorities to strictly abide by the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board with regards to the disposal of medical wastes. The HC also directed the authorities to formulate a system for the distribution of special masks for speech and audio impaired persons as well as pavement dwellers after the petitioner informed that while the state has claimed that it has arranged for such special masks, there was no distribution system in place. The bench also suggested that it is the right time to implement the Anti-begging Act, to prevent the spread of coronavirus and provide rehabilitation to the beggars.Further hearing of the PILs will take place on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/protect-doctors-staff-from-assault-by-kin-of-covid-patients-hc-tells-maharashtra-govt-101620933291926.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body plans to allot ward wise jab centres to residents||To smoothen the vaccination process, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned to allot vaccination centres to potential beneficiaries, as per their respective civic wards. This, officials said, will help in evenly dispersing the crowd and eliminating serpentine queues outside large vaccination centres. However, this plan will be implemented only after the civic body can procure an adequate number of vials. Civic officials also said ward-wise booking of slots for vaccination will continue via the Co-WIN app, the modalities for which, are yet to be decided.Decentralising immunisation will benefit citizens like 49-year-old Sujata Shah, who travelled 23kms from her home in Borivli to the BKC jumbo centre, to get her second jab, as she couldn’t book a slot at a nearby vaccination centre on the Co-WIN app. She got her first jab at HCG Hospital, Borivli last month. But when she tried to get her second dose, the hospital ran out of vials, which left her with no option but to choose the jumbo centre.“It was my sixth week from the time I took my first shot, so I had to get the second jab at the earliest. Also, as I am a diabetic, I didn’t want to miss my second jab. I ended up spending ₹800 on commute just to get the second vaccine,” said Shah.But not everyone can afford to spend large amounts on the commute to get the vaccine. Additionally, due to the unavailability of vials, people often have to run from one vaccination centre to another, which are kilometres away, despite having an appointment. The differently-abled and bed-ridden patients are most affected.On May 10, Tanmay Roy, 57, had to book an ambulance to ferry his 88-year-old paralysed father from Malad to get him inoculated at Dahisar Jumbo Centre.“I could have taken him to BKC Jumbo Centre but his doctor suggested to get him inoculated at Dahisar Jumbo Centre which remains less crowded. Due to his health condition, he is extremely vulnerable to contracting the infection, so we had to be careful,” he said.Every day, hundreds of probable beneficiaries are facing a similar plight to get immunised in the city. Taking cognisance of the inconvenience that is being caused, the public health department has chalked out a plan to start ward-wise immunisation of their respective residents.“We are planning to allot vaccination centres according to the wards. This will help lessen the burden on other big centres. But to do so, we need to have an adequate number of vials to distribute it among all the 26 wards,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.At present, BMC has 146 vaccination centres across the city. But most of the centres either have an inadequate number of vials or slots for jabs that aren’t available on the centralised Co-WIN app.For instance, Preeti Nihalani booked a slot for her 60-year-old mother at Tata Memorial Hospital for Thursday. But later, she got a message about its cancellation.The BMC on Wednesday floated an expression of interest (EOI) to procure 10 million vaccine doses from vaccine manufacturers abroad. The decision was taken by the civic body on Monday to speed up the vaccination process.“It is a good suggestion to allot vaccination centres ward-wise to its residents. But, BMC will also have to ensure that each of the wards has an adequate number of vials. Otherwise, it may further aggravate the public fury against the corporation if they notice any partiality in the distribution of the vials,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-plans-to-allot-ward-wise-jab-centres-to-residents-101620933171916.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||As bed vacancy goes up, patients from other cities, states travel to Mumbai for Covid-19 treatment||As bed availability in the city has gone up with a decline in daily positivity rate, the city has recorded a rise in the number of Covid-19 patients from other cities and states.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, this is due to the shortage of beds in many states, especially in Northern India.Earlier, of the total patients admitted, 10%-20% were outsiders (non-residents of Mumbai). However, this number has now gone up to 30% with an increase in bed availability, BMC officials said.As per the BMC data, the bed availability ratio was 22% in dedicated Covid hospitals and centres, as of April 7. The availability ratio for intensive care unit (ICU) beds was 6%, 20% for oxygenated beds and 4.95% for ventilators, as of April 7. This went up to 46% vacancy in dedicated Covid hospitals and centres, 10% in ICU beds, 44.94% oxygenated beds and 5.49% in case of ventilators, as of May 12. In this period, there was a significant jump in the capacity of overall beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and centres followed by ICU beds, oxygenated beds and ventilators.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Mumbai has witnessed the trend of non-resident citizens getting admitted in Mumbai since the start of the pandemic. In this, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) tops, wherein citizens from Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan etc are admitted. But infected patients from within and outside states have also been flying to Mumbai for admission, and the inflow has increased by around 10%.Kakani added, “Earlier, we had 10% to 20% patients, from outside Mumbai, admitted in city hospitals, now that figure has gone up to 30%. Among this, many also prefer civic-run SevenHills Hospital.” Further, Bombay Hospital in south Mumbai has also seen an increase in the number of Covid patients coming from outside Mumbai. Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital said, “We are seeing patients coming to Mumbai via air ambulance as there is a shortage of beds in their hometowns. I have got two patients who flew via air ambulance from Delhi two days ago as they were not getting a bed there. I have a patient who came from Jodhpur and got admitted to Bombay Hospital. Apart from this, within the state, too, we see those infected with Covid flying to Mumbai via air ambulance. We are going to treat a patient tomorrow who is arriving from Jalgaon.” The city has over 85,000 beds that include isolation beds in quarantine centres, ICU beds, oxygen beds, ventilators and normal beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and centres.Meanwhile, on Thursday the city reported 1,952 cases and 68 deaths. The city reported a daily positivity rate of 6.31% as 30,884 tests were reported on Thursday. With this, the city’s tally has gone up to 683,185 and death toll has reached 14,040. The city’s fatality rate is 2.05% and recovery rate is 92% with 630,900 recoveries. There are 36,338 active cases in the city. Dharavi — city’s former hot spot — reported nine cases on Thursday, taking its total case count to 6,662.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-bed-vacancy-goes-up-patients-from-other-cities-states-travel-to-mumbai-for-covid-19-treatment-101620933111909.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Maratha community hopeful after Centre files review petition||The decision of filing a review petition in the Supreme Court (SC) has revived the hopes of the members of Maratha community. Maratha community outfits have welcomed the step by the Centre, which has filed a review petition in the SC challenging its verdict over the 102nd Constitutional amendment saying that the amendment has done away with the powers of the state concerning the reservation.“If the top court accepts the Centre’s stand that the power is still with the state, it will open a window for the revival of the reservation. The five-judge bench had quashed the reservation questioning the Gaikwad commission report and also upheld Indra Sawhney judgment’s spirit of not crossing 50% of the cap on the reservation. The report can be still be revised and the reservation can always be accommodated within 50% limit if the SC rules that states have powers. The review petition is a great sigh of relief for us,” said Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha.Public works department minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan has demanded that the Centre should also file a review petition in SC for its verdict on 50% cap. “To save the reservations given by many states by crossing the limit of 50%, the ruling on Indra Sawhney verdict too should be challenged. The Centre should file a review petition over it too. We had pleaded with the Centre on both these aspects even before the final hearing on the reservation began. We are happy that the review petition has come immediately after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led delegation of Maharashtra government met the Governor on Tuesday,” he said.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “The Centre had time and again clarified that the state government’s powers to give reservation were intact and had said this in SC too. The review petition is a reiteration of the stand. A two-judge bench had earlier admitted the stand by the Centre. I am happy that the Central government moved a review petition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-maratha-community-hopeful-after-centre-files-review-petition-101620932932664.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cancelling Class 10 exams against academic interest of students, states PIL||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved in Bombay high court (HC) challenging the state government’s April 2021 order on cancellation of Class 10 exams across all boards, given rising Covid-19 cases in the state. The petition has claimed that the government’s decision was against the academic interest of students and would lead to problems in the admission process for Class 11 as different boards would come up with different formulae for declaration of results without conducting exams. The PIL filed by Pune resident and retired professor Dhananjay Kulkarni through advocate Uday Warunjikar has claimed that the government decision would result in complete absurdity as the unequals would be treated equally if results were based on percentile or best of five formulae. The petition has stated that if the state board for higher and secondary education would conduct the examination for Class 12 which has nearly 14 lakh students across the state there was no justification for cancelling Class 10 exams, which will be given by more than 16 lakh students of the state board and other students belonging to other boards as well. Kulkarni has further submitted in the petition that the decision to not conduct exams for Class 10 would also affect the admissions to diploma courses which have 11.5 lakh seats and will also have an adverse effect on the diploma in pharmacy course. The petition has added that though the state has said that it would come out with a common formula for all boards it is yet to be announced and if the proposal to conduct an entrance test for admission to class 11 could be conducted then there was no harm in conducting the class 10 exams as well. In light of these averments, the petition has sought to quash and set aside the cancellation of Class 10 SSC exams decision of the state government and pending hearing sought a stay on the operation of the decision. The petition has also sought directions to the Centre to conduct class 10 exams across boards with a proper formula to avoid confusion among students. Though the PIL was listed before a bench of HC on Thursday, as it recused the PIL is likely to come up for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cancelling-class-10-exams-against-academic-interest-of-students-states-pil-101620932931941.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to stop vaccination drive for 45+ age group on Sat, Sun||Owing to the shortage of vaccine doses, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to stop the vaccination drive for the 45+ age group on Saturday and Sunday. On Friday, the vaccination drive will be undertaken for four hours, between 1pm to 5pm.According to BMC officials, it plans to vaccinate around 100,000 citizens, who are awaiting their second dose of Covishield and Covaxin, on a walk-in basis for 60+ and specially-abled citizens. However, the decision might change owing to the revised guidelines of administering a second dose of Covishield between a gap of 12 to 16 weeks. The current gap between two doses of the vaccine was six-eight weeks.The civic body had a stock of 100,000 vaccines on Wednesday, but of the same, over 20,000 were used for Thursday’s vaccination drive.Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer said, “Around 80% of the doses were used for administering the second jab for those above 45 years today. In the next two days, we will further reduce the percentage of inoculation for the first dose. We are expecting more stock of vaccine from the Centre tomorrow or day after. The stock currently available with us can last for two more days. Both the manufacturers are expected to supply us stocks against our orders placed for the 18-44 years group. We can then think of resuming the inoculation for 18-44 years. We have not decided any date to continue the suspension of the vaccination for this group, it depends on the availability of vaccines.”On Thursday, 31,377 citizens were vaccinated in the city, of which, 6,541 were between the age group of 18 and 44, 12,184 were between 45 to 59 age group and 10,953 were senior citizens above 60 years of age followed by the remaining healthcare and frontline workers. Overall, 2,817,425 citizens have been vaccinated in the city.Though the civic body has suspended the vaccination drive for the 18 to 44 years of age group to divert the doses for the second shot of the 45+ age group, the private hospitals are continuing to conduct the vaccination drive in the city as they are directly procuring the vaccine doses from the manufacturers. These private hospitals are conducting vaccination for all age groups above 18+ and are allowed to charge.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner said, “We had around 100,000 doses in our stock as of Wednesday and we will continue our vaccination drive with it on Friday too. However, for now, the vaccination for the 18 to 44 age group will remain on hold as we had announced on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-boy-to-stop-vaccination-drive-for-45-age-group-on-sat-sun-101620932811954.html

14-05-2021||Delhi||As kids process grief, Delhi schools lend a hand||From organising online prayer meets for students who lost their parents to Covid to ensuring constant communication with them, schools in the national capital are taking various steps to ensure emotional and mental support for these children to process their grief.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said at least six students in her school have lost one of their parents this month. “These deaths can weigh heavily on the minds of children and there has to be a specialised approach because every situation is different. We have asked teachers to be in touch with these students and their families. Many families are still in shock and we will encourage them to opt for counselling when they are ready,” she said.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales Pusa Road, said the school tries to be the first contact for the child after they receive information of a parent’s death. “We have created WhatsApp groups where teachers inform us if there has been a death of a parent. We first call the immediate relatives of the parent to get stock of the situation there, ask about the child, and assure the family of any assistance they need,” she said.The school then gets in touch with the classmates and their parents to find out the child’s closest friends and establish a peer group. The peer group is then instructed to keep the child engaged and busy through conversation, activities and group phone calls as it is easier for them to talk to someone their age. The school also organises virtual prayer meetings for children and is planning on a “concert of hope”.“We will share photographs of those who have lost their lives to Covid and bring the children together on a platform so that they can share their grief. The death of a parent involves more than mental health issues. Their entire lives will change because of this,” she said.Psychologist Manveen Kaur, who is the counsellor at Amity International School in Saket, said that dealing with death is more difficult with children as they often don’t understand their emotions or are unable to identify or communicate it, leading to behavioural changes.“If grief counselling is not done in the right way, it would have long-term adverse effects like longstanding depression and anxiety in children, trust issues in life and can become a part of their personality,” she said, adding that they are doing family therapy with such children and their immediate family members.“The family members are the immediate contact of the children and need to be counselled on how to behave with them and involve them in daily activities or look for changes in their behaviour,” she said.Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School in Saket, said the school is planning voluntary group therapy sessions where children can share their grief together.Schools are also helping students with other necessities during the pandemic. “From providing cooked meals for the families who tested positive to arranging for medicines, oxygen or cremation facilities, we have a dedicated cell looking into the various needs which came up during the pandemic,” said Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh.Government schools in the capital have also asked their teachers to maintain communication with children and parents despite the ongoing summer vacation. Sarita Batra, principal at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Shalimar Bagh, said the school management committee has also been active in keeping tabs on the children to see if they need any help.“We have been recording motivational stories on fighting these challenging times and sending them to children. Sometimes, we also discuss stories on video conferencing platforms with each section and turn this into a storytelling session, allowing children to express themselves. Our teachers also record voice messages for the children on WhatsApp and motivate them to not lose hope,” she said.The Central Board of Secondary Education also launched a mobile application for students of classes 9 to 12 on Monday to look at the psychosocial wellness of students. The app offers counselling sessions, educational material on social, emotional and behavioural issues such as depression, anxiety over exams and internet addiction disorder, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/from-counselling-to-prayer-meets-schools-in-delhi-go-the-extra-mile-to-ensure-emotional-support-for-students-who-lost-parents-to-covid-101620932092393.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt opens two quarantine centres for unattended, rescued children||The Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) has set up two quarantine centres, especially for children who are either found unattended or rescued by NGOs or police, before sending them to designated child care institutions (CCIs) or children homes.The centres are also catering to children, aged between six and 18 years, whose entire family are down with Covid-19 or are have been hospitalised. The quarantine centre for girls has been set up in a child care home run by an NGO, Butterflies, in south-west Delhi’s village Jaunapur. For boys, the quarantine centre has been set up at the government-operated children home in Lajpat Nagar. Both the quarantine centres became functional this week.Delhi minister for women and child development Rajendra Pal Gautam said the department decided to set up such centres to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among children residing in children’s homes or CCIs across the Capital. “Normally, children found unattended or rescued are directly sent to child care institutions or children’s homes after producing them before district child welfare committees. In the current circumstances, we cannot let new admissions mingle with the children who are already there in the CCIs. Therefore, it was decided to set up these two quarantine centres for children aged between six and 18 years,” he said.The children brought to the quarantine centres will be isolated here for 14 days, following which the department willl conducts their Covid-19 test before transferring them to children’s homes or CCIs. There are 101 children’s homes in Delhi.The two centres are providing all the basic facilities to these children, as any other CCI, and also have a full-time nurse to monitor them. They also have television and indoor games facilities for the residents. The WCD has also roped in doctors to regularly check the children for any symptoms.Currently, there are 11 boys and 13 girls living in the quarantine centres. Yogesh Mishra, in-charge at the Lajpat Nagar centre, said 10 of the boys were rescued by childline workers from railway stations and bus-stands. “Any new child has to undergo an RT-PCR test. We keep them in a separate room till the report comes. In case any child is found Covid positive, he or she is sent to district Covid care facilities. If the report returns negative, they live with other children staying at the facility,” he said.The department has constituted a district task force for Covid-19 positive children, who are in CCIs or whose parents have died due to the virus. Mishra said he also got one such case through the task force wherein an autistic child was found with his unconscious Covid-positive mother in Uttam Nagar last week. “The mother was rushed to a hospital and the child brought here. However, after realizing that he has autism, we had to send him to Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences. His mother passed away at the hospital on Wednesday night,” he said.Officials at the Butterflies child care center in Jaunapur said a majority of girls staying with them have been rescued either by police or the district task force. “Most of these are cases of elopement. They were found unattended either at the railway station or bus stand. We have been maintaining social distancing within the centre as well,” said Mohit Pal, in charge of the facility.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), which is also monitoring these centres, said that it’s also exploring the possibility of setting up full-fledged Covid care centres for children. “We are trying to get at least some beds reserved for children in the existing government Covid care facilities so that in case the situation worsens, the children do not suffer. We are also closely monitoring these two centres and ensuring that they provide all possible facilities so that children do not go through any trauma during isolation,” said Ranjana Prasad, DCPCR member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-opens-two-quarantine-centres-for-unattended-rescued-children-101620932091840.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Process to decongest Tihar prison set off with release of 300 inmates||Delhi’s Tihar jail officials on Thursday started the process of releasing prisoners on interim bail as a measure to decongest the prison complex that is currently at almost double its capacity with over 19,500 prisoners as against sanctioned room for 10,026.The prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, confirmed that the process to release 1,133 prisoners started on Thursday. HT spoke to different jail officers and confirmed that at least 300 prisoners had already been released by 10 pm. The prison authorities are also awaiting the state government’s order to release around 1,000 convicts on emergency parole.“Following a Supreme Court order, the high-powered committee (HPC) has now ordered immediate release of those 1,133 UTPs who were released on interim bail last time (in 2020), and later surrendered with no adverse report. They will be released on the strength of their previous interim bail orders which will be deemed valid again for an interim bail of 90 days. This process is starting today,” Goel said.In March last year, as one of the first measures to decongest the jail in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, around 6,000 prisoners were released on emergency bail and interim parole, and were later directed to surrender on dates decided by HPC, which includes members of the state government, courts, and prison authorities. With cases declining after Delhi’s third wave of the infection in October-November last year, and the prisoners already out of jail for more than nine months, the Delhi High Court in December asked the prisoners to surrender in a phased manner between February and March.Of the prisoners who were released, around 2,300 undertrial prisoners are yet to surrender. Their names have been shared with Delhi Police.“Only those prisoners who surrendered on time and also did not indulge in any unlawful activity have been selected. There are some 350 prisoners who were released last year, but were again arrested for street crimes. They will not be eligible. For the convicted prisoners, we are awaiting the home department’s order for their release. In their case too, only whose who surrendered on time will be eligible,” a prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said.For release on interim bail, HPC has laid down 11 categories of undertrial prisoners -- such as those in civil imprisonment, senior citizens facing trial for offences with a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail, those suffering serious illnesses and are facing trial for offences with punishment ranging from 10 years to life -- who are eligible for grant of 90 days interim bail on furnishing a personal bond.The spread of the infection inside Tihar has been more severe this time compared to the spread during the first three waves of the infection. In February, there was not a single case of Covid-19 among prisoners or jail officials. Even until April 6, the jail had only 19 cases of Covid-19 among prisoners. But in the past one month, Tihar has reported over 300 Covid-19 cases among prisoners. Six prisoners have died of the infection in April and May.Prison officers said the cases are again going down inside the prison. Currently, there are about 100 cases of infection. Underworld gangster Chhota Rajan, who was admitted to AIIMS last month, returned to Tihar on Tuesday after testing negative. Student-activist Umar Khalid, who was kept in isolation after testing positive last month, too, returned to his cell after recovering from the disease.Advocate Ajay Verma, former convenor of National Forum for Prison Reforms, said, “ We had approached the Supreme Court to direct the high-powered committee to decongest the jail by releasing prisoners on interim bail. Only those prisoners who surrendered well on time are entitled. This is a good move by jail officers to immediately release the prisoners . From a safety point of view, it is better for both jail officers and prisoners. The jail has no space for social distancing.

These are prisoners who surrendered on time and did not indulge in any unlawful activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/process-to-decongest-tihar-prison-set-off-with-release-of-300-inmates-101620932032664.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Mosques shut on an Eid without festivity||When Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the shahi imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid, will deliver his Khutbah (sermon) after Eid prayers on Friday, only a handful of people would be listening, unlike the pre-corona times when at least 15,000-18,000 people gathered to offer the namaz in one of the country’s largest mosques.The Jama Masjid will stay shut to avoid crowding in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and only the Imam and the mosque staff will offer namaz inside the Mughal-era monument. Imam Bukhari urged people to stay home and not crowd mosques and markets on Eid-ul Fitr -- the festival that is celebrated on the culmination of the fasting month of Ramzan.“We pray for the well-being of our country and our fellow countrymen. But this time, there will be special prayers for the people who died of Covid-19 and their grieving families and those who are still struggling with this deadly virus. Some of them are from our own families and acquaintances. The situation this time is even worse than last year. The virus is not even sparing youngsters and children… I urge people to stay home and pray for the welfare of our country,” Bukhari said.Similarly, all other big mosques in the city will remain shut on Eid as a lockdown continues to remain in effect to contain the spread of the virus. Only the mosque staff living inside the building will offer the prayer on the premises.This year, for the second time in a row, Muslims will observe the festival at homes with no public prayers, hugs, and dawats (get-togethers).Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Masjid Fatehpuri, said, “In view of the extent of loss around us, this year’s Eid is not about celebration and festivities. It should be observed by helping those in need and praying for those suffering due to this deadly virus. We cannot forget things happening around us and indulge in celebrations. We will also be praying for Palestine (In the backdrop of recent clashes in Gaza).”Several people said that this year, Eid is actually not about celebrations but prayers and atonement. Anas Tanvir, an advocate and founder of the Indian Civil Liberties Union (ICLU), said, “There is nothing to celebrate this year when so many people we know have lost their parents and family members to Covid-19.”Many people also shared their pain of losing their loved ones amid the pandemic and not having them around on Eid, on social media. “My Eid would start with receiving eidi (gifts) from abba and amma, no matter where I was. Now that I have lost both of them, it will never be the same,” Siddiqui Fariqa wrote on Twitter.Several Delhiites have decided to celebrate Eid by helping those in need amid the lockdown. Abu Sufiyan, an old Delhi-based entrepreneur, said he along with a team of volunteers have donated 500 eid kits, containing regular ration and items to prepare Eid delicacies such as sewaiyan, to the poor between Wednesday and Thursday. “We are distributing these kits among those from marginalised sections irrespective of their religion since Eid is for everyone,” he said.Meanwhile, several doctors will spend their Eid while working in Covid wards in hospitals. Dr Kashifa Majeed, 24, an intern at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences & Research said her parents in Jodhpur (Rajasthan) have motivated her to choose duty over festivities this year. “I will be doing night shifts on both Thursday and Friday. My parents said that I am more required here at the hospital right now and we can celebrate Eid next year...There are so many patients at the hospital who would not be able to be with their loved ones on this Eid. At least we can be there for them and cheer them on,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mosques-to-stay-shut-muslims-say-they-will-pray-for-those-affected-by-pandemic-this-eid-101620932033293.html
14-05-2021||Delhi||Central Vista: Lack of labour slows office complex work||The construction of two office complexes that were being built at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue in central Delhi to shift offices from the Central Vista for the ongoing revamp project has been delayed due to a shortage of workers and changes to the buildings’ plans, a senior Central Public Works Department (CPWD) official said on Thursday.CPWD officials said a revised deadline for the two complexes is yet to be finalised.The two complexes, which will house 29 departments, mostly defence agencies, were to be completed by March this year.A senior CPWD official aware of the development said, “There were some changes in the floor plans requested by departments that will shift there, because of which we had to rework the drawings. We were hoping to complete the work by June, but the pace of work has been affected due to a shortage of workers. A large number of labourers have left due to the Covid-19 situation in the Capital and the lockdown.”The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs did not respond to requests for a comment.The lockdown in the city, which was imposed on April 20 to arrest an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths, has seen several migrant workers leave the Capital for their home towns and villages, leading to delays in several infrastructure projects, including the Pragati Maidan revamp, and construction of the Dwarka expressway.The CPWD is building the two office complexes to relocate offices, especially from the hutments around the North and South blocks, to make way for the construction of the Vice President and Prime Minister’s residences, Special Protection Group (SPG) office building, and others, as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project.HT on May 4 reported that the V-P, and PM’s new residences are scheduled to be completed by May and December 2022, respectively, according to the CPWD, the nodal agency for the Vista project, as the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) has granted the necessary clearance for the rest of the buildings under the plan.There was no clarity if the delay in the construction of the two complexes will impact work on the PM, VP’s residences.While the office complex at KG Marg will have three blocks of nine-storeyed buildings (ground plus eight), the one at Africa Avenue will have four blocks of eight-storey buildings.“Work on the buildings is around 65% complete. We were hoping to complete it by June, but it looks difficult now, since we don’t have sufficient labour available. The structures are almost ready. We have to complete the floor-wise work as per the revised plan. Another reason for the delay is trouble getting in the construction material due to the partial lockdowns and labour shortages in other parts of the country,” said the official.A senior CPWD official said a review meeting was held on Wednesday regarding all the agency’s ongoing projects in the country.“We are facing a shortage of workers at all our projects. The shortage varies from 20 to 80%, depending on the site. The problem is less acute at sites where we have on-site labour.”Meanwhile, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), where the three buildings of the new common central secretariat are proposed to be built, is yet to be completely moved to Janpath hotel, its temporary home for next three years. The arts and culture centre was to complete the shifting process by mid-May.“The process got stalled due to the lockdown,” said an IGNCA official. The deadline for completing the shifting process will be revised depending on when the lockdown is lifted, said the official.As for the work related to Central Vista, the CPWD official said that no decision has been taken to revise the deadline of various project components.The entire Vista project is slated to be completed by September 2026.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/central-vista-labour-shortages-delay-work-on-two-new-office-complexes-on-kg-marg-africa-avenue-101620931972480.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||3 held for robbing toll booth attendant in Mumbai||Navghar police have arrested three men for allegedly assaulting an attendant of the Mulund (East) toll booth and robbing money from him on Thursday morning.According to the police, around 9.30am on Thursday, the attendant, Paresh Suryavanshi, was walking towards the MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd office – the firm that manages the toll booth – near the bridge at Anand Nagar to deposit the amount collected at the booth, when a motorcycle approached him from behind. Inspector Ganesh Sanap from Navghar police station said that as restrictions on travel are in place on account of the pandemic, there was less traffic in the morning, taking advantage of which, the robbers attacked Suryavanshi with a wooden stick on his head.“The accused then tried to snatch the box of cash from Suryavashi, but he resisted the attempt, following which the box fell on the road and the cash, worth ₹8,500, fell out of the box,” said Sanap.The accused then picked up the money and fled the spot. Suryavanshi raised an alarm and called the police.Sanap said that after registering the case, they scanned the CCTV footage of the area and noted the number of the motorcycle. “Based on the number plate of the motorcycle, we tracked the three men,” added Sanap.The men – Rahul Rajendra Patre, 23, Sunil Prakash Dhurandhar, 20, and Kailash Chandrakant Thakur, 28 – have been arrested for assault and robbery.The police are now probing the case further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-held-for-robbing-toll-booth-attendant-in-mumbai-101620931671815.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh not to be arrested in atrocities case till May 20: State to HC||In a temporary reprieve for Param Bir Singh, the Maharashtra government on Thursday assured the Bombay high court (HC) that it will not be arresting the former Mumbai Police commissioner in relation to the FIR (first information report) registered against him at Akola on April 13 on the basis of a complaint lodged by a personnel. The case, in which Singh and several others are booked for various offences, including atrocities under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, was later transferred to Thane Police.The division bench of justice PB Varale and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the application filed by Singh’s counsel senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, was informed that the FIR was registered against him as retribution for the grievances and complaints of corruption he had raised against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The application by Singh stated that he was being pressured to withdraw the March 20 letter written by him to the chief minister against Deshmukh, but as he had refused to comply, the FIR was registered against him. In light of this, the application sought an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the “malicious attempts” to pressure him to withdraw his March 20 letter. The application also sought restricting the investigations into the FIR registered against him pending the hearing of the plea in HC, and also to quash the case as it was “wholly arbitrary and illegal” and issued with “sinister motives”. Jethmalani further submitted that as the applicant was apprehending his arrest, he should be protected and no coercive action must be taken against him till the next date of hearing. Senior advocate Darius Khambata for the state informed the court that the government needed time to reply to Singh’s application and assured the court that it would arrest the former Mumbai Police commissioner till the next date of hearing. “The FIR was registered on April 13 and we are now at May 13. He has not been arrested till now,” said Khambata. The court accepted the assurance by Khambata and posted the hearing of the petition to May 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-not-to-be-arrested-in-atrocities-case-till-may-20-state-to-hc-101620931612384.html

The directions were issued after hearing the interim bail application filed on medical grounds by Bharadwaj’s daughter Maaysha Singh. A division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petition filed by Singh, was informed by advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhary that Bharadwaj was being kept in a prison ward with 50 other women and that the conditions were extremely unsanitary and there was no possibility of physical distancing. Chaudhary further submitted that Bharadwaj has comorbidities, and due to issues of overcrowding in the prison amid the Covid-19 pandemic and lack of proper treatment to inmates, the petitioner was seeking the release of her mother on interim bail on health grounds. When the bench asked for a fresh report on Bharadwaj’s current health condition, additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik for the state prison authority submitted that they would take the accused to Sir JJ Hospital on Thursday for a medical examination and submit a report within a week. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) was entrusted with the Elgar Parishad case probe last January. The agency’s lawyer, advocate Sandesh Patil, said that there is no urgency in the matter and that it was unable to file a reply on Singh’s petition within a week due to the pandemic situation. The bench responded, “We understand that officers are working at 15 % capacity. Let us see the medical report first.” The court directed the prison authority to file a report of medical examination by May 17 and it will hear the plea next on May 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-submit-sudha-bharadwaj-s-health-report-by-may-17-bombay-hc-tells-authorities-101620931613126.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Indrani Mukerjea seeks interim bail||Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, recently sought interim bail on health grounds following her Covid-19 after she recovery.The prosecution has submitted a reply opposing the plea.Indrani, who is facing a murder charge for allegedly killing her daughter in April 2012, had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of April. She later wrote to the court from jail seeking interim bail on health grounds.Meanwhile, her regular bail plea is also pending before the Bombay high court.This is her second request for interim bail. Last June, Indrani had sought interim bail due to the spread of Covid-19 in prison. A month later, her plea was rejected by the special CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) court.While refusing to grant her interim bail for 45 days, the CBI court had noted that Indrani is a foreign national, and thus belongs to the category of prisoners which is exempted from getting interim bail. The court also observed that only on the grounds of the spread of Covid-19 in jails, Indrani should not be granted bail. The court had also noted that medical officers are available in the jail and prisoners are well taken care of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indrani-mukerjea-seeks-interim-bail-101620931611792.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar cancels move to hire pvt agency for publicity||Following criticism from the Opposition and on the social media over the decision to spend ₹5.98 crore on deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s social media publicity, the order has now been scrapped. The state government had on Wednesday issued a government resolution (GR), giving its nod to hire a private agency for the publicity of the schemes and decisions by Pawar on social media and increase his outreach.After the media reports on the decision emerged, the Opposition strongly criticised the deputy chief minister for spending such a huge amount on publicity during the pandemic. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader also faced criticism on the social media, following which his office issued a statement on Thursday announcing that the proposal has been cancelled.“The deputy chief minister has directed to immediately scrap the order as he feels that there is no need of appointing a private agency. His office does not feel the need to be active independently on social media as the publicity department of the government is sufficient for it. The office will continue to rely on the publicity department of the government for the communication with media and public. Eyebrows were raised over the order issued yesterday as the deputy chief minister has always believed to be away from unnecessary publicity. He has ordered to cancel the said order,” the statement read.BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said, “After we raised the voice, the deputy chief minister has cancelled the order. It should also be done by the CM too amid the financial crisis in the state during the pandemic.”NCP spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said the proposed expenditure on publicity was very less in the comparison to the money spent by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-cancels-move-to-hire-pvt-agency-for-publicity-101620931551832.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai labs see sharp drop in Covid-19 tests||With the drop in the number of daily Covid-19 patients, government and private laboratories are seeing a 36-50% dip in demand for RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests in May compared to April. Health officials attribute it to the lockdown imposed in mid-April, which restricted movement, and consequently cases and the tests for their close contacts.Amid the spike in cases in April, private laboratories were receiving around 15,000 swab samples daily, which is now down to around 8,000. In the first week of May, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal, too, confirmed the dip. Data from the BMC shows that overall testing in the city has dropped 36% in May – from an average of 43,354 tests a day to 27,798. Chandrashekhar Mani, vice-president (operations), Thyrocare, said, “The demand for testing has dropped by almost 50% this month compared to the previous months. When the second wave started, the state, in a circular, instructed corporate houses to test their employees, which added to the demand for testing. Firstly, they asked for RT-PCR testing, and gradually allowed rapid antigen tests.” Suburban Diagnostics, too, has seen a similar trend. Dr Anupa Dixit, laboratory director of the diagnostic centre, said, “As we have seen a drop in the daily Covid-19 cases, the number of tests has naturally gone down. At present, we are testing 7,000-8,000 samples daily.” Last month, the city broke all records on April 7, with 11,163 new cases, the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic. On an average, the city was recording 6,800 new cases daily. The overall growth rate worsened to 1.91%, with a doubling rate of 35 days. However, as of May 12, the city’s doubling rate has improved to 176 days and the overall growth rate is 0.38%. The daily average of Covid-19 cases stands at 2,100 in May. “In April, our main target was testing as many people as possible. We were tracking 40 close contacts for every patient. On certain days, we even conducted 56,000 tests. But now, the number of daily tests has dropped to around 28,000, as the infection rate has fallen. With this, the need for testing close contacts of patients has also declined,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Public health experts point out that the lockdown has largely contributed to it. “The lockdown has helped control the spread of the virus, thereby bringing down the demand for testing. Also, last month, we were testing all local vendors and roadside stall owners, which has stopped now because of the lockdown,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. On May 5, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) reiterated the guideline that a person who has tested positive for Covid-19 need not undergo another test after completing the mandatory quarantine period or post recovery. Experts believe this may also be one of the contributing factors behind the drop in testing numbers. In April, the labs were overwhelmed with work and faced severe shortage of testing kits, which delayed the reports by more than two-three days. “Now, with fewer samples, most labs are able to give the reports within 36 hours,” said Mani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-labs-see-sharp-drop-in-covid-19-tests-101620931493476.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik questions Centre over use of non-permitted Moderna vaccine||Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Thursday questioned the Central government about how it allowed a non-permitted vaccine to be administered to the residents of France and their relatives who reside in India.Malik in his tweet said “Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V are the 3 Vaccines that are permitted in India by our government. According to information received by me, the French Embassy in India has procured the vaccine @moderna_tx and is inoculating their citizens and their relatives at Navi Mumbai with the help of @ApolloHosMumbai. Question arises, how can a non-permitted vaccine be allowed to be administered? If they can get it, why can’t Indian government get it for our citizens too? The government and the Health Minister @drharshvardhan must clarify.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has termed this a non-issue. “It is the right of every embassy to give whatever vaccine they want to their employees. The state has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which should take action if they want. They just want to divert the topic,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.The state government has been accusing the Centre for vaccination fiasco, saying it was the latter who allots vaccines to states and hence any shortage was its responsibility. State ministers said the Central government was biased against Maharashtra and was not allotting sufficient vaccines to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-questions-centre-over-use-of-non-permitted-moderna-vaccine-101620931371828.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Rural Maharashtra sees more Covid-19 cases compared to urban spots||Maharashtra, which recorded 42,582 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, is witnessing a surge in cases in the rural parts of the state as compared to urban pockets. Both Covid positivity rate and growth rates have increased in rural areas compared to urban centres.Take the case of rural parts of Ahmednagar which reported 2,370 new cases on Thursday, which is 829.41% more compared to cases in the urban parts of the district which stood at 255. Similarly, in Jalgaon, 575new cases were recorded in rural areas whereas 71 new cases came from urban Jalgaon. Solapur rural saw 1,569 new cases while the urban pockets in the district clocked 125 cases. The trend is similar for Kolhapur and Sangli which recorded 1,144 and 1,229 cases in rural areas and 125 and 234 new cases in the urban areas, respectively. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 management, said this trend was witnessed even in the first wave of the virus. “Covid-19 first strikes the urban areas and then slowly spreads to semi-urban and rural pockets,” said Salunke, adding, “There is a huge population living in peripheral areas who come to urban areas for their livelihood. They are the carriers of this virus,” he added.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, blamed the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour among rural masses for the spread of the virus. “You hardly see rural people wearing masks or observing social distancing. In addition, they tend to neglect initial signs of Covid-19 symptoms,” said Shaikh. “Rural health infrastructure is the worst, and we hardly see doctors in many places. These factors aggravate the situation,” he added.In Ichalkaranji, a private hospital was found using a ventilator meant for government hospital and charging fees from patients. In Nashik, police started bashing those roaming or driving without valid reason. In Satara, the local administration has decided to fine citizens ₹500 for roaming without valid reason.Currently, Kolhapur is witnessing a high fatality rate of 3.5%. The Covid-19 task force team visited the city to study the situation and suggested a complete ban on home isolation while beefing up testing facilities in this region. A total of 250,398 tests were conducted across the state on Thursday. The day also saw 54,535 recoveries. The death toll has reached 78,857 with 850 patients succumbing to the virus on Thursday. The total case count in Maharashtra stands at 5,269,292.On Thursday, there were 533,294 active cases in the state. Pune topped with 101,181 active cases followed by Nagpur with 45,996 active cases. In terms of Covid fatalities, Mumbai leads with 14,040 deaths followed by Pune with 10,232 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rural-maharashtra-sees-more-covid-19-cases-compared-to-urban-spots-101620931312271.html
14-05-2021||Pune||Rural Pune hot spots put on alert to control Covid spread||On the evening of May 10, an auto rickshaw with a loudspeaker rode through the Bhigwan village making an announcement that the residents knew was coming: a complete lockdown starting from the midnight of May 12. Bhigwan, a business hub in Indapur tehsil located on the Pune-Solapur highway, and known for its fish market, had just come out of a Janta curfew, which was far stricter than the curbs imposed by the state government on April 15. In this Janta curfew, only medical shops were permitted to remain open. Bhigwan is among the 107 villages of Pune district that were recently put on a first-of-its-kind list brought out by the Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune’s district collector, on May 7. The list categorised the hot spots as “alert” (the caseload was high and not reducing) and “high alert” (the caseload was high and increasing). Bhigwan was among the former and at least 159 villages and/or municipal councils made it to the latter. On May 11, Pune district recorded 7,714 new Covid-19 cases and almost 48% came from villages and municipal councils. Though the state government has imposed strict curbs, at least four of the 15 tehsils in Pune district (Baramati, Bhor, Maval and Indapur) have imposed week-long complete lockdowns last week. “The number of cases has been going down in Pune district. In Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, cases have reduced. But in the rural parts, the number of cases is high. So, containment planning has been done in rural areas. Aggressive testing is going on and emphasis has been given on early detection and isolation. With these measures, cases will come in control in rural areas,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. As cases began to surge in Maharashtra starting February -- it remained the most affected state in the country for most of March and April – the spread of Covid-19 hit both densely populated urban centres as well as rural parts of the state which have little access to health care infrastructure. However, even as cases seem to have come under control in urban centres like Mumbai, the positivity rate in rural parts of the state have shot up in the last few weeks. For instance, rural Pune reported a test positivity rate of 28.07% compared to PMC, the district’s urban centre, which reported 18.18% positivity rate in the week of May 3-9. PMC which has the highest number of confirmed cases in the district started to show a downward trend of positive cases from the third week of April. In the first 12 days of May, 47,542 new positive cases were recorded in rural Pune; by comparison, 32,546 new cases were recorded in PMC and 26,303 new cases recorded in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Even if we were to take recoveries into account, out of 88,851 active cases in the district on May 12, PMC recorded 27,014, PCMC recorded 20,869, while rural parts of the district recorded 39,529. Pandurang Salavade, the sarpanch (village head) of Dorlewadi village in Baramati tehsil (an “alert village”) expressed shock at the severity of the second wave. “There have been 185 cases in Dorlewadi [till date]. During the first wave, we registered 30-35 cases in the village. There were no deaths. This time, there have been 12 deaths, all in May. The entire village is terrified and is seriously following lockdown rules,” he said. Shubhangi Nale is an ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) member in Dorlewadi. One of the tasks assigned to her at the start of the pandemic was to survey 50 families every day to detect early the onset of the Covid-19 infection. She was also tasked to monitor symptoms of Covid patients in home isolation and, since the beginning of this year, to spread awareness about the vaccination drive to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Nale said that last year she didn’t fear for her life, but this time around, the speed at which the infection has spread is terrifying to her. “I have been working as Asha worker since 2009 and it is a completely different experience working in Covid pandemic. I was not scared of working last year. This time I am afraid of the way the virus is spreading. I can’t work from home. I have to go and interact with people. Most of the time we don’t even know that the other person has contracted the virus. I am taking more precaution this time,” Nale said. Many villagers were lax about wearing masks and often visited weekly markets without maintaining physical distance. “It has been a year since the pandemic has begun. Why people haven’t adopted basic behaviour required to fight this disease is beyond me,” Nale said. The health infrastructure in rural parts is under pressure to accommodate the caseload in the second wave. There are 56 hospitals and Covid Care Centres with 2,293 beds (1,190 oxygen beds; 137 ventilator beds), which serve all 14 municipal councils in the district; 138 hospitals with 5,911 beds (1,966 oxygen beds; 188 ventilators beds) must suffice for 1,866 smaller villages. But this isn’t evenly available. Dorlewadi has a population of 6,500. Most households do not have equipment like oxymeters and thermometers and if symptoms are identified, Nale tries hard to convince villagers to get tested. However, for that, they must visit Baramati, six kilometres away as there isn’t a testing centre in the primary healthcare centre in the village. If someone needs to be hospitalized, they must visit Baramati town. The administration has been trying to increase bed capacity and hire more medical professionals in order to improve the quality of treatment. “Our primary aim is early detection and early treatment. With this target we have shown results. We have hired additional medical personnel for Covid duty. We have continued the vaccination drive. There is a plan to build a pediatric hospital in each tehsil. Through CSR, the work to make oxygen plants operational has started at 17 places,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO Zilla Parishad-Pune. Work orders to install oxygen generation plants at 10 hospitals have been issued and ₹50.14 lakh funds have been secured through District Planning Committee funds for this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rural-pune-hot-spots-put-on-alert-to-control-covid-spread-101620931252462.html
14-05-2021||Lucknow||Eid festivities amid pandemic||This is second year in a row that devotees have observed Ramzan under pandemic and will be celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr amid lockdown in their homes. Last year, was a complete lockdown while this year we are in a ‘Corona Curfew’ in Uttar Pradesh. Muslims will be offering prayers indoors and celebrating it with family members while connecting with others on phone and virtually. Corporate professional MA Khan shares that last year, though it was a lockdown, he did observe namaz at iconic Nanpara mosque in small groups but this time prayers will all happen at home only. “People are wary on meeting each other. Some delicacies will be prepared but no socialising. Last year, we packed them and sent to our friends and relatives but this year we won’t do that also. Yes, ‘zakat’ portion has been exceeded and a lot of people are doing the same.” Talking about how things are going to be for her this Eid, researcher and social worker, Prof Qamar Rahman said, “I have lost a nephew to Covid so what celebrations in such times! But still, Eid is all about ‘fitrah’ (charity given on Eid) so it’s ‘wajib’ (mandatory) on all. I along with my foundation members have been doing our bit since Ramzan and provided best we could from distributing food items to money on Eid.” Shia PG Degree College lecturer and patron of art-culture Masood Abdullah said that it’s a tough time, but tradition has to go on. “We will have a simple affair with namaz at our campus Seesh Mahal where 60-odd people live together including tenants. Thereafter, sewain, biryani, kebabs will be prepared for us, specially to give to close relatives who are in grief and are not celebrating due to loss of family member,” he said. Known designer Asma Hussain says it’s difficult to celebrate with so much sadness around. “Celebration this Eid will be only for the purpose to observe as currently we are living in a tough phase where everything is too gloomy. So, no reason to celebrate as we lost close ones, we need to prayer and offer best of help to all in need,” she said. According to fashion designer Umair Zafar the best way to observe Eid is to be with people who need your support in the best of your capacity. “See, as per tradition rituals will happen, some ‘pakwans’ will be made and a video conferencing with family members and friends will take place. But right now need is to help people which we are doing but can’t share about it!” Wazda Arora, owner Quiff Salon, said, “We should all be together and face the challenges as we have to come out of it that will be Eid for me and my family. Faced very tough situations last month now just want all to be well from this Eid onwards.” She looks at the brighter side of things and prays things to get better for all soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eid-festivities-amid-pandemic-101620931193164.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks national policy on vaccine import, asks Centre to buy on behalf of states||Maharashtra has demanded a national policy on import of Covid-19 vaccines to avoid “unhealthy competition” and profiteering by vaccine manufacturing companies from other countries. The state has also requested the Centre to procure vaccines on behalf of all states for fair price and uniformity in scheduling.State health minister Rajesh Tope, along with health ministers from five other states, participated in a video-conference with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Thursday. Maharashtra pressed for a national policy on vaccine import and more vaccine doses for the state for inoculating the second dose to beneficiaries aged above 45 years, Tope said after the meeting. “Almost all the states participated in the interaction sought policy on the procurement of vaccines from other countries. Currently every state is going for global tenders for procurement of vaccines manufactured in other countries amid the shortage. This would lead to unhealthy competition among the states. The vaccine manufacturing companies from other countries will prove to be beneficiaries of the competition among Indian states; they will look at it as an opportunity to earn more profit. Ultimately, the nation will be at a loss. It should be avoided,” Tope said to have suggested to the Centre.The minister said if the Centre floated global tender on behalf of states, India could procure the vaccines at competitive prices. “Intervention by the Centre in this respect is important. It should float a tender on the basis of demand of vaccines by the states, and should also fix the schedule for vaccination of these imported jabs. The Centre can bring clarity on the use of these imported vaccines, their prices and monitoring for states in the framework of the policy,” he said. He further added that the policy would help weed out the confusion among states related to vaccines developed by other countries and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).Maharashtra has also demanded for more vaccines for the state to complete vaccination of more than 2 million people who are waiting for their second dose.It has also demanded curtailment of the maximum retail price (MRP) of Amphotericin B injection which is utilised in treating mucormycosis, a fungal infection among recovered Covid-19 patients. “Maharashtra has around 1,500 such patients who need multiple injections, ranging between 20 and 40, with each costing at ₹6,000. We have demanded that the MRP of such injections be reduced to make them affordable to the patients. The MRP is too high, forbidding regulators to take any action. Similarly, the manufacturing companies of this drug should be asked to ramp up production. We have also requested the Centre to allot us an extra quota of the injections in the ratio of the patients in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-national-policy-on-vaccine-import-asks-centre-to-buy-on-behalf-of-states-101620931132977.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Amid second wave, DGCA mandates breath analyser test for crew, ATCO||Taking into account the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country in the ongoing second wave, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Thursday issued guidelines on breath analyser (BA) tests for airlines and airports across the country. This comes after the Delhi high court (HC) ordered DGCA to issue guidelines stating all requirements and protocols to be followed for administration of BA test. DGCA said a maximum of 5% pilots and cabin crew members will be subjected to random pre-flight BA test on a daily basis, subject to the limit that not more than six people shall be tested in any hour of the day. The aviation regulator also made Air Traffic Controllers (ATCO) subject to random BA test before their daily duty.Pilots from Air India and other airlines had earlier written to DGCA to stop BA tests since they aggravate the risk of getting infected. A senior Air India pilot said, “We wanted the government to stop BA tests completely for air crew, as it was done last year. The effect of the second wave in the country is huge and we are only risking our lives by conducting BA test even on a random basis.” DGCA, however, clarified that the new guidelines are temporary in view of Covid-19 and will remain in effect till three months. The restoration of provisions of Civil Aviation Requirements on this will be reviewed after three months.The regulator clarified that to ensure safety, every aviation personnel reporting for duty is required to submit an undertaking stating that he/she is not under the influence of alcohol and that he/she has not consumed alcohol in the last 12 hours from the time of reporting for duty. DGCA also mentioned that the undertaking must contain a warning that in case of violation of the undertaking, strict action, including off rostering and even suspension, will be taken by DGCA against such an individual. “Cockpit crew, cabin crew and ATCO shall submit the undertaking in the presence of medical staff, and the same shall be captured on camera,” stated the order. Mentioning the measures to be taken while conducting the test, DGCA said the test will be carried out in a bigger and an open area which has CCTV coverage. DGCA asked the doctor/paramedic/EMT/nurse to scan a person for symptoms of Covid-19 before carrying out BA test, and exempt him/her from the test if he is detected with any Covid-19 symptoms. “Such a person will undergo the required examination and will return to duty only after having been declared fit, records of which will be maintained,” the order stated. DGCA further clarified that such cases shall not be treated as missed BA cases.Asking the doctor/paramedic/EMT/nurse to take all precautions, DGCA stated they will have to take a rapid antigen test or any other test for Covid-19 as approved by the respective state government prior to joining the duty for BA testing. “The person doing the BA test should use a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. The person undergoing the test should wash their hands before and after the BA test or use disposable gloves for handling the BA machine. Before every use, BA equipment should be sanitised using UV sterilisers. Integrity and sanitary condition of BA tubes/ mouthpiece should be maintained,” the order concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-second-wave-dgca-mandates-breath-analyser-test-for-crew-atco-101620931131780.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||School fee hike issues resurface: Parents sign online petitions, demand action||With a large number of complaints concerning fee-related issues mainly including the ones related to fee hikes remaining unresolved, parents from the state have now resorted to signing online petitions. Over the last few days, parents from different parts of the state have signed petitions urging the government to address the issues of fee hikes in private schools. Recently, a group of parents from the city started a petition urging the Maharashtra government to reduce school fees by 50% during the pandemic, as the overall cost of operations have reduced due to school closures. “Parents have been protesting against exorbitant and unjustified fees charged by the schools for the year 2020-21 and 2021-22. They have lodged several complaints with the statutory authorities, met the education minister many times to get some concession in fees, but except false promises, nothing has been done till date,” said Jayant Jain, president of the Forum for Fairness in Education, a parents organisation that started the petition. So far, it has been signed by nearly 6,000 parents. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association said the Central government can have a comprehensive policy concerning private school fees. The government should come up with an amendment in the Right to Education (RTE) Act and include a provision for the regulation of fees. It should appoint a committee at the central level (Central fee regulatory committee) and state level (state fee regulatory committee). The committee at the central level should be an appellate body,” she added. A petition demanding the same which was started in 2018 is now doing the rounds on parent groups and is being re-endorsed by parents. Recently, the Maharashtra government had invited suggestions on amending the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. It received 2,825 suggestions, the majority of which are from parents. The government-appointed committee will now be examining the suggestions and will later give its report in this regard.A government resolution released on May 8, 2020, stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26, 2020, in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The court lifted the stay in March this year and said that the state may initiate action against a school in case of complaints from parents or even take suo motu cognizance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/school-fee-hike-issues-resurface-parents-sign-online-petitions-demand-action-101620931072428.html
14-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fraudsters dupe citizens on pretext of selling Covid drugs at cheaper rates||At a time when people are taking to various social media platforms to amplify SOS alerts in order to avail emergency medical help for needy Covid-19 patients, some are taking advantage of the ongoing crisis.The Maharashtra cyber police has launched a probe against some of such elements and registered an FIR (first information report) against unidentified cyber fraudsters who posed as representatives of pharma giant Cipla on social media and duped dozens of people across the country under the pretext of selling Remdesivir and Tocilizumab – two drugs used to treat Covid-19 – at cheaper rates. Cipla, which manufactures and distributes the two drugs in India, approached the Maharashtra cyber police with the complaint on Wednesday.“The company has provided the contact numbers of 38 individuals suspected to be involved in the racket and also details of 40 bank accounts belonging to them, to the police. The accounts are based in New Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal The cyber police started freezing these accounts on Thursday,” said an officer.The racket came to light after the company’s corporate communications team received complaints from the relatives of Covid-19 patients claiming that its representatives had cheated them under the pretext of selling the medicines.Cipla’s manager Vrajesh Bajaj in his complaint stated that the “aggrieved people” informed his company that few people posted mobile numbers on various WhatsApp groups and social media platforms posing as ‘authorised’ dealers of the pharma company. When patients’ relatives contacted on the given phone numbers, the suspects would convey that the injections would be made available on the payment of 50% advance via online transaction. The rest of amount can be paid during the delivery of the drugs, the police said. The company’s corporate communication team was flooded with calls in which many people complained that after receiving the advance money, the suspects stopped responding to calls. Some also said they had received water and fake drugs which displayed the complainant’s company’s name and logo. Many citizens also complained on social media tagging the pharma company.The Maharashtra cyber police then initiated its investigation. “We would soon zero down on the suspects. Details of beneficiary accounts are also being obtained. The investigation is in progress,” said Yashasvi Yadav, inspector general of state cyber police. The police have registered an FIR under the relevant sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Trademarks Act, 1999, and Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.The Union health ministry has directed that the supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab can only be through authorised government and private hospitals and that no individual, distributor or retailer can sell these drugs to the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fraudsters-dupe-citizens-on-pretext-of-selling-covid-drugs-at-cheaper-rates-101620931071864.html
14-05-2021||Gurugram||Vaccinations for 18-44 suspended, 8K doses left for 45+ in Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccinations for people in the 18 to 44 age category will be suspended on Friday as the district health department ran out of vaccine doses on Thursday, officials said. Inoculation of the second dose for those above 45 above will continue, but it is also likely to get affected if the district does not receive fresh stock from the state health administration by Friday night.“Both Covishield and Covaxin stocks for beneficiaries above 18 years are over. Therefore, no sessions have been planned for Friday. Only Covishield shots will be given to those aged 45 and above, waiting for their second shot. If the doses are not allocated tomorrow (on Friday), vaccination for 45 above will also be disrupted,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The district has been facing a shortage of vaccines since Tuesday, when the health department ran out of Covishield doses allocated for the 18-44 age group. Although the state health department provided 4,500 doses of Covaxin, the stock finished on Wednesday, following which the health department collated unused vials of Covisheild from various urban primary health centres. At least 3,982 people took their second dose at government sites and 50 at private hospitals on Thursday.On Thursday, at least 2,279 people in the 18-44 age group took their jabs at government health centres and 371 in private facilities. Only two private hospitals — Fortis and Max — are currently giving shots.“We have already demanded the state health department to provide the stock. We are not sure about the quantity of allocation as there has been an overall shortage,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.According to Singh, there are about 8,000 doses left for the population above 45 years.Earlier on the day, Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Thursday said that the state government will float a global tender for the Covid-19 vaccines to ensure free vaccination for those aged between 18 and 44 years. He had recently said that about 11 million people in the state are in the 18-44 age bracket.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health, said, “In principle, it has been decided to float global tender for vaccines.”Even as the health department struggles with a shortage of vaccines, the health department is holding a drive-through vaccination drive at DLF City Mall on Friday. At least 200 doses will be administered to people above 45 years who are scheduled for their second dose.“It is a trial method as many vaccine beneficiaries have been complaining of getting exposed to coronavirus infection while standing in queues. It will be helpful for the elderly who cannot come directly to the health centres. They can sit in their cars and get vaccine shots. Once we receive enough vaccines, such drives will be held at multiple locations,” said Yadav.The drive is being held in collaboration with Park +, a mobile-based application that offers automated parking solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccinations-for-18-44-suspended-8k-doses-left-for-45-101620927233424.html

According to officials, an FIR has been filed against six persons, including three women from KayaKalp, an NGO. The complaint accuses the six of diverting the state funds. As per the complaint the accused took ₹10,000 out of every ₹15,000 they accessed, on the pretext of paying government officials. Dattawadi police arrested Gauri Gurang (32), a resident of Dhanakwadi; Savita Karishma Lashkare (26), and Sarika Lashkare (30), both residents of Yerawada; Amol Mali (25), and Mahesh Ghadsingh (20). The sixth suspect, identified with a last name as Sonawane, is currently not traceable, said police. “The accused were produced before the court which remanded them to police custody till May 17,” said assistant public prosecutor Kiran Bendhar. The state government had released ₹7.94 crore to be transferred to 5,296 bank accounts belonging to sex workers in Pune based on a Supreme Court order that victims of the flesh trade be compensated by the administration with provision of foodgrains and cash. The court ruled that no documentary proof must be taken from victims while delivering the welfare measures. HT reported that how part of funds went to the bank accounts of women not CSWs, living in Annabhau Sathe nagar, Tarawade vasti, and Mohammadwadi. “The Dattawadi police conducted an inquiry of 75 women and found out that 6,000 sex workers were eligible for the funds. We have spoken to 75 women who were not sex workers and yet, were paid this amount. We are now investigating the list provided by Kaya Kalp to see how many of the women registered are genuine sex workers,” said police inspector Krishna Indalkar, an investigating official in the case. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has also ordered n inquiry under sub-divisional magistrate Santosh Kumar Deshmukh. “I have spoken to 20 of the women that the police inquired into and they all pointed to an individual running an Aids control organisation. We are preparing the data which will be presented to the collector on Monday,” said Deshmukh. Saheli Sangh, an NGO, and the National Network of Sex Workers (India), have meanwhile protested and condemned the corruption. “We have been conducting a rapid assessment survey among the 2,000-odd sex workers in Budhwar peth and so far, we have covered 358 women of which 138 are saying they did not receive the money even after submitting documents,” said Tejasvi Sevekari of Saheli Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-arrest-5-for-misappropriation-of-state-funds-meant-for-csws-101620916130808.html
