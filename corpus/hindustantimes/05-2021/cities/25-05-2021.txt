In the next fortnight, it conducted only 3,658 daily average tests (1,707 RTPCR, 1951 antigen) that yielded 738 average daily cases.Then the target was increased to at least 2,900 daily RTPCR tests and 5,200 daily tests.From May 16 till May 24, it has already conducted 5,228 daily average tests (2,974 RTPCR, 2,254 antigen) tests and returning 329 daily average cases - an average positivity rate (proportion of tests returning positive results) of 6.3%. Currently, the positivity rate in May stood at 10.36%, down from the peak of 19.3% on May 6.“For about a month starting mid-March, we were short on testing kits, which is no longer the case. These numbers indicate that the spread of infection has come down,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “This is primarily due to partial curfew. Early treatment through faster detection also helped.”Initially, the partial corona curfew began at 8pm on April 30 and was due to end at 7am on May 4 but was extended several times. It is now extended to stay in place till 7am on May 31.The officials familiar with the development also said that testing has also been increased in rural areas which was about 26% of overall testing till last week and now it is about 30% at present.“Since the positivity is less in rural areas, increase in testing in such segments will also result in decline in positivity,” the officer added.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a positivity rate of 5% or lower over two weeks to consider the infection under control in a region.“The declining figures indicate that the peak is over. Had the curfew been implemented earlier; it would have reduced number of cases and deaths. The recovery of patients in ICUs and on ventilators is still major concern,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “It is also vital that vaccination is increased and within next couple of months, the vaccination coverage should cover 50-60% of the city population ahead of any probably third wave,” he added.According to state control room records, there were 102 Covid-related deaths during the period starting March till December 31, 2020. But the tally on May 24 stood at 420.He said that in case the government decided to do away with the partial Corona curfew, strict enforcement of Covid protocols should continue.“It is vital that enforcement continues. Otherwise, people will again flout guidelines and it may happen those cases may start to increase again. During the present second wave, the cases spiked at rapid pace and also declining fast,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-ghaziabad-ramps-up-testing-cases-decline-101621967350919.html

Acting swiftly on the message, a group of locals arranged the medicines and drove to Kol’s village to hand them over. A group of locals in Chitrakoot district are using social media to arrange rations, vegetables, medicines and emergency help for people living in tribal pockets of the district. The group began its work when the Covid-19 cases spiked again in late March. With the help of Parhit Seva Sansthan, an NGO, the group arranges help for people living in tribal areas. Anuj Hanumant of Parhit Seva Sansthan said, “We started arranging help for people in April when the government machinery was exhausted with rising number of Covid-19 cases. We started with by delivering dry rations to people in tribal pockets and slowly expanded from there.” Reportedly, the livelihood of the tribals was affected badly due to restrictions imposed in the wake of spurt in Covid-19 cases. To reach out to tribals in need, the group uses social media groups. “As very few tribal families have smart phones, we added as many locals as possible, including businessmen, students and journalists who use smart phones in tribal areas so that they could inform about people needing help,” said Hanumant. “We started with one group which has now expanded to four groups with more than 300 members,” he added. When the group receives a request for help from tribals, it arranges whatever is required and ensures that it is delivered to the family. The group claims to have given food and other help to over 1000 tribal households in the past two months. “We also seek support from the district administration, specially in case of medical emergencies for tribals,” said Anuj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/locals-in-chitrakoot-using-social-media-to-help-tribals-101621966150990.html

While Khan is a police informer with a criminal record, Mukesh Kumar is a Delhi Home Guard personnel, the officer said.The kidnapping came to police’s notice after they received a PCR call on May 15 about a woman waiting in Sarai Kale Khan with ₹1 lakh as ranson money.Her brother was kidnapped and the abductors used his mobile phone to demand a ransom of ₹3 lakh, but the deal was settled for ₹1.8 lakh. But the police call was made before the money could exchange hands.The Sarai Kale Khan police registered a kidnapping case and began searching for Varun. They got the hint of his location after a photo of the kidnapped victim showed police chairs and tables in the background.The police eventually rescued Varun from Jamia Nagar police station where he was allegedly kept captive by the head constable and Khan.What emerged was an unusual story.“Earlier this year, Varun and his associates robbed a person in East Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar. Varun’s share of the loot was ₹1.5 lakh,” said the DCP.One of Varun’s associates, Anubhav, happened to mention this to Khan, who was the head constable’s informer. The policeman and Khan allegedly decided that if they kidnapped Varun, they could recover the robbed money from him and share it among themselves.So, the duo allegedly roped in the home guard jawan Mukesh Kumar in the plan and used his car to carry out the kidnapping.Once the police sorted out the kidnapping case, they also ended up solving the Gandhi Nagar dacoity case, in which a police case was registered earlier but the crime was not cracked. The DCP said that ₹1.4 lakh of that money has been recovered from Varun’s home and a search is on for his associates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/head-constable-dismissed-2-others-held-for-kidnapping-accused-in-dacoity-case-101621966033091.html

In fact, the second wave has exposed the hollow claims of the Haryana government regarding everything being normal and under control. No set Covid protocol was followed and there was persistent shortage of medicines, beds, ventilators and oxygen in hospitals which led to hoarding and black marketing,” the Congress leader said.Dalal alleged that a blunder was committed by the state government when it decided to use industrial oxygen for medical purposes. The outcome has opened Pandora’s box as incidence of new life-threatening diseases such as black fungus have been seen.‘ALLEGATIONS BASELESS, PREPOSTEROUS’Rebutting Dalal’s allegations, a government spokesperson said that the observations made in the representation were baseless and preposterous.“The Haryana government has not only been on its toes right from day one but has also taken a large number of preventive measures in anticipation to avert the catastrophe caused by Covid-19. That is why the fatality rate in state has remained around 1 % and the recovery rate has been around 95%,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said that a provision of 13,949 oxygen beds and 5,350 ventilator beds has been made in state. “Haryana is not only the first state to conduct a door-to-door survey in the rural pockets but the campaign of test, track and treat ensured that the pandemic was contained well in time,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Dalal’s comments regarding use of industrial oxygen were unscientific. “The industrial oxygen was converted to medical grade and then used in hospitals,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalal-seeks-probe-by-commission-of-inquiry-against-bjp-jjp-regime-101621960751502.html

Vij had also said the cost of Coronil kits will be borne by Patanjali and the Haryana government’s Covid relief fund in 50:50 ratio.In a joint statement, head of AAP medical cell in Haryana, Dr Sarika Verma and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta said, “The Drug Council of India has not approved Coronil as a medical treatment for Covid and the government should refrain from wasting taxpayers’ money on it.”The statement said the party will request Vij to make all medical expenditure on the advice of the ICMR. The state government should improve the health infrastructure by increasing the number of tertiary care centres in every district instead of spending it on products which have no medicinal value.“There is shortage of Amphotericin in every city of Haryana.

Several students reported that they are not able to see the internal marks given by the college and practical marks whereas some received a ‘fail’ or an NA’ remark in their mark sheet. This technical snag is affecting their online application for the second semester exams starting next month. “After I completed my exams through the student login id, I tried to check my result, but my college internal marks were not shown on it. Also, at one of the practical subjects it was showing NA, if the practicals are not conducted due to Covid pandemic then why the NA remark is given. It is all confusing for us and I am worried whether I will be able to appear for the next semester exams,” said Pratik Karade, a second year Bachelor of Science student. Currently, the first semester exams are underway where more than 10.5 lakh students are appearing for 3,700 subjects in the online mode. The exam which began on April 10 is being conducted of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) method in online mode. The university’s SPPU Edutech Foundation is conducting the exam. It was instructed to all affiliated colleges of SPPU that they should conduct practicals and internal tests before June 15 and start submitting their marks to SPPU. The results which are declared by SPPU are only showing marks of the written online exams, and before the subjects having practical marks are either showing NA or a fail remark. As the colleges were closed due to the Covid pandemic, no practical sessions were held for students and majority of the colleges have not yet sent their internal marks to the university. “Students are in a state of confusion and also worried about their exams subsequently their future career. Most of the students are now applying for higher studies courses once they finish the second semester the admission process would start. But if they are declared fail or not given internal marks, it will impact on their results and further to get the admissions. This issue is due to the lack of coordination between SPPU and college administrations which needs to be improved,” said Kuldeep Ambedkar, a student and president of Students Helping Hand organisation. SPPU’s examination and evaluation department has given a clarification about the issue saying that these results are temporary and are given only for the reference of the students. “The results which are declared now are temporary results just for the students to know their marks in the online written exams. Once we get the internal marks and practical marks from all the colleges, we will declare the final results of both first and second semester combine. Students need not worry about their results, or any other issue related to the exam,” said Mahesh Kakade, SPPU examination and evaluation department head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-students-panic-after-results-declared-without-practical-grade-101621958950649.html

Mohol has also made a similar request to the Serum Institute of India (SII), to which they have responded, asking the city to get clearance from the central and state governments.In the letter, Mohol stated, “We the representatives of Pune, with the help of the administration, are working hard to supply the necessary medical aid, but as the population of the city is about 50 lakh (5 million), we are running short of the available facilities. The third wave is yet to come and it is forecasted that it will affect the younger generation, and I think this is more serious. Now, we can say that vaccination is the only weapon in our hand to fight against the coronavirus. It is the only antidote available to us to survive. Vaccination drives are being conducted in the city on large scales. But as compared to the population of the city the number of the vaccines we receive, is less and that is why we cannot reach each and every person in the city.”The letter added: “With reference to the above mentioned subject we are in correspondence with Serum Institute of India to provide us at least 25 lakh doses of Covishield vaccines. Pune Municipal Corporation is ready to buy 25 lakh doses of Covishield vaccines and we will be adhering to all the terms and conditions of payments. We are ready to buy vaccines for citizens. The Central Government of India has 50% shares of vaccines produced in India and the State Government and private hospitals the remaining 50 per cent. It is my humble request to you to grant us the permission to buy the vaccines directly from the Serum institute of IndiaReplying to the letter sent by the mayor, SII executive director Dr S S Jadhav said, “Cyrus Poonawala, chairman of Serum Institute, is keen to help the Pune Municipal Corporation. He also wants to give priority to Pune. However, as per the guidelines of the Central Government, the company can only supply vaccines to the Centre, state governments and private hospitals. Therefore, permission should be obtained from the Central Government to supply vaccines to Pune.”Vax on campus @ Magarpatta cityMeanwhile, vaccination for corporates on campus began, with Noble hospital at Magarpatta city. Today, 200 doses of Covishield were given to staff of Magarpatta City, in Hadapsar. “On the first day, 200 vaccine doses were given and gradually the number will increase to daily 1,000 doses. It will also cover the corporate employees and residents inside the city,” said Dr H K Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mayors-letter-to-union-health-minister-asks-for-permission-to-buy-2-5-million-covishield-doses-101621957570571.html

The anticipated third wave of Covid-19 is likely to affect children and also, the upcoming monsoon season puts children at risk for various other infections. Pune district authorities have missed their regular immunisation target for April, given that the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak in the same month. Pune rural has vaccinated about 7% of its target children, while PMC has vaccinated 3% of the target children under the routine immunisation programme, which includes pentavalent, BCG, measles and rubella. District immunisation officer, Sachin Edake said, “We have vaccinated less than the annual target of 8.3% children every month. By the end of March 2022 we should have covered every child for routine immunisation. However, the pandemic, strict lockdown and a fear of stepping out and the hesitancy of parents to bring kids to primary health centres hindered the routine immunisation.” “However now we are planning to create more awareness and open up more immunisation centres so that children are vaccinated. The third wave could hit us anytime and during the monsoon season children fall ill, so it is important to immunise them. In the rural areas about 7% have been vaccinated of the 8.3% target set for each month.”Similarly Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has also fallen back on its routine immunisation as only 3% of its target of 60,900 children for the have been vaccinated. A senior health official at the PMC, requesting anonymity, said, “We have missed our target due to the lockdown and due to the Covid-19 peak. Our own staff was involved in treatment and vaccination process for Covid-19. However, routine immunisation is essential to make sure that we keep other epidemics away. To ensure children are vaccinated with the three most important vaccines in the first 11 months after birth, we may plan to start more immunisation centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-dept-urges-district-authorities-to-ensure-children-do-not-miss-out-on-regular-vaccines-101621956910513.html

Now, again this issue of conducting the exams is going on, due to which students are worried and frustrated,” said Dr Anjali Chaudhary of Sangopan- The Art of Parenting, a child counsellor and parenting coach. “On the other hand, parents are worried about the child’s safety whether to send the child to appear for the exam or not and even their future career with college admissions. More than urban area parents, rural parents are more confused and do not have proper guidance from anyone. This is leading to clashes between parents and children, already from the last 1.5 years the daily routine of children is disturbed, they are not able to spend time with their friends and go outside. Now again the tension of exams to be conducted and in such adverse situation is making them psychologically disturbed,” she added. Last month, the state government cancelled the Class 10 exams due to an increase in the number of Covid cases. While the Class 12 exams were postponed, a petition was filed at the Bombay High Court by professor Dhananjay Kulkarni challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision cancelling the Class 10 board exams this year due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. Even the central education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank along with other senior ministers held a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday regarding conducting of Class 12 board exams in the country. Asawari Chavan a class 10 student said, “I was preparing very hard for my board exams despite the Covid pandemic through my online lectures and taking help from our teachers. I was so excited to appear for the exam, but it got cancelled and disturbed all my plans. Since then, I stopped studying and now suddenly there are news about exams would be conducted again, and now I am worried again. The link of study is gone and due to the tension of Covid infection I cannot concentrate back fully on my study syllabus.” Mahesh Rathi a parent of Class 12 student said, “There is confusion about the exams, safety of students and further admissions in the college. No clear guidelines or instructions are there and we as parents are more worried for our child. It is affecting our entire family, as my son is not able to plan his further career goals and we cannot plan financially for his admission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-parents-face-challenges-due-to-uncertainty-on-board-exams-101621955531712.html
25-05-2021||Ranchi||Cyclone Yaas: Very heavy rainfall likely today; 13 trains cancelled||Strap: Air service likely to be affected; disaster management department asks districts to make alternative arrangements for electricity in hospitals, ensure oxygen back-up  In view of the approaching Cyclonic Yaas, that is likely to trigger very heavy to extreme rainfall coupled with gusty winds in parts of the state on Wednesday, as many as 13 trains that depart or pass through Ranchi railway station have been cancelled, while flight operations from Ranchi airport will depend upon climatic condition of the city on Wednesday, officials said on Tuesday. Besides, the state disaster management has directed districts to make alternative arrangements for electricity at hospitals and ensure oxygen back-up. Districts have also been asked to ensure other modes of communication such as satellite phones and wireless communication system in case mobile communication gets affected due to the cyclone. According to the prediction of the weather department, cyclone Yaas is likely to make landfall around Wednesday noon. However, most parts of the state, mainly southern and central parts, are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall since morning, that will intensify to heavy to very heavy rainfall by evening, weather officials said. Senior public relation officer of South-eastern Railway, Neeraj Kumar, said in view of the cyclone, as many as 13 trains, which depart or pass through Ranchi, have been cancelled till now. Meanwhile, Birsa Munda Airport director Vinod Sharma said they have ensured all precautionary measures for works related to civil, electrical, operation, fire and ATC (air traffic control) departments. “On an average, seven flights are operating currently on a daily basis. If Ranchi doesn’t get much affected by rainfall or high-speed winds, flight operations may remain unaffected on Wednesday. We are also ready for flights in case they are diverted to Ranchi due to the cyclone’s impact,” Sharma said. The state electricity department was also prepared to deal with any imminent damage caused by the cyclone. The department officials said they have distributed electricity poles and wires to all divisions so that power services can be restored at the earliest in case of any damage. Districts that are likely to get affected most by the cyclone have already set up control rooms and made arrangements of temporary shelters. Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC) Chhavi Ranjan on Tuesday held an emergency meeting to chalk out preparedness strategy to deal with the cyclone. The DC said temporary shelters homes have been set up on block level and circle officers have been asked to ensure food and drinking water at the centre. A special team has been set up to deal with any emergency situation and Ranchi municipal commissioner officials have also been directed to be prepared, he said. The DC said oxygen refilling companies have been asked to keep back up oxygen so that patients do not suffer. Similar kinds of arrangements have been made by East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Simdega, Dumka, Dhanbad, Bokaro and other administrations.

25-05-2021||Other||Data analysis of black fungus cases questions blame being put on Covid-19 treatment protocols||PUNE The Pune district health office has analysed 620 reported cases of mucormycosis in the district since December 2020. The analysis shows that in May alone, 538 cases, which account for 91% of the reported cases minus duplications. The analysis also provides insights on the type of treatment these patients received during their Covid-19 treatment. Mucormycosis has become a major challenge for the administration which is now struggling to treat patients for both the infections, mucormycosis and Covid-19. The analysis of all the cases registered on the health office portal gives the number of people who have received steroid therapy and oxygen support, necessary during the treatment of Covid-19. These treatment protocols are now being questioned as possible causes of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis, which is a fungus, has now become a major challenge because of the number of infections reported. The infection is primarily caused due to two reasons; one when fungi enters the body, and second, when immunity is suppressed. There have been demands to study whether contamination of industrial oxygen which is repurposed for medical use could lead to the introduction of the fungus, or if excessive use of steroids during the course of treatment on Covid-19 patients, could lead to suppression of immunity. However, the data analysis of the cases in Pune shows that close to half the number of mucormycosis patients did not receive any steroid therapy, and similarly, close to half did not receive any oxygen support during the course of their Covid-19 treatment. The analysis shows that of the 620 cases, 351 did get steroid therapy, while 269 did not get steroid therapy. Similarly, 302 people did not receive oxygen support prior to the onset of mucormycosis. The data also showed that of the 620 cases, 380 had diabetes. This was followed by 105 who had an immunocompromised status and 69 who had a comorbidity.The district administration, in its report, also stated that due to the duplication of names, about 29 cases have been repeated. Of the total 591 actual cases, 92 are from out of Pune district, like from Ahmednagar (32), Solapur (17) and Satara (17). On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Currently there are 2,245 active cases of mucormycosis in the state and of that, 1,007 are undergoing treatment through the MPJAY scheme. We are also getting 60,000 vials of Amphotericin B injection through a global tender which will reach the state directly by the first week of June.”Dr Halikar Sudhir, ENT specialist from Noble Hospital, said, “I have treated about 40-42 patients for mucor in the second wave alone. In 40 patients I saw that 15 did not report diabetes, while seven-eight were being treated at home so they had very mild to moderate symptoms during their Covid-19 treatment. They required only small doses of steroids and possibly no oxygen therapy. So this entire debate about contaminated oxygen or excessive use of steroids is questionable based on the data from the district administration and my own experience.”“We need to now study that whether this new strain is compromising the immunity of the host to such an extent that the fungus is having a strong impact. This is because we did not see so many cases of mucor in the first wave. Another thing to notice is that mucormycosis is a very commonly present fungus in our homes and even in the hospitals, so the fungus enters everyone’s body; but only those with compromised immunity face severe symptoms. Even among my patients I found that non-diabetic mucormycosis patients had milder symptoms than those who had diabetes,” Dr Sudhir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/data-analysis-of-black-fungus-cases-questions-blame-being-put-on-covid-19-treatment-protocols-101621955530475.html

The two deaths were reported from Patna’s Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), said its superintendent Dr Manish Mandal. He, however, did not share the details of the deceased. All these cases were associated with coronavirus. While some patients had contracted the fungal infection during treatment of Covid-19, many others reported it as a post-Covid complication, said health officials. Bihar reported 3,306 new cases of coronavirus and 104 deaths to the virus on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases so far to 6,95,726 and deaths to 4,746. Even as new infections were down, the number of deaths remained high. The state had reported 111 deaths in a single day on May 18, the highest so far this month. Among the new cases of mucormycosis, 19 were reported at the IGIMS, two at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur, one at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Patna, and seven at different private health facilities across the state, said health officials.

The second wave has also hit the force’s upper echelons and several top officials are in home isolation. Meetings are now being held online. “It’s a worrisome situation for the police department as we are not able to work in a systematic way as we used to because of this virus,” the official said.According to the information obtained from police headquarters, the 33 police persons who died were from various ranks, from inspector to chowkidar. Around 2,400 have been infected in the second wave, of which 150 were hospitalised, some in serious condition. There are around 445 active cases in the state police department. The number of Covid cases among police personnel last year wasn’t immediately available.Bihar Police has a strength of 80,000, including personnel posted in about 1,100 police stations across the state and other police wings such as CID, special branch, STF, Vigilance, government rail police, etc. Additional director general (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, “We have observed that vaccination has been effective in containing infections or its impact on our personnel. We are trying our best to get all our personnel vaccinated as soon as possible. About 90% have received the first dose, and of them, 75% have received the second dose.”Bihar Police Association’s state president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh has requesting the state police chief to make special arrangements for treatment of police personnel and their families.

25-05-2021||Other||HC keeps lens on deaths, state seeks time to compile||PATNAThe Patna High Court, which has been hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid management in Bihar, on Tuesday said it was important that every death, Covid or non-Covid, was reported and documented, as it could go a long way in helping the state prepare for the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Referring to its May 17 order, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar said the official website for death registration must be updated with information compiled from every village, panchayat, block, district or town. Instead of information regarding the infrastructure available in districts, the correct figure of deaths should be reported as it would give an overall view of the ground situation, the bench said.The court also wanted to know if there was only one crematorium at Buxar and why the state’s affidavit was silent with regard to burial grounds. “The affidavit is also conspicuously silent as to how many public functionaries related to panchayati Raj institutions have reported deaths in their respective areas within 24 hours, as directed earlier, and why the official website is not updated. Why it is that the digital India programme is not being put to use in Bihar?,” the court asked, adding if the authorities needed time to compile data, that could be granted for the sake of correct and complete information.The court granted one week to the government for presentation of complete and correct information after advocate general Lalit Kishore said that the chief secretary had directed all the district magistrates for the same and sought 10 days of time. “Till now, the civil surgeon used to inform the health department regarding Covid death figures in his district. Now, after the court direction, the chief secretary has directed the DMs to furnish all death figures, whether they take place in village, panchayat, block or district town, or at home or in hospitals or dedicated facilities. Separate affidavits will have to filed for each district, starting off with Buxar,” the AG said. Earlier, the AG said that due to efforts of the court, things had started improving, with positivity rate dropping to two per cent, recovery rate increasing to 97% and number of active cases coming down to 27,000 in less than two months, while “states like Maharashtra, Gujarat etc, with better medical infrastructure, are still battling the pandemic, though they, too, have witnessed significant improvement in the situation”. The bench said while what the AG’s observation sounded good, the court would not let its guard down and like to maintain the momentum, “as we are preparing ourselves for a situation that may arise six months from now in the form of expected third wave”. “The government’s affidavit says that bed occupancy in hospitals has come down to 50%, oxygen supply has improved and ventilators are available, even if some are non-functional, as reported in newspapers. But the best way we can serve the residents of the state is by coming up with facts and figures. That is why we said Buxar is a test case with regard to reporting and registration of deaths. It is equally important that deaths are reported,” the bench observed. The bench said while the state’s stated policy was “test, track and treat”, what percentage of its population was actually being tested. “If 1.25 lakh tests are being conducted in a state with a population over 10 crore, what percentage it comes to population wise compared to Delhi, Maharashtra or other states? The state is working, but it needs to work more, have more equipment and infrastructure,” it said. The bench was also informed that the state government had withdrawn from the ESIC Hospital, Bihta, where 76 beds were manned by the Army and 50 by the hospital authorities. The court asked if the ESIC hospital under one management would be able to serve better. “Bihta is an important hospital to cater to rural population. With cases of black/white fungus rising, it would require dedicated wards. As is emerging, the cases are rising in rural areas due to indiscriminate use of steroids and drugs by quacks,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-keeps-lens-on-deaths-state-seeks-time-to-compile-101621955350607.html
25-05-2021||Pune||Paper leak case: Lt. Col. Bedi’s police custody extended until May 28||The police custody of lieutenant colonel-rank officer arrested by Pune police from Secunderabad in Army recruitment question paper leak case was extended by a court in Pune on Tuesday.The remand of Lt Col Bhagat Preetsingh Sartajsingh Bedi (44) was extended until May 28 by additional sessions Judge AY Thatte on Tuesday. “He was presiding over the committee that was overlooking the exam procedure. The question paper was of 50 questions. He saw the paper, wrote the 50 questions by hand on a paper, and sent a photo of those hand-written questions to the earlier arrested person,” said public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal. A source close to the investigation revealed that the two may have destroyed both their phones used for the transactions after the police raids. “They have consented to extended custody so there was no argument from our side. They are co-operating with the investigation,” said defence advocate Sudhir Shah. Lt Col Bedi had allegedly sent the questions to a storekeeper from Delhi Cantonment, Vira Prasad Kotiswamy Narnepati (41), who was arrested on May 15. Narnepati’s police custody remand was also extended until May 28 by the same court on Monday. Narnepati revealed that the officer had sent him the paper, according to Laxman Borate, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, Pune police. The police have recovered a blue coloured phone from Narnepati. However, the recovered phone is not the one he used to send the paper to one among the two other people wanted in the case. The person who received it from Narnepati had sent it to the second person wanted in the case. Narnepati had allegedly recived ₹7,00,000 and had paid ₹3,00,000 from it to Lt Col Bedi for the paper and returned ₹4,00,000 to the two others wanted in the case, according to ACP Borate. When the case came to light, the nation-wide recruitment exam was cancelled hours before it was held. “He paid ₹3,00,000 to the Lt Col for receiving the paper but once the police raids were done and exam was cancelled, he sent the remaining money back. All these transactions were in cash,” said ACP Borate. Two separate offences were registered in the matter and a total of 12 arrests have been made so far in the case and after February 28 when the exam was supposed to be held at 40 centres with 30,000 aspirants. One case in the matter is registered under Sections 406, 420, 120(b), and 34 of Indian Penal Code, Sections 6 and 7 of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at University Board and Other Specified Examination Act, 1982; Sections 7, 12, and 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 (2018 Amendment) and Section 66(c) of Information Technology Act at Vishrantwadi police staiton. Another case in the matter is registered under Sections 420, 409, 34 of Indian Penal Code, Sections 6 and 7 of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at University Board and Other Specified Examination Act, 1982; Sections 7, 12, and 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 (2018 Amendment) and Section 66(c) of Information Technology Act at Wanowrie police station. So far, the arrest of one person in both the cases has confirmed any link between the two cases. Two major rank officers, Thiru Murugan Thangavelu (47) and Vasant Vijay Kilari (45), were arrested earlier in the Wanowrie case. The others arrested in the case include Kishore Mahadev Giri (40), Malegaon in Baramati; Madhav Sheshrao Gitte (38) a resident of Sappers vihar colony in Pune; another accused called Bharat Lakshman Adakmol (37) from Pachora, Pune; Gopal Yuvraj Koli (31) a resident of BEG Center in Dighi; and Uday Dattu Auti (23) a resident of BEG Khadki.

In a press release, the Centre also said that the vaccine wastage rate was higher in the government data because of a mismatch, which has now been rectified by the districts.“Haryana health department improved the vaccine wastage data from 6%, as per the data recently released by the Centre to 2-3% (as per recently updated data available with state government). The vaccine wastage percentage was relatively higher in the data released by the Centre as there was data mismatch and the districts have rectified it.” the state government said in its statement on Tuesday.“Haryana had a 6% vaccine wastage of Covieshield and 10.2% wastage of Covaxin. Thereafter the officers of the health department immediately swung into action and identified that there was a data mismatch,” the government further said.Additional chief secretary of health Rajeev Arora said that the health department officials have corrected the data mismatch and “subsequently the wastage percentages dropped from 6% for Covieshield to 3.1% and 10.2% of Covaxin to 2.4%. Thus, the average wastage percentage is between 2-3%,” the statement showed.Earlier on May 11, the Union ministry of health and family welfare in a press release, noted that Haryana, Rajasthan and Assam were the top three states with the maximum wastage. Data from the ministry showed that the wastage was 6.49% in Haryana, 5.92% in Assam and 5.68% in Rajasthan. The ministry also highlighted that Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Punjab, Manipur, Bihar and Meghalaya were the other states which also reported a higher rate of vaccine wastage.In Haryana, 3,270,712 people between 45 and 60 years of age have been given the first dose and 774,105 people in the same age group have received their second. Also, in the 18 to 44 years age group, 4,388,638 first doses and 983,673 second doses have been administered, according to the state government’s data on Tuesday. Also, 3,757 new Covid-19 cases and 95 deaths were reported in the state previously on Monday, a bulletin from the state government showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-vaccine-wastage-rate-improves-in-haryana-average-now-at-2-to-3-says-state-government-101621952802384.html

25-05-2021||Kolkata||‘Storm surge triggered by cyclone Yaas during full moon would inflict maximum damage’: IMD||Storm surge in the sea and rivers triggered by very severe cyclone ‘Yaas’, which coincides with the perigean spring tide of Wednesday’s full moon, would inflict the maximum damage this time, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have warned. “The maximum damage would be caused by the storm surge this time. On May 26, when the cyclone hits, there is also the spring tide. The damage would be the maximum in the coastal districts of East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas,” said Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director general of IMD’s regional office in Kolkata Experts said that the water level in the sea rises at least a metre high during a spring tide, which occurs during a full moon, over a normal high tide that comes every day. The water level is highest during the perigean spring tide when the moon is closest to the earth. “The storm surge triggered by the cyclone at East Midnapore district would be 2m–4m, while in South 24 Parganas it would be 1m–2m. This is over and above the astronomical tide (spring tide),” said Banerjee. Storm surge is the abnormal rise in seawater level during a cyclone. The sea and river level rises and floods the low-lying areas along the banks and coastline. For storm surge, the IMD has issued a red warning, the highest level of warning that calls for taking action, for East Midnapore district. For South 24 Parganas district an orange warning ( officials to remain prepared) has been issuedYaas has already intensified into a severe cyclone and is expected to gather more steam and become a very severe cyclone by Tuesday late night before hitting the Odisha–West Bengal coast somewhere around Balasore on Wednesday noon. “The water level is already high because of the spring tide and that’s more worrying. Sea and river water have gushed into some places along the coast and in the Sunderban delta. Around nine lakh people have already been evacuated,” said Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal. The chief minister said that she, along with top bureaucrats and some cabinet ministers, would stay the night in the control room set up at the secretariat to monitor the storm and the related disaster management work. The IMD has issued a red warning for heavy to very heavy rain for two districts – East Midnapore and West Midnapore and an orange warning (be prepared) for another 13 districts on May 26. Around three lakh government employees, from senior bureaucrats to home guards and civic volunteers, have been deployed for disaster management work and carry out relief work after the cyclone. The Army has been kept on standby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/storm-surge-triggered-by-cyclone-yaas-during-full-moon-would-inflict-maximum-damage-imd-101621952351178.html
25-05-2021||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to stay in control room, to monitor situation closely||As cyclone Yaas is expected to hit the coasts of Odisha and West Bengal later on the afternoon of May 26, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said that she will “monitor the situation closely” in the state from the control room in the secretariat building Nabanna.Chief minister Banerjee visited the control centre established in view of cyclone Yaas earlier on Tuesday, to inspect the preparations in place. “I have spoken to all the DMs on cyclone Yaas. I will stay in Nabanna tonight. I will monitor the situation closely,” news agency ANI quoted the chief minister as saying. The West Bengal state government had set up the control room to monitor the cyclone that is moving towards the state.Earlier on Monday, Banerjee while briefing on the steps taken to handle the situation, said that 4,000 shelters have been prepared and a million people were to be evacuated. “As many as 4,000 cyclone shelters are ready, 10 lakh people [are] to be evacuated. 51 disaster management teams, 1,000 electricity and 400 mobile network restoration teams [have been] formed. 20 districts will be severely affected,” ANI quoted her as saying.On Monday, she also met with the Union home minister Amit Shah over a video conference, in which Shah discussed the preparedness of states expected to be hit by the cyclone. Chief ministers of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh were also present in the meeting. During the meeting Banerjee assured that all steps have been taken to ensure minimal loss to life and property by the cyclone, news agency PTI reported.Alleging that the Centre has been impartial towards West Bengal, Banerjee said that it assured Bengal of all help but earmarked an advance of only ₹400 crore to the state. Following the meeting with the home minister Banerjee said, “At the meeting, I sought to know why Bengal, despite being a bigger state than Odisha and Andhra Pradesh -- both in terms of population density and number of districts -- is getting less? Why are we being deprived repeatedly?" PTI quoted her asking.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in a press release at 1pm on Tuesday said that the severe cyclonic storm Yaas is very likely to further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm in the next 12 hours. “It is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar Island close to north of Dhamra and south of Balasore, during noon of Wednesday, the 26th May as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm,” the weather bureau further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cyclone-yaas-west-bengal-chief-minister-mamata-banerjee-to-stay-in-control-room-to-monitor-situation-closely-101621945864618.html
25-05-2021||Pune||Drive for 18-plus picks up pace at private hospitals in Pune||PUNE Four days after private hospitals in Pune begun vaccination for the 18-45 years age group, scores were vaccinated amid slots booked till Friday in most hospitals.At many hospitals, long queues were witnessed amid youngsters patiently waiting for their turn since morning. So far, at least 18 health facilities in the city have started vaccination with the latest being Deenanath hospital, which is inoculating the 18-45 years age group at Balshikshan school, Mayur colony.Interestingly, some local youths said few hospitals were visited by youngsters from nearby villages or other cities to get jabs. While HT could not independently confirm this, authorities clarified that there are no directions that prohibit people from one part of the district or another to get vaccine dose in other parts.On being asked if those not from Pune are also coming to the city for jabs, Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble hospital, said, “We do not get to know the address of the beneficiaries who come to us. Anyone sitting in Loni or even from a nearby district can book a slot for those getting the vaccine under 18-45 years of age criteria. Mentioning the address is not a mandatory criterion.”Many said they have not been able to book a slot through online registration at private hospitals.“I am trying to get an online slot from last one week in a private hospital but it gets full within seconds when it opens up. There should be an offline registration facility available at the hospital even for the age group between 18 to 45,” said Karan Makwana, an IT professional.The scene was in contrast to one being witnessed earlier this month when many from rural areas complained their jabs are being taken by those living in the city.According to Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall Clinic, around 10,000 people have been vaccinated till now at the private hospitals in Pune.“As few hospitals have got the vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers, each hospital has vaccinated 1,000 to 1,200 people till now,” said Bodamwad, who is also a member of Hospital Association of Pune.While youths from the IT sector are unhappy with the limited slots given for online registration at private hospitals. “I am trying to get an online slot from last one week in a laid private hospital but it gets full within seconds when it opens up,” said Karan Makwana an IT professional.He said the number of beneficiaries getting jabs at private hospitals would have been double if the 18-45 age group would have been allowed on-site registration.On Monday, the Central health ministry enabled on-site registration for the 18-45 years age group on the Co-WIN platform for all government vaccination centres. This was in addition to the facility of online appointments provided for this population group. However private centres will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments.Meanwhile, hospitals including Ruby Hall Clinic, Noble hospital and Sahyadri Hospitals were to start on-campus vaccination from Monday. However, on-campus vaccination for employees of corporates could not start on Friday due to a technical glitch in the portal, hospital authorities said.“Vaccination dry run was carried out today at destination centre inside the Magarpatta City but as we had login issues it didn’t take off. We will be doing vaccination for corporate companies and residential area people possibly from tomorrow.” said Sale from Noble Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/drive-for-18-plus-picks-up-pace-at-private-hospitals-in-pune-101621944611783.html
25-05-2021||Pune||Pune scientists discover new species of multidrug-resistant bacteria from snake||PUNE The city-based scientists along with other experts in the country have discovered a new species of bacteria which are known to resist the approved antibiotics used in the treatment of snake bites. The bacteria was found in the scats or faecal of “vine snake” a green coloured snake commonly found in the northern western ghats. The two species of bacteria have been discovered for the first time, claim scientists.According to these researchers, it is necessary to find out the microorganisms of animal origin which can lead to various human diseases or the next pandemic in future given the current Covid-19 pandemic situation.A team of scientists working from Junnar, Pune and Chandigarh made this discovery which was accepted in February 2021 by “The study” and recently published in the Springer – Nature journal Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek.According to the team, while most of the study for isolation and identification of microorganisms from snakes and other wild animals mainly focus on the oral cavity. But in the present study, the novel microorganisms are isolated from the scat of snakes.RD Chaudhari from the department of zoology and research centre, Shri Shiv Chhatrapati College, Junnar, Pune (SSCC) who first collected the faeces of the snake four years ago, said, “It is a huge discovery and further study is needed. We do not know how harmful this new bacteria or how safe it is. It is resistant to the existing antibiotics we use for the treatment. The most important point is that this bacteria can enter other species not just through snake bites, but also through the faeces of the snake and can be carried through the water flow in the rainy seasons or air.”The faecal microbiome is studied to understand the gut microbes and in this case, also the microbes from the scat may represent the microbes present in the gut of the snake. The role of this microbe in the snake gut needs to be established by further studies. The bacteria reported here comes under the family Planococcaceae. Some species of this family are pathogenic.It is important to identify the bacteria in snakes because they can cause disease. As society develops, the chance that humans have contact with animals decreases; however, the desire of people to interact with animals increases. As a result, several people will come in contact with these bacteria which are opportunistic invaders and may lead to various diseases. Most of the bacterial species isolated from the snakes have public health importance and have been incriminated in human infections worldwide. Some snakes may already harbour these bacterial pathogens from the wild, said the statement issued by National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), which is located in Pune and which also worked in the project and Shri Shiv Chhatrapati College.“Given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, multiple researchers after a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV found that coronavirus might come from snakes. So we need to realise that these microscopic organisms have the potential to cause more such pandemics in future. Hence, nowadays it becomes important to focus on such a study to avoid diseases originating from wild animals,” said Chaudhari.In the present study strain, SN6T and SN6b as novel species of the genus Savagea and the family Planococcaceae are discovered for which the name Savagea serpentis sp. Nov of is given. As these bacteria are isolated from snakes hence the species name serpentine is given. In addition to NCCs and SSCC both of which are located in the Pune district, microbial type culture collection and CSIR Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh also worked on this research.According to the team, the newly isolated bacteria from scats of vine snake are resistant to multiple antibiotics of four different classes that are aminoglycosides including gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, neomycin, and streptomycin, b-lactams including penicillin G, amoxicillin, cephalosporin C, cefoxitin, thienamycin, aztreonam, clavulanic acid; fluoroquinolones including levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, gemifloxacin.. and sulphonamides including sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfisoxazole and others. The most interesting fact mentioned by the team is that other bacteria from the family Planococcaceae are sensitive to several antibiotics including tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin-G, rifampin, streptomycin and others.Further, the team added that there are many bacteria including multi-drug resistant which are present in the snakes leading to wound infections after snake bites. In some serious cases, patients may suffer from cellulitis, tissues necrosis, finger or toe gangrene, and/or extensive necrotizing fasciitis. To avoid such types of infections antibiotic therapy is the only way. It is also mentioned that ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, gentamicin, penicillin and vancomycin are the most frequently prescribed antibiotic after snake bite to control wound infection due to bacterial flora present in snakes. But these newly isolated bacteria are resistant to these drugs which is of serious concern.They further added that a few species and strains of Planococcus have been demonstrated to be pathogenic to other animals. Some species lead to an outbreak of necrotic hepatitis in chickens. Some of the species and strains of Planococcus are found in bronchial biopsy in a child with cystic fibrosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-scientists-discover-new-species-of-multidrug-resistant-bacteria-from-snake-101621944130770.html

25-05-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Games of change to redefine your perspective on garbage||The Zilla Parishad office has asked for suggestions on waste management. I think we need to play some games and conduct some workshops.The first game is Needs and Wants. Imagine that the city is to be evacuated and you have only a few hours to pack essentials. What will you take? Imagine, if you could only take 10 things or five items – what would they be? Do we really need all the things we acquire?The second game is Tales Tails Tell. Take an item, say a pair of jeans and put it on a flat surface like a bed or a table. Then add one or more “tails” behind it, with name cards, to show all the stages of production – from cotton (and water, seeds, fertiliser, pesticides) to cloth production. The metal rivets (mining, ore transport and refining, metal production, rivet production, transport) will be another tail. Add another for the zipper. Combine the tails to the fabrication of the jeans, the transport to the shop and your home. The idea is to realise that each stage produces waste and pollution. What is to be done with the jeans when one longer needs them?The third is the Segregation Game.Make a list of the items of waste produced in your house in a week. Classify each item as dry or wet. Do you already segregate these? Do we need more categories of bins?Red Dot Learn to place diapers and sanitary napkins into paper bags and mark these with a red dot so that waste collectors can safely deposit these for further processing.Experiment When will they degrade? Dig up a patch of soil about four to five inches deep and bury a banana peel, a piece of paper, a bit of plastic. Check on them after a couple of weeks and a couple of months. Wash before you bin Many people order food and dump the containers with leftover food right into the trash. It’s an invitation to flies, cockroaches, rats and ants. A little care to rinse out the food containers will help to keep your home more hygienic and improve the work conditions of those who have to handle the waste.Then we should have projects for the entire family and online workshops for each ward or neighbourhood. One, on how to set up a compost unit and another on how to set up a rooftop garden, where you can use the compost and also, keep your roof cool, and get some fresh veggies and herbs. How about a craft workshop to convert coconut fibre into kitchen scrubs, and coconut leaf fronds into brooms? Arrange a V-Collect Mela every few months to give away clothes, toys, electronics and household items you don’t need. Play SimCity in real life with a neighbourhood walk and a map to plan area-level waste management. The aim will be to place material recovery units, biochar units, and storage space for construction and demolition debris to be used when needed.Now is a good time to slow down and think these things and the materials in our lives. How would they continue their journey in the earth’s natural cycles once their productive life in our homes is done? When life was simple, we would classify waste as wet and dry, and be done with it. Dry waste included paper, plastic, metal, glass and wet waste, was just veggie peels and leftovers. For many years now, we use complex materials. Some packages lay aluminium and plastic to hold chips, while others pack paper and aluminium to hold liquids like milk or juice. Napkins and diapers are not made of cotton but layers of plastic with super absorbent polymer. Suitable solutions to manage complex wastes need some whole-of-system innovations, from producers to consumers to recyclers. We need to be smart with the materials we use and the systems we set up. Neighbourhood-scale, decentralised and humane methods of waste management that can function even during lockdowns. Collection of household waste should be done with non-polluting handcarts and wheelbarrows, avoiding trucks on diesel.We can start by working with the city and the Zilla Parishad to shift to Zero Waste. Each house or society should set up an individual or collective compost unit, keep dry waste clean and give to waste collectors for recycling; keep sanitary waste separate and mark it with a red dot; promote re-use of household items with V-Collects; and support safe working conditions and fair wages for waste collectors who help everyone lead a healthier life. Note: The ZP needs to strengthen the Covid Waste collection and management system too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-games-of-change-to-redefine-your-perspective-on-garbage-101621942693992.html
25-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC asks state to apprise on preventive measures against black fungus, issues notice||Concerned over the rapid rise in the cases of mucormycosis (black fungus), the Rajasthan High Court has issued a notice to the state government to inform it about the preventive steps being taken to deal with the disease, HT has learnt.The division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice MK Vyas passed the order while hearing a PIL filed by advocate Siddhartha Jain. The petition stated that the black fungus infection or mucormycosis mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens. While it is very rare, it can lead to the loss of the upper jaw and sometimes even the eyes. The second surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country has been more devastating than the first. Before the pandemic like Corona was over, another pandemic called mucormycosis (black fungus) took birth, which has hit more than 500 people in Rajasthan.Counsel for the petitioner Chitrank Sharma told the court that in view of the increasing cases of black fungus, the Rajasthan government has placed orders for the purchase of about 2,500 injections of Liposomal but mucormycosis patients have to take about 40 or more than 40 injections and it costs about 4-5 lakhs for the treatment. Due to this, many people were not able to get treated and lost their lives.“Due to the pandemic of black fungus, hundreds of people are facing innumerable problems in these challenging times, a major one of them is not getting proper treatment because of shortage of beds, medical oxygen, ventilators and medicinal drugs in the hospitals. Several people of the state are unable to get proper treatment or even basic medical care and the treatment of the black fungus pandemic is very costly,” he added.The petition has urged an increase in the availability of medicine and to provide appropriate medical facilities to the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-hc-asks-state-to-apprise-on-preventive-measures-against-black-fungus-issues-notice-101621942271039.html

And in one such unique initiative to support the cause, Patna-based artist Rajni Ranjan is using her creativity to educate the masses, one nail at a time.Ranjan, a professionally trained beautician and a self-taught freehand nail artist, recently posted pictures of her art that shows portraits of a nurse inoculating a patient painted on nails along with precautionary messages. She captioned the photo, “Let’s get your weapon and get armed to fight against this evil... Get vaccinated get shielded.”The 26-year old who aims to spread Covid-19 vaccination awareness with her innovative skills says, “I pick topical causes, newsy events and even festivals to spread the message through this medium of mine, and vaccination awareness is important in the present situation.”Ranjan also created another artwork thanking actor Sonu Sood for his exemplary efforts for helping those in need. With the actor’s portrait and message as ‘Sonu Sood – The Real Super Hero’ on each nail, the artist in her heartfelt note wrote, “If I can’t give back to the society, then this isn’t a good life I am leading.” – Sonu Sood. This man shows how your actions speak louder than words. @sonu_sood thank you for being there in hard times for everyone.” The actor also acknowledged her artistic craft on Twitter.The story of using nails as a canvas goes back to 2017, the year when Ranjan joined Instagram with a purpose to show her artistic side but with a twist. “When I joined the social media platform, I wanted to showcase my interest in art but with something different, so I started painting nails,” says Ranjan who directly paints own nails or artificial ones without designing a rough sketch. She also adds, “It takes up to 2-3 hours to complete one design. And if there are minor mistakes, those can be easily rectified similar to how we do on canvas.”As Ranjan has been doing nail art for the last 6-7 years as leisure pursuit, she also credits inheriting her father’s creative side for her artistic skills. “Papa used to do canvas painting as a hobby earlier, I think somehow I have got the talent and inspiration from him”, she says.She also aspires to get certified training in nail art and open a studio, and also give training to those interested in the profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patnabased-rajni-ranjan-showcases-her-covid-19-inspired-nail-art-expresses-gratitude-for-sonu-sood-101621940774620.html

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||YouTuber booked in Arunachal for racist remarks held in Ludhiana||YouTuber and social media influencer Paras Singh, alias Bunty, was arrested in Ludhiana on Tuesday for his racial remarks against a Congress MLA from Arunachal Pradesh and ill will towards the people of the state. Paras Singh, who goes by the name Paras Official on his YouTube channel, had in a video posted on Sunday termed Congress MLA Ninong Ering a non-Indian and apparently claimed that Arunachal Pradesh was a part of China, sparking furore among Arunchalees and people from other parts of the country. Also read: Aim to comply, discussing issues: Facebook on new social media guidelinesIn another video, posted on Monday, he apologised for his comments. “A case has been registered against Paras for racial hatred and the cyber crime branch in Itanagar is investigating the matter,” Arunachal Pradesh police chief RP Upadhyaya said. Paras Singh has 457k subscribers on his YouTube channel. Union minister of state for youth affairs and sports Kiren Rijiju confirmed Paras Singh’s arrest and tweeted that he has talked to the Ludhiana commissioner of police to speed up the process to hand over the accused to Arunachal Pradesh Police. Appalled, dismayed: Arunachal leaders Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu condemned the racial slur and said the “video aims at inciting ill will and hatred towards the people of Arunachal Pradesh”. Social media should be used with caution and any infringement will lead to action according to law, the CM added. State deputy chief minister Chowna Mein said he was “appalled and greatly dismayed” to see the YouTube post, which not just “casts doubt on the nationality of the Arunachal Pradesh MLA but also questions about the existence of the state within India”. “To doubt our nationality because of how we look is a problem most of us from the Northeast of India face regularly in the mainland. What we look like, how we dress, what we eat and how we live makes us no less Indian. We are proud to be a state in the Union of India where even in the interior most we greet each other with a Jai Hind and primary schoolchildren even in the border villages sing Saare Jahaan se Achha, Hindustan Hamara with pride,” he said on his official Twitter handle. More legal trouble for YouTuber Paras Singh had apparently made the comments while reacting to a letter written by Ering to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wherein he had sought a ban on the relaunch of PUBG Mobile as Battlegrounds Mobile India. The Pasighat East MLA, when contacted, said he would file a case against Paras Singh. The All-Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU) issued a statement to say that the people of the state are hurt by the remarks. “Such incidents are not isolated ones and have been happening time and again in various parts of the country. It is distressing that even after over 70 years of the country’s independence, people from the state and the northeast region in general face humiliation in other parts of the country, whenever they go there for work or study,” the joint statement by AAPSU president Hawa Bagang and general secretary Tabom Dai said.

On Monday, basic education minister Satish Dwivedi and minorities welfare minister Mohsin Raza announced adoption of health centres in Itwa in Siddharth Nagar district, from where Dwivedi is an MLA, and Safipur in Unnao, Raza’s home town. “I will do my best to better the medical facilities and infrastructure in this CHC,” Raza said, adding he had intimated his decision to the chief minister. Dwivedi said he planned to demolish the old health centre building in Itwa and replace it with a new one.Ved Prakash Gupta, the BJP lawmaker from Ayodhya who has just recovered from Covid, too, confirmed he was adopting one health centre while several other lawmakers said they were finalising the adoption. “I have adopted PHC at Pura Bazaar, located where an Azamgarh-Ayodhya four lane road is coming up. We also intend to set up a trauma centre there in due course,” Gupta said. BJP MLC and party vice president Vijay Bahadur Pathak said he had adopted a PHC in Azamgarh. “We are committed to improving facilities in health care,” Pathak said. There are indications that Yogi Adityanath, too, might adopt a CHC or a PHC.Meanwhile, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi sent three truckloads of wood to enable the poor to cremate their dead in Rae Bareli. “Sonia ji had directed her representative KL Sharma ji to arrange wood for cremation and now the party cadres will help the poor in cremating their near and dear ones,” said party spokesman Vinay Dwivedi.Cremation in Rae Bareli takes place at Gokna, Dalmau and Gegaso ghats on the banks of the Ganga and many poor people are burying their dead by the riverside in absence of money to buy firewood for their last rites. Several bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients were seen floating in Ganga at several places in UP earlier this month, prompting administration to step in with help to cremate bodies.The Yogi government has announced ₹5,000 for cremation of all the poor in the villages, while the state’s labour welfare council too has separately announced ₹7,500 for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-ministers-mlas-adopt-health-centres-sonia-gandhi-sends-wood-to-cremate-poor-101621923369984.html

Shukla, who is presently on central deputation and posted as additional director general of Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) in Hyderabad, has refuted the allegations, people aware of the matter said.Shukla was summoned twice for questioning, but she cited the pandemic and her responsibilities in CRPF to express her inability to have her statement recorded. She later moved the Bombay high court against the summons, but it granted permission to the Mumbai Police to record her statement in Hyderabad.Shukla did not respond to HT’s calls and text messages.Also Read | ATS head for Antilia case is Thane top copThe cyber police on March 26 filed a case on a state intelligence department (SID) complaint against unknown persons for allegedly leaking the report submitted by Shukla, over the purported payments for transfers within the police department when she was the commissioner of intelligence in August 2020. Shukla’s report named senior politicians, middlemen, and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking. The report referred to “monetary exchange” between officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.Home department officials said that the copy that was reportedly leaked was the SID’s office copy and did not bear Shukla’s signature.Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte submitted a report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, detailing the circumstances in which Shukla created the report. Kunte’s report added Shukla intercepted calls of six persons in the name of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It said no transfers of police officers took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020, the period in which the calls were intercepted.Kunte’s report questioned whether Shukla had leaked the report. It said if that were the case then she would be liable for “strict action”. “The report leak had led to breach of privacy and defamation of the officers whose names have been mentioned in it. The deals for the transfers mentioned in it and actual transfers done by the government differ. This proves that there was no question of any scam in the transfers,” Kunte’s report said.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has said Shukla sought proper permissions from the then additional chief secretary (home) and intercepted the phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-phone-tapping-mumbai-police-record-rashmi-shukla-s-statement-in-hyd-101621923309893.html
25-05-2021||Kolkata||SC to hear plea seeking SIT probe into alleged post-poll violence in West Bengal||The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday petitions seeking the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged post-poll violence that took place in West Bengal. The top court will also look into accusations that the state government was complicit and overlooked these incidents, news agency ANI reported.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of "targeted killings", the Mamata Banerjee-led party said the BJP was spreading fake news on social media.Also Read: No post-poll violence after May 8, Bengal govt tells HCThe BJP shared on social media images of bodies of party workers in North 24 Parganas district’s Amdanga assembly constituency, Kotulpur in Bankura district and Mothabari area of Malda district and accused the TMC of killing them. Police probe into the incidents resulted in the conclusion that these deaths were either by suicide or drowning accidentally.  “Spreading fake news, morphed photographs and edited videos is an old practice of the BJP. Even when a debt-ridden farmer commits suicide or a man takes his own life after a failed affair, the BJP sees an opportunity to create a sensation,” TMC MLA and party spokesperson Tapas Roy had said. Following a judgement of the Calcutta high court that said the state had taken steps to contain violence, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “Having highest respect for the court, I would like to say that its observation is surprising. The court should send its representatives to those areas where the TMC has unleashed terror. Women are being raped and molested. Shops and farms are being looted and ransacked so that our workers lose their source of income...Banerjee and her police are giving wrong information to the people to hide the truth.”Also Read: In Bengal’s post-poll political violence, a battle of narrativesA two-judge vacation bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Vineet Saran and comprising Justice B R Gavai, will hear the petitions filed by Arun Mukherjee, Debjani Halder, Bhupen Halder, Prosanta Das and Paramita Dey.These petitions, in addition to demanding that an SIT be formed to probe the incidents, also sought direction from the chief secretary, government of West Bengal and the Centre, to provide immediate relief to the internally displaced persons affected due to post-poll violence by setting up camps, making provision for food, medicines, pandemic resources, and making appropriate medical facilities accessible to them in light of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, ANI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/sc-to-hear-petitions-of-political-violence-in-west-bengal-today-101621918779399.html
25-05-2021||Other||Cyclone Yaas inches closer, West Bengal to evacuate around a million people||Around a million people are likely to be evacuated and taken to cyclone shelters in West Bengal before very severe cyclone Yaas hits the West Bengal-Odisha coast on Wednesday noon. “Evacuation process has already started and we plan to evacuate around a million people before the cyclone hits on Wednesday noon,” said a senior official of the state government. On Monday, the administration started moving people living on some of the remote islands in the Sunderban delta and on islands, such as Ghoramara, located close to the confluence of the River Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. “The sea and the river get very rough as a cyclone approaches and hence people living on Ghoramara Island had to be evacuated on Monday,” said a senior official of the South 24 Parganas district administration. In the early hours of Tuesday, the cyclone was located around 450 km south-east of the West Bengal coast. “From a cyclone, Yaas has already intensified into a severe cyclone. It is likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclone and is expected to hit the land somewhere around Balasore in Odisha on Wednesday noon,” said a senior official of the Indian Meteorological Department’s regional office in Kolkata. Click here for LIVE Updates on Cyclone YaasChief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that around 20 districts, including those in north Bengal, would be affected. The worst affected would be the coastal districts of East Midnapore, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas. Winds with speed reaching up to 70-80 kmph and gusting up to 90 kmph are likely to hit Kolkata on Wednesday. Rain and strong winds have already started in the coastal areas and the sea has turned rough. In East Midnapore which is located closest to Balasore, the wind speed may reach up to 155 - 165 kmph gusting up to 185 kmph. In some areas, such as Gosaba Island in the Sunderban delta, block administration has evacuated pregnant women and shifted them to ‘mother hubs’ on Monday. “As Covid-19 is taking a heavy toll we have arranged separate facilities for pregnant women, particularly those whose estimated date of delivery is very close. Also, this time safe homes and quarantine centres have been set up to isolate suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases,” said a senior official of Gosaba in the Sunderbans. What is a cause of concern for the administration is the cyclone coinciding with the spring tide phase during the full moon, sp the storm surge could be higher and more devastating this time. In May 2020, when cyclone Amphan hit the state, low tide was prevailing. Hence, the storm surge was not so high even though the gale was strong. “The water level is already high because of the spring tide and once the cyclone hits, we are expecting waves at least 2-4 m high at East Midnapore district which shares its boundary with Odisha. In North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, the storm surge would be 1-2 m high,” said an official of the meteorological department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyclone-yaas-inches-closer-west-bengal-to-evacuate-around-a-million-people-101621919050277.html
25-05-2021||Patna||25 ventilators sent by Centre 9 months ago finally installed at Bihar hospital||The 25 ventilators received nine months ago under PM CARES Fund finally became operational on Monday at the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), the largest government hospital in north Bihar.Hospital officials have maintained that the installation was delayed due to paucity of oxygen supply and other technical issues. While the hospital has been in the news for alleged poor state of affairs, the ventilators provided under the PM CARES fund too have been questioned by several states over their quality. The Centre, however, has blamed lack of technical knowhow as the chief reason for problems faced by the states. DMCH medical superintendent Mani Bhushan Sharma too was on record having accepted a lack of manpower to handle ventilators.Darbhanga district magistrate (DM) Thiyagarajan SM, himself a doctor, said the oxygen cylinder manifold system from the old surgical wing was shifted to Covid care wing, which also has a 25-bed ICU, after completion of necessary civil works.“Earlier, doctors had complained that the consumption of oxygen in the ventilators was high. The complaint has been redressed,” said DMCH superintendent Dr Manibhushan Sharma.He said two patients have now been placed on the ventilators received from PM CARES Fund.Three ventilator technicians, one biomedical engineer, four paramedics and three technicians to run the new manifold oxygen plant have been roped in by DMCH to run the new ICU efficiently, Sharma said.The total number of ventilators at the DMCH has now gone up to 32.On Monday, 2,844 people were reported to have tested positive for Covid-19 infection in the last 24 hours, raising the state’s tally to over 692,000 cases. The disease also claimed 93 more lives in Bihar raising the death toll to 4,642.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/25-ventilators-sent-by-centre-9-months-ago-finally-installed-at-bihar-hospital-101621916769552.html
25-05-2021||Patna||19 new cases of black fungus in Bihar, total rises to 201||Bihar has reported 19 new cases of Mucormycosis or black fungus on Monday, taking the total number of patients to 201. The state also registered one death, taking the death toll from the disease to five.Seven new black fungus cases were reported from Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), four at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), three at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital in Bhagalpur, one from the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and four from different private health facilities in Patna, said state health officials, adding other details were awaited. Black fungus is a life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection and according to the Union health ministry, India currently has 5,424 cases among Covid-19 patients spread across 18 states and Union territories. 4,556 of these patients have a history of Covid-19 infection and 55% of them had diabetes. Mucormycosis, if left untreated, can kill up to 80% of those infected. In others, it can lead to loss of eyesight and deformity of facial structures as doctors debride or remove the dead tissues. It usually affects the nose, eye, and then moves on to the brain.The Bihar government on May 22 declared black fungus a notifiable disease under the epidemic diseases act. On May 18, it designated the AIIMS at Patna and the IGIMS, as centres of excellence for the treatment of the fungal infection in the state. Several other states have also declared Mucormycosis as an epidemic.Bihar reported the first casualty due to suspected Mucormycosis when a 58-year-old man from Kaimur, admitted at the AIIMS, died on May 12. A doctor, who was undergoing treatment at the Ruban Memorial Hospital, a private health facility in Patna, also died of black fungus on May 17. Two deaths of patients from Chapra and Patna were reported at the IGIMS on May 23. AIIMS Patna has already created a separate 30-bed ward for treatment of cases of black fungus, which have been rising rapidly from the end of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/19-new-cases-of-black-fungus-in-bihar-total-rises-to-201-101621914969563.html

25-05-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand facing vaccine shortage, 3 days' stock left for 18- 44 group: CM||Hitting out at the Centre, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren said on Monday that the state was facing a severe shortage of Covid vaccines and has barely two-three days of shots for the 18-44 age group left in its stock.Chairing a cabinet meeting, Soren said the Centre failed to alert states and take necessary measures even as it had prior knowledge of the second wave of the pandemic."The Government of India knew about the (second wave of the) infection but there was much delay in directions to the states and ultimately the entire country was impacted by it," he said, chairing a meeting of his Cabinet Minister."We were suggested that there should not be any lockdown in the country but given the rate of infections, the state governments started taking their own decisions. Today there are partial or complete lockdowns (in every state)," he added.The chief minister said that Jharkhand got barely 40 lakh doses of vaccines against a requirement of 4 crore doses, leading to the shortage.Only a week or ten days' stock of vaccines are left for people above 45 years of age, while two-three days of stock is left for the 18-44 age group, he added.However, the state government would make serious efforts to procure the required quantity of vaccines, including through imports, he said.Soren said the state government would soon make a decision on extending the lockdown as 23 of its 24 districts share borders with either Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh or Chattisgarh, which are severely affected.Every day about 20,000 people are coming to the state through the railways and to combat the spread, Jharkhand has decided to intensify testing in rural areas on a war footing, Soren said.In urban areas, he said, the chain of the virus has been broken and fresh cases have reduced drastically to around 2,000 from earlier 15,000-20,000 a day."As far as death rates are concerned, we are the top in the country. UP and Bihar are reporting fewer deaths but you can assess if it is true. Many states are manipulating data but it is the priority of our government that we will ensure full transparency and take all possible steps to contain the virus," Soren said."Till the time a single death takes place in the state, we will consider it as peak," he said, adding that 'kafans' (shroud to cover bodies) would be made available to the people free of cost as there were reports of people facing difficulties in getting them.Sounds of sirens of ambulances could only be heard in state capital Ranchi a month back but now the situation has changed, he claimed.The second wave proved much fatal for the state and people lost their relatives, friends and loved ones, Soren said."Jharkhand was barely able to face the first wave when it was attacked by the second wave. However, with our limited resources, manpower and means we would battle the third wave if it comes and a number of steps have been initiated to augment the health infrastructure in the state, including special child care wards in hospitals," he said.Special emphasis is being given on rural areas as Jharkhand's 75 per cent of the population reside there and a massive door-to-door campaign has been launched where survey would be conducted in all rural households, providing them with necessary kits to fight Covid-19, he said."Our priority has been life and livelihood. The infection rate is decreasing. We issued 10 lakh e-passes for the movement during the restrictions as we didn't want people to face inconvenience," Soren said.Jharkhand has launched a massive 10-day drive for the rural areas under which each home in every village will be surveyed and proper treatment facilities will be made available to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-facing-vaccine-shortage-3-days-stock-left-for-18-44-group-cm-101621906855759.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||Sharp fall in cases, but most Covid ICU beds in Delhi remain full||Even as Delhi continues to witness a steady decline of daily new Covid-19 cases, the number of seriously ill patients has remained nearly stagnant, with most ICU beds in big private hospitals remaining almost full.The number of Covid-19 cases has reduced from a 7-day average of 18,374 (May 3-9) in the first week of May to 3,285 (May 17-23) in the third week of the month, and the number of hospitalisations declined by 33% in this period, but the ICU occupancy has declined by only 5.6%.Doctors and government officials said this is because of extremely critical patients reaching hospitals during the peak and long recovery time in ICUs.HT analysed government data between May 10 and May 22 and found that while the number of active cases in Delhi has seen a decline of 67%, and the number of non-ICU patients by 59%, the number of ICU-patients has remained almost stagnant. Indeed, some days including May 12, 13 and 14, the number of ICU patients were even higher than May 10. From May 10 to May 22, the number of ICU patients has declined by 11% -- indicating that the pace of recovery of serious Covid-19 patients is way longer than those with milder symptoms.During the entire 13-day period, the number of ICU patients in Delhi remained above 5,000 till May 20 . It was only from May 21 that it went down below 5000.At the worst of this crisis, only 13.6% of Delhi’s Covid-19 beds were empty (16,942 occupied and 2,666 vacant) on April 20, while six days after that the city had completely run out of ICU beds for the general public, according to government data. Currently, of the total 28,485 beds across the Capital, 8,791 are occupied and 19,694 are vacant.Dr SCL Gupta, medical superintendent of Batra hospital said, “The numbers have started coming down over the last two or three days. But it will take another two weeks for the ICUs to empty out. These are still patients who were admitted during the peak.”The number of cases in Delhi peaked on April 20, with 28,395; the hospital occupancy on May 6, with 20,117 ; and the number of people in ICUs at 5,813 on May 12.The longer ICU stay led to a clogging up of the system at the peak, said Dr Sumit Ray, critical care specialist and medical superintendent of Holy Family hospital.“That is the timeline of Covid-19. Those who get critically ill, tend to have a long hospital stay. In the ICU, those who are not on ventilators take about two to three weeks to recover and those who are on ventilators could take up to a month. During the peak, the beds in ICU were completely full and that is the reason people were running from hospital to hospital,” he added.However, the availability of ICU beds has improved markedly. But if the current occupancy of ICU beds is just over 62%, it is largely because of ICU capacity added in the city over the last three weeks. The Delhi government created two makeshift 500-bed ICU-only facilities on vacant grounds and attached them to Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals. Another 200 were added at the Radha Saomi facility in Chhatarpur.“Now, we are getting only three to four patients a day and not all of them need ICU care. So, most of the patients currently admitted to the ICU are those who were taken in during the peak. Patients in ICU, especially those on ventilators, need a long time to recover. The numbers are likely to start coming down over the next couple of weeks,” said a senior doctor from Rajeev Gandhi super speciality hospital who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharp-fall-in-cases-but-most-covid-icu-beds-in-delhi-remain-full-101621899782947.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||‘MCQs second option; first choice would be to cancel CBSE exams’: Delhi schools||A day after the Union education ministry asked states to examine two proposals for the Class 12 Central Board Secondary Education (CBSE) exams, several schools in Capital said they would prefer that the exams be cancelled, but if the government insists on going ahead with them, choose the option in which students will be evaluated through multiple choice questions (MCQs).At a high-level meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, and attended by the Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and all state education ministers, the government on Sunday offered two proposals to the states on conducting exams only in major subjects – either in the regular format at designated centres, or multiple choice papers of a shorter duration at schools where the students are enrolled.Madhulika Sen, senior adviser at Tagore International School, said neither parents nor the teachers were in favour of holding exams.“Maybe the government is considering to hold physical exams considering the drop in cases. But what about the third wave or the increase in black fungus cases? We don’t know what the situation will be in July,” she said.School principals said that, if the exams were held, they would prefer the second option, but cautioned that it was going to be a major challenge during the pandemic since they’d not only have to convince teachers to come for invigilation but also ensure distancing inside the exam centres and outside the school premises.Sen said, “The biggest challenge is to convince teachers to come and work as invigilators because many haven’t been inoculated. The black fungus situation is also evolving. Another issue is that while we will follow all Covid-protocols at the school premises while conducting exams, what about the scene outside school? Even earlier this year, when schools reopened for board students, we faced problems with ensuring physical distancing outside schools as children and parents will crowd there.”Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International, said it will be a big challenge to ensure safety of teachers who will be sent for invigilation duties.“We smoothly conducted pre-board exams at our school, but during the practical exams in March, my teachers had to go for invigilation to other schools, and many tested positive for Covid It will be a big challenge to decide whether to appoint teachers from parent schools as invigilators or let CBSE appoint invigilators for all schools,” she added.Several principals said CBSE should prepare a proper plan to send question papers online to the schools in order to avoid any contact during their transport.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “The question papers of all subjects should be sent online and appropriate time should be provided to download and photocopy them depending upon the number of students in that subject in a school. Besides, there should be a mechanism to evaluate the MCQ format answer scripts digitally.”Some teachers were of the opinion that any change in the format at this stage will add to the exam stress among students. Meenakshi Khushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan in Pushp Vihar, said, “The MCQ format is good when it comes to the evaluation process, but any change in the pattern will further disturb students. They have already suffered a lot and we should not do anything that will increase their stress. It will unfair to students preparing for exams in the existing format,” she said.Others also pointed out that the new format may put students at a disadvantage. Rajrani, who teaches History at a government school in east Delhi, said, “When the Class 12 students returned to school for practicals and board preparations in February, we practiced with question papers in the current format. For descriptive answers, even if a student forgets a few points he may be able to score some marks. However, in objective-type questions, there will be no marking if students cannot answer a question. With schools closed, we don’t know how we will ensure enough practice for them in a month.”Some school administrators also raised the issue of lack of space if exams are to be conducted in-person. Mary Jyotsna Minj, head of Government Girls Senior Secondary School in New Kondli, said the school has around 650 Class 12 students in both morning and evening shift.“We have around 59 classrooms and if we were to follow social distancing measures, each classroom would have only 12 students. We would only be able to conduct exams for major subjects, if we use a majority of the rooms and depute two teachers as invigilators in each room,” she said, adding that the school plans to use open areas if needed. “But to arrange senior teachers, when so many of them are engaged in Covid duties and other work, will be a challenge since the number of rooms used as exam halls will increase," Minj added.Delhi’s education minister Manish Sisodia said in Sunday’s meeting that conducting board exams without vaccinating all students and teachers will be a big mistake.CBSE controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcqs-second-option-first-choice-would-be-to-cancel-cbse-exams-delhi-schools-101621896541202.html
25-05-2021||Lucknow||4 held for assaulting meat seller in UP; victim also booked||Four men accused of thrashing a meat-seller at Gott village under Katghar police station in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad district on Sunday were arrested on Monday, Moradabad police said. However, the victim was also booked for killing an animal with the intention to create mischief and violating lockdown guidelines.A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media on Sunday. In that the men, along with two others — all of them self-styled gau rakshaks (cow protection vigilantes) —were seen catching a meat-seller and transporter named Mohammed Shakir and assaulting him for allegedly carrying buffalo meat with him. Shakir also alleged that his attackers demanded ₹50,000 from him.Moradabad’s superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said a case was registered against six people on the complaint of the victim’s brother, Zakir, and hunt was on for the other two men, including the main accused, Manoj Thakur. “We will arrest them soon,” Anand said.Thakur claimed to be the national vice president of Gau Raksha Vahini, a cow protection vigilante group. But the outfit said he was fired from it six months earlier. The police couldn’t give a clear answer about Thakur’s institutional affiliation. “The case is under investigation, and I don’t know much about it,” said Gajendra Singh, station house officer of Katghar police station, when asked to confirm if Thakur was indeed an office-bearer of the vigilante group.The police also lodged a case against Mohd Shakir for “causing mischief by killing an animal” and committing an act likely to spread infection and cause violation of the partial Covid curfew — legalese for the charge of not wearing a mask.But the Moradabad SP denied it was a counter case. “Approximately 50kg meat was seized from him, and he failed to show any valid document for its purchase,” Anand said.The case against the vigilantes was registered under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 389 (extortion), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Katghar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/4-held-for-assaulting-meat-seller-in-up-victim-also-booked-101621895682567.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||Despite sharp drop in Delhi’s Covid-19 caseload, most ICU beds in major pvt hospitals still full||Even as Delhi continues to witness a steady decline of daily new Covid-19 cases, the number of seriously ill patients has remained nearly stagnant , with most ICU beds in big private hospitals remaining almost full.The number of Covid-19 cases has reduced from a 7-day average of 18,374 (May 3-9) in the first week of May to 3,285 (May 17-23) in the third week of the month, and the number of hospitalisations declined by 33% in this period, but the ICU occupancy has declined by only 5.6%.Doctors and government officials said this is because of extremely critical patients reaching hospitals during the peak and long recovery time in ICUs.HT analysed government data between May 10 and May 22 and found that while the number of active cases in Delhi has seen a decline of 67%, and the number of non-ICU patients by 59%, the number of ICU-patients has remained almost stagnant. Indeed, some days including May 12, 13 and 14, the number of ICU patients were even higher than May 10. From May 10 to May 22, the number of ICU patients has declined by 11% -- indicating that the pace of recovery of serious Covid-19 patients is way longer than those with milder symptoms.During the entire 13-day period, the number of ICU patients in Delhi remained above 5,000 till May 20 . It was only from May 21 that it went down below 5000.At the worst of this crisis, only 13.6% of Delhi’s Covid-19 beds were empty (16,942 occupied and 2,666 vacant) on April 20, while six days after that the city had completely run out of ICU beds for the general public, according to government data. Currently, of the total 28,485 beds across the Capital, 8,791 are occupied and 19,694 are vacant.Dr SCL Gupta, medical superintendent of Batra hospital said, “The numbers have started coming down over the last two or three days. But it will take another two weeks for the ICUs to empty out. These are still patients who were admitted during the peak.”The number of cases in Delhi peaked on April 20, with 28,395; the hospital occupancy on May 6, with 20,117 ; and the number of people in ICUs at 5,813 on May 12.The longer ICU stay led to a clogging up of the system at the peak, said Dr Sumit Ray, critical care specialist and medical superintendent of Holy Family hospital.“That is the timeline of Covid-19. Those who get critically ill, tend to have a long hospital stay. In the ICU, those who are not on ventilators take about two to three weeks to recover and those who are on ventilators could take up to a month. During the peak, the beds in ICU were completely full and that is the reason people were running from hospital to hospital,” he added.However, the availability of ICU beds has improved markedly. But if the current occupancy of ICU beds is just over 62%, it is largely because of ICU capacity added in the city over the last three weeks. The Delhi government created two makeshift 500-bed ICU-only facilities on vacant grounds and attached them to Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals. Another 200 were added at the Radha Saomi facility in Chhatarpur.“Now, we are getting only three to four patients a day and not all of them need ICU care. So, most of the patients currently admitted to the ICU are those who were taken in during the peak. Patients in ICU, especially those on ventilators, need a long time to recover. The numbers are likely to start coming down over the next couple of weeks,” said a senior doctor from Rajeev Gandhi super speciality hospital who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-sharp-drop-in-delhi-s-covid-19-caseload-most-icu-beds-in-major-pvt-hospitals-still-full-101621887847863.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||Centre must either vaccinate all class 12 students or look at alternatives to exams: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the Centre should not be driven by an “obsession with examinations” while taking any decision regarding the Class 12 board exams and also cautioned the Union government against turning schools into super spreaders of Covid-19 by conducting exams.Sisodia’s comment came a day after the Union government convened a digital meeting to decide on the Class 12 board exams and subsequent entrance examinations that were postponed from March-April due to the second wave of Covid-19 across the country.At least two states, Maharashtra and Delhi, were of the opinion that exams should not be conducted amid the pandemic. Several states also raised the demand of vaccinating students and teachers before conducting exams, officials said; the Centre has asked states to submit their detailed suggestions on the matter by Tuesday.In an interview to India Today on Monday, Sisodia said, “We will give two suggestions to the Centre on Tuesday--- either to vaccinate around 1.4 core students scheduled to appear for Class 12 exams across the country; or, to cancel the exams and evaluate students on the basis of their historical references. In case a few students are not satisfied with their marks under the alternative method of evaluation, they should be given another option to appear for exams when the situation improves.”“The government should not be driven by an obsession with examinations and prioritise the interests of students. We should not turn schools into super spreaders due to our mistake (of holding exams during the pandemic),” he said.Sisodia said the central government should speak to Pfizer, which has developed a vaccine for children above the age of 12 years, and acquire that vaccine for inoculating 1.4 crore students (across all boards, all over India) who are currently studying in the 12th grade. “Or, the government may consult health experts on whether the vaccine given to those in the age group of 18+ can also be given to the students of class 12, who are mostly 17 or 17.5 years old,” he said.In another interview to NDTV, Sisodia said, “I request the Centre to consider that over 2.5 lakh Covid-19 cases are still being reported from across the country on a daily basis. Even as the cases are receding in Delhi, Covid-19 has started to make inroads into rural India. Besides, there are theories that the third wave of Covid-19 will mostly affect children. Any decision should be taken after considering all these factors... We cannot conduct exams by risking the safety and security of our children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-must-either-vaccinate-all-class-12-students-or-look-at-alternatives-to-exams-sisodia-101621887787846.html
25-05-2021||Other||31 doctors hired for Ramlila ground Covid facility disengaged from duty||New Delhi: Thirty-one junior resident doctors who were hired to work at Ramlila ground Covid care facility attached to Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) for three months, have been disengaged from duties days after they joined. While the doctors alleged they were removed due to disagreements over “payments”, hospital authorities said their services were not required since Covid-19 cases have been on the decline in the national capital. The hospital earlier this month appointed 136 junior resident doctors on a per-day and per-shift basis at the 500-bed facility, initially for a three-month period, and doctors joined between May 10 and May 15. On Sunday, however, the GTB hospital issued an order saying the services of at least 31 of these doctors were terminated immediately. Dr Nitin Bagari, one of the residents who was discharged, said, “The authorities hired us for three months. However, we have been removed from duty within days of joining, without any prior notice. I joined the facility only on May 12.” Dr Bagari recently completed his MBBS programme and internship. Another junior resident, who asked not to be named, said, “Some of us recently raised an issue regarding the night shift. We demanded that it be counted as a double shift and we be paid accordingly. Within days, authorities removed us from duty.” GTB hospital officials rejected these claims. “The doctors were hired on a daily honorarium basis to manage Covid-19 cases during the peak. They were to be hired for a maximum of three months but not necessarily so. Right now, cases have gone down and we cannot justify having so many doctors. Interns from GTB hospital have now been diverted to manage any patients admitted in the facility,” said a senior official from the hospital administration, asking not to be named. Meanwhile, the 31 doctors said they plan to protest against the move at the Covid facility on Tuesday. “We will gather to ask authorities why we were removed so abruptly,” said Dr Bagari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/31-doctors-hired-for-ramlila-ground-covid-facility-disengaged-from-duty-101621887727924.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||HC seeks status report on mosquito menace as civic bodies chalk out vector control drives||The Delhi high court on Monday initiated a public interest litigation (PIL) on the mosquito menace in the national capital said if not contained, vector borne diseases would add to the existing problems and complexities of the Covid-19 pandemic.The observations came even as the three civic bodies in the national capital are gearing up to conduct mega drives this week to ensure vector control -- nearly 1,700 municipal staff of the north and east corproations will be engaged in the exercises of fogging and spray of anti-larva medicines, while south corporation will launch a separate drive in its area.However, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh noted that on account of the current pandemic, steps to control the mosquito menace have taken a back seat.“We are inclined to take suo motu cognisance of the mosquito infestation which has taken place in Delhi. On account of the current pandemic, steps to contain such infestation have taken a back seat. Every year, during and after the monsoon months, the city sees vector borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya, and if this is not contained, with the growing Covid pandemic, the rise of such diseases would lead to and add to the problem and complexities (of Covid),” the bench said.It issued notices to the Delhi government, the three municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB) seeking to know the steps taken by them or planned to be undertaken by them to contain the mosquito infestation. AAsking the civic authorities to “pull up their socks”, the court said, “The mosquito situation is very bad... With the onset of monsoon, and looking at the pandemic, we will land in major problems.”“If people get dengue or something and they need to be hospitalised in Covid times, it will multiply the problem very badly,” it added, while directing the authorities to file their responses by Thursday.Meanwhile, the north civic body has also identified over 170 sites, which are prone to water accumulation and fit for mosquito breeding. “We have identified more than 170 places, which are prone to mosquito breeding. Intensive fumigation and anti-larva medicine spraying will be conducted at these locations and other places as well. Our domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) are already inspecting households for mosquito breeding. We will ensure that vector borne diseases do not hit the capital this year,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said. He said he has also written to the public works department (PWD) and other road owning agencies to keep their drains and roads clean to ensure no waterlogging takes place during monsoon. According to data provided by civic bodies, 25 cases of dengue have been reported till May 22 this year while only 18 cases were reported during the same period in 2020. Similarly, the capital has reported only four cases of chikungunya till May 22, 2021, while 10 cases of chikungunya were reported during the same period last year. Till May 22, 2021, Delhi has reported eight cases of malaria while the number was 18 during the same period last year. The total number of dengue cases in 2020 was 1,072 while it was 2,036 in 2019. There is no figure available for the current year. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said it is already carrying out fumigation exercises and has issued over 1,800 fines to owners of properties where mosquito breeding was found. A senior official of the SDMC said, on condition of anonymity, “The department has sent nearly five lakh awareness text messages. We have appealed to people to control mosquito breeding in and around their houses by cleaning their water coolers every week. The civic body has also issued nearly 1,800 legal notices and fines against households and commercial units for mosquito breeding on their premises.” Nirmal Jain, mayor, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). said the civic body will soon begin spraying of anti-larva medicine at locations where water usually accumulates. “We are making efforts to control mosquito breeding. Our staff is engaged in Covid duty as well, so, from this week, will start dedicated drives to control mosquito breeding,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-seeks-status-report-on-mosquito-menace-as-civic-bodies-chalk-out-vector-control-drives-101621887667822.html
25-05-2021||Delhi||Two selling vial of black fungus drug for ₹11,300 held, 20 vials seized||The Delhi Police on Monday said arrested two men and seized 20 vials of amphotericin B, currently a hard-to-obtain antifungal drug used for treating patients who have mucormycosis, or black fungus, a disease that is on the rise across the country. The two had procured the injections from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and were selling each vial for ₹11,300, which is about 36 times its actual price of about ₹330, the police said.This is the first seizure of the antifungal drug in Delhi and the second case of cheating in the name of delivering urgently needed injections in the past three days.The increasing cases of black fungus (mucormycosis) and an acute shortage of amphotericin B injection -- the only effective drug against the disease according to doctors -- has led to the hoarding and black marketing of the injection, police said. A similar hoarding and black-marketing of drugs such as remdesivir, faviprarir and ivermectin, which are used to treat Covid-19 patients, was seen in the month of April and early-May, when Covid cases were at an all-time high in the capital. Experts also said the sudden rise in black fungus cases, especially in recovered Covid-19 patients, may be because of the high use of steroids and them remaining on oxygen and ventilator support for a prolonged time.Given the spike in cases, the allocation of amphotericin B to various states and Union territories (UTs) is being done by the central government, depending upon the number of cases reported by each state and UT. Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadanand Godwa on Saturday had announced an allocation of 23,680 additional vials of amphotericin B to all states and UTs.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said on Sunday, two students who are members of a WhatsApp group, “Covid Helper”, formed to help out patients, told the Saket police about the black marketing of amphotericin B. The duo said while they were trying to source the drug for a patient, they came across a person who was selling one vial for ₹11,300.“The students demanded 20 vials of amphotericin B and the person agreed to deliver them for ₹2.26 lakh. The delivery was scheduled near Max hospital in Saket. Our raiding team along with the students reached the meeting point and waited for the suspects, who arrived in a MGF Hector SUV. Spotting the police team, the suspects tried to flee but were caught. The car was searched and 20 vials of amphotericin B were seized,” said DCP Thakur.A case was registered and the two men, identified as Rajnish Shrivastava,46, and his driver Murtaza Khan,36, were arrested. The SUV in which they were travelling and transporting the injections was also seized.“Shrivastava disclosed that he brought the injections from Lucknow and was trying to sell them at a very high price, taking advantage of the current shortage. We are now trying to find out how and from whom Shrivastava procured the injections. The seized injections are of the newly produced lot,” said Thakur. Police said Shrivastava completed his masters in tourism from Lucknow University and later started a company, AmbuSmith Inc., that deals in medical equipment and modification of ambulances. Shrivastava is into the trading of medical equipment such as stretchers and ICU beds for hospitals. His business of modifying ambulances is being run from a workshop in Mohammadpur village near the Delhi airport. Khan, his driver, also helped him in the business.Driver arrested for cheatingIn another case, a 28-year-old driver was arrested on Saturday for allegedly cheating the family of a patient suffering from black fungus of ₹3,000 after promising the home delivery of amphotericin B. The arrested man, Prashant Kumar Sharma, had circulated his mobile number on social media as a supplier of the antifungal drug. The patient’s family contacted him and he tricked them into paying ₹3,000 into his online wallet. However, after taking the money, SHarma neither delivered the injection nor returned the money, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.“Two mobile phones were seized from Sharma. We are trying to ascertain the number of people he had duped by promising to deliver amphotericin B injections,” added Sathiyasundaram.Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava, in a virtual meeting with senior officers on Saturday, had directed them to remain vigilant and take action against financial frauds, cyber crimes, and fraudsters involved in the black-marketing of essentials such as medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-selling-vial-of-black-fungus-drug-for-11-300-held-20-vials-seized-101621887547879.html

Chairing the third meeting of the board of governors of PBIP through video conferencing, the CM said the anti-red tape legislation, recently passed in the state, was aimed at making government procedures investor friendly. Invest Punjab CEO Rajat Agrawal said in the last four years, 2,394 projects, to the tune of ₹84,500 crore, have come to the state. Out of these, 53% projects have already started production and another 35% are in various stages of construction. He added that 24% of the total projects have come up in SAS Nagar while 22% projects are in Ludhiana. The state also witnessed investments in interior districts such as Sangrur and Bathinda, and border districts such as Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Pathankot, he said. The CM said that since March 2017, investment proposals have come from countries such as Germany, Japan, France, USA, UK, UAE, Singapore, Spain, Denmark, South Korea and New Zealand, and he hopes that by the end of December 2021, Invest Punjab achieves a milestone of Rs. 1 lakh crore in investments. Hero Group’s chairman and managing director Pankaj Munjal said his company has already tied up with Japanese Company Yamaha and Mitsui besides other companies of Germany and UK to set up facilities in the Hi-Tech Cycle Valley. He said that the e-cycle market industry alone has a global potential of over Rs. 5 lakh crore, out of which, India has merely captured 2% i.e Rs.10,000 crore which could further be enhanced to Rs.50,000 crore. Chairman, CII Punjab, Bhavdeep Sardana emphasised on the need for setting up a steel city in the state, considering the existing growth and potential in secondary steel, forging and machining. Chairman and managing director of Vardhman Group, Sachit Jain spoke about the investments made by AICHI Steels of Japan in Punjab through Vardhman Steels. He further informed that Vardhman Steels is planning to invest another Rs. 200 crore in its expansion project very soon. Speaking on the occasion, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the state has major land chunks for industry at Rajpura, Bathinda and Goindwal Sahib, which can be optimally utilised and offered to those entrepreneurs who want to set up their ventures in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-tells-invest-punjab-to-work-out-model-for-incentives-on-case-to-case-basis-101621886648372.html

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||3 Covid patients diagnosed with black fungus die in Amritsar||Three Covid positive patients, who were also diagnosed with mucormycosis died at Amritsar hospitals on Monday. Punjab has reported 17 deaths due to black fungus in the past four days. While one patient belonged to Amritsar district, the others were from Tarn Taran and Jalandhar districts. “A 65-year-old Amritsar resident died in a local private hospital while two patients, 62-year-old man from Patti, Tarn Taran, and other 75-year-old man from Phillaur, Jalandhar, died at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, on Monday,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh. GMCH medical superintendent Dr KD Singh said, “Two Covid-19 positive patients, who were also found infected with black fungus, had died at the hospital but the fungal infection was not the main reason behind their death. They died due to Covid-related complications.” A total of 111 cases of mucormycosis have so far been reported from state and an expert group has finalised the treatment protocols for the disease, state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said. He said 25 of these cases were reported from government health facilities, while the remaining 86 from various private hospitals.“Black fungus cases are mainly found in patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 or are immune-compromised (suffering from HIV or Cancer etc.) or the patients recovered from Covid with help of steroids/immuno-modulators, those who were on oxygen support for long time and people having uncontrolled diabetes,” the minister said in an official statement.Sidhu said antifungal drugs are required to treat this disease and the supply of these medicines is regulated by the central government. Two injections are being provided to the states by the Union government in the treatment of black fungus. No one can procure these medicines from the open market directly as their distribution is under the sole purview of Government of India, he stated.The health minister informed that an expert group of the state government has finalised the treatment protocols and an expert committee has been formed to advise the treating hospitals and physicians in accordance with the treatment protocol for mucormycosis or black fungus.Any hospital requiring injections Liposomal Amphotericin-B and Amphotericin-B can also approach this committee and it shall be made available subject to the availability from Government of India. However, at present due to restricted supply, this committee would examine requests and ensure that the basic requisite quantity of the medicine is provided to hospitals which require these injections on priority for treating the patients of black fungus.All patients of this disease will have to be notified by the treating institution/physician as the disease is now a notified disease in the state of Punjab. Sidhu further stated that symptoms of black fungus infection can include facial pain or swelling, stuffy nose or brown nasal discharge, toothache, loose teeth, redness, pain or swelling of the eye, fever, shortness of breath, headache, altered sensorium, double or blurred vision. If anyone has any such symptoms, he/she should report to the nearest health facility at the earliest, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-covid-patients-diagnosed-with-black-fungus-die-in-amritsar-101621886412817.html

Mumbai police’s additional commissioner (West) Sandeep Karnik issued an order under Article 311(2)(B) of the Constitution of India dismissing the constable, who was already serving life imprisonment for his role in Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter killing. He allegedly aided and abetted controversial Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze in purportedly committing the two crimes, when he was out on emergency parole.Mumbai police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu on Monday said that Shinde was earlier suspended, now he has been dismissed from the service. An order to this effect was issued by additional CP, West on Saturday. “Based on the findings of NIA’s probe about his role in the serious cases his dismissal procedure was initiated. His act maligned the police’s image in public and his actions also brought shame to the police department. Hence he is fit for dismissal from the police service without holding a departmental enquiry,” said Karnik.Shinde was arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on March 21. He was later handed over to NIA. Shinde was actively involved in murder of Hiran on March 4, the ATS had said.ATS sources said Shinde was in regular touch with Vaze ever since he got out on parole in May 2020 and, according to ATS remand application, Shinde was looking after Vaze’s “illegal activities” in Mumbai and Thane area. Gujarat based accused Naresh Gaur, also arrested by NIA, had allegedly supplied Sim cards to Shinde who in turn handed them over to Vaze. Shinde would help Vaze in all his illegal works, ATS stated. Sinde had served in Mumbai crime branch. Shinde, an accused in encounter case of slain gangster Lakhan Bhaiyya, had come out on parole. Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya was killed in a fake encounter on November 11, 2006. In 2013, a Mumbai sessions court had awarded life sentences to 21 people, including 13 Mumbai Police personnel, convicted in the case. Presently Shinde is in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hiran-murder-case-arrested-cop-dismissed-from-city-police-force-101621886227809.html

Of these, at least two dozen hotels are already up for sale and around 50 other hotel owners are planning to follow suit, as per the hoteliers’ association. Most of these hotels have already laid off several staff members and are working at 30 to 50% strength. But with no income, they are struggling to meet regular expenses, such as electricity and rent. Surinder Singh, president of Federation of Hotel and Guest Houses Association, Amritsar, says, “At least 50 to 60 hoteliers in the city are eager to leave the trade. Nearly two dozen have already put up their hotels for sale, but no one wants to buy a sinking ship. These hoteliers are reeling under debt from banks and taxes imposed by the government. If the lockdown continues for some more time, we fear that many hoteliers may commit suicide like the farmers. Our association, at the national level, is planning to approach the Supreme Court demanding relaxations.”AP Singh Chatha, president of the Amritsar Hotel and Restaurant Association (Ahara), said, “Four five-star hotels of our association have already shut their operations. Many members are under depression as there is zero occupancy in their hotels. Unable to pay taxes, they are being harassed by government officials. Heavy penalties are being imposed for late payment. Many who had taken hotels on lease have also left the business. Most of the hotels are running with 25 to 50% staff strength and their salaries have also been decreased to 50%.”A hotelier, wishing to be anonymous, said, “With no customers, I am unable to pay the installments of my bank loan and the interest is piling up. We are receiving electricity bills and constant tax filing reminders but how do we pay when we have no income?”Hotelier Jatinder Singh alias Moti Bhatia demanded that the government waives off all taxes since March 2020. “We should also be exempted from paying electricity bills. Otherwise the industry will not be able to revive even after the next ten years,” he said.Amritsar district tourism officer (DTO) Gursharan Singh said, “We are in constant touch with the hoteliers and hope that the situation improves in the coming days. The state government is also concerned about the grievances of the hoteliers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/struggling-to-stay-afloat-amid-lockdown-amritsar-s-hoteliers-mulling-to-quit-biz-101621886048358.html

Amphotericin B is first choice and covers almost all the types of fungal infection. But if not available, there are other anti-fungal injections being used,” said Dr RK Mishra of SIPS hospital where 12 black fungus patients have recovered till now.“Ten patients recovered without amphotericin B, while two managed amphotericin B on their own. However, those given other options took a longer time to recover. But they recovered,” said Dr Mishra.Dr Farookh Ansari, medical director of Chandan hospital, another private hospital treating black fungus patients, said instead of waiting for amphotericin B, other options were used on patients. Chandan hospital has treated over a dozen black fungus patients.Amphotericin B is in short supply in the private sector while government-run medical colleges treating black fungus cases have an adequate stock. Hence, doctors in the private sector are using alternatives to save lives.“We use amphotericin B as it covers all types of fungal infections. It takes 28 days to get a fungal culture report. Hence, instead of waiting, we start other available anti-fungal treatment options. In several cases it has worked.”“The injection amphotericin B has been found most effective in black fungus cases. hence it is the preferred one. But if not available, the other options can be used instead of waiting,” said senior plastic surgeon Dr Vaibhav Khanna, director of Healthcity hospital.Dr Ved Prakash, head of the department of pulmonary critical care medicine at King George’s Medical University, said, “Posaconazole has also been used in black fungus cases. Instead of injection amphotericin B, which is considered to cover maximum fungal infections, the alternatives can also work among black fungus patients.”Who’s at risk?Covid patients with prolonged hospital stay on oxygen support having comorbidity such as diabetes were at the risk of getting black fungus, said doctors.“Covid induced poor immunity contributes 50% while history of uncontrolled diabetes where patients are irregular in monitoring of their sugar levels and also fail to take the prescribed medicine regularly, contributes to another 30% getting the black fungus infection. Those who develop high sugar during Covid treatment due to use of steroids are also at risk,” said Dr RK Mishra of SIPS hospital.At times, Covid-induced hypoglycaemia too causes poor immunity for getting infected, said Dr Mishra who has treated 14 black fungus patients.“I do not agree with the theory that only prolonged oxygen support is responsible for black fungus infection. Two patients I treated never needed oxygen support,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amphotericin-b-shortage-in-lucknow-s-private-hospitals-makes-doctors-fall-back-on-other-anti-fungal-treatment-options-101621885927779.html
25-05-2021||Mumbai||8 days on, Navy calls off SAR op for barge P305 and tugboat Varaprada||The Indian Navy on Monday evening called off the eight-day search and rescue (SAR) operation for missing crew members of barge Papaa305 (P305) and tugboat Varaprada, which capsized in the Arabian Sea last Monday, hours after extremely severe cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast. Meanwhile, three of the eight bodies that drifted ashore in Valsad and Daman in Gujarat have been identified as crew members of Varaprada. The toll of the P305 tragedy remains 70 and the Varaprada incident three.On Monday morning, the Navy located Varaprada on the seabed, about 20 nautical miles away from Mumbai, following a thorough search using advanced side sonar of INS Makar. “The Navy sent its special diving team in search of crew members, to check if any of Brave Nature’s victims were trapped on the tugboat,” said commander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer of the Western Naval Command. “The diving team did not find any crew member trapped, after which Naval officials decided to call off the SAR.” The Navy then withdrew their assets from the SAR in Heera oil fields in the Arabian Sea. The tugboat sank on May 17, when it was returning to Mumbai harbour. The incident came to light after INS Kolkata rescued two crew members of the tug, while on their way to the search and rescue for barge P305. Barge P305 was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the Arabian sea. It was anchored about 200m away from the platform when the cyclone hit the Mumbai coast. The barge got de-anchored in the night of May 16, and hit a platform while drifting in the rough sea. It eventually sank around 7pm on May 17, with 261 on-board. The rough weather and very choppy sea made the Navy’s search and rescue operation one of the most challenging operations undertaken by them in four decades. The Navy succeeded in rescuing 186 crew members of P305 and has so far recovered bodies of 70 others during the search. The barge was also located on the seabed in Heera oil fields, but the diving team did not find any body trapped inside. Meanwhile, Yellow Gate police said so far 48 of the 70 bodies have been identified by their relatives. The process of identification of the remaining 22, to find the five missing P305 crew members, is on. The police will also go for DNA fingerprinting, as some of the bodies are decomposed. The agencies claimed on Sunday that they found 17 more bodies over the past two days at different beaches in Raigad district, Palghar and Valsad at Gujarat. Officials said seven bodies were recovered from Valsad, one from Daman, one from Arnala beach in Palghar district and eight bodies were found at Alibag, Murud, Nagaon and Sasawne in Raigad district. Of the eight bodies found at Gujarat and Valsad, three were found to be crew members of Varaprada. The remain bodies are being checked to find the 8 missing people from the tugboat.The body of Nagendra Prajapati, 59, the captain of the tugboat, was identified by his elder brother Surendra, 61, who came from Lucknow on Monday. Surendra identified his brother’s body on the basis of his wrist watch and gold ring. The body was found by local residents of Bhagal village when it landed ashore on May 21, said a police officer. Another body of Umed Singh, 59, who was working as a second engineer on Varaprada, was identified by his elder brother Rajkumar Singh, 63, on Sunday. Rajkumar came from Jalaun district of Uttar Pradesh after the company informed him about the incident. Aadhaar, election card, mobile phone and bank debit cards were found in his pockets. The third body, of Saddam Hussein Ejaz Ahmed, 29, who worked as an electrician on Varaprada, was identified by his elder brother Azad who lives in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/8-days-on-navy-calls-off-sar-op-for-barge-p305-and-tugboat-varaprada-101621885868897.html

The order was passed on May 21 and came into the public domain on May 24.The petitioner requested a CBI probe against the ADM (City) of Ghaziabad, and some other persons for their alleged involvement in black-marketing and illegal sale of oxygen in Delhi, Haryana, etc, “resulting in the deaths of scores of Covid patients in Ghaziabad and nearby areas”.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate SFA Naqvi argued, “ADM (city) is in charge of oxygen distribution in Ghaziabad and under his nose black marketing of oxygen was taking place.”“Ghaziabad has several oxygen plants and can easily sustain and fulfil the entire oxygen demand in the district. Regardless, the city has been facing a shortage of medical oxygen,” said Naqvi.The petitioner has filed some audio and video clips along with the petition.The state government counsel submitted that shortage of oxygen was not reported in the district of Ghaziabad during the period of the complaint, that was in the last week of April 2021, and the allegations in this regard in the petition are baseless.“Further, the petitioner on May 1 filed a complaint to the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ghaziabad, after which a three-member inquiry committee was set up by the DM Ghaziabad, which is conducting an inquiry.” submitted the state government counsel.The court directed the Ghaziabad DM to file his personal affidavit, bring on record the inquiry report and fixed June 7 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-dm-asked-to-file-affidavit-on-alleged-black-marketing-of-oxygen-101621885808856.html
25-05-2021||Mumbai||LLM students allege discrepancies in admissions as students with lower scores bag seats||Less than a week after the University of Mumbai (MU) wrapped up the final round of admissions to Master of Law (LLM) course for the 2020-21 academic year, a group of students have raised objection to the manner in which seats were allotted. In a letter addressed to the MU vice-chancellor as well as the governor of the state, these students have pointed out discrepancies, showing how non-revealing of vacant seats left some with higher entrance exam scores losing a seat to those with lower scores. “The last spot admission round was announced in mid-May and applicants were asked to once again apply for a division as per the seat vacancy information shared by MU on their website. We applied accordingly, only to later find out that there were more vacant seats in other divisions, which we were not made aware of,” said an applicant. He added that due to this error on the part of the law department at MU, students with a lower score in common entrance test (CET) have bagged seats while those with higher scores have not. On May 15, the university’s department of law issued a notice allowing candidates, who could not make it to the five merit lists, to apply afresh for the vacant seats through spot admission. On the same notice, the department announced that the sixth merit list would be the last one. There are around 600 seats for LLM in six divisions — Constitutional and administrative law, business law, intellectual property and information technology law, human rights law, criminal law and criminal administration, and environmental and legal order. Applicants, however, alleged that the university hid seat vacancy from all divisions before announcing the sixth and final merit list. “The seat vacancy list on the MU website showed only four vacant seats and students applied accordingly. However, once the sixth merit list was out it showed at least a dozen other students were allocated seats across divisions. How did these students find out about more vacant seats without MU officially announcing the same? The university is clearly keeping seats hidden from the common admission process,” said another student.An official from MU told HT that as per law, reserved category seats cannot be converted into general category seats, even though there are no applicants under these categories. “The final round was conducted to give students another chance at applying for LLM seats as the second Covid-19 wave affected the admission process. But in the special round, we still cannot give away seats from reserved categories to those from the open category,” said the official. MU in a statement has refuted all claims, saying the admissions was a virtual process and conducted smoothly without any errors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/llm-students-allege-discrepancies-in-admissions-as-students-with-lower-scores-bag-seats-101621885807764.html

The arrest of Vijay Chowdhary comes a day after a sacked home guard jawan, Satyaprakash, was arrested in the same case. Another police constable Simavat, the third accused in the case, is yet to be arrested. While Satyaprakash was sacked after the teen’s death, the two constables were suspended. After Chowdhary’s arrest, a Unnao police team left for Lucknow to seek permission for a DNA sample test from additional director general of police (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat. Sabat was not available for comment. But people familiar with the issue said the police had taken the clothes and shoes worn by the constable on the day of incident into custody. Forensic experts would lift the DNA samples and they would be matched with that taken from the vendor’s body, said a senior officer. The DNA matching, the officer claimed, was imperative to build a strong case against the constables. Meanwhile, Satyaprakash was interrogated for about 30 minutes and sent to the Unnao jail. Replying to the two-three questions put to him, the home guard said the vendor was forcibly taken from his shop and brought to the police station sandwiched between him and constable Vijay Chowdhary. “As we reached the police station, the vendor slumped to the ground, everyone got scared,” he said, according to officials privy to his interrogation. His version of the teen being taken away by force is corroborated by the footage from CCTV camera, which was installed opposite his shop. The footage shows Chowdhary and Prakash arriving on a motorcycle and stopping a metre away from the shop. Chowdhary is seen gesturing to the vendor to come and the vendor follows the instruction. Then, Chowdhary is seen slapping him thrice with force and compelling him to sit on the motorcycle. The home guard, on his part, has denied beating the teen inside the police station. But the vendor’s family insists he was assaulted inside the police station where his condition deteriorated. The home guard’s denial was in line with the police station CCTV footage, which was mysteriously released a day after the death on Saturday. According to the footage, the vendor apparently was allowed to go back, but he had difficulty walking and nearly fell at the gates. Policemen are seen attending him and carrying him away. The CCTV footage raises doubts as no camera number is seen, nor is there any mention of time and date, those privy to the issue indicated. Unnao district magistrate Ravindra Kumar said the police were looking into who released the footage and whether it was edited. The vendor’s father alleged that his son was beaten up in the police station and the footage was deliberately produced to refute this allegation. “Then where else was he beaten up? The post-mortem has found 14 injuries, the one on the back of the ear was fatal,” he said. His mother was inconsolable and said her son was handed over to her and a relative in an unconscious state at the police station. “We took him to the hospital in a battery rickshaw that we arranged. The policemen did nothing,” she alleged. According to people familiar with the issue, the release of the footage has raised more questions than answers. None of the policemen present in the Bangarmau police station on the day had been questioned yet, according to them. “It has been two days since the investigation was transferred to the crime branch and they haven’t been questioned,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teens-death-in-unnao-suspended-constable-arrested-dna-test-likely-101621885567791.html
25-05-2021||Chandigarh||CJ urged to form larger HC bench on examining marital status for giving protection to runaway couple||A single bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court has requested the chief justice to constitute a larger bench to examine whether protection can be provided to runaway couples without examining their marital status. The bench said this while hearing a petition filed by a couple from Haryana wherein the man ran away with a woman without divorcing his wife and sought protection. The bench said, “It appears that various benches of this court (of co-ordinate strength) have formed different opinions on the matter which cannot be reconciled easily. Therefore, it is appropriate to request the chief justice to constitute a larger bench to decide the petitions seeking protection.” The expression “person”, the bench added, is used instead of using the word “adult” in view of the fact that this court also seems to have granted protection in certain cases where both the petitioners were had not attained adulthood. “Keeping in view the fact that a large number of writ petitions regarding the issue are being filed, the counsels would be at liberty to request a larger bench for interim relief and expeditious disposal,” it said. In the past few weeks, conflicting verdicts have been given on the issue of protection to runaway couples. On May 11, a bench observed that the “entire social fabric of the society will get disturbed” if the plea for protection from a live-in couple is accepted, while another termed live-in relationships “morally and socially not acceptable”. These judgments were followed by two other benches ruling the opposite. A bench on May 18 held that live-ins are not prohibited nor do they amount to commission of any offence, another observed that such relationships may not be acceptable to all but could not be termed illegal and, therefore, the denial of protection to live-in couples would be a mockery of justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cj-urged-to-form-larger-hc-bench-on-examining-marital-status-for-giving-protection-to-runaway-couple-101621885453418.html

The government and Deshmukh have sought an interpretation of HC’s April 5 order, which directed an independent probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into corruption allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against the politician. Patil has claimed that as the independent probe ordered by HC was based on her complaint to Malabar Hill police, she should have been added as a respondent in both the petitions. However, as neither the state nor Deshmukh had done so, HC should consider her application and be allowed as a respondent in the petitions. Pointing to the fact that the state had tried to bypass her and pressed for an urgent hearing on May 21 before the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade, Patil in her praecipe has said that the government wanted another bench to interpret parts of the April 5 order to suit its purpose. She has stated that as the order was passed by the bench headed by the chief justice, the interpretation of the order should also be done by the same bench. Justifying her request to be included as respondent, Dr Patil said that as her complaint was the basis of the April 5 order, she should be given an opportunity to explain the grounds of the plaint and the Singh’s intention in the letter which he wrote to the chief minister on March 20 making the allegations against Deshmukh. The praecipe has sought tagging her application along with the petitions filed by the state and Deshmukh, so that she may also be heard and allowed to be added as a respondent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/want-to-respond-to-plea-into-cbi-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-lawyer-jaishri-patil-to-hc-101621885389683.html

Officials said though private hospitals deal directly with the vaccine makers, the state government has decided to play the role of a mediator to expedite the process. Principal secretary (health) Hussan Lal said the department is communicating with the manufactures through the central government. “They have assured to deliver around 2 lakh doses of Covishield soon,” he said. Of the 2 lakh doses, Sohana Hospital in Mohali alone has booked 50,000 shots, said an official privy with the development. “All we want is to increase the availability of vaccine in the state. We had sought requirement from private hospitals and have tied up with the manufacturers,” Lal added. On Monday, vaccine jabs were administered at 23 sites of Fortis, Max Medcentre, Matshya and Suri Jeevan Jyoti in Mohali, Oswal and Fortis hospitals in Ludhiana, Amandeep Hospitals in Amritsar, Pathankot and Tarn Taran, Reliance Industries staff in Hoshiarpur and Columbia Asia Hospital, Patiala. The state government is also expected to start booking of Sputnik vaccine by month- end. But some officials said the bookings may take couple of more weeks. “We have written to Dr Reddy’s who have distribution rights of Sputnik vaccine in India. But for the time being, they have expressed inability to commit to us,” said State vaccination nodal officer Vikas Garg. Drive for 18-45 group to stay suspended for 2 more days The resumption of the inoculation drive for the 18-45 age group may take two more days as 1,14,190 doses of Covaxine are likely to arrive in the state by Wednesday (May 26). “At present, we are left with only 20,000 doses for this category and that was the reason why the drive was suspended for the last three days,” said director (health) Dr GB Singh. The delivery of around 2 lakh Covishield doses is also scheduled to reach the state by the month-end. For the vaccine drive for those aged above 45, the state has around 1.50 lakh doses left and is expecting delivery from central pool by May 28. Now, Pfizer refuses to supply shots directly The state government on Monday issued a statement that vaccine manufacturer Pfizer has also refused to send supply vaccine directly to the Punjab government citing its policy according to which it only deals with the federal government concerned. The development came a day after Moderna refused to supply its vaccine to the state government on similar grounds. Citing a communication from Pfizer, state vaccination nodal officer for Vikas Garg said the firm is only working with the federal governments across the world to supply its vaccine as part of the national immunisation programmes. Garg said besides Pfizer, many vaccine manufacturers such as Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were approached for direct purchase of jabs as per the directions of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to explore possibilities of floating a global tender for the procurement of vaccine. He said now the state is still hoping for a positive reply from Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-asks-vaccine-makers-to-speed-up-deliveries-to-private-hospitals-101621885389172.html

During a review meeting, Thackeray directed the forest department to expand the reserve area, amid the possibilities of a potential growth in the number of tigers. Out of 312 tigers in state, 203 are within Tadoba and its buffer zone. The man-animal conflict in Chandrapur forest, which houses Tadoba, has resulted in the deaths of 33 people in 2020 and 18 so far this year. “To reduce the conflict and offer free area to the wild cats, the relocation of the two villages should be immediately undertaken,” Thackeray told officers.The state forest department has already relocated locals of four villages from the forest area. “The relocation will help avoid such conflicts. The villagers should be given cash compensation during the relocation. At the same time, measures need to be taken to reduce the accidental deaths of tigers. Most of the tiger deaths have occurred by falling into wells. Measures such as heightening of the fencing walls of the wells should be undertaken,” CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expand-boundary-of-the-tadoba-andhari-tiger-reserve-maharashtra-cm-to-forest-dept-101621885327763.html
25-05-2021||Mumbai||Five underground silos to tackle Mumbai’s flooding woes||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is constructing five underground water silos at vulnerable spots in the island city to mitigate the flooding that usually happens during the monsoon. Two chronic waterlogging spots have been identified for the pilot project currently under construction: One at Hindmata Junction in Dadar (East) and the other at Gandhi Market near Matunga, both on Babasaheb Ambedkar (BA) road. Both spots get inundated up to over two feet of water during every heavy spell of rain. The road is one of the main connectors of the eastern suburbs to the island city. According to officials, of the five silos, two will be at Hindmata (one under Hindmata flyover, and one under the northbound carriage of BA road). Water from these silos will be channelled from underground pipes to two other bigger underground silos — one at Pramod Mahajan Udyan on Senapati Bapat Road, near Elphinstone station, and one under St Xavier’s ground in Parel.From these two bigger silos, water will either flow into the sea through underground pipes, or used for non-potable purposes. In the long run, BMC plans to set up water-filling points at the two bigger silos at Elphinstone and Parel, for refilling water tankers for non-potable purposes. One more underground silo is being constructed at Gandhi Market under the south-bound carriageway on BA road, which is yet another low-lying area. Three dewatering pumps will pump the surface water into this tank, from where underground pipes will discharge it at the railway culvert near Matunga. P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of BMC’s stormwater drains (SWD) department, said, “Since this is the first time we are trying the concept in the city, we have selected these two waterlogging spots. Depending on the success with this project, construction of similar silos in other waterlogging-prone spots will begin after monsoon 2021.” Other similar spots identified by the civic body are Postal Colony, Chembur; Oberoi Mall in Goregaon; and the area around Mahalaxmi in South Mumbai. While the silos at Hindamata with a capacity to hold 1,000 cubic metres of water or 1,000,000 litres, each, and the silo at Gandhi Market with the capacity to hold 1,200 cubic metres of water, will be completed before this monsoon, the two silos at Parel and Elphinstone will be completed by monsoon 2022. Velarasu said, “The two silos at Parel and Elphinstone, where work is going on right now, will be completed and used for monsoon 2021. But we have dug up only a portion of both these open spaces. There is more scope to create another silo at each of these open spaces. This will be phase two of the project, taken up after monsoon 2021. We didn’t want to dig up the entire open space in one go.” The total water holding capacity of the tanks at Parel and Elphinstone alone is 50,000 cubic metres, once completed. The first phase, to be completed before this monsoon, will have a total water-holding capacity of 16,000-17,000 cubic metres, Velarasu said. The cost of the first phase is Rs60 crore, while the cost of the entire project is Rs130 crore. Velarasu added, “The project has been designed by the SWD department of BMC) with a local consultant. A local contractor is constructing the silos. SWD department is taking remarks from the civic bridges department, for the silo under the Hindmata flyover.” BMC has maintained it is safe in terms of the structural stability of the flyover, to have silos underneath it, as they are nowhere near the pillars of the flyover. Manoj Baraskar, independent structural auditor, said, “Foundations of flyovers are Pile foundations and go pretty deep. As long as sufficient distant is maintained between the pillars and the tank, it should cause no problem for the structural integrity of the flyover. As far as structural integrity of the road is concerned (near Gandhi Market) we need to regular inspection chambers. Beams of carriageways are likely to be in contact with water accumulated on the surface of the road, so steal in the beams may rust, and need regular inspection. Otherwise there should be no problem at all, and is a good idea.” The idea to construct underground water tanks to hold monsoon flood water was first mooted for Mumbai in early 2019, along the lines of underground water tanks constructed in Tokyo in Japan, to mitigate flooding. BMC was also in the process of signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the project. Bids were floated in 2019 for constructing underground water silos in Mulund and Bhandup, so as to divert excess rainwater from Mithi river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-underground-silos-to-tackle-mumbai-s-flooding-woes-101621885267782.html
25-05-2021||Other||48 freshwater turtles found dead in Maharashtra; no case filed yet||The forest department in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon recovered carcasses of at least 48 Indian flapshell turtles from an under-construction aqueduct in Asoda village, Jalgaon district, on Sunday. The development incidentally took place on World Turtle Day, observed globally on May 23. While post-mortem reports of the reptiles were not available till the time of going to press, department officials claimed that the turtles had likely died of heatstroke. “Post-mortem reports will be available only on Tuesday,” said Vivek Hoshing, deputy forest conservator, Jalgaon. Flapshell turtles are categorised as ‘vulnerable’ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red-list of globally threatened species, as they face a “high risk of extinction in the wild.” The deaths were reported to the forest department early on Sunday by locals from Asoda, where construction work is underway to provide an irrigation channel from Waghur damn to the agricultural fields of Mamurabad village. A seasonal stream known as the Lavki nullah has been temporarily diverted by the contractor to lay the main water pipeline. A biodiversity register, prepared at village level under the mandate of the Biodiversity Act, had previously documented the presence of these freshwater turtles in the nullah. “It seems that once the kaccha nullah was diverted and the water in it dried up, the turtles living there went to the aqueducts of the main pipeline, which is being built adjacent to the stream. These are metal pipes which absorb a lot of heat. Because there was no mud or water, it is possible that the turtles died of overheating. The pipes were being welded together, which may have contributed to the deaths,” said Hoshing. Despite the scale of mortalities in this incident, the forest department has not yet registered an offence against the contractor or any other persons under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, citing that the Indian flapshell turtle is not protected under the law. Justifying this claim, Hoshing referred to a December 2020 judgment of the Supreme Court (SC) against a Kerala resident, George Kurian, in which it was ruled that possession of a specific sub-species of flapshell turtles (lissemys punctata punctata) will not be punishable under WPA. Kurian was found to be in possession of Lissemys punctata punctata (sometimes known as the South Indian flapshell), which the SC ruled this to be different from the species Lissemys punctata (commonly known as the Indian flapshell), which is indeed protected under Schedule 1 of the WPA.“This is a flippant technicality, and holds no water scientifically speaking. WPA has not been updated since 1972 to reflect changes in modern taxonomy. Scientific names keep changing all the time, but the species remains the same. Lissemys punctata punctata is a sub-species of lissemys punctata, which is afforded the highest protection under the law.A startling number of them have died under suspect circumstances. It warrants an investigation by the forest department,” said Dr Varad Giri, noted herpetologist and taxonomist. Moreover, Giri added that the 2020 SC order concerns only possession of the animal and not its death. “You cannot even kill vermin without permission under the law. The forest department needs to do more in asking who is responsible for these deaths,” he said. When asked for a response to these arguments, Hoshing said, “No, the flapshell is not protected in any schedule of WPA. There is no mention of this specific species, so how can we register an offence? Besides, the incident has occurred on non-forest land, where we have no jurisdiction.” Experts also pointed out that the exact taxonomy the dead flapshells in Asoda is not yet proven. “It is not easy to simply distinguish only by looking. How the forest department come to the conclusion about the sub-species is not clear,” said one herpetologist working in Maharashtra, not wanting to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/48-freshwater-turtles-found-dead-in-maharashtra-no-case-filed-yet-101621885208791.html

Of these, 84 victims belonged to Patiala, while 124 were from other districts.Since the second wave hit the state, Rajindra Hospital, a tertiary healthcare institute of the Malwa region, has recorded over 2,100 Covid deaths.Medical superintendent Dr HS Rekhi said though the number of admissions in the isolation ward has come down by 10-15%, critical patients are still admitted in level-3 wing of the hospital.“This is the main reasons behind the high mortality rate as at least 150 level-3 beds are still occupied. The patients were admitted to the hospital in a critical stage,” he said.Patients from other parts of Punjab and neighbouring states, including Haryana and Delhi, approached the hospital for treatment due to shortage of beds and oxygen supply in their respective areas.“Most of the patients are coming with 30-40% oxygen saturation level. We are hopeful that their condition will improve in the coming days,” Dr Rekhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patialas-rajindra-hospital-reports-208-deaths-in-a-week-101621885208296.html

25-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls unlocking, starting next week||With Covid-19 cases on the decline, the state is planning gradual unlocking from June 1, by allowing shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities to operate, albeit with timing restrictions, and government offices to operate with more employees. However, the suburban train network is unlikely to be open for the general public for a few more weeks.Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 22,122 new Covid-19 cases, which was the lowest single-day spike in 69 days (17,864 infections were reported on March 16). The state tally has now touched 5,602,019. The death toll stands at 89,212 after the addition of 361 new fatalities on Monday. The state has witnessed a steady decline in cases over the past three weeks as the daily caseload dropped below 30,000, from it hovering around 55,000 three weeks ago. The active cases in the state dropped to 348,395 on Sunday, from its peak of 699,858 cases on April 22. The daily growth rate dropped to 0.69% on May 18, from 1.45% on April 30. This has led to the rising demand of relaxation from the ongoing lockdown, which has been imposed in a phase-wise manners beginning from April 5. The ongoing lockdown is in force till 7am on June 1.The deliberation over the gradual relaxation from the lockdown has begun at the state government level. The final decision by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to be taken towards the end of the week after due deliberation with his cabinet colleagues and the experts from the state task force. The state is expected to allow the establishments from non-essential sector to operate for limited hours, along with the shops and establishments in the essential sector. The timing of operation of the players in essential sector is also expected to increase. “Industrial units, too, may get some relaxations, while the workforce in government offices is expected to go up from the current permission of 15%. However, the establishments like restaurants, malls, multiplexes will continue to remain shut as they have been proved to be superspreaders in the past,” said an official from Mantralaya.The positivity rate in as many as 23 districts (of total 36) is still more than 10% and relaxations from the curbs there is against the guidelines of the Centre and World Health Organisation (WHO). Satara, Sangli, Parbhani, Osmanabad, Hingoli, Beed, Sindhudurg are among those with a high positivity rate. “We are expecting the positivity rate to fall below the benchmark towards the end of the week, so that they, too, get some relaxations,” the officer said.Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said on Monday that the state government was considering unlocking from June 1. He, however, said that it will continue in the districts where cases are still high. “There are currently at least 14 district which we consider to be in the red zones with high number of cases and the restrictions for them cannot be lifted. But for other districts where cases have fallen, some relaxations will be given. After all the industrial losses, livelihoods of the people need to be considered. The modalities for unlocking will be chalked out in the next 4-5 days,” he said.Wadettiwar said that districts with high number of cases may see more restrictions and containment zones. “The districts, which still are hotspot of cases, will have more containment zones, aiming at restricting the rise in cases. We have also directed strict action against people who step out in public places without valid reasons. We have also been emphasising on institutional quarantine of infected people in these districts to break the chain of infection,” he said.The minister clarified that the local trains in the MMR would not be opened for the general public for at least for few more weeks. “There has been lot of demand for allowing the people from various categories to commute in local trains, but it is not possible at least for next few weeks. One of the main reasons for the drop in the cases in Mumbai and surrounding areas is the restrictions on rail commuting. If we allow all to commute in trains, there would be similar crowding, leading to the spread of the virus. We will continue to allow people in health services and government employees to commute,” he said.There were 263,774 tests conducted on Monday, while the number of recoveries were 42,320. The positivity rate stood at 8.3%. The state currently has 327,580 active cases. There are currently 327,580 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 48,258 patients, followed by Mumbai with 28,299 active patients. The death toll has now reached 89,212 with Mumbai leading with 14,613 death,s followed by Pune with 11,497 patients. Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli remains to log high number of cases. On May 24, there were 1209 cases in Kolhapur region, which is much more compared to 901 new cases a month back. Satara also witnessed an increase in cases as 1,912 cases were recorded last month on April 24, which jumped to 2,470 on Monday. In Buldhana, there were 641 cases last month on April 24, which jumped to 1190 on Monday. In Kolhapur, there was huge queue outside the Regional Transport Office (RTO) to recover the vehicles seized during the lockdown of those who were travelling without valid reason. In Nagpur, citizens heaved a sigh of relief was lockdown was relaxed. Dr Ishwar Gilada, Secretary General, Organised Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG), said the problem is Covid-19 has now deeply penetrated to the rural pockets. “Many rural people tend to skip testing as Covid-19 is seen as a stigma. The result is entire family gets infected since this mutant is highly virulent,” said Gilada. “Another issue is the inadequate hospital infrastructure as rural pockets have hardly 30 % of healthcare facility which cater to more than 70 % of the population,” said Gilada. “The entire process is delayed due to which more people get infected and even the death rates increase,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-unlocking-starting-next-week-101621885147746.html

Else the responsibility of incorrect data will be upon you,” said DG in his letter to the three premier institutes of the state that collectively conduct the maximum tests in the state via RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) method.The issue came to light when rapid response teams went to the addresses mentioned against IDs of the tested persons with Covid-19 positive reports. The teams found the persons had been already given medical kits. On being asked, the persons told the teams that they had given the swab sample again to check their current Covid status (second test).In case, the person gives a sample again for Covid test, the reference ID generated by the labs has to be kept the same as in the first instance so that the teams get the data of the previous test and do not unnecessarily visit their homes again.In many cases, repeat samples of the same person have been mentioned with different IDs generated by the labs. As a result, the teams that went to the address found the person was tested earlier also and had already received medical kit and medical advice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-tests-three-institutes-in-lucknow-asked-to-correct-data-glitches-101621885027760.html

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cong may suffer if 2022 polls are fought under Capt: Pargat||Amid attempts by the Congress leadership to sort out the rift in the state unit, Congress MLA Pargat Singh on Monday said the party’s prospects could take a hit if it goes into the 2022 assembly polls under the leadership of incumbent chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. “There is resentment against the state government among the people. The chief minister should get his own survey done and he will know,” the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA told reporters after a meeting with cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi at his official flat here. The state polls are due early next year. While he downplayed the meeting calling it “routine”, both Randhawa and Channi have been discontented with the chief minister lately. They are among half-a-dozen dissenting leaders, including former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who are trying to regroup. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat has asked the state leaders not to air their grievances in public. Another Congress general secretary KC Venugopal had also on Friday said the party leadership was watching the developments in Punjab and will take a call on the situation. Pargat also endorsed Amargarh MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman’s call to fellow legislators on Saturday to come together and resign en masse from their seats due to the state government’s failure to fulfil the expectations of the people. “Dhiman did the right thing and others should also speak up,” he said, prodding other MLAs to also come out and express their feelings. Pargat, who had last week accused the chief minister’s political secretary of making a threat call to him, again spoke in Channi’s defence in the harassment allegation by a woman IAS officer. “The matter is being raked up after a gap of two years without any complaint. Why is a lady officer’s name being dragged in all this now?” he questioned, insinuating attempts to arm twist the minister. Meanwhile, Punjab Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati, who last week threatened to go on hunger strike if the state government fails to apprise her of its stand in the harassment allegation against the minster, said the chief minister had called up to assure her that the state government would give its reply soon. “Therefore, I have postponed the protest for now,” she told reporters. The chairperson said she was not scared of the consequences of taking up the issue and those who were accusing her of acting under the influence of the state government. “The commission is not under pressure from anyone. I am being trolled by some people, but I do not care. There are some who are asking why it is being taken up after two years. I want to state clearly that there is no delay,” she insisted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-may-suffer-if-2022-polls-are-fought-under-capt-pargat-101621884789048.html

According to the police, on Saturday, they had received a call from Sonu Jha, 27, who informed them that his wife Soni, 28, had become unresponsive after falling in the house. The police reached the spot and rushed Soni to a hospital. “She was declared dead by the hospital, following which we registered an accidental death report in the case,” said senior inspector Sham Shinde of Bhandup police station. Shinde said that Soni’s autopsy report stated that her death occurred due to strangulation. “The victim had a ligature mark around her neck after which her death was ruled as a murder,” said Shinde. They then detained Soni’s husband. “Jha was the only person living with Soni and he was present in the house at the time of her death,” Shinde said. During interrogation, Jha confessed that he had killed his wife by strangling her with a saree. He told the police that they had married after a long courtship. However, after getting married, there were quarrels between the couple on regular occasions. Jha in his statement said that Soni was upset with his long hours of work and had found out about his extra-marital affair a few days ago. “On Saturday when Jha returned from work, Soni confronted him about his affair.

25-05-2021||Other||Widely publicise free treatment of black fungus for poor: HC to Maharashtra govt||The Maharashtra government on Monday informed the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) that 1,000 hospitals were being empanelled for the treatment of mucormycosis, apart from the 130 existing hospitals treating fungal ailments as well as the 19 medical and surgical packages earmarked for treating the infection under the Mahatama Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). MJPJAY facilitates cashless treatments to needy patients from below poverty line. HC has directed the state to widely publicise the facility for the “poorest of poor, the illiterate and semi-literate as well as those living in tribal belts”. The information was furnished by the state in a suo motu public interest litigation (SMPIL) instituted by HC after news reports pointed to shortage of oxygen, black marketing of essential drugs to treat Covid-19 and issues pertaining to the last rites of victims of coronavirus. After reports raised an alarm on the rising number of mucormycosis cases in the state and the plight of people from the economically weaker sections who contracted the infection but were unable to afford treatment for it, the court included the issue in the PIL. The state government on May 18, through a government resolution (GR), had said that the grievances of the underprivileged would be considered, and that the treatment for black fungus infection would be covered under MJPJAY. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Bhalchandra Debadwar in a hearing of the SMPIL on May 21 had asked the state government to ensure “proper distribution” of Amphotericin B injections and other medicines required to treat black fungus and consider the request to cover its treatment – which can cost nearly ₹8- ₹10 lakh – under MJPJAY. On Monday, chief public prosecutor DR Kale for the state said that in line with the May 18 GR, medicines for treating mucormycosis would be made available through district civil surgeons. Referring to a report filed by the regional manager of state health insurance society, Kale said expenses for mucormycosis treatment would be capped, so that non-government hospitals do not raise exorbitant bills. The state government further said that antifungal medicines required for the treatment of the ailment would be provided free of cost to patients admitted in pre-identified hospitals, and district civil surgeon and state health assurance society would reimburse the cost of the drugs. He added that daily consumption of medicines while treating mucormycosis patients would also be monitored through MJPJAY web portal. “The hospitals treating mucormycosis patients would display instructions for the public at large at conspicuous places and make information as regards availability of beds on the portal. This would prevent unscrupulous elements [hospitals] from fleecing poor people by raising large bills. Needless to state, the list of hospitals identified for such treatment and through which the medicines would be made available should also be given wide publicity, so that patients do not land in the wrong hospital for availing treatment on mucormycosis,” noted the bench in its order. The court further directed the government lawyer to take instructions and address the issue of availability of medicines or injections necessary for treating mucormycosis patients and posted the further hearing of the SMPIL on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/widely-publicise-free-treatment-of-black-fungus-for-poor-hc-to-maharashtra-govt-101621884669959.html

The state is likely to extend the duration for manufacturers and suppliers to submit bids for the second time. The current deadline ends on May 25. The Mumbai civic body has also floated the tenders for vaccines and its deadline too ends on Tuesday. It is yet to announce its decision, although it had received three offers for supplying Russia made Sputnik V vaccine. The state floated an express of interest (EOI) on May 17 to procure 50 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration, and are being manufactured in other countries. The deadline ended on May 20 and was extended to May 25, as there was no response. “We have not got any response to the EOI floated to procure Covid vaccines,” Rajesh Tope, state health minister, told HT. This comes at a time when the state has suspended its drive for those below 45 years due to non-availability of doses since May 12. It was trying to place orders with Indian and foreign manufacturers to replenish their stocks and reopen all centres. By floating global tenders, the state is aiming at importing the doses of the vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Zydus Cadila, Sputnik among others. “We have no option but to extend it further as we need vaccines to immunize those in the 18-45 age group as decided by the Centre. The decision over giving extension will be taken on Tuesday,” Tope said. In case of Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has received three proposals till now for supplying Russian Sputnik vaccine. The BMC had last week extended the last date to May 25 for receiving a global expression of interest. The BMC had also sought clarification from the three companies that had submitted their proposals. The clarification was about documents relating to them being the official supplier of the Sputnik vaccine. The three proposals had quoted around ₹1,500 for both doses. Until Monday, the BMC had not extended the tender dates. The civic body too is expected to announce its decision on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Tope again urged the Centre to form a policy for vaccine import at national level. “The state has already urged the Centre to frame a national vaccine import policy to avoid unhealthy competition among states to procure vaccines,” he added. The demand was made in the backdrop of US pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Moderna making it clear that they will deal only with the central government and not sell Covid-19 vaccines individually to any state. On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said they have spoken to Pfizer and Moderna for procuring vaccines and both the manufacturers have refused to sell it directly. On Sunday, the Punjab government said that the Moderna Inc. declined their request to procure vaccines by saying that it only deals with the Central government. “The bid was open for all the players and was not sent to specific manufacturers,” the health minister said, in response to a question on any communication received by the state from manufacturing firms such as Pfizer or Moderna vaccines over vaccine supply. The Central government provides free doses for those above 45 years but for the beneficiaries below 45 years of age, the stock has to be procured by the state government. The Indian manufacturers have not given any confirmed supply schedule to the state, except assurance of improving supplies from June. “We are hoping their production capacity will start increasing from June. As soon as the supplies of vaccine stock become regular, we will start the vaccination drive around-the-clock. We will hold the drive for 24 hours a day. I want to immunise the entire population at the earliest and have planned things accordingly,” the chief minister said on Sunday. The state is also not getting enough supply from the Centre that has slowed down its drive for those above 45 years of age. On Monday, it vaccinated 248,251 beneficiaries. Between May 15 and 21, 844,135 people were inoculated, against 1,834,369 in the preceding week of May 8-14 and 1,433,165 from May 1-7. In the last week of April, 2,080,998 doses were given to the beneficiaries, according to the statistics available on Co-Win portal.

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||Three Covid patients diagnosed with black fungus die in Amritsar||Three Covid positive patients, who were also diagnosed with mucormycosis, popularly known as black fungus, died at Amritsar hospitals on Monday.While one patient belonged to Amritsar district, the others were from Tarn Taran and Jalandhar districts. A 65-year-old Amritsar resident died in a local private hospital while two patients, 62-year-old man from Patti, Tarn Taran, and other 75-year-old man from Phillaur, Jalandhar, died at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, on Monday,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh.GMCH medical superintendent Dr KD Singh said, “Two Covid-19 positive patients, who were also found infected with black fungus, had died at the hospital but the fungal infection was not the main reason behind their death. They died due to Covid-related complications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-covid-patients-diagnosed-with-black-fungus-die-in-amritsar-101621884668840.html
25-05-2021||Mumbai||After mucormycosis, Mumbai sees cases of aspergillosis||Amid rising concerns over mucormycosis cases in the city, doctors are observing growing cases of another invasive fungal infection—aspergillosis– among recovered Covid-19 patients. Doctors attribute it to unregulated usage of steroids among patients infected with the novel coronavirus in the second wave. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare fungal infection caused by a group of mould called mucormycetes. Similarly, aspergillosis is an infection caused by aspergillus, a common mould (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors. Doctors said aspergillosis that “mimics mucormycosis” spreads slowly, but also causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and can reach the lungs of the patients. Healthy people breathe in aspergillus spores every day without getting sick due to high immunity. Taking this as a cue, currently many hospitals are routinely performing a nasal endoscopy for all in-house post Covid-19 patients with low immunity for early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. “There is a sudden and alarming increase in the occurrence of invasive aspergillosis. Those with a weakened immune system, having uncontrolled diabetes, organ transplant recipients, ones with certain types of blood cancer, and those taking steroids or having lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to aspergillus,” said Dr Shalaka Dighe, ENT surgeon, Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Mumbai. Civic-run hospitals like King Edward Memorial (KEM), Parel and Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital, also have patients with aspergillosis. “We have got patients with either of the fungal infections or with co-infections of mucormycosis and aspergillosis. These fungi remain in the environment always. Earlier, we used to see these types of fungal infection among patients with immunosuppression like cancer, HIV, TB or organ transplant patients,” said Dr Hetal Marfatia, head of the ENT department, KEM hospital. Dr Amol Patil, senior consultant, ENT and skull-base surgery at Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, said the concept of white and black fungus is misleading. Fungi are mainly differentiated as invasive and non-invasive. “Both mucormycosis and aspergillosis are opportunistic invasive fungal infections, which means they affect people with a weakened immune system. If the infection gets detected at a later stage, both require debridement to remove dead tissues. This leads to loss of patients’ eyes, palate and nose. Mucormycosis is more aggressive than aspergillosis,” he said. Mucormycosis commonly affects the nose and para-nasal sinuses and can very quickly spread to the eye and brain. Symptoms are nonspecific and include a blocked nose, bloody or foul smelling discharge from the nose, cheek swelling or pain, swelling of eyes, double vision, loose teeth and pain in the teeth. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs and causes cough with expectoration, blood in the sputum, fever and breathlessness. Involvement of the nose and sinuses results in symptoms similar to mucormycosis. To rule out any confusion, doctors prefer doing fungal culture. “Patients with aspergillosis are usually treated with an antifungal drug called Voriconazole. But if any patient also has presence of mucor, Voriconazole can lead to a flare-up of mucormycosis. In such cases, we use a newer antifungal called Isavuconazole to treat these patients, as it works against both mucormycosis and aspergillosis,” said Dr Dighe. Some states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are also reporting candidiasis fungus infection. “Candidiasis, which many people have foolishly named as ‘white fungus’, is harmless. It can be treated with normal antifungal medicines and ointments,” said Dr Patil. Why the rise? Covid-19 patients are often given high doses of steroids which compromises their immunity to fight fungal infections. This is as one of the primary reasons for the growth of fungal infection in the second wave of the pandemic. Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist sharing his views on the rising cases of fungal infection stated that there has been a widely held perception the second wave was caused by a virus that was more lethal than the first time around. This, coupled with the fear of a lack of hospital beds, the urgent need to control the infection, and the belief that sicker the patient, higher the dose of steroid should be, potentially could have nudged doctors to prescribing higher and prolonged doses of steroids. “The use of corticosteroids, for a prolonged duration, and in high doses could be contributory (in fungal growth), especially among patients with uncontrolled diabetes, immunosuppressive conditions such as chronic liver disease, kidney disease, and malignancies,” he said. Dr Ajay Doiphode, president, Association of Otolaryngologists (AOI), Mumbai Branch, said Tocilizumab, another immunosuppressive medication that is given to Covid-19 patients is also associated with invasive fungal infections. Abhay Pandey, national president of All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation (AFDLHF), said when there was a severe shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients in April, many companies producing industrial oxygen (not for human consumption) were forced to produce medicinal oxygen without proper quality check. “There is a possibility that the fungus which remains in the environment may have gotten inside the patients through this sub-standard and polluted oxygen,” said Pandey who has also written a letter to the state health ministry regarding it. Dr Pinto said “There has been speculation around the quality of oxygen, the use of zinc supplements, excessive steam inhalation as being contributory, but these should be considered speculative unless proven.” “It is known that fungus thrive more in moist and damp environments so tropical countries are witnessing more cases of fungal infection. As these molds remain in the environment, it is essential that patients even after recovery maintain proper hygiene and keep wearing masks,” said Dr Patil. Doctors suggest patients remain more vigilant, monitor their blood sugar levels, look for red flags like eye pain, swelling of the eyes and cheek, nose block, cheek pain, and abnormal discharge from the nose. Infected in a week of dischargeSunil Kanal, 62, a resident of Chembur was diagnosed with Covid-19 on April 5. He was admitted to a private hospital on April 9. After 21 days of hospital stay, he was discharged on April 30. But despite repeated requests of his family, the hospital refused to do a CT scan during discharge. Within eight days of discharge, he started having fever which made the family members curious. “I had read about mucormycosis, so I immediately took him to an ENT for a general check-up. Later, he was diagnosed with a similar fungal infection, aspergillosis, which by then had spread to his lungs through his nose and throat,” said Roshan Kanal 38, his son who has already spent around ₹6 lakh on his Covid-19 treatment. Now, the patient is undergoing treatment at Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Chembur. Dr Shalaka Dighe, ENT Surgeon, the treating doctor, said, “At present, we are treating him with an antifungal medicine—Isavuconazole. We are trying to optimise his infected lungs before we can decide on operating upon him. Due to his health condition, we can’t even operate on his infected nose as we can’t put him on general anesthesia. We will do his CT scan in the next two days, depending on the result, we will take the final decision.” THE FUNGAL INFECTIONSBoth mucormycosis and Aspergillosis are opportunistic fungal infections. They affect people with a weakened immune system. The spores of mucor and aspergillus are found in the environment. Inhalation of these spores normally does not have any harmful effects. The body’s immune system destroys them. However, it results in serious infections in immunocompromised patients such as those with uncontrolled diabetes, organ transplant recipients, patients with blood cancer and Covid-19. Mucormycosis commonly affects the nose and paranasal sinuses and can very quickly spread to the eye and brain. Symptoms are nonspecific and include a blocked nose, bloody or foul smelling discharge from the nose, cheek swelling or pain, eye swelling, double vision, loose teeth, pain in the teeth. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs and causes cough with expectoration, blood in the sputum, fever and breathlessness. Involvement of the nose and sinuses results in symptoms similar to mucormycosis. Aspergillosis spreads slower than mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is more aggressive than Aspergillosis. Aspergillosis is normally treated with Voriconazole. Mucormycosis is treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B/ Amphotericin B. The differentiation of fungus as black and white is not scientifically correct, doctors said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-mucormycosis-mumbai-sees-cases-of-aspergillosis-101621884548339.html

His hope did not bear fruit.Despite having the letter, Rahul has been waiting outside the Red Cross office in Qaiserbagh here for two days to get the injection. He had nothing to show for his effort even on Monday.“It took two days to get the letter from authorities. Now, it is even tougher to actually get the injections at the Red Cross office, while my relative remains in a serious condition,” said Rahul, resident of Gorakhpur’s Chauri Chaura. He was among several other attendants waiting on the Red Cross office campus near the Qaiserbagh bus station here on Monday.Patient admitted to government-run medical colleges and government hospitals get the injection from there (medical colleges and government hospitals) but those admitted at private hospitals need to take injection from Red Cross. The attendants outside the Red Cross office were those who had their relatives admitted to private hospitals.When asked about the situation, Lucknow divisional commissioner Ranjan Kumar said, “We are continuously distributing the injection/medicine for black fungus. The stock is coming and the committee formed to screen the need approves the application for distribution. The supply is coming.”The Red Cross that is supposed to distribute amphotericin B to patients admitted to private hospitals in districts under Lucknow division has received applications from 70 attendants who have their relatives admitted at private hospitals in the state capital and the districts nearby such as Gonda, Kanpur, Unnao, Hardoi, Rae Bareli and Sitapur. Those admitted at government medical colleges/hospitals are provided this injection by medical colleges/hospitals only.“It seems the authorities have evolved this paperwork just to buy time. They do not have the injections and the paperwork took two days that I fear might go in vain,” said another attendant standing at Red Cross office campus, who did not wish to be named.“There had been 40 applications for a three-day dose (18 doses @ 6 per day) that required 720 injection vials. But only 90 have come since Red Cross was entrusted the task of distributing the injection on May 20,” said Indian Red Cross Society (Lucknow) chairman Om Prakash Pathak. “We gave only one-day dose, that is six injections, to 15 attendants/applicants by Sunday, and no fresh stock has come on Monday,” he said.Patients admitted to private hospitals can purchase the injection from medical stores, but there are hardly any injections with the medical stores in and outside Lucknow.According to an order issued by additional chief secretary (medical health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad on May 19, the Red Cross has been entrusted the task of distributing amphotericin B injection for black fungus patients admitted to private hospitals, after approval from the committee.In view of the shortage of these injections, the health department had started an arrangement that medical colleges will get a separate stock. Patients admitted at private hospitals will be provided the doses via open market or through the Red Cross society in four divisions of Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra, Meerut.14 fresh cases, three more deaths With 14 fresh black fungus cases, the state’s tally reached 598. Nineteen deaths have been reported, including 3 at King George’s Medical University on Monday. Those who died included 40-year-old man from Bihar, a 53-year-old woman from Deoria and a 70-year-old woman from Lalganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/black-fungus-patients-kin-face-agonising-test-of-patience-for-injections-101621884488330.html

25-05-2021||Mumbai||BMC to start vaccinating lactating women from Tuesday||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to start vaccinating lactating women in the city from Tuesday, said civic officials. The move comes after the Central government allowed the same on May 19.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “We will start walk-in vaccination for lactating mothers from Tuesday, as the Central government has allowed it. However, we do not have any permission or guidelines for pregnant women. Hence, they will not be vaccinated for now.”According to BMC officials, they will allow lactating women to get their jabs on walk-in basis and a separate desk will be created for them. They will require a certificate from their doctor and will have to fill a consent form at the vaccination centre. BMC in a statement said, “On the first three days of the week, lactating women can walk in for vaccination. If they wish to get the Covid vaccine, they will need to have a certificate from the gynaecologist treating them on their letterhead regarding vaccination.”The statement added, “Pregnant women must also give their own consent to receive the Covid vaccine after obtaining such a certificate from a gynaecologist. Both the gynaecologist’s certificate and the consent form should be handed over to the vaccination centre.” Consent forms will be available at vaccination centres. Meanwhile, those aged above 45 years will be allowed to walk in for their second dose from Tuesday. The walk-in facility available to this age group for their first dose will continue as well.According to BMC, between Monday and Wednesday, those above 45 years of age will be allowed for both dose of vaccination on walk-in basis and between Thursday to Saturday vaccination will be only on basis of appointment, and on Sunday vaccination will remain suspended.However, the vaccination for 18-44 years of age group remains suspended in civic and government-run vaccination centres.BMC had last week allowed those aged above 60 for walk-in vaccination. however, now it has decided to allow all above 45 years of age to walk in for vaccination on three days.On Monday, 25,211 citizens were vaccinated in the city, of which 9,078 were from the 18-45 age group, 6,007 were aged between 45 and 59, 9,064 were senior citizens and the remaining were healthcare and frontline workers. Overall, 2,980,478 citizens have been vaccinated in the city since January 16.As per BMC data, there are 1.1 million senior citizens in Mumbai, and 0.88 million of them have received their first dose of vaccine. The civic body is now focusing on covering the remaining senior citizens.Meanwhile, those wanting second dose of Covaxin will be allowed on walk-in basis. According to BMC, those requiring second dose of Covishield have to come 84 days after taking first dose, as per the Centre’s instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-start-vaccinating-lactating-women-from-tuesday-101621884307755.html
25-05-2021||Mumbai||Daily cases drop to 1,049 in Mumbai, positivity rate at 4.7% but fatality still high||The city on Monday reported 1,049 Covid-19 cases against 21,947 tests conducted on Sunday, with a positivity rate for the day of 4.7%. Mumbai also reported 48 deaths. The total case count has reached 697,959 and toll 14,613. Daily case fatality rate reported on Monday is 4.5%. Mumbai has been reporting a higher daily case fatality rate for the past month. The higher number of deaths has been attributed to the spike in cases reported in April and first part of May as well as a rise in critical patients infected during this period. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of civic public health department, said, “More deaths occur in patients who are in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients admitted to ICU take longer to be discharged and remain in the hospital for more than 21 days on an average, whereas the normal cycle of the virus in an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient is 14 days. At least 25% of our ICU patients have been in the hospital for 28 days or longer.” “ICU bed occupancy is higher when compared to normal Covid-19 bed occupancy. Even though independently, more ICU beds are vacant now in comparison to last month,” he added. Of the total 22,078 beds available for Covid-19 patients, 13,704 or 61% are currently vacant.In case of ICU beds, 532 of the total 2,867 beds or 18% are vacant. Of the 1,471 ventilator beds, only 147 or 9.9% are vacant.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) Save Lives strategy, coined in mid-2020 to reduce the number of Covid-19 deaths, is still in place, Kakani said. In addition, BMC is studying reasons of death in individual cases, and referring the findings to the state task force to come up with solutions. Once the infection reaches the patient’s lungs or other complications related to Covid-19 have reached an advanced stage, it is more difficult to treat them with drugs like Remdesivir, said Kakani. In such cases, the line of treatment doctors opt for takes longer to show its effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-cases-drop-to-1-049-in-mumbai-positivity-rate-at-4-7-but-fatality-still-high-101621884187705.html

The UT had reported its first death due to the fungal disease, which is increasingly affecting recovering coronavirus patients, on May 21. The victim had been a 40-year-old man of Poonch. The move comes days after the Centre directed all the states and UTs to make black fungus a notifiable disease.According to the notification, all the government and private health facilities and medical colleges are required to follow the guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of the disease issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and J&K government as amended from time to time.The guidelines make it mandatory for all such facilities to report suspected and confirmed cases to the health department through district-level officers and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).The notification also mandates that no person, institution or organisation will spread any information or material for management of mucormycosis without prior permission of the directorate of health services in Jammu and Kashmir. The DHS will constitute a committee headed by Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the concerned district, which will have specialist of internal Medicine, Ophthalmology, ENT and Epidemiologist as members to review any violations. The violators will be punished under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-fungus-declared-an-epidemic-in-jk-101621883948408.html

It had earlier told court that the rates are to be reduced from ₹2,000 to ₹1,900.Computed tomography (CT) scan and its high-resolution (HR) variant are medical imaging techniques used in radiology to get detailed images of the body non-invasively for diagnostic purposes. Chest CT scan is being widely used by Covid-19 patients to assess the extent of infection in lungs. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said no private diagnostic centre should charge more than ₹1,800 for CT/HRCT scan, which is inclusive of all taxes. Earlier, the Mohali administration had also capped the price at ₹2,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-caps-ct-scan-rates-at-1800-101621883528172.html

Dr Sanjeev Kumar Digra, professor, department of paediatrics, SMGS Hospital, Jammu said irrespective of the hype over the third wave, young children have always been at risk of contracting the infection.“As more of the population is infected with the virus, young children become more vulnerable. Thus, the onus of protecting children is on adults. If they religiously follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, they can ensure that the infection does not reach their kids at home,” he said.Dr Sanjeev said Covid symptoms in children include fever, throat pain, cold, cough, dysentery. “In the second wave, it has been observed that children also tend to develop rashes and redness in eyes. If a child is suffering from high grade fever for four to five days, is not eating well, starts vomiting, not breathing naturally, has bluish discolouration of body parts, has sunken eyes or dry lips, and his/ her oxygen saturation level dips below 94, one must immediately consult a doctor,” he said.Srinagar and Jammu districts have together contributed for about 1.10 lakh cases and 1,713 deaths of the total.

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||Audit raises objection to ₹21cr spending by Chandigarh forest dept||Auditors discovered irregularities in the ₹21.42 crore spent by the Chandigarh forest and wildlife department between April 2019 and March 2020, an RTI reply has revealed.The audit was carried out by the office of principal director of audit (central) which had sent a report to the department on October 28, 2020, seeking the latter’s response in six weeks.As per the audit report, an unauthorised payment of ₹47.77 lakh was made to a security agency for outsourcing its services without executing a legal contract with it. Moreover, in case of some eight tenders, where the total bid amount was ₹18.89 crore, the minimum turnover condition was not met by any of the three bidders. Execution without fulfilling the prescribed terms and conditions led to void contracts, the report stated.Against 10 sanctioned posts, the department employed 33 people, including four extra clerks, two peons, eight drivers, four supervisors and five security guards, with their wages amounting to ₹46.94 lakh in excess expenditure. Due to the planning of an unrealistic budget, excessive saving of ₹1.32 crore was done. The report stated that excessive savings or underutilisation of funds led to parking of funds which could have been utilised for other government functions.While the procurement of goods and services by ministries or departments is mandatory through the government e-marketplace (GeM), it was found that an all-in-one pc, a sofa set, RCC pipes and outsourcing of some other services totalling to ₹11.78 lakh was done outside of the GeM portal. It was also found that one employee, an accountant, was drawing two conveyance allowances per month and an amount of ₹31,000 had been wrongfully paid.Non disposal of unserviceable items which had been lying unused for over nine years in the stores also cost the department ₹14.90 lakh. This included various items like bicycles, barbed wires and lawn mowers among other items, the report stated.Apart from the fiduciary irregularities, the report pointed out that there was a non-deduction of uncommuted pension from hired ex-servicemen, improper maintenance of form number 7 and service books; non-physical verification of consumables and fixed assets; and some other general irregularities.While the report mentions that a response to these objections is awaited, deputy conservator of forests Abdul Qayum said a brief reply had been sent by the department already. “If it is not deemed satisfactory, a detailed response will be prepared and sent,” he said without elaborating on what had been said in the brief reply.Social activist RK Garg, who filed the RTI, said, “The department frequently violates the rules, and the authorities must take strict note of this. How were contracts worth ₹18.89 crore were voided and ₹2.44 lakh spent just on a sofa set needs to be examined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/audit-raises-objection-to-21cr-spending-by-chandigarh-forest-dept-101621883408241.html
25-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn puts water tariff hike on hold till next year||The Chandigarh administration on Monday stayed the hike in water tariff till March 31, 2022. The charges were increased by 200 times in September last year.A detailed notification regarding the stay is awaited. It is expected to bring more clarity on the date from which the decision would be applicable, and if the hiked charges that were paid by the residents would be adjusted.After public outcry and criticism from the opposition, the MC general house had passed a resolution in October last year, asking the administration to withdraw its September the notification and stick to the existing rates till the pandemic was over.In response, the UT administration in February this year had asked the MC to reconsider the resolution, and then in May sought some clarifications.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore took the decision in view of the MC resolution and pandemic situation, it is learnt. MC commissioner KK Yadav had opposed the MC resolution on rollback of the hiked tariffs, contending major loss to a financially struggling civic body.The MC collects ₹90 crore per annum as water charges, but the expenditure incurred to maintain supply to its 1.8 lakh consumers is ₹225 crore, said an official. Struggling to even pay salaries to its employees because of a severe financial crunch, the civic body was expected to earn an additional ₹60 crore from the hike.Political slugfest The administration’s decision has come days before the Congress had planned a major city-wide protest against the hike.Facing resistance from various quarters, the top BJP leadership, including city president Arun Sood and mayor Ravikant Sharma met the UT administrator a few days ago and pressed for a rollback.Sharma said, “We always deliver on our promises. Just after my election, I declared that the rollback would be one of my priorities.”Meanwhile, even though Congress welcomed the decision, it questioned its timing. “Why put the hike on hold till March 2022 only? Is it because the MC elections are due in December this year,” asked HS Lucky, chief spokesperson of city Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-puts-water-tariff-hike-on-hold-till-next-year-101621883351380.html

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||Remdesivir row: FIR recommended against Mohali’s Mayo Hospital||Finding Mayo Hospital (now Mount Star Hospital) in Mohali’s Sector 69 guilty of black-marketing 83 remdesivir injections in the past one month, a four-member inquiry committee has recommended penal and legal action against it. Remdesivir is used for the treatment of Covid patients and is being provided to private hospitals at controlled rates by the state government. The inquiry was initiated after allegations of irregularities at the private hospital.In the report submitted to Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, the committee has recommended an FIR against the hospital management, chief financial officer (CFO) Mukesh Sharma, his son Kshitij Sharma and the pharmacy on its premises. The hospital changed its name to Mount Star about 10 days ago due to an ongoing litigation.The committee found that bills for the injection were issued in the name of a prominent cement manufacturing firm besides the CFO and a few doctors of the hospital. One bill was also issued in the name of a woman on March 17 even as she was admitted on March 18. While doctors reportedly denied getting any injections, the reply to the show-cause notice issued to the hospital was also unsatisfactory, the committee stated in its report.When the controversy erupted, the three directors of the hospital — Deepak Tyagi, Virender Dhankhad and Dr Manoj Sharma — had accused the CFO and his son of illegally procuring remdesivir injections and selling them at a premium to patients outside the hospital. The CFO, on the other hand, has alleged that the directors had fabricated documents pertaining to the drug sale to frame him. Both allegations are being probed by police.Subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Jadgeep Sehgal, who was part of the inquiry committee, said: “When the management was aware that the CFO is selling injections illegally, then why did they not inform the administration? Also, how come the pharmacy gave an injection to the CFO’s son? It is clear the hospital made huge profit by selling the injections in the black market.”According to sources in the administration, the hospital procured the injections from the state government for ₹1,800 each and sold them for nearly ₹40,000, pocketing over 2,000% profit, even as private facilities are required to sell remdesivir at the same rate at which it is procured under the National Health Mission. Its current price varies between ₹1,150 and ₹2,500, depending on the brand.“I have received the report, on the basis of which strict action will be taken against the hospital,” said the deputy commissioner. An FIR will be registered against the guilty under the Disaster Management Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and other relevant penal provisions.The inquiry committee also included deputy superintendent of police Deep Kamal, senior medical officer Dr Vijay Bhagat and drug inspector Jai Jai Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/remdesivir-row-fir-recommended-against-mohali-s-mayo-hospital-101621883228673.html

25-05-2021||Other||Delhi police visit Twitter offices in city, Ggm over ‘toolkit case’||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Monday said they have sought a clarification from Twitter in connection with a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) national spokesperson Sambit Patra about an alleged toolkit released by the Congress party that the micorblogging site tagged as “manipulated media.”Delhi Police officers on Monday evening visited offices in South Delhi’s Lado Sarai and Golf Course Road in Gurugram. A police team from Lodhi Colony’s special cell visited the offices to secure the participation of Twitter’s Managing Director Manish Maheshwari as part of the probe. “The person(Manish Maheshwari) who had to join investigation said he is not the concerned person. He sent a reply to the DCP of special cell that he was part of Twitter India and not Twitter Inc. Any tagging to that concerned tweet was done by Twitter Inc. Though his bio said he is the MD of Twitter in India. So we visited the Twitter office to summon the concerned and verify his claims. This is just a preliminary inquiry,” a senior police officer said. The visit came after the special cell of Delhi Police asked Twitter to explain the “manipulated media” tag.  The city police’s special cell has been conducting an enquiry into a complaint filed with the police chief and the Tughlak Road police station on May 18 by two Congress party leaders, seeking a first information report (FIR) against some BJP leaders for allegedly “forging documents, and circulating fabricated material on Twitter under the hashtag CongressTolkitExposed.” No FIR was registered till Monday evening in the matter, the police said.But it wasn’t immediately clear whether the police were investigating this or the “manipulated media” tag which means, according to the platform’s policies, “deceptively altered media”. Twitter flagged the Patra tweet on Friday. In his tweet, Patra released details of the Toolkit, a social media campaign playbook, that the Congress allegedly prepared to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi and build a biased narrative over India’s management of Covid-19, and the Central Vista project. The IT ministry has already written to Twitter , expressing its displeasure at the tagging, and asking it to remove the “manipulated media” descriptor. “Delhi Police is enquiring into a complaint in which clarification is sought from the Twitter regarding the classification of a tweet by Sambit Patra as manipulated . It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such. This information is relevant to the enquiry. The special cell, which is conducting the enquiry, wants to find out the truth. Twitter which has claimed to know the underlying truth should clarify,” the Delhi Police said in a statement released on Monday evening by their spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.Twitter did not immediately respond to queries on the incident. On May 18, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra posted two purported documents of the Congress’s research department on Twitter and called them a toolkit with “elaborate plans” to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi, politicise religion and help build a “biased narrative” over Covid-19 management and the Central Vista project. Other BJP leaders also joined Patra in the allegations.Rajeev Gowda, who heads the Congress’s research department, immediately hit back and accused the BJP of propagating a fake “toolkit” on Covid-19 mismanagement and attributing it to his party. The same day Godwa and Rohan Gupta, chairman of the party’s social media department, filed a police complaint.Gowda on Monday said, “This is an effort to cover up the whole thing. The BJP hatched a conspiracy to cook up a forged document and they have been caught. Now they are trying to browbeat twitter. They have no legal authority to do that.”On Wednesday, a case was registered in Raipur in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh against the state’s former chief minister Raman Singh and other BJP leaders for allegedly promoting enmity by allegedly spreading fake news related to the “toolkit”. In response to a summons from Chattisgarh police, Patra has sought a week’s time. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Patra did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-visit-twitter-offices-in-city-ggm-over-toolkit-case-101621882627682.html
25-05-2021||Other||Minister’s brother appointment row: University VC sends report to governor||LUCKNOW Vice chancellor of Siddharth University, Kapilvastu, Prof Surendra Dubey on Monday confirmed that chancellor governor Anandiben Patel had sought a report about the appointment of state’s basic education minister’s younger brother in the university and said he had sent his report to the governor.The appointment of Arun Kumar, UP’s basic education minister Satish Dwivedi’s brother, as assistant professor in psychology, under the economically weaker section (EWS) quota, had created a political storm with the opposition seeking minister’s resignation on the issue.Arun’s wife is also an assistant professor in another institution, reason why opposition parties claimed that his appointment under EWS quota wasn’t justified. However, the VC said the EWS certificate produced by minister’s brother was issued by the district administration. “If the document submitted by him turns out to be fake, the university will take action against him as per the rules which includes his termination and recovery of salary. Arun joined the university on May 21,” the VC added.“I was not even aware that Arun is the brother of the basic education minister in the UP government,” the VC said adding that though he was aware of viral posts on social media pertaining to minister’s brother appointment, he would order a probe only if asked by a competent authority to do so.“I will order probe only if any competent authority ask me to get the matter investigated. On the basis of social media reports, EWS certificate of the faculty members will not be made public,” the VC said.“Posts were advertised in October or November 2019. Arun used EWS certificate that was valid for a period of one year. The last date for submitting application was December 2019. The scrutiny of the applications got delayed because of pandemic COVID-19 that broke out in March 2020. Subsequently, Arun was appointed by the selection committee in March 2021,” the VC said.Meanwhile district magistrate Siddharth Nagar, Deepak Meena said the certificate of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) that was issued to the minister’s younger brother in 2019 by the district administration was “genuine”.“It was valid for a period of one year. The university concerned must have cross checked its validity when he applied to the post of assistant professor,” the DM said.IPS Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist, Nutan Thakur lodged a complaint with governor Anandiben Patel, who is chancellor of the university, saying that prima facie the minister’s brother used EWS quota to get the job which “looks to be fake” and an inquiry should be set up to settle the dispute.The basic education minister Satish Chand Dwivedi had denied any foul play in his brother’s appointment.“My brother got selected to the post of assistant professor through a fair selection process followed by the university. Anyone having doubts on his selection may seek probe,” the minister said in a video statement.The minister added that he was not involved in the selection process in any way. Asked about his brother using EWS quota, the minister said if a family member is earning well, it doesn’t mean that all members of the family are financially stable.“My brother applied for the post using an income certificate issued by the district administration which must have been checked by the university,” said the minister who represents Itwa constituency in Siddharth Nagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ministers-brother-appointment-row-university-vc-sends-report-to-governor-101621882328169.html

25-05-2021||Noida||Residents push for developing green belt in Sector 77||Residents are demanding that the Noida authority develop a 60-acre plot that is currently a dust bowl located in Sector 77 into a green zone. Sector 77 and adjoining areas are home to a number of high-rises.“We have been pursuing the matter with the authority for quite some time. It will help not just Sector 77 but neighbouring areas as well by reducing dust pollution,” said Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Westeria, Sector 77.Deepak Mittal, a resident of Antriksh Forest in the same sector, said that his high-rise is adjacent to this proposed green belt which he had been seeing barren for over a decade. “Since the area is large with loose soil, whenever wind blows it brings dust directly into our houses,” Mittal said.“The city has seen so many plantation drives. I don’t understand why this (the plot) had been left out. It’s high time that the revival of this green belt is taken seriously,” said Sachin Goyal, a resident of JM Orchid, Sector 76.According to Noida authority officials, the work will begin soon.“We have sent the proposal and the work will begin soon. We will be exploring the option if it should be developed on Miyawaki afforestation method or not. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, many residents have approached us to plant more medicinal and oxygen generating trees like peepal, neem, banyan, and sahajan,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty, public health, Noida authority.The Miyawaki method revives the green cover on degraded land using little water by retaining moisture with help of stubble and straw, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-push-for-developing-green-belt-in-sector-77-101621881909084.html

25-05-2021||Noida||Three recovered Covid patients succumb, families accuse Ghaziabad hospital of negligence||Ghaziabad: Chaotic scenes were witnessed Monday morning at the Sarvodaya Super Speciality and Heart Hospital in Ghaziabad where the families of three post-Covid patients, who died within a short span of each other, allegedly engaged in a spat with the hospital authorities, accusing them of medical negligence. Finally, the police reached the hospital and pacified the families of the victims. The hospital authorities identified the three victims 54-year-old Mona Gambhir and two patients aged 62 years and 52 years. According to the families, the oxygen supply allegedly got disrupted and the hospital authorities were allegedly lax on their part, which they said claimed the lives of the patients. “It is a case of negligence. My nephew was present at the hospital where my sister was under treatment; her oxygen level was 91. On Monday when my nephew went to see her at 8am, she was lying with her mouth open on the bed. She was on a Cpap system with oxygen. The police also arrived,” alleged Tarun Bajaj, Mona’s brother. The Cpap (Continuous positive airway pressure) is used to help patients who have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) breathe with ease during sleep. The machine raises air pressure in the throat so that the airway does not collapse while breathing.“She had been cured of Covid and thereafter, was admitted at the hospital for the past eight-10 days. They first put her on normal oxygen and later on the Cpap system. It is due to negligence of the hospital that patients suffered such a condition,” he alleged further. The families of the other two victims could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that he got in touch with the hospital after the incident. “I spoke to the hospital authorities and have asked for a detailed report. We will get the incident inquired,” he added. According to the medical superintendent of the hospital, following the commotion, the staff at the hospital declined to continue working and had to be put at ease. “The families raised different allegations and all three were post-Covid patients. There was lung involvement and all three patients had developed severe infection. We put them on a ventilator. Both women patients were taken from the Cpap system to a ventilator on Monday and they could not survive. Another male patient was already on a ventilator. Their attendants were also told to shift them to higher centres if they wish,” Dr Manoj Jain, the superintendent of the hospital, said, adding that the three deaths took place within the span of an hour.“They also raised allegations that the oxygen system was not functioning. We have a centralised oxygen supply system and if it developed any fault, other patients, too, would have also suffered complications. However, other patients were not affected. Our staff also got panicked due to the commotion,” he added. The police, meanwhile, said they have not received any complaint so far from the families.“Our team reached the hospital to maintain law and order. We have not received any complaint about the incident so far. In case we get a complaint, we will forward it first to the health department for an inquiry, as per procedure, under sections of medical negligence (if any),” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-recovered-covid-patients-succumb-families-accuse-ghaziabad-hospital-of-negligence-101621881847591.html
25-05-2021||Noida||Noida: Long queue for drive-through vaccination at GIP Mall||A two-kilometer long queue of cars leading up to the GIP Mall in Noida’s Sector 38 was seen on Monday for the drive-through vaccination camp there where the second dose of Covaxin was administered for those who were 45 years and older (45+).The mall’s parking lot has been a vaccination centre since May 22 from 10am to 4pm. Monday’s queue was a first.“The centre has a cap of administering 200 doses a day. However, around 300-350 cars had lined up at the centre. People had started coming at 8am itself,” Praveen Kumar, an official from district administration who was managing the vaccination site, said.Vaccinations here did not require prior booking and were free of cost. Second doses of Covaxin were given at the centre. As per the Cowin dashboard, 192 people were vaccinated at the centre on Monday and a total of 742 people have been vaccinated here since May 22.People who arrived at the centre alleged that some were allowed to walk-in and get their second dose.Shikha Dwivedi, a resident of Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, said she was waiting for her turn since 9.30am. “We waited in the car for six hours to get the shot. But others who came in as late as 2pm simply walked into the centre and got it. There is no one to check whether people are going in by turn or not,” she said.“When people saw that walk-in vaccinations were also taking place, those who were behind us in their vehicles in the queue got down, walked up to the centre and got vaccinated. Officials should have kept a check on this,” said Pankaj Bisht, a resident of Sector 75. Delivery executives were seen delivering food to people waiting in their cars as many ordered meals online. “We came at around 9am and even then, the queue was at least one-and-a-half km long. We hadn’t anticipated this and were not carrying any food so we had to order some for us at 3pm,” said VK Saluja, a resident of Sector 45.Many people had arguments at the centre with security guards as well. “The management should tell people waiting in the queue about the number of vaccines available with them and how many are left. There are still over 50 cars in line awaiting their turn when we walked up to the centre, by which time we got to know that only 10 more doses will be given. How will we get to know this sitting inside the car,” said Vikram Negi, a Sector 119 resident who had come with his mother to get vaccinated.Officials said that tokens will be issued from Tuesday. “We will issue 200 tokens on a first-come, first-serve basis at the centre.

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||FIR against Khanna hospital for overcharging Covid patient||Taking stringent action against fleecing of Covid-19 patients, police have lodged an FIR against Jain Multispeciaty Hospital, Khanna.The hospital was found charging 259% more than the rates fixed by the state government from the family of a Covid patient, who eventually succumbed to the virus.A case under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code; Sections 51 (B) and 58 of the Disaster Management Act; and Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act has been registered against the hospital management following a complaint by Sagar Verma, a resident of Yamunanagar, Haryana.In his complaint to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, Verma alleged that the hospital handed them a bill of ₹8.45 lakh for the treatment of his father, Ashwani Verma, 50, who eventually died. The family managed to pay ₹4.08 lakh, but the hospital demanded full payment.After the deputy commissioner ordered a probe by a committee, it was found that as per government rates fixed for Covid treatment, the actual bill should have been ₹2.35 lakh. On its part, the hospital claimed the huge bill as a “clerical mistake” and the total was actually ₹4.86 lakh, still 106% higher than the government’s guidelines.The inquiry report also established that due to the malpractice of overbilling by the hospital, the complainant shifted his father to another health institution, where he succumbed later.Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said complaints against malpractice by hospitals can be filed on health department’s 104 helpline or to his office. He added that in this hour of distress, the administration will not spare anyone breaching the capped charges for Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fir-against-khanna-hospital-for-overcharging-covid-patient-101621881068235.html
25-05-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad doctors claim ‘yellow fungus’ infection in a post-Covid patient||Doctors at a Ghaziabad private hospital on Monday claimed that one of their patients, a 45-year-old man who had recovered from Covid-19, is diagnosed with mucour scepticus disease, or so-called “yellow fungus”.But the district health department said that they awaited the patient’s histopathological (tissue test) report for confirmation.The patient arrived at the Harsh ENT Hospital at Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC) on Sunday with post-Covid complications.“It is called as yellow fungus as the affected area is yellow in colour and has pus formation below it. It is generally found in reptiles. It was detected through endoscopic examination of the patient’s nose,” Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT surgeon at the hospital.News agency ANI reported that yellow fungus is a fatal disease because it starts internally and therefore it is important to note its symptoms. Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of Delhi’s All India of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said during a Covid-related press briefing in Delhi on Monday that the terms like “black, yellow and white fungus” could mislead and create confusion.“Fungal infections, like black fungus is a different family. Its culture has white coloured fungal colonies and has black dots. So, in general terms it is stated as black fungus. In general, we have mucormycosis (so-called “black fungus”) which is more prevalent nowadays. We also have infections like candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus and histoplasma besides coccidioidomycosis,” he said.He added that most fungal infections nowadays are of mucormycosis and aspergillosis (so-called “white fungus”) with some candida infections as well.“So, it is better we use correct names and labelling the same fungus with names of different colours can create confusion,” Dr Guleria said. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said, “We have spoken to the doctors at the hospital. We are waiting for the histopathological report, expected in a couple of days,” Dr Gupta added.So far, the hospital at RDC, Raj Nagar is treating 27 patients suffering post-Covid complication of mucormycosis and invasive aspergillosis and three of them are stated to be suffering from both.“These are basically different types of fungal infections and nowadays they are generally termed as per their appearance (colour). Yellow fungus infections mostly occur in unhygienic conditions or during humid weather conditions. It can also affect our vital organs and there is also pus formation. Most of the fungal infections occur in immuno-compromised patients or those having prolonged treatment history besides those having diabetes,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar Jain, consultant (ENT), Columbia Asia Hospital at Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-doctors-claim-yellow-fungus-infection-in-a-post-covid-patient-101621879567585.html
