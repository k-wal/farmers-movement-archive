The fresh cases dropped to 582 against 687 cases on Friday while the fatalities went down to 17, from 23 the day before. It is for the first time since May 15 that less than 20 deaths have been reported in the city. The latest fatalities, which include 13 men and four women, have taken the district’s toll to 1,854.The maximum number of deaths include people in their 40s (two deaths), 50s (six deaths), followed by those in their 60s (seven deaths). A 29-year-old male from Sahnewal was the youngest to succumb to the virus in the last 24 hours.Ludhiana now has 9, 355 active cases.Presently, there are 51 patients on ventilators, out of which 28 are from Ludhiana while 23 are from other districts and states.Deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma appealed to residents to adhere to all safety protocols to stay safe in these times.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia expressed respite over the declining number of cases. She said that the curbs imposed by the administration have started showing results.However, she warned people against complacency. “We should make sure to not lose the gains of this lockdown. It is all the more important that we continue adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour, maintain social distance, wear masks, frequently wash hands and avoid going to crowded places,” said Dr Kiran Ahluwalia.3 of a family dead in five daysThe contagion snuffed out the lives of three members of a family in five days in Jagraon.Resident Harvinder Singh said on May 17, his sister-in-law Manpreet Kaur passed away, the next day his younger brother Balwinder Singh succumbed to Covid and on Friday evening, his father Nirmal Singh lost his battle to the virus. Terrified by the deaths, the remaining family members have left the house and are currently taking shelter in an isolation center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-appears-to-recede-with-582-new-cases-17-deaths-in-ludhiana-101621708199419.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Positivity rate drops to 6.6% in Punjab, lowest in 2 months||Even as the number of deaths in Punjab crossed the 200 mark once again on Saturday, the positivity rate in the state has halved in the past ten days. Positive rate is the true indicator of the growth or decline in the spread of an infection, as it is the proportion of people testing positive among all those sampled.On Saturday, the state registered lowest positivity rate in the past two months, with only 6.6% of the samples tested for the virus found positive, as compared to 14.2% on May 12, which was the highest. This drop is coupled with a record 82,097 tests conducted on Saturday.Moreover, it is for the first time in the past one month that none of the districts registered more than 15% positivity rate. Only two districts, Pathankot (10.37%) and Fazilka (10.39%), registered more than 10% positivity rate. In a big sigh of relief, the industrial town of Ludhiana, which at one point was registering highest positivity rate, recorded just 3.9%, lowest after SBS Nagar. 5,421 cases, 201 deathsMeanwhile, the state registered 5,421 fresh cases while 7,363 people recovered from the virus and 201 succumbed to it, bringing down the active case load. Among the fresh cases, 582 surfaced in Ludhiana, followed by 555 in Mohali, 445 in Jalandhar, 411 in Bathinda, 400 in Amritsar, 363 in Patiala and 305 in Muktsar. Bathinda and Patiala registered maximum 20 deaths each, followed by 19 in Amritsar, 17 in Ludhiana, 12 each in Fazilka and Amritsar and nine each in Faridkot, Sangrur and Jalandhar. As many as 7,280 persons were on oxygen support while 381 were on ventilator support on Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/positivity-rate-drops-to-6-6-in-punjab-lowest-in-2-months-101621708079285.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: ACB arrests two cops on corruption charges||The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday arrested an assistant police inspector (API) and a sub-inspector from Dharavi police station for allegedly taking bribe from a private construction contractor to shield him from severe legal action.ACB claimed to have arrested API Prabhakar Joshi, 44, red handed while accepting the bribe amount. ACB officers also arrested sub-inspector Amol Gade, 27, in the case.ACB officers said that the complainant contractor was booked last month by Dharavi police in a case for assaulting a public servant and obstructing him from performing his duty. In this case police had seized ₹40,000 cash and other belongings of the complainant. However, when the complainant recently went to the police station to collect the money and belongings, Gade told him only ₹30,000 was seized from his possession back then. Gade also retained ₹15,000 as bribe and returned only ₹15,000 to the complainant, ACB said.Later, Gade produced the complainant before Joshi, who demanded ₹12,000 for not initiating externment proceeding against him. The complainant then reported the matter to ACB. The agency, after due verification of facts, laid a trap on Friday and arrested Joshi while accepting ₹12,000 bribe from the complainant at the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-acb-arrests-two-cops-on-corruption-charges-101621707958692.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Steel firm directors booked for tax default of ₹92 crore||MRA Marg police booked two directors of a Fort-based steel product manufacturing company for allegedly defaulting ₹92.92 crore worth Sales Tax and Value Added Tax to the state government between 2014 and 18.Chetan Mehta and Mahadev Shringare, directors of Opera Steel Private Limited, have been booked on the complaint of Shrikant Gavare, a sales tax officer. Gavare in his statement to police has stated that the company defaulted in paying the due tax to the state government between 2014 and 18, and that the amount has now become ₹92,92,66,312 with interest and penalty. Various letters, summons, notices, reminders, warning summons and police prosecution notice have been slapped to the company and its directors, but the tax department never received any response from company officials, a police officer said.The company moved the Bombay high court against the tax department’s order, but the same was rejected by the court. They then filed an appeal in higher court and the matter is currently subjudice. But, the court has not passed any stay order on the tax department’s action and the company, too, had not approached the department with any court order. As per the first information report (FIR), a copy of which is with HT, tax officials also claimed that sufficient time and fair opportunity was given to the company for paying the tax, but they failed to do so. “From this, it prima facie appears that the accused company and its directors have committed an offence as per section 74(2) of the Value Added Tax Act, 2002,” Gavare said in the police complaint. Hence, as a last resort, the department on Thursday registered a criminal case against two directors of the company under sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, section 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act and 74(2) of the Value Added Tax Act, 2002. The police are now going through the document and communication details submitted by the complainant. The accused would soon be summoned for questioning, and if they fail to respond to the summons they may face arrest, another police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-steel-firm-directors-booked-for-tax-default-of-92-crore-101621707898766.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||I jumped holding hands of my cousins but lost them to the sea, recalls P305 tragedy survivor||Udaram Meghawal was visibly upset and infuriated when he started arguing with a guard at Sir JJ Hospital mortuary on Friday evening. “Show me the mark of cut on the shoulder and the lost finger,” he insisted when the guard and a policeman asked him to check if a body of a matching height and built was that of his elder son, Amararam, 40.The 65-year-old from a remote village in Pali district of Rajasthan was unable to cope with the news that he had lost both his sons — Amararam and Pappuram, 32 — in barge Papaa305 or P305 tragedy.However, the guard informed him that such marks will not be visible, as the body was swollen due to drowning. Meghawal reluctantly took three rounds of the mortuary and examined the body again and again, but did not identify the body as that of his elder son.“My world is devastated and I am feeling as if all my cognitive functions are dead,” said Meghawal. He said he was “afraid of facing his two daughters-in-law and their four children aged between three and 11 years”. What bothered him the most was this: “Now, who will provide for them, who will take care of them?”He left the hospital mortuary late on Friday evening with the body of Pappuram and performed last rites on Saturday afternoon at his hometown. Now, one of his nephews will visit the mortuary on Sunday to ascertain if any of new the bodies at the mortuary is that of Amararam.Both Amararam and Pappuram were working on P305 along with their cousin Mahendra Ranawat, 19. All three of them had jumped in the sea around 4pm on Monday (May 17) when water had entered the ill-fated accommodation barge and it was about to sink. Ranawat was rescued by INS Kochi, 16 hours later at 8am on Tuesday, while Pappuram’s body was recovered during search and rescue operation and Amararam is still missing.“Amararam and Pappuram were doing piping work on the barge when they took me on the ship as a helper, said Mahendra. The 19-year-old comes from a farming family and is one of the five siblings — two elder sisters and two younger brothers. After completing Class 12, he decided to work to help his father financially for his sister’s marriage. Pappuram brought him to Mumbai and after completing paperwork, they went on to the barge on November 4. His salary was being deposited in his father’s bank account to ensure maximum savings.Ranawat said that on May 15 all of them were informed about the incoming cyclone. On Sunday evening, wind speed started increasing and the gusty sound gave an indication of what lied ahead. The crew members were, however, not mentally prepared for what happened next. All eight anchor cables of the barge gave way by Monday morning, leaving the barge at the mercy of the stormy weather. The barge drifted and hit a platform; soon water started entering the barge from the damaged side and the vessel began tilting, said Ranawat, adding that by 2pm on Monday water level reached the deck and crew members started jumping in the choppy sea. Following suit, he and his two cousins jumped in the sea together so as to avoid drifting at 4pm, about an hour before the barge capsized. “However, as we jumped from the barge, water gushed in the wind pipe of Pappuram and he started gasping for breath,” said the 19-year-old. “We tried to help him stay above water level, but the high waves made it difficult and eventually Pappuram breathed his last around 6.30pm.”Ranawat and Amararam, however, continued to hold hands. “Both of us were crying and pleading for help,” said Ranawat who, around three hours later, realised that Amararam’s movement stopped. As wind speed increased further and waves roared higher, he got separated from his cousins and drifted away.Exhausted and famished due to the rough seas and lack of food since Sunday afternoon, he again saw Pappuram floating a few metres away from him. He tried to reach Pappuram, but couldn’t because of the high waves. Completely helpless and alone, the 19-year-old let the sea take him wherever it wished and floated with the help of the life-jacket. Around 8am on Tuesday, May 18, the naval ships engaged in search and rescue operation noticed Ranawat and rescued him. He was one of the 125 survivors brought to Mumbai by INS Kochi on May 19.“I had lost all my belongings. I remembered the mobile number of a cousin who lives in Pune. I called and informed him about the incident,” he said, with tears rolling down his eyes. The cousin then informed their family about the tragedy. Meghawal said he came to Mumbai by train after hearing about the incident and reached the city on May 21. He directly went to the Sir JJ Hospital with one of his nephews, Kishor Ranawat, and shortly identified the body of his younger son, Pappuram.“Nothing can be more burdensome and agonizing than the bereavement of one’s own children,” said Kishor, adding, “Now we have to bear the grief and sorrow of the death my brothers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/i-jumped-holding-hands-of-my-cousins-but-lost-them-to-the-sea-recalls-p305-tragedy-survivor-101621707839980.html

The authorities are now trying to establish the identity by matching it with the identification marks of missing crew members. Raigad superintendent of police Ashok Dudhe said, “The first body was found at Murud beach on Friday evening, following which Yellow gate police station and ONGC officials were alerted. On Saturday morning, two more were found from Nagaon beach and one from Sasawne beach in Alibag taluka. Decomposed and bloated, the bodies are beyond identification.” All four are suspected to be in their 40s. Of the four of them, three had no garments on the body when found ashore while one of them found at Nagaon had a jacket like clothing on the body. The bodies have been sent to Alibag civil hospital for post-mortem. “We are in touch with ONGC officials and Yellow Gate police. Till now, they have not been identified. We have been provided with a list of people missing from the barge along with their identification marks. We are trying to match them with the bodies to establish their identity. If the clothes would have been intact, identifying would have been easier,” Dudhe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/four-bodies-found-along-raigad-beaches-suspected-to-be-of-those-missing-from-barge-p305-101621707839304.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi records 3.58% positivity rate, lowest cases since March 31||With 2,269 new cases of Covid-19, Delhi reported the lowest daily incidence of the viral infection in 52 days on Saturday, and the positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive – dropped to 3.58%, a figure, experts said, showed the fourth wave was gradually coming under control in the national capital.The Capital has been under a lockdown for a month; the “last resort” step was taken after a massive surge in infections overwhelmed the health care infrastructure and resulted in shortages of essential supplies such as medical oxygen and life-saving drugs.In April, Delhi reported its worst surge of Covid-19, with the number of cases recorded in a single day shooting up to over 28,000 and the positivity rate to 36%, meaning more than one in three people tested were found to have the infection. It has now reduced to around one in 33 tested people having the infection.Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore, said the government should now focus on vaccinating a significant proportion of the population to prevent a third wave.With reports of a shortage of vaccines for those between the ages of 18 and 44 years, the number of jabs given in Delhi almost halved on Saturday. About 50,000 jabs were administered, according to the official health bulletin; the daily jabs crossed 100,000 a day after the vaccination was opened up for the younger population in the Capital.“Some curbs have to remain – malls, gyms, cinemas, weddings any place where people gather. With a large number of people exposed to the infection, there might not be a surge for the next few months... this time needs to be utilised to vaccinate a significant proportion of the people,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.He added: “In the absence of vaccines, the government also needs to see whether it is prepared with beds and oxygen needed in case there is a surge again.”On Saturday, Delhi reported 182 deaths due to the viral infection, dipping below the 200 mark for the first time in 34 days. However, with fewer cases and a high number of deaths still being reported, the seven day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has shot up to 6.15%. The cumulative CFR – based on the total number of cases and deaths reported so far – is at 1.63%, higher than the national average of 1.1%.As per the latest health bulletin, the new fatalities pushed the death toll due to Covid-19 in the national capital to 23,013. The number of daily cases in the city was 2,260, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Twitter, adding: “These are lowest numbers after 31 March. Still need to take all precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-delhi-records-3-58-positivity-rate-lowest-cases-since-march-31-101621707533292.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Incidents of wild animals drowning in wells is a matter of concern for experts, activists||Since April 15 this year, 11 wild animals have drowned in open wells in Maharashtra. These include two tiger cubs, a family of four sloth bears (with two cubs), a jackal, one blackbuck, a jungle cat, a leopard and a nilgai. Another 33 animals, including 10 wild boar, 16 nilgai, a tiger cub, a rock python and a leopard, were rescued from open wells during the same period, according to data with the forest department, and independent logs maintained by Satpuda Foundation — an Amravati-based wildlife conservation group.All incidents, barring two leopards in Pune’s Junnar taluka, occurred in agricultural fields in Vidarbha districts, within or close to buffer areas around tiger reserves. Earlier, in January 2021, a gaur (Indian bison) in Mahabaleshwar was rescued from a 50-foot-deep well. In November last year, a striped hyena had also been rescued by a volunteer group from an uncovered well in Ane village near Otur, Junnar. A SIMPLE FIX?Experts and activists expressed concern at the frequency of such incidents. These may not pose a significant conservation risk, but are easily preventable with little logistical support.“A few leopards or bears drowning in wells every year is not going to make a huge dent in their overall population. Human beings kill wild animals in larger numbers through various other means. But in this case, the solution is apparently quite simple — you just have to cover the well,” said Dr Aniruddha Belsare, a wildlife veterinarian, conservation researcher and disease ecologist who has previously studied human-leopard conflict in Maharashtra. Another “no-cost band-aid” solution, he said, would be providing “jugaad ladders” in these open wells that animals can use to get out.And yet, animals have been dying in this manner for decades, exclaimed Bandu Dhotre, a Chandrapur-based wildlife activist and non-government member of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL). Satpuda Foundation, for example, has scattered records of bears, deer, nilgai, leopards and tigers drowning in irrigation canals and tube-wells going back to 2011.In 2012, when Dhotre had staged a hunger strike in front of the forest department’s district headquarters for better protection of tigers around protected areas in Vidarbha, one of his demands was that open wells in buffer areas be covered.“This has been done at a lot of places around Tadoba Tiger Reserve where the wells are now covered with wire mesh or fenced. But we’ve started seeing such accidents in places where they were not happening earlier,” said Dhotre, referring to the recent casualties.While Dhotre speculated that wild animals in these areas may be expanding their ranges, leading them to agricultural fields and eventually to uncovered wells, experts cautioned against accepting this hypothesis without further study.Nevertheless, activists, experts and even officials agreed that such deaths are likely being grossly underreported. “We only hear about it when a large or exotic animal dies in this manner in areas where the forest department is active. But you cannot track every casualty. There are still places remote enough, and animals that are not glamorous enough, that we may never see the full scale of the problem,” said Kishor Rithe, head of Satpuda Foundation and a non-government member of SBWL.ANIMALS LIKELY ENDURE PROLONGED DISTRESSThough experts, particularly wildlife veterinarians, cautioned against anthropomorphising these accidents, they conceded that most animals that drown in wells are sure to have experienced painful and prolonged deaths. A veterinarian who has conducted dozens of post-mortems for such cases said he first looks to an animal’s claws for such indications.“One of the first things I check is nails. I’ve seen leopards and bears where the animal has struggled so much, trying to grab onto something, that their sharp nails become extremely blunt. It really gives you a sense of how much the animal has struggled,” said Dr Nikhil Bangar, veterinarian at the Mandikoh Leopard Rehabilitation Centre in Junnar. Even Belsare, who was more reluctant to use words like pain and suffering in this context, said, “Most wild animals are great swimmers. They will do all they can to stay afloat, before they develop hypothermia, fatigue and other medical conditions leading to drowning. These deaths are not instant, or easy , and often involve prolonged stress.”Though forest department officials did not share post-mortem reports of the 11 casualties referred to at the outset of this report (citing confidentiality), the cause of death in all cases has been attributed to drowning, they confirmed. This is done on the basis of a simple forensic test, in which a small piece of lung tissue is set in a glass of water. “If the tissue floats, the animal did not drown. It may have been poisoned, poached and then thrown into the well, opening up another line of investigation. But if the lung sinks, it means the animal did indeed drown,” Dr Belsare explained. But, he also emphasised that the process of drowning itself is not as simple as the test which confirms it. There is, in fact, a more complex sequence of events that eventually culminates in death for the animal.HT also spoke to a wildlife veterinarian currently employed with the forest department at a tiger reserve in Vidarbha who has conducted post-mortems in such cases for all manner of wildlife, including leopards, sub-adult tigers, bears and deer. “In case of drownings, we do not typically ask questions beyond the lung test. It is time consuming and we need specialised vets to conduct post-mortems and interpret the data. The drowning conclusion may be reductive, but further investigation is not encouraged.”THE MECHANISM OF DROWNINGFrom a coroner’s perspective, one of the first physiological responses an animal might experience in such a case is hypothermia, followed by exhaustion. “There could be a drop in body temperature due to the water, and as the animal struggles to stay afloat there will be a build-up of lactic acid in the muscles. Eventually the airway will become submerged as fatigue sets in. Water will enter the lungs, causing air-hunger, leading to asphyxiation,” said Dr Naveen Pandey, wildlife veterinarian with the Corbett Foundation. .Metabolic changes that occur during drowning may also cause cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. “Sometimes, in case of more delicate animals like deer, the creature may even die before asphyxiation. In this case we look for certain lesions on the heart called petechial haemarroaghes, which broadly indicate cardiac arrest,” said Pandey. A drowning animal may develop a range of other conditions in combination with one another, from aspiration pneumonia which is caused by entry of oral or gastric contents into the lungs, to pulmonary edemas where air sacs in the lungs fill up with fluid, explained wildlife veterinarians who spoke to HT for this story. Experts described five broad stages of this process — struggling; violent intentional movement and breathlessness; deep respiratory movements, swallowing of water, immobility and convulsions; loss of corneal reflexes and hampered vision; and slowing down of respiratory movements, unconsciousness, and finally drowning.“During the first phase, the muscles get overworked. In the second phase, the animals may experience laryngospasms, where the trachea involuntarily closes. As the animal struggles to breathe, respiratory acidosis occurs when the body is not able to remove carbon dioxide due to a lack of oxygen. Then oxygen depletion leads to unconsciousness, and this further allows water to enter the lungs and airways, making them bulky and distended. Lungs get inflammation, leading to pneumonia-like conditions and pulmonary edemas,” said Dr Bangar.Eventually, the lack of oxygen leads to irreversible brain damage, putting the animal in a coma. “No longer able to struggle or see, the animal drowns. But as I’ve said, there is a lot that happens before that final moment of death,” he added. A 2016 paper in the peer-reviewed journal Veterinary Pathology describes the process as such: “The drowning process is complex, involving sequential, concurrent and overlapping cardiorespiratory reflexes, electrolyte and blood gas abnormalities, aspiration and swallowing of liquid, vomition, struggling, involuntary movements and physical exhaustion, breathlessness, or air-hunger, eventually culminating in death.” ADMINISTRATIVE WILL REQUIREDSince 2011, there have been at least three general resolutions (GR) passed at the state level pertaining to joint forest management practices in wildlife dense areas which have recommended that wildlife-proofing of wells be expedited in protected and non-protected areas. The latest of these was passed by the forest department under Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherji Jan Van Vikas Yojana in August 2015.“As per these GRs, zilla parishads are tasked with the responsibility of covering open wells. An amendment to the last GR in 2017 even devolved powers to the forest department to take up the issue, but the administration has been extremely slow on the uptake. Meanwhile, animals continue to drown, and we simply write them off with obligatory post-mortems,” said Rithe.Responding to these concerns, Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests (Maharashtra), drew attention to various administrative challenges faced by the department. The main issue, he said, is that these wells are located outside the boundaries of protected areas, where the forest department has no administrative jurisdiction. Moreover, there is no legal consequence for an individual, say a farmer, who leaves their well uncovered, causing death of an animal.“Many of these wells are built under various government schemes, which do not have strict mandates for protection of wildlife. But we are making efforts to plug the gaps. We regularly raise the issue with zila parishads. In Bhandara, where two tiger cubs drowned in a siphon well this month, we have identified 32 such wells and temporarily covered 28 of them. The irrigation department has been instructed to find a permanent solution,” said Kakodkar.Experts, on the other hand, were not inclined to laud these measures. “It is just a hole in the ground. The fact that stakeholders have still not found a way to just cover them up strikes me as extremely lazy,” said Dr Belsare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/incidents-of-wild-animals-drowning-in-wells-is-a-matter-of-concern-for-experts-activists-101621707778667.html
22-05-2021||Other||Ludhiana’s MD Oswal Hospital resumes vaccination, 5 more pvt ones to follow suit from May 28||In a relief for vaccine aspirants complaining of huge rush at government session sites, Mohan Dai Oswal hospital resumed Covid-19 vaccinations on Saturday after receiving a fresh stock of 2,000 Covishield doses. The hospital is charging ₹850 from each beneficiary for the two doses. Five other private hospitals, including Dayanand Medical College & Hospital (DMCH), SPS Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Deep Hospital and Verma Multispeciality, are also set to resume vaccinations from May 28 when they are expected to receive fresh stocks from the Serum Institute of India. Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital is to receive 10,000 more doses on the day. Private hospitals had to suspend vaccination drives in late April as the district administration fell short of its vaccine stock, prompting it to reserve the doses only for government session sites. This resulted in heavy rush at government-run vaccination sites in the city. The problem compounded when the government began vaccinating the 18 to 44 age group from May 9. The rush was so overwhelming that the health department was forced to cancel the pre-registration of slots done by residents through the CoWin app. Inaugurating the vaccination drive at Mohan Dai Oswal hospital on Saturday, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma and police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal urged residents to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that herd immunity is achieved against Covid-19. The DC said that a fresh batch of 1.12 lakh doses will reach six private hospitals on May 28. Of these, 50,000 doses would reach DMCH, 25,000 will be for SPS Hospital, 10,000 for Fortis Hospital, 10,000 more for Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital, 15,000 for Deep Hospital and 2,000 at Verma Multispeciality hospital. He said residents can get themselves vaccinated at these private hospitals by paying a nominal charge, whereas in government facilities, the jabs are completely free. He said MD Oswal Hospital is charging ₹850 from each beneficiary, whereas at other hospitals, the cost may vary. He informed that these private hospitals have sourced the vaccine directly from the Serum Institute of India at their own cost. He urged all private hospitals to source this vaccine and if any hospital is interested in book vaccine doses, they can contact Sandeep Kumar, ADC, development, Ludhiana. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the district administration plans to vaccinate each and every eligible person by June 15. Enquiries pouring in, say private hospitals Private hospitals in the city have already started receiving enquires from residents eager to get themselves vaccinated. Dr Anurag Chaudhary, head of the department of community medicine at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said most of the queries are coming from senior citizens who are wary of visiting crowded vaccination centres. “We are expecting to receive a fresh lot of vaccine on May 28. Once the vaccine is available, requisite arrangements will be made to vaccinate the maximum number of people without causing crowding at centers. Residents can book their slots through CoWin app. We will soon share the helpline numbers through which residents can seek help in booking the slots,” said Dr Chaudhary. Dr Baldeep Singh, MD of Deep Hospital in Model Town, said “We are encouraging group vaccination. We have received queries about the vaccines from industry and other establishments. Due to lockdown, commuting is a major challenge. Further, crowding at hospitals is another problem as it comes with a risk of infection. So we are encouraging group vaccinations wherein a doctor and a staff nurse will visit a location and vaccinate people there.” Munish Dogra, a hosiery owner, welcomed the development. “The price of vaccines could be debated upon, but there are two ways to look at it. The rate of the vaccine could be looked at from different perspectives. One can find the vaccine expensive. But if one considers spending ₹2,000 on two jabs of vaccine that could save the life, then it is cheap.” Surinder Kaur, 63, a resident of Field Gunj said the resumption of vaccination drives at private hospitals would be a huge respite for many elderly like her. “This is a great move. I was worried about the rush at government sites. “ Ludhiana Inc books vaccine worth ₹1 crore Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said city-based industrialists have booked Covid vaccine worth over ₹1 crore from Serum Institute of India to vaccinate their employees and family members. He said the doses would reach the city soon after which special camps will be organised at premises of the respective units. High drama over special treatment to VIPHigh drama was witnessed at a vaccination site located in a school at BRS Nagar this afternoon when people queuing up for the vaccine caught the healthcare staff jabbing a VIP inside his car parked outside the vaccination centre. A woman standing in the queue reportedly grabbed a healthcare staffer by the arm and snatched the injections kept in her pocket. Soon others surrounded the health department employee and began protesting. As the situation started turning ugly, the health department employee first ran back to the vaccination centre but found the door bolted then ran towards her car and fled the scene.

The amount will be encashed after six months if the civic body fails to start disposing of the legacy waste.The failure of the MC in dealing with over 16 lakh tonnes of accumulated garbage at the main dumpsite situated at Tajpur Road is taking a toll on the residents here. Citing groundwater contamination in the 2km area surrounding the landfill site, the monitoring committee also ordered a ban on further construction of colonies there.A virtual meeting of the monitoring committee headed by chairman Justice (retd) Jasbir Singh was held on Friday.While the civic body was directed to provide alternate sources of potable water to the residents already residing in these areas, the PPCB was directed to seek environmental compensation from MC for its failure to deal with the legacy waste. Further, the civic body was directed to commence the operations of the construction and demolition waste plant in the city within three months, failing which, it’ll have to pay a penalty of ₹2 lakh.PPCB senior environmental engineer Sandeep Bahl said that the PPCB had collected groundwater samples in the past and had found that the water in the area was contaminated. Environmental compensation will be sought from MC as directed by the monitoring committee, he added. Meanwhile, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that the civic body has already initiated the process to deal with legacy waste and 5 lakh tonnes of garbage will be disposed of in the first phase of the project which is being taken up under the Smart City Mission.“We are working on establishing the construction and demolition waste plant and achieving the target of 100% waste segregation in the city. We will take required steps to stop further construction of colonies in the area and provide potable water to the residents as ordered by the monitoring committee,” said Sabharwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngt-rap-ludhiana-to-submit-rs-5-lakh-to-ppcb-for-legacy-waste-101621706939505.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Look after pilots who have lost lives due to Covid: Air India pilots||After Air India pilots recently lost three senior pilots to Covid-19, the Indian Pilots Guild, a Boeing pilot’s union of Air India wrote to their chairman requesting to immediately provide a befitting compensation to their colleagues who have died due to infection. They also requested to immediately attend to and mend the gap in the company’s HR policy so that their family will be looked after by the airline, in case the worst happens to one of them.Late Capt. Prasad had operated San Francisco-Bangalore, landed on April 15, 2021, and travelled as staff on duty to Mumbai. He was shifted to a Mumbai-based hospital after he tested positive, but gradually his condition worsened and succumbed to the virus on May 9.Stating a staff notice dated July 17, 2020, that pays ₹10 lakhs to a pilot who dies of Covid-19, the pilots pointed out that this is the only measure Air India takes to compensate the next of kin of an active employee who lost life due to Covid-19, in the line of duty.“Whilst the intent of the company may be good, let us not overlook the reality of the situation. Nationwide, PSU’s (public sector undertakings) have policies in place for such tragedies. Ex-gratia payment and compassionate employment being the most common. Why is Air India the only PSU that is relatively complacent towards compensation in the case of the death of an employee? We were surprised to learn that a well-respected Indian private airline runs a benevolent scheme with its employees where it covers a deceased pilot to the sum of ₹5 crores in case of death. Why can’t the flag carrier create and provide something similar?,” said an IPG pilot.“The Central government has an active scheme called Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package insurance scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19. Why shouldn’t something similar be offered to a serving PSU employee,” he added.The unions asked the airline about the steps being taken by Air India to ensure the aircrew/employees will be taken care of in case Covid-19 is contracted. They also questioned, how will the next kin be looked after in the unfortunate event of the demise of an employee.Three senior Air India commanders have lost their lives to Covid in a span of five days in this month - Capt. Amitesh Prasad, Capt. Sandeep Rana and Capt. GPS Gill. “The gravity of the situation will amass when one is to note that a total of three active pilots in Air India lost their lives to Covid-19 under similar circumstances within five days, between the 9th and the 14th of April, 2021..we request you to immediately attend to and mend this dismaying gap in the company’s HR policy so that we may know that our loved ones will be looked after by our company should the worst happen to one of us,” the letter concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/look-after-pilots-who-have-lost-lives-due-to-covid-air-india-pilots-101621706197736.html

Of them, 108 have lost both their parents, the task forces appointed by the state government informed.After the Supreme Court (SC) directives taking cognisance of the reports in the social media that children orphaned after losing their parents due to the virus were being illegally adopted, the state government’s woman and child welfare department (WCD) formed task forces in every (36) district to identify such children two weeks ago.This was to ensure that the orphaned children are in safe custody and are given their financial and property right. The step also assures that the children are safeguarded from illegal custody and trafficking.The task forces have found at least 195 such children in the state have lost their parents, of them, 108 have been orphaned after losing both their parents. 42 children have been brought to the child care institutes (CCIs) run by the state government.According to the figures collated by the WCD, Mumbai had no such children, while Nandurbar had the highest 93 children, of which 66 have lost both their parents. Hingoli, Jalna and Gondia have 18, 16 and 12 children who have lost one of their parents. Thane has 11 children who have lost both their parents due to the Covid-19.WCD minister Yashomati Thakur said that the number of affected children is expected to be 400 in the state. “We have galvanised the machinery to take care of all these children with the help of the child care institutes we have at district levels. First, we try to give the children family parenting with the help of Bal Sangopan and foster parenting schemes. If that is not possible then these children are brought to the child care institutes. We have increased the age limit of their stay in these institutions to 23 years from 18 years so that they are protected until they stand on their feet. We are guardians of these children and will continue to take their care,” Thakur said.The district administrations have started visiting their houses to take review and extend the help required by the children.“As the basic principle of the Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act), we prefer the custody to be retained by the extended family of the children who lost both their parents. Family care is important for their upbringing. Such children in custody with relatives like uncle or grandparents are given financial assistance of ₹1,125 per month under our Bal Sangopan scheme. In case such custody in the extended family is not possible, the children are brought to CCIs by following due process,” said an official from the department.In a government resolution issued on May 11, the state government has made it mandatory for the hospitals to note the information from the Covid-19 patients about their minor children about their custody during the treatment. The districts level task forces, headed by district collectors, have been assigned with the task to keep a tab of the custody of the children of the parents admitted for treatment or in case of their deaths. The task force has also been directed to take steps to avoid any illegal adoption and extending legal aid to such children to protect their rights. The GR also has mandated counselling wherever required.Manisha Birasis, assistant commissioner, woman and child development department, said that the district level task forces will take care of the legal rights of the children. “The GR is self-explanatory on various fronts. It also has stated how to safeguard the rights of the children in a property once they attain a majority of their age. The district authorities will ensure that their property rights are not entangled in family disputes,” she said.The WCD has also directed the district authorities to take action against the people involved in the illegal adoption of such children. Cases have been filed in such attempts under various sections of the JJ Act and Indian Penal Code.Besides this, the department has also directed the district administrations to extend the counselling to women who have lost their spouse due to Covid-19. “Such women can be given aid through 130 counselling centres and 31 shelter homes for women in the state,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/195-children-lost-one-parent-to-covid-108-lost-both-maharashtra-task-forces-101621705274619.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Two accountants of Mumbai hospitals siphon off ₹5.23 crore, one held||The Bhoiwada police have arrested an accountant of Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital for allegedly siphoning off nearly ₹5.23 crore from the hospital trust’s bank account. The accused used bogus signatures of the hospital’s deans and transferred money in 25 other bank accounts. According to police, the accused have been siphoning off money for the past 11 years and is believed to have invested the amount in lands in rural areas.Ex-assistant accountant Rajan Rawool has been arrested on Thursday and presently in police custody, while the main accused ex-accountant Shripad Desai is still at large. “We shall soon arrest him in the case,” said Vijay Patil, deputy commissioner of police, zone 4.The matter came to the light after a secretary in the Trust Sandhya Kamath raised suspicion over a cheque. She then got a preliminary forensic audit done. After discovering huge irregularities, she informed the concerned officials, following which, Desai and Rawool were sacked from the service last year. But as the two assured that they would return the money, an immediate police complaint was not lodged. But after waiting for five months KEM’S Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh finally lodged an FIR with the police recently. Desai and Rawool have been employed with Diamond Jubilee Society Trust, which was established by Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital to provide medical relief and undertake development, research programmes in health services, medicine, applied science and upgrading healthcare facilities to various sectors of the society. The trust receives government funds for medical researches, donations from foreign countries. These funds are further used for research purposes and charity for helping poor medical students.“Since 2009, the two have been forging signatures of the KEM Hospital’s deans and indulging in misappropriation of funds. So far probe has revealed that they forged signatures of at least two deans including Dr Avinash Supe,” said inspector Sushil Gaikwad of Bhoiwada police station.They transferred money to 25 bank accounts belonging to various people known to them. Details of these bank accounts are being obtained, Gaikwad said.Desai and Rawool have been booked on the charges of cheating forgery, criminal breach of trust by an employee. Desai has been summoned for questioning, the police said. “We would be investigating how they managed to hide such huge irregularities and no one noticed it. We will find out how they used to dodge the regular auditing,” Gaikwad said.Rawool has been sent to police custody up to May 27 by a local court on Friday, Gaikwad added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-accountants-of-mumbai-hospitals-siphon-off-5-23-crore-one-held-101621705498456.html

22-05-2021||Mumbai||IIP Dehradun sets up compact oxygen plant at Pune for treating Covid-19 patients||As several parts of the country struggle with a shortage of oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients, CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun, has set up a compact medical oxygen plant in Pune that can be configured for monitoring in real-time.The plant, an upgraded version of the traditional pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, was started on Friday at the Aundh Chest Hospital, Pune. By adding a vacuum element to the PSA technology, scientists at IIP, a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), an autonomous body under the Government of India, have been able to make the plant more compact, more efficient and operationally economical. “The PVSA innovation is intended to support the national crisis response to the pandemic. A compact oxygen plant will require less energy and less space. Such a smaller machine is ideal for hospitals where space is a constraint,” said Anjan Ray, director of CSIR-IIP, who led a team of nearly a dozen people involved in various aspects of the project. The oxygen purity level of this system was found to be 96%, as against the medical requirement of 90-96%.The unit was fabricated by CSIR-IIP’s licensee and engineering partner, Gaskon Engineers, in New Delhi. Bharat Forge Ltd, a Pune-based engineering company, helped integrate the new plant with the hospital’s ongoing oxygen supply network. The CSIR team from National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, provided on-ground expertise to ensure oxygen purity, flow rate and pressure were delivered to patient requirements.Nitin Bilolikar, civil surgeon of Pune and joint head of the health department of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) confirmed that the oxygen plant has been set up at Aundh Chest Hospital and attached to the supply for patients.In a regular PSA system, the air is sucked in, pressurised and passed over adsorbents that can separate nitrogen and other component gases. The purified oxygen is then supplied to oxygen tanks and cylinders. However, the adsorbents or molecular sieves which trap the nitrogen, have to release this nitrogen (“desorb”) towards the end of each cycle so that fresh air can be taken in again for separation. This is a time-consuming process.“Vacuum is one of the best ways of rapid desorption, enabling the bed of sieves to be emptied of the adsorbed nitrogen. Compared to PSA systems that simply depressurise for nitrogen release, vacuum makes the system more efficient. The advantage is at a very molecular level,” said Ray.For every 100 molecules of oxygen present in the air taken in by a traditional PSA system, around 15 molecules of pure oxygen is generated. The PVSA, on the other hand, can deliver 30-35 oxygen molecules per 100, Ray explained.“Professor Ray had sent a plant to Pune and our job was to enhance the performance of the plant for improved reliability of oxygen supply and safe connectivity to patients,” said Moonish Ghuge, vice president, Kalyani Centre for Technology and Innovation, the research and development wing of Bharat Forge. Ghuge and his team ran the plant in their lab for 72 hours and simulated situations to ensure the supply was consistent and a failure would not affect patients. Another feature of the system is that it can be monitored remotely. “The system works on the principle of Internet of Things. The idea is to get the system to talk to us and give us real-time analysis. This will help us in predictive maintenance and for further design improvements over time,” said Ray, adding that a patent has been filed for the system.The PVSA system is supported with the principles of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), which is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces (GUI) for high-level process supervisory management.“While the first unit at Aundh was set up as a field demonstration unit and first run for several months on the CSIR-IIP campus at Dehradun, we plan to scale it up and deploy larger sizes of 500 LPM and more over the next few months. The long-term goal is to build an intelligent oxygen delivery and management network,” said Ray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iip-dehradun-sets-up-compact-oxygen-plant-at-pune-for-treating-covid-19-patients-101621705139655.html

Overall, Mumbai has conducted a total of 6,048,686, with a positivity rate of 11.4%. within the past week, Mumbai’s positivity rate has dropped below 5%, in contrast to April when it was as high as 20%. Positivity rate is the number of positive cases as a per cent of total Covid-19 tests done. Four wards in Mumbai has more than 2,000 active Covid cases, as per data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), corresponding to areas of Andheri East, Andheri West, Borivli, and Kandivli. Eleven wards have more than 1,000 active cases. The least number of active cases are in the B ward (167) corresponding to areas of Mohammad Ali Road and Pydhonie, followed by the C ward (197), corresponding to areas of Marine lines, in south Mumbai. Fifteen wards have a growth rate over Mumbai’s average growth rate of 0.22% with wards corresponding to Colaba and Byculla area showing the highest growth rate, and wards corresponding to Mulund and Marine Lines showing the lowest growth rate. On Saturday, 1,827 positive patients recovered or were discharged from hospitals post-recovery. Mumbai now has a recovery rate of 93% that had dipped to below 85% in April, when the city was reporting around 8,000 new cases per day. The doubling rate in Mumbai has now gone up to 326 days. Doubling rate is the number of days taken for present Covid-19 cases to double. Meanwhile, Mumbai has 62 containment zones which are slums or chawls, and 246 sealed buildings at present. Of the 22,090 Covid beds in hospitals across Mumbai, 13,729 are vacant.

22-05-2021||Ranchi||Petition moved in J’khand HC for CBI probe into woman cop’s death||Main opposition BJP’s legislature party leader Babulal Marandi on Saturday demanded that the state government immediately recommend CBI probe in the death case of Sahibganj police officer Rupa Tirkey, claiming that people do not have faith in the probe conducted by local police that was working allegedly under influence of Pankaj Mishra, the assembly representative of chief minister Hemant Soren. The former chief minister said Tirkey’s family members and the tribal society in general have been repeatedly demanding a CBI probe in the matter, as “police officials in Sahibganj were acting as Mishra’s henchmen”. “It’s baffling as to why the state government is not recommending a CBI probe in the death case despite repeated demands by the family and tribal society. The family and people in general do not have trust in police investigation, as the police department is behaving like Mishra’s henchmen. Soon after her death, Tirkey’s mother filed a complaint and named three persons, including Mishra. However, the police instead filed a case against unknown persons and did not even question Mishra,” said Marandi, adding that the CM should immediately recommend a probe by the central agency in the matter. Addressing media persons at the party office, few audio clips associated with Mishra were also played by the BJP leader to establish the power that the CM’s assembly representative wields in Sahibganj district. The CM’s assembly Barhait falls in Sahibganj district. The BJP leader said they will continue to raise their demand, and if required, they will also approach court for the purpose. Tirkey, in her first posting as Mahila police station in-charge, was found hanging in mysterious circumstances at her official residence on May 3. Following this, her family lodged a complaint with police and named three persons--two of Tirkey’s female colleagues, and Mishra. Mishra, however, has maintained that he played no role in the case and was open to probe.Later, police investigation established the case as that of suicide, and arrested a male sub-inspector, who was allegedly in a romantic relationship with Tirkey, in the matter. Besides the BJP, several other leaders, including those from the ruling party, have demanded CBI probe in the case. Congress legislator Bandhu Tirkey has been a vocal proponent of the same. He also met CM Soren earlier this week and reiterated his demand. Reacting to Marandi’s demand, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya described it as “hollow”. “We have always maintained that justice will be ensured by the government in the case, irrespective of whosoever is guilty. An SIT is already probing the case. After that if people are not satisfied, then we will give it to whichever agency for which demand is made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/petition-moved-in-j-khand-hc-for-cbi-probe-into-woman-cop-s-death-101621703458344.html
22-05-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Nearly 50% drop in Covid cases, deaths last week||Jharkhand, for the first time after a hiatus of one-and-a-half months, felt some relief in the third week (May 15-21) of this month as weekly detection of Covid-19 cases and deaths registered a significant decline by around 50% in comparison to the previous week. While 33,962 cases were reported in the second week of this month between May 8-14, the third week registered a decline by nearly 50% with the discovery of 17,011 cases. The number of deaths too declined by 47%, as 394 fatalities were reported in between May 15-21 in comparison to 751 during May 8-14.Besides, the positivity rate (number of positive cases per 100 samples tested) also dropped to 4.70% in the third week against 8.51% in the second week. This indicates slowing down of the spread of the infection.According to health experts, the growth of Covid-19 cases and number deaths will decline further, as the peak of the second wave has already passed in the state . “This is now the end of the second wave of the pandemic. The next month is going to be a low key affair. But, we should not be relaxed, as the next couple of months (June-July) will provide a cushion for robust preparation for the third wave, if it comes. Besides, it is high time to focus and escalate vaccination coverage,” said Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine, RIMS.The state, which was hit hard by the second wave, was still discovering over 2,000 cases on a daily basis, much more that what it reported daily during the peak of the first wave between mid-August and mid-September last year.The impact of the second wave was so intense that all Covid-19 parameters of the state faired poorer than the national average.However, these parameters have now improved in last two weeks. According to the health department’s bulletin on May 21, the seven-day growth of the disease was 0.62% in the state against the national average of 0.76%. The seven-day disease’s doubling period in Jharkhand stood at 112.09 days against the national average of 91.28 and recovery rate was 91.05% against the national average of 87.20%.However, the state’s mortality rate of 1.45% was still higher than the national average of 1.10%.Jharkhand till May 21 reported a total of 327,035 cases, including 297,776 recoveries, 24,499 active cases and 4,760 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhandnearly-50-drop-in-covid-cases-deaths-last-week-101621703398285.html
22-05-2021||Patna||Bihar IMA forms panel to probe doctors’ death; toll reaches 96||Stung by the death of over 96 doctors in Bihar in the current wave of Covid-19, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Bihar Branch has constituted an eight-member committee under the chairmanship of Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh, IMA India (president-elect) to investigate reasons behind such a large number of casualty of doctors in the state.The IMA president said that more than 329 doctors have succumbed so far during the second Covid-19 wave and 96 out of these casualties have been reported from Bihar, which now has the highest number of doctor deaths during the second wave. “During the first wave of Covid-19 last year, 30 doctors had lost their lives in Bihar,” said Dr Singh.According to the news agency ANI’s report, the IMA said that over 400 doctors across the country have succumbed to the Covid-19 infection during the second wave of the pandemic.On May 18, the IMA had said 269 doctors had lost their lives during the Covid-19 second wave over the past two months. During the first wave in 2020, India had lost 748 doctors. With the updated toll shared by the IMA today, India has now lost over 1,000 doctors due to Covid-19.Of the 96 deaths reported in Bihar, 38 had taken place in Patna alone with 14 deaths reported from Muzaffarpur, as per a list released by the IMA, Bihar chapter. Five deaths have been reported in Bhagalpur and three each at Gaya and Siwan. “Doctors in Bihar have been working continuously. The committee has been formed to find out the reasons for death as doctors even in non-Covid hospitals and clinics have been treating patients. In many cases proper distancing with patients could not be maintained,” said Dr Singh, IMA national president (elect). The IMA president blamed the lack of proper care and facilities for doctors for such a high number of casualties. “In all government or private hospitals, no beds have been reserved for doctors’ treatment. Doctors died for want of beds and ventilators,” alleged Dr Singh. “At least two beds could have been reserved for our fraternity members and the mortality would have been much less. After all, we are also working for the public and their welfare,” he added.Dr Singh was also critical of oxygen supply and said that the state capital has more than 200 hospitals (both government and private) but only 90 got oxygen supply during the crisis. “More than 100 did not get supply but still kept treating patients by managing oxygen in the name of humanity,” he said. The IMA has demanded that doctors should be properly treated even in private hospitals and beds should be earmarked for them. “We demand that those doctors who died due to Covid should be given ₹50 lakh compensation amount by the respective state governments,” Dr Singh demanded and informed that IMA has decided to give ₹10 lakh each from its side to families of poor doctors. “In Bihar, we are going to give ₹10 lakh to the family of three poor doctors and this will be done in other states as well,” Dr Singh said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ima-forms-panel-to-probe-doctors-death-toll-reaches-96-101621703278455.html
22-05-2021||Patna||Senari accused acquittal: State, victims may move SC||A day after Patna High Court acquitted all the 13 accused in the 1999 Senari massacre case, a sense of shock and disbelief has gripped the Senari village and reopened the wounds of the few who survived the bloodbath.The double bench of Patna High Court on Friday acquitted the accused for “want of sufficient evidence regarding their identity” in the massacre of Bihar’s Senari village where 34 upper caste men were killed. The decision surprised the state government as well. Advocate General Lalit Kishor told media persons that the state government may challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court. The law department has also sought an advisory from Kishor.The victims’ families are expected to file an appeal against the verdict after the certified order is out later this week. An angry Arun Sharma asked, “Then who killed 34 and injured five men in 1999?” Senari since then has come out of the darkness with the village having motorable roads, electricity and other government facilities. Sources said that even though the villagers are shocked by the court’s verdict, the cordial atmosphere prevails. “The anger is mostly against court, police and government in general,” said Babu Sharma.However, it has opened the wounds once again. Recounting the horror, 47-year-old Arjun Sharma who was 25-year-old at that time said, “I was standing at the door of my house along with brothers and cousins Suresh, Sachidanand, Naresh, Sheo Kumar, Vimlesh and Kavindra. The extremists, who were in police uniform, arrived there and they caught hold of Kavindra and Vimlesh and took them towards Thakurbadi. They killed them by cutting their throats.” “The entire village is shocked with the verdict. The villagers are not ready to accept that the accused have been let off,” said villager Ajay Sharma, 54, who also lost his brother. He blamed the police and the state government for the acquittals. “The police did not file a strong charge sheet with solid evidence against them,” he alleged. Ajay Kumar, 59, whose younger brother Ranjan and cousins were killed in the massacre on March 18, 1999, said if the court acquitted all the accused, who killed his family and others in the village. “The extremists took them to Thakurbari, tied their legs and hands. The miscreants first cut the throat of the victims and thereafter they cut the stomach of those who were found alive,” he said recalling the gory incident. The verdict has also shocked Sharda Devi, 62, who lost his 21-year-old son Rakesh in the incident. “It is being said that the accused persons could not be identified. I want to ask how could an old lady, who was trying to save her life, identify the accused 20 years later?” she asked.Mohan Sharma, 45, was picked by the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) like other men of the locality and lined up near Thakurbari under the Karpi police station area. “Two people were killed before me. I was hit by a sharp-edged weapon. I fell and pretended to be dead. I wrapped under the cover of dead bodies, from where I escaped when gunmen fled away,” he recalled. Social activist Bablu Sharma told HT the state government provided compensation and government job to the next kin of the deceased. “Many of the family have shifted to other places and have built houses. There is no hatred in the village now. Most of the families are now residing in Khatangi, Manjhiyawan and Odibigha villages,” he said.Former mukhiya of Karpi village, Kamlesh Sharma informed that eight of the victims is a close relative of the then High Court’s registrar Padmnarayan Singh, who died due to heart attack after he saw bodies. His son Ramakant Singh is the senior lawyer of Patna High Court, but he could not take action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/senari-accused-acquittal-state-victims-may-move-sc-101621703218333.html

We are trying to procure the drug but to no avail. Hospital authorities said they don’t have the drug and are waiting to get it from the government. The drug is not available anywhere in the market,” he added.Rakesh Beniwal, of Sirsa said doctors asked them to bring 10 vials of the drug for treatment of his father-in-law.“Doctors said we need six injections per day and the treatment lasts four to six weeks. They expressed inability to provide even a single vial of the medicine. How do we procure it if neither the government nor the markets have it?” he said.Slamming the BJP-JJP government, INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala and Congress’s Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry said the government had notified black fungus as a disease but it does not have the injections required to treat the patients.“The government has notified 12 medical colleges to treat black fungus patients and all of them are facing acute shortage of the drug. If hospitals don’t have the medicine, how will they treat the patients? Why has the state government not floated tenders to get Amphotericin-B earlier,” Choudhry said.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said there is acute shortage of the injections across country.“The Centre had allocated only 100 vials of the drug to Haryana and PGIMS had received 200 vials. On an average, a patient needs seven injections of the drug a day and the treatment continues for at least 30 days. So, one can easily imagine the shortage. The state had written to the Centre to allocate more vials of the drug,” he added.PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya said 63 patients of black fungus are admitted at the institution and they don’t have enough drug vials to treat them.“We have written to the state seeking 6,000 vials to treat the patients and are yet to receive them. Our institute was allocated four districts but cases are coming in from across state,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-faces-acute-shortage-of-drugs-to-treat-black-fungus-patients-101621702320437.html

Sagar hailed from Sonepat.There is a look-out circular issued by the Delhi Police against Sushil Kumar, who is posted as an officer on special duty (OSD) at Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi, and police are continuously making raids in Haryana and Punjab to arrest him.Sagar’s father Ashok Dhankar and his maternal uncle Anand alleged that they got life threat from the Olympic medallist and demanded his immediate arrest.“We got information that the Delhi Police has traced Sushil’s location somewhere in Punjab and police are helping him during his stay. He has connections with gangsters and we are getting threats from him. We want his immediate arrest,” they added.Sagar’s father Ashok said his son had been at Chhatrasal for nearly eight years.“I handed over Sagar to Mahabali Satpal, who runs Chhatrasal Akhada when he was just 15. He considered Sushil Kumar his guru. Both Satpal and Sushil promised us to make my son a good wrestler. My son had won many medals before he was killed after a brawl with Sushil Kumar and his associates,” he said.“We got to know after Sagar’s death that he was staying in a flat outside the stadium. He was planning to quit the stadium and shift to Narela, where a former coach was giving training. Sushil and his associates abducted Sagar from his house in Model Town to teach him a lesson for bad-mouthing him in front of other wrestlers,” he added.Sagar died on May 5, while two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar got injured after they were allegedly assaulted by Sushil Kumar and other wrestlers on the night of May 4, on the stadium premises in Delhi.The Delhi Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information leading to Sushil Kumar’s arrest. A reward of ₹50,000 has also been announced for arrest of his associate Ajay Kumar, who has been absconding in the case, police had said.Anand alleged that his nephew had been forced to shift from the flat which was in the name of Sushil Kumar’s wife to another flat after he failed to pay rent.“Sagar’s wrestler friends told us that Sushil was mounting pressure on him to join gangsters, who were illegally encroaching upon the plots but he denied. Since then, their rift had escalated,” he added.Earlier, a Delhi court had refused to grant anticipatory bail to Sushil Kumar, stating that he is prima facie the main conspirator and allegations against him are serious in nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wrestler-sagar-dhankar-s-family-seeks-sushil-kumar-s-arrest-101621702080357.html

22-05-2021||Pune||Revenue from liquor sales dips due to lockdown||The liquor sales revenue for the government for 2020- 2021 has dipped due to the closure of all liquor shops in the aftermath of lockdown announced by the state government in Pune Region. The district saw liquor revenue earnings amounting to ₹1,797 crore for the current year in comparison to ₹1,805 crores for 2019-2020. The state government has however permitted home delivery of liquor which has also caused lesser sale of liquor in the market, excise department officials said. During the last lockdown, all liquor shops were also shut and during the said period, the state noticed that the revenue earnings of the government had come down drastically which prompted it to take the decision to open all the shops under the law of essential services. For 2021, the liquor shops were functioning full steam in the months of January, February, and March but were shut down due to rising infections in the state. State excise superintendent Santosh Zagade said, “The lockdown announced by the state government to break the chain of the virus had an impact on sale of liquor. There has been a significant decline in liquor sales following the lockdown and home delivery has not got the expected response.” The excise department in its crackdown on illicit liquor has recovered booze worth ₹19 crore during the past two years during Covid-19 outbreak. It had lodged 3,526 cases in 2019-2020 and 3,040 cases in 2020-2021 With liquor shops shut since the lockdown in March and subsequent shutdown extensions due to Covid-19 pandemic, the state excise department for Pune region has pegged its losses for the industry between April and September 2020 at ₹190 crore. Also, September witnessed a decline of 50.88 per cent of the revenue earnings for the region as the department could fetch only ₹127.92 crore for the said month as compared to ₹178.80 crore during the same period last year. Percentagewise, the overall decline has been at least 21.74 per cent, excise department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/revenue-from-liquor-sales-dips-due-to-lockdown-101621697338011.html

The Pune bar association which has spearheaded the issue since a long time stated the building will be one of the best facility-oriented structures for all those visiting the campus for court work.According to the PWD, the new construction will entail demolition of the over 50-year-old building structures all along starting from Gate No 4 until the lawyers’ chambers building. The heritage structures belonging to the British era will remain intact, untouched and preserved for posterity. The new building will have world class court rooms with quality ante chambers and all other facilities for the litigants, judges and the court staff. The court hall will undergo a revamp as the Pune bar association demanded that the capacity be extended to 500 with an overhauled bar room and also a dedicated bar room for women lawyers. Also, the water closets and sanitation blocks will be upgraded to the highest standards according to the construction plan. The demand for new buildings with ultra-modern facilities for the convenience for one and all has been gaining currency for past several years with the lawyers’ association and litigants expressing their need for the said type of building. PBA president advocate Satish Mulik said, “The district judge has informed us that the work is likely to start from July during a meeting with the office bearers last week. Initially, the old structures will be demolished, and the bar association office will be shifted to a temporary location.

22-05-2021||Pune||MPCB seeks explanation from PMC for dumping waste in riverbed area||Despite National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) warning, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has continued to operate the garbage processing plant at Sinhagad road and is dumping garbage at the Mutha riverbed. Following a complaint from local residents and environmental activists, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) visited the spot and sought an explanation from PMC officials. Abhishek Kumbharkar, a local resident of Wadgaon Budruk area found out the dumping of garbage near the Bhumi Green Energy Company premises. The processing plant near Prayeja city on Sinhagad road was set up by PMC in 2016 with contract given to Bhumi Green Energy to process 150 metric ton of garbage. The private firm recycles waste and produces a RDF (refuse derived fuel). Kumbharkar approached environmental activist Sarang Yadwadkar, who wrote a letter to the PMC solid waste department and MPCB officials. Kiran Hasabnis, MPCB sub-regional officer said, “After the complaint, we visited the spot on Friday and found the company is storing waste outside the project premises near the river. Most of the garbage is segregated plastic. Due to the slope, the garbage is rolling into the river. We have noted down versions of the company and other observations. We will send a letter to PMC to explain whether the land belongs to PMC, or it has taken on rent to dump the garbage. If we find any flaws in the explanation and our observation, we will serve notice to PMC and company.” Vijay Tilekar, Owner, Bhumi Energy Green Company said, “We set up the plant in 2016 and are processing 150 metric tonnes of waste and producing RDF (refuse derived fuel). We give plastic material to other companies for recycling purposes. It has taken the private land on rent adjacent to our plant to keep plastic material temporary before transporting to Malegaon based plastic recycling plant. There is no dumping of garbage in the riverbed.” In 2019, Yadwadkar had filed a petition in the NGT and mentioned the 12 dumping spots in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The NGT took cognisance of the issue and appointed a five-member committee and NGT had appointed MPCB as nodal agency, while warning municipal commissioners of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad that they should ensure that no further dumping of debris or any other waste, including construction waste is disposed of in the river. Yadwadkar said, “The firm stored garbage near the river side instead of the project premises. The land is outside the project, and it has been shown in the river protection belt in Pune city’s development plan (DP). The land reclamation has been done and the dumped garbage is is rolling into the river and polluting river water. On one side, the PMC has undertaken a river development project and on the other hand, it is polluting a river.” Ajit Deshmukh, head of the solid waste department of the PMC said, “Our officials visited the spot. The company has put aside recycling material near the company premises. We instructed the company to remove the rejects as early as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mpcb-seeks-explanation-from-pmc-for-dumping-waste-in-riverbed-area-101621696798160.html

22-05-2021||Patna||Darbhanga Medical College Hospital battles big odds to save Covid-19 patients||The facilities at the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH), one of the oldest medical colleges in Bihar after the Patna Medical College Hospital, are in a sorry state.Residents of several districts including Samastipur, Madhubani and Saharsa depend on the DMCH but a visit to this medical college reminds one of hell.Filled with garbage and waterlogged, the hospital premises are unhygienic with pigs and cows hanging around.Nurses on emergency duty were seen crossing over pools of dirty water. A nurse, Dipa Kumari, said they have been facing this situation for 27 years and it worsens during the monsoons. She said frontline workers are forced to serve by putting their own lives at risk.Not even the DMCH medical superintendent Mani Bhushan Sharma's office has been spared. In order to escape injury or get himself drenched in the filthy water, Sharma has to take the help of a guard and driver to reach his office.When asked, Sharma said the situation is not new because this hospital is very old and situated in a low-lying area. On the Covid situation and facilities for Covid patients, he said they are fighting day and night with the support of the administration. He, however, pointed out that there is a lack of manpower to handle ventilator issues. Sharma, who himself has recovered from coronavirus, said his daughter is also Covid positive, but despite all odds, he is doing everything possible to ensure the recovery of patients.Sharma said DMCH is running a Covid ward in a new building where everything is upgraded.However, in front of the DMCH superintendent's office is the Covid ICU ward. The nearby area is again inundated with dirty water.Doctor Ashutosh Kumar, who serves in the Covid ICU ward said, said doctors and nurses are at God's mercy with high chances of infection from garbage and water-logging on the premises but they are helpless.The road to the new nurses' hostel, especially for the ones serving in the Covid wards is damaged and water-logged.Chandan, whose father-in-law is critical and admitted to the Covid ward, crosses the water-logged road to buy medicines. He said, "What can we do? I have to go to get medicines every day. I have to buy them from outside."The surgery ward of DMCH is in a similar poor state, and the chances of any untoward incident can't be ruled out. Half the building has already been vacated by the administration due to worsening conditions leaving the surgery ward at God's mercy.Reacting to the poor condition of the building, a surgical ward staff member said, "Yes, we are afraid but you have to ask this question from the government."The DDC of Darbhanga Tanay Sultania told ANI, "We have made available two senior doctors (POD) and four SR/PG doctors in each shift for three shifts every day. Apart from that, we have made available one senior doctor and two PG students of the medicine department in each shift for the care of serious patients. Physician on call (head of one medicine unit) is also available.""Before April 12 only one POD and 2-3 PG students were there for the entire HDU ward and converting HDU to semi-ICU--the entire HDU ward is made as semi-ICU with 75 BIPAPs available for non-invasive ventilation. Sixteen patients are currently on BIPAP. The nursing station has been operationalised on each floor. There are two nurses each on five floors in each shift. Earlier there were only six nurses in each shift," he said.He said, "And we increased the number of ward boys from 4-5 in total to 10 government ward boys in each shift and six outsourced ward boys in each shift dedicated to the movement of cylinders. Also, the control room functions all the time for addressing complaints. Twenty calls are made by operators on their own to admitted patients to seek feedback in each shift every day."Blaming the low-lying area and the old building that houses the DMCH for the unhygienic conditions on the premises, Sultania said the entire focus has now been shifted to the cure of Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/darbhanga-medical-college-hospital-battles-big-odds-to-save-covid-19-patients-101621694018488.html

These migrant workers from Jharkhand,engaged in a project in Nepal by Larsen & Tourbro,through a contractor,had been stranded due to lockdown in the Himalayan country to rein in coronavirus surge and had been sending SOS messages including video messages to the Jharkhand government for rescue.The workers reached Viratnagar on Bihar-Nepal border and boarded the bus to travel to Dumka, around 245 km away. "Our worker brothers have reached India-Nepal border. Soon they will depart for Dumka. Team of officers and paramedics are at Viratnagar on Bihar-Nepal border to bring them home safely. "RAT kits, dry ration, oxygen cylinder equipped ambulance have all been sent from Dumka," said Deputy Commissioner Dumka, Rajeshwari B, who had flagged off a bus from Indoor stadium to Nepal border alongwith officials for the ferrying workers Friday.A migrant worker coming home thanked Hemant Soren-led government for their rescue.

Sarangi said members of Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal helped in locating the workers and also in their return back home.Chief Minister's office said a bus and an ambulance were rushed to the Indo-Nepal border to bring back workers. Approval from Nepal government had already been sought for this, the official added. On their return, the workers will undergo health check and COVID tests, the official said. The Jharkhand government has imposed lockdown-like restrictions that mandate compulsory seven-day quarantine for people coming to the state. The workers will be brought to Dumka's indoor stadium first.Former legislator and BJP leader Kunal Sarangi among others had escalated the matter urging the Ministry of External Affairs besides Indian Embassy in Nepal and others thanked the Indian Embassy in Nepal too for swinging into action. A Larsen & Toubro spokesperson confirmed that the workers were engaged by the company at a project site through a contractor. Chief minister Soren had on Thursday retweeted a message by a non-profit body Shubh Sandesh Foundation: "Doing our best to assist 26 Jharkhand migrants stuck in Nepal. Our friends in Nepal are in touch coordinating food, travel pass, medicine etc for them."Earlier, former legislator Sarangi had tweeted: "I sincerely request @DrSJaishankar Sir & @IndiaInNepal to get it looked into. These poor migrant labourers from Jharkhand are stuck in Nepal and they are very unwell. Pls rescue them." In earlier video messages the migrant workers were seen appealing to the Jharkhand government to rescue them while saying that they are stranded in Nepal due to the lockdown and most of them have fallen sick but are not getting any medical attention and food.In a separate message later, the workers said that they have received a communication from the Shubh Sandesh Foundation that arrangements are being done for their safe return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/26-jharkhand-migrant-workers-stranded-in-nepal-depart-for-dumka-101621688755633.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||With hospital 8 hours away, Covid centre set up at remote HP village||To check the spread of coronavirus in the tribal regions of Himachal Pradesh, particularly areas bordering Uttarakhand in Shimla and Sirmaur districts, the civil administration has set up a 10-bed Covid care centre at Kwar village. The transit Covid care centre will cater to patients from the remote panchayats of Dodra, Kwar, Jiskun, Pandhar and Dhandwarhi, which has a population of about 7,500. Locked away in the Himalayas, Dodra Kwar is one of the remotest inhabited pockets of the state that was connected by road only in 2013.The nearest hospital at Rohru is an eight-hour drive away due to the poor condition of roads in the region. Dodra and Kwar are two villages on the opposite sides of the valley separated by the Rupin river that merges into the Tons river. Also read: Two Covid vaccine doses needed for protection against variant from India: Report“Cases are on the rise and it’s not possible for all patients to travel to the nearest hospital at Rohru so we decided to set up the Covid care centre in the village itself,” says Rohru sub divisional magistrate BR Sharma, who holds the additional charge of the Dodra Kwar SDM. “We have set up the centre in a government building that was earlier being used as a sheep carding centre,” said Sharma, adding that the centre has two wards. At present, it has three patients, while there are 42 active cases in the remote region. Health teams deputed for vaccination The health department has deputed five teams to vaccinate those above 44 years in the villages of the region. The department has also stationed an ambulance at Kwar village to ferry critical patients to the civil hospital at Rohru. The civil hospital at Rohru has despatched 10 oxygen cylinders for the Covid care facility. “Local residents have been a big help. We had only 25 regulators for the cylinders but were helped by individuals and associations,” says Rohru civil hospital medical superintendent Dr Ravinder Mukhiya. The civil hospital can accommodate 70 patients though 54 patients are undergoing treatment at present. Local contractor Jai Chauhan, who travelled all the way to the industrial belt of Baddi to buy the regulators for the oxygen cylinder, says “The local truck operators’ union was a big help.” The hospital is now equipped with 90 oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-hospital-8-hours-away-covid-centre-set-up-at-remote-hp-village-101621688938528.html

The MLA who was among 19 legislators who rebelled last year against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot under former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s leadership, is also said to be dissatisfied with the government over the alleged stoppage of the developmental work in his assembly constituency. Choudhary, however, did not elaborate on what caused anguish to him. The legislator said the Rajasthan unit president of the Congress, Govind Singh Dotasra had spoken to him and it is now for him how he sorts out the issue. “I have sent my resignation and now the speaker has to look into it. Party's state president talked to me and said it is a family matter of the party. He is head of the party in the state and it is for him to sort out the issue,” he told reporters here. Gudhamalani MLA Choudhary said he has resigned but talking about it is not his top priority. “The Covid-19 pandemic is there and people are dying. I visited anti-covid centres in my constituency and took stock of the situation and arrangements there. This is the top priority for me at present,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/i-was-anguished-congress-hemaram-choudhary-on-resigning-from-mla-post-101621686907954.html

The order also said that this information will have to be updated four times a day.Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has instructed that the drugs needed for the treatment of Covid-19 should be made available to the general public. He also highlighted that hoarding, overcharging or black-marketing of these essential drugs should be stopped. He said that the new measure will ensure that such practices are minimised, news agency ANI reported. The DDMA rule states that the information should be updated at 10am, 2pm, 6pm and 9pm daily.The Lieutenant Governor also instructed that similar measures should be taken with regard to equipment like pulse oximeters, oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators.The Delhi high court previously ordered the Centre and the Delhi government to check black-marketing of essential medicines and medical oxygen as the city raced against time to provide for its Covid-19 patients, many of whom died due to the lack of medical oxygen as well as life-saving drugs. “We are still not understanding the gravity of the situation and that is why we are not coming together. Which is why we are seeing instances of hoarding and black marketing.

22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Develop social media strategy to fight fake info on Covid: Experts||From linking 5G communication technology and male infertility to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state health authorities see fake theories being floated on social media as major contributors to the slow response to vaccination in the rural areas. As the Punjab government has yet to draw up a strategy to debunk unfounded claims, conspiracy theories are being spread to disrupt the government’s plans to contain the pandemic. Also read: ‘Enough is enough’: IMA demands prosecution of Ramdev under Epidemics ActCommunication analysts say that the state government may take a cue from the Centre’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) to combat hoax messages on social media. State ministers, MLAs and MPs should proactively step forward to clear rumours around Covid-19 and its treatment, the experts say. The government should identify specific false narratives challenging Covid-appropriate behaviour and engage professionals for the effective handling of misinformation and fake news, they say. Vaccine hesitancy, containment zones in Fazilka Fazilka district epidemiologist Dr Sunita confirms that during mass testing it was observed that villagers attributed vaccine hesitancy to 5G technology. “It was common to hear in the rural areas that infections and mortality were due to the new age technology used by the communication sector. Scores of them were in a denial on the pandemic and we are still struggling to convince them,” she says. Fazilka has the highest nine villages as containment zones where the areas are sealed due to a high number of virus infections. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Haryana) president Gurnam Singh Chaduni recently told villagers that the large number of deaths in the rural areas was due to 5G radiation and not Covid-19. 5G testing hasn’t even started in the country The testing of the 5G network has not yet started anywhere in India, says the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) in a recent press statement. “Such audio and video messages by others as well are on social media for quite some time. Rural communities take farmer union leaders seriously on such issues. Since fake narratives have not been countered, a section of people still believe that the pandemic is not an emergency medical situation but an official conspiracy to derail the farmer agitation against the farm laws,” says a civil surgeon. Another source in the health department says a section of people fear vaccination may affect male fertility or cause genetic changes among young women. “The global scientific community has ruled out any such impact of vaccines, but these issues are prevalent among the urban and rural population. In April, the state government roped in Moga born actor-philanthropist Sonu Sood as a brand ambassador for Punjab’s vaccination programme, but he has hardly any visibility on the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. Engage religious leaders, Punjabi singers According to Rubal Kanozia, a media analyst and an assistant professor at Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, the Punjab government should engage religious leaders, Punjabi singers and even news anchors, who have a sizeable following on social media, to debunk myths associated with the pandemic and vaccination. “Punjab has a significant penetration of smartphones in villages and celebrated faces can become a game-changer by using social media platforms. A call by heads of religious institutions and deras can improve inoculation significantly,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/develop-social-media-strategy-to-fight-fake-info-on-covid-experts-101621681197495.html
22-05-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Putting your health in your own hands||Founded in 2015, Avegen is a health-tech startup based in Pune and London. Avegen builds digital care programmes that it claims are personalised, patient-centric and evidence-based. Its HealthMachine platform is a software-as-a-servce (SaaS) deploying these digital care programs that improve health of individuals with long-term conditions. These digital care programmes – built on a compliant and scalable platform - are designed around the patient enabling proactive care for patients with chronic conditions, and supports clinicians in improved patient management. Coming togetherSays Apte, “The team is split between Pune and London. Nayan is based in London and he heads our commercial and client services team. The product development team and program management is of India. Nayan and I have been in touch since 2006-07. While I sold my previous company, Nayan was also looking to start something. We essentially decided that it was a good time to get together and launched this venture in late 2015.”HealthMachine – Powering digital care programmesHealthMachine puts each patient in control of their own health, tracking progress and strengthening outcomes. Easy-to-use functions and gamification touches make HealthMachine-based care programmes intuitive and effective, removing traditional barriers. Avegen currently has three digital care programs on HealthMachine:•Cardiac rehabilitation•Maternal health •HIV‘Together for Her’ in IndiaExplaining the digital care program for women, Kalnad said, “Avegen has been working in the digital healthcare space since 2015 in both India and the UK. It is Avegen’s Vision to transform healthcare using technology, and we work in multiple disease and care areas, including cardio-pulmonary care, HIV, and maternal health. Together for Her (TFH), our maternal healthcare program was started in 2017 with a vision to improve the quality of maternal healthcare and reduce preventable maternal deaths.”Kalnad claims that TFH is a completely digital care program for pregnant women with over 30,000 users at present. The application provides gestational week-specific information on recommended healthcare behaviours, as well as data-driven feedback on their nutritional and antenatal behaviours. Additionally, TFH uses machine learning and predictive analytics to provide maternal health information that is personalised to a pregnant woman’s health status. “Firstly, we want to reduce deaths during pregnancy. In terms of impact on women’s health, we aim to reduce anaemia prevalence in mothers who use the app by at least 20 per cent, compared to treatment as usual. Also, we are aiming at having 25 lakh mothers on our TFH program in the next five years,” Kalnad adds.Gupte says explains, “We all consume lot of technology every day. However, most advanced and powerful tech is unfortunately directed at making us buying something, instead of improving our lives. What drives me is using same tech to have a positive impact on peoples’ lives. India is a powerhouse of delivering software and IT projects to the world but we don’t develop world-class software for Indian consumers. We wanted to change this and hence, we developed TFH which is available to Indian users in English and Hindi.”Providing relevant content Says Gupte, “The content on the platform changes on two dimensions. Fresh relevant content is being developed on a regular basis, while in terms of personalisation, when a mother signs up we build a profile for her based on the areas of interests. Pregnancy is definitive journey of nine months and hence, week by week, certain content becomes more relevant. So, respective content is shown to them correspondingly.”First adopters The biggest customers Avegen’s HealthMachine are pharmaceutical companies and hospitals in the UK. In India, doctors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are the first adopters. “Avegen also helped one Mumbai-based NGO build a helpline for HIV positive patients during the first lockdown in the country in March 2020,” says Gupte.Funding Merck for Mothers (MFM) has been a funding partner with Avegen since 2017. MFM has supported the development of TFH, which was started as a quality-of-care review platform and has since evolved into the current maternal care program. MFM works with partners around the globe to support innovative solutions that aim to end maternal deaths.As for Avegen, Dr Kalnad says, “We are a bootstrapped company. The initial investment was mainly from friends and family. We had raised around $250K in 2016. This year we want to raise fresh round of funding of about Rs28 to Rs30 crore to expand in Europe. We want to be the first or major company having origins in India which will make big in the digital therapeutics and digital care program space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-putting-your-health-in-your-own-hands-101621680718005.html

22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu dares Capt Amarinder to prove he wanted to switch sides||Congress leader and former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has been critical of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh over the Bargari sacrilege issue, on Saturday challenged him to prove that he had met any leader of another party for switching sides. “Prove one meeting that I have had with another party’s leader. I have never asked anyone for any post till date. All I seek is Punjab’s prosperity. Was invited and offered Cabinet berths many times but I did not accept. Now, our esteemed high command has intervened, Will wait,” the Amritsar East MLA tweeted. Also read: 6 feet or 10 metres: What experts say about safe distance to keep Covid at bayHe also shared a video footage of a press conference he addressed recently in Patiala in which he says that his family members and he sacrificed key posts just for the sake of Punjab so why would he seek the posts now. His tweet comes after Capt Amarinder claimed that “he (Sidhu) is in talks with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal and that he can switch sides any moment”. Without mentioning his name, he dared him to prove that he had had any meeting with a leader of any other party. Sidhu has been critical of Capt Amarinder after the Punjab and Haryana high court last month quashed a probe into the 2015 Kotkapura firing incident, which had taken place during a protest against the desecration of a religious text in Faridkot district. The CM too had slammed Sidhu, calling his outbursts total indiscipline and suggesting that he may be leaving for the AAP. Capt Amarinder and Sidhu had met over tea in March following reports that the Congress central leadership had been trying to rehabilitate the MLA who had resigned as minister after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio in 2019. After the meeting, Amarinder had expressed confidence that Sidhu would be back in his cabinet. Sidhu had joined the Congress after leaving the BJP before the 2017 assembly elections. Punjab cooperative and jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh and Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa are among the other Congress leaders who have criticised Capt Amarinder for not delivering justice in the Bargari sacrilege and police firing incidents. All these Congress leaders also want action against former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and former deputy CM and Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal in this issue.

A few days back, he shared a post on social media and started getting calls. Over 200 people have so far called him from various parts of Assam and other states to hear him hum and sing. Talking about his reason behind the campaign, Bikarmjit Bauliya said, “Last year I also tested positive and it was a tough time I went through, mostly because of the pressure I faced. I have struggled with depression at one point in my life and I know how tough it is to fight with our own mind. I am a singer but I have to work for my father’s medicine shop to earn my bread and butter. Music is my passion and I gain positivity from music. With this campaign, I am getting a chance to connect with people and listening to their stories. This is making me more positive and optimistic.”Many of them don’t just listen to his songs but also share their experience, fear, anxiety and battle with the coronavirus disease. An 82-year-old lady calls him every day. On Saturday morning she informed that she tested negative. The lady claimed that she recovered quickly due to the positive energy she generated within because of Bikarmjit’s songs. Bikarmjit started his campaign inspired by Bengali singer Lopamudra Mitra. So many singers, including Lopamudra Mitra and Shilajit Mazumder, have called and appreciated his gesture. “Some people are criticising me by saying that it is just another publicity stunt. But these people are not ready to discuss mental health. I got calls from various singers and they appreciated my initiative. No matter how people criticise me, I am going to continue this because I believe, we need to work on mental health.”Bikarmjit’s actual surname is Kar but he writes Bauliya which is inspired by the Bauls (Bengali folk singers). He once auditioned for Saregamapa Bengali where he couldn’t manage to get into the top-12 because of his folk accent. But he continued his passion for music after that. He sings almost everywhere, be it a friend’s wedding or when someone is feeling upset. “There is no shame in singing. If I can make someone happy, I can do it anywhere, anytime,” he said.Requests for Bikarmjit’s songs pour in not just from Assam but states like Tripura, West Bengal, Chattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharastra, Delhi and Panjab. “I sing Bengali folk songs mostly but people from other languages are also requesting me to sing in their languages. Music can be a therapy for people in distress. In this situation, we need to be kind towards each other. I am happy that people are responding,” he said.Chattisgarh resident Mihir Purkayastha has his roots connected to Assam. His ancestors lived in Karimganj district decades back. A friend told him about the folk singer’s Facebook post and shared the number. Mihir said, “I feel connected to my roots through folk music. I felt excited to talk to a folk singer and called him. His positive energy helped me get more energy inside me. I hope I’ll recover from covid soon.”82-year-old Nazima Begum from Hailakandi district said, “When my test report came positive, I had to stay at home isolation. It was tough because I was feeling abounded. My family members were not coming close to me, I had nobody to talk to and share my feelings. My granddaughter informed me that there is a singer who is willing to sing for me if I call him. I am a music lover, so I called him. Now I feel he is my grandson. He is so positive, he encouraged me to be positive and fight the virus. Today my reports came negative and I feel his positive energy helped me recover faster.”Sweta Roy, a school teacher from Silchar feels the mental health of Covid-19 patients is not being addressed properly. She recovered from the virus after fighting for two weeks but feels weak mentally. Talking about her experience of listening to Bikarmjit Bauliya, she said, “Music has the power to boost mental strength. But listening to someone live is a different experience. I spoke to him about his works and I feel thankful to people like him.”Bikramjit Kar (Bauliya) supports his father’s medicine business. In his spare time, he supplies medicine and important items to Covid-19 patients. He wants to inspire the young generation. “We can see that the young generation in places like Kolkata, Delhi and other parts of the country are supporting each other in this situation. They are using social media platforms to connect and address the issues faced by victims of Covid-19. I want the young generation in my city to come out and do this. It is our chance to show humanity and a sense of responsibility towards society.”He is also a dog lover. He calls his pet ‘Laleshwar’ which stays with him all the time. He also feeds the street dogs at night and provides them with medical support when they get injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-folk-singer-sings-over-phone-to-boost-mental-health-of-covid-19-patients-101621677777329.html

It was filed on the complaint of Akash Sharma, the chief of Congress’s student wing National Students’ Union of India in the state, under Indian Penal Code’s Sections including 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace). The BJP has alleged the “toolkit” was aimed at building a biased narrative over the Centre’s handling of the second wave of Covid-19, and the Central Vista Project. Many top BJP leaders, including its chief JP Nadda and Union ministers Smriti Irani, Hardeep Puri, Anurag Thakur, Piyush Goyal, amplified tweets about it.The Congress accused the BJP of concocting the document on Covid-19. In a tweet on Tuesday, Congress’s research department head Rajeev Gowda said: “BJP is propagating a fake ‘toolkit’ on ‘Covid-19 mismanagement’ & attributing it to AICC [All India Congress Committee] Research Department. We are filing an FIR [First Information Report] for forgery against @jpnadda & @sambitswaraj When our country is devastated by Covid, instead of providing relief, BJP shamelessly concocts forgeries.”Raipur police superintendent Ajay Yadav cited due process and added the notice has been issued to Singh for questioning him in the case and to get his statement recorded.Police officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they want to question Singh whether the Twitter account @drramansingh belonged to him, where did he get the alleged Congress’s documents from, and about the communication between him and others regarding the use of hashtag “CongressToolkitExposed” on social media.In his complaint, Sharma accused the BJP leaders of forging, fabricating, and manufacturing the documents on the letterhead of the AICC Research Department. It added they were meant to be spread via social media and has “potential of creating communal disharmony, unrest in the country”. He accused the BJP of using the alleged documents “to spread fake news” which has the potential of inciting “violence and fuelling hatred”.The BJP slammed the Congress for registering the case and issuing notice to Singh and called it an attempt to save its face. “The case registered against Raman Singh is completely fake and politically motivated. The Chhattisgarh Police are working under political pressure and hence served the notice,” said Gauri Shankar Srivas, a BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-police-to-question-former-chief-minister-over-congress-toolkit-101621674657027.html

Questions were raised over the photograph of PM Narendra Modi which is on the vaccination certificates issued through the Centre’s CoWin application in the recent past. On May 12, the Chhattisgarh government launched ‘CG Teeka’ Web Portal for systematic vaccination of people in the age group 18-44 years. People with no smartphones or internet facility can also get their registration for Covid-19 vaccination via ‘Help Desks’ established at panchayats, urban bodies, municipal corporations and other places.Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singhdeo said that no one should object to the photograph of CM Baghel because the state government is funding the vaccination of 18-44 age group. “When the Centre is using PM Modi’s photograph for the vaccination certificates, which they are funding, why can’t a state government use the photograph of CM which the state is funding? I don’t think anyone should have any objection,” said Singhdeo. Claiming that the state government is working just for the photo opportunity, BJP spokesperson Gaurishankar Srivas said that this is not the time for photo session and advertisement. “When the people of the state are suffering in the state, the government is working on these photo opportunities which is a shame.

The barge was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the Arabian sea. As Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast, the barge got de-anchored on Sunday night. The barge sank around 7 pm on Monday in a very choppy sea and rough weather, which made the search and rescue operation one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades.Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that chartered the barge and hired its crew, said there were 261 members on board. The barge sank about 40 nautical miles west off Mumbai.The Navy and the Coastguard have so far rescued 286 barge crew members and recovered 60 bodies.

I approached chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan too many times, but he also could not help me.”Sahu said he met Agrawal many times to get his money back, but he was not ready to do so. “In 2015, he offered me ₹2 lakh to end the case but after 15 years, it had become a fight for pride and against the breach of trust. I have met at least 15 superintendents of police of Guna, and they always said the matter is being investigated.”In February, when Rajeev Mishra took over as the Guna police superintendent, he reviewed all the pending cases and got to know about Sahu’s pending case. “Mishra asked Binagaj police to investigate the matter and after four months, I finally won a long battle to have the case registered,” Sahu said.Mishra said the case was registered on Thursday against Agarwal of the Madhya Pradesh Warehouse Corporation under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 420 (fraud), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 467 (forgery of valuable security), and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).“I have also ordered an inquiry into the delay of more than two decades in registering the case,” said Mishra.Despite repeated attempts, Agrawal could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/after-21-years-madhya-pradesh-police-book-warehouse-manager-for-stealing-farmer-s-crop-101621659355824.html

They fell back on faith and started organising havans to ward off the evil that they thought was causing them fever en masse in the absence of any testing facilities. With no respite in sight, a local chemist prescribed Bhupinder paracetamol as his fever worsened. The situation kept getting from bad to worse for him as two residents died on the same day in the village on April 22 after having a fever for over three days. The following day, the brothers went to see Pramod Kumar, a local physician as they also now developed cough and body ache. Kumar too prescribed paracetamol. Over the next few days, over 20 people died in the village and yet there was no testing.Finally, on April 24, Kumar asked Bhupinder, who was now barely able to walk, to get tested, start taking antibiotics and isolate himself as more people died without getting tested in the village. In the middle of the following night, Bhupinder began gasping for breath and could not walk anymore, setting alarm bells ringing among his family members. Yoginder, who had a mild fever, drove his brother to a hospital in Jhajjar, over 50 km away, where doctors asked them to get tested for Covid before admission. Bhupinder struggled to breathe on the back seat of his car as he had to wait till late afternoon to get tested. As the two were told they would get their reports two days later, Yoginder rushed Bhupinder back to the hospital, where doctors insisted on a Covid positive report to start treating them.A doctor suggested a nebuliser, but it was not available either in Totoli or Jhajjar before a cousin of theirs managed to borrow it from a friend. Nebuliser brought some relief as Bhupinder could breathe better now but now Yoginder’s condition worsened. A desperate Yoginder drove his brother 124 kilometres to Faridabad as his condition again worsened. A doctor examined Bhupinder and told Yoginder he immediately needed to be put on ventilator support even as no beds were available. They will get a bed if someone dies and vacates one, the brothers were told.Bhupinder now started turning pale and could not talk anymore even as the family managed to get a five-litre oxygen cylinder, 159 kilometres away in Bhiwani. Midway to Bhiwani, a cousin of Bhupinder and Yoginder joined them with oxygen cans. Bhupinder now began tossing and turning as Yoginder desperately pumped the oxygen. In Bhiwani too, they were unable to find a ventilator bed. Another member of the family rushed back to Faridabad but by the time he reached there, a vacant hospital bed they were promised was occupied by someone else by then. The family was left with no choice but to bring Bhupinder back to their village with two oxygen cylinders. They again began the search for a hospital bed on April 28 and were denied admission to the Jhajjar hospital as Bhupinder’s condition worsened despite getting a high flow of oxygen. He could no longer recognise his brother even as Bhupinder finally managed to get ventilator support at a nearby hospital following the death of a patient. Yoginder, meanwhile, started suffocating. Bhupinder, the father of a 12-year-old daughter, died the following day and Yoginder was now put on the same ventilator support, but he too lost the battle for life three days later.Authorities in Rohtak acknowledged that over 30 people died in the Titoli village in just a few days after developing fever while insisting they did not have Covid. District information officer Sanjeev Saini said there were just four Covid related deaths in the village as per the chief medical officer’s report even as most people who died never got tested and the village was sealed last week.Block development officer (Titoli) Raj Pal said the deaths were sudden but largely they included people who were suffering from diabetes and other diseases too. “Though the testing earlier was not much available, after May 1, we have ramped it up in the village,” Pal said. He too maintained just four people have died of Covid in the village of around 12,000 people.Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health expert, said honest reporting of Covid deaths and cases can make people more cautious and help check of carelessness and thus exposure to the virus. He added the baseline mortality, or the average number of people dying normally in a year is seven in every 1,000 people. “Therefore, in a population of 12,000, there should generally be not more than 84 deaths in a year or seven in a month. However, in the case of Titoli around 30 deaths had taken place in less than a month,” he said. “This is a clear indication that most people have not died a normal death. At a time, when the country is struck with a ravaging pandemic, there is every possibility that these deaths have mostly taken place because of Covid,” Lahariya said.He added deaths of people under 60 falls under the preventable mortality category. “Many of those lives could have been saved if the disease was diagnosed at an early stage and medical intervention was done,” Lahariya said. “Avoiding or hiding the actual figures does nothing more than worsening the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-30-die-in-haryana-village-officials-insist-only-4-died-of-covid19-101621657015590.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Reset policy to tackle Covid-19 effectively||When Covid-19 alarm bells rang in early 2020, individually and institutionally, we were groping in the dark. The information asymmetry was plugged as more research-based data emerged. As the first wave waned, false and unscientific narratives and policy inaction lulled us into complacency. Eventually, the inevitable second wave caused unimaginable human and economic catastrophe in the country. Thus, it is pertinent to analyse our approach, or the lack of it, which is responsible for the current state of affairs. At the outset, there has been an unequivocal failure in discharge of constitutional duties, protection of fundamental rights of citizens and the abdication of governance by the central and the state governments alike. Therefore, the courts have been forced to assume normal executive functions. This must challenge the executive to have a rethink about the efficacy of its functioning. In tackling Covid-19, the centralised top-down approach has worked neither at the national nor at the state level. Valuable time was lost in the micro-management of policies that resulted in preventable casualties. Numerous faults could be listed in the approach adopted hitherto but our endeavour at individual, societal, state and national level is to equip ourselves better for future waves. Vaccine procurement should be with Centre The amended vaccine procurement policy needs to be abandoned in favour of the previous single-point procurement by the Centre. The differential pricing policy is arbitrary and must go. Formulation of policies, after a consultative process with the states, with respect to time-bound universal vaccination; streamlined single-point vaccination procurement at the national and international levels; and ensuring adequate supply of oxygen should be the domain of the central government. Floating global tenders by states is no assurance for supply of vaccines. The financial capacities of states do not inspire confidence among international vaccine producers and their negotiation skills don’t match with the central government. Thus, the Centre is most suitable to procure from abroad and at home. The whole financial burden, like pulse polio, needs to be borne by the Union government as the precarious financial position of many states could make them falter and impede universal vaccination. A realistic assessment about the demand and supply of vaccines is a pre-requisite for a vaccination plan to blunt the impact of the second and coming waves. India administered 19.19 crore doses till the morning of May 21, 2021. Only 3.05% of the population has received the second dose. The Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have promised to ramp up vaccine production in the coming months but to what extent that is possible remains to be seen. If we are to vaccinate 85 crore people, who are above 18, in one year, then we need roughly 12.57 crore doses a month, (after accounting for 19.19 crore doses), with approximately 41.32 lakh doses administered daily against an average of 15.35 lakh achieved till May 21. It is a tall order. Any rollout plan would depend upon the capacity utilisation of producers and import tie-ups. Thus, the formulated policy ought to inform the citizens of vaccination timelines for fully vaccinating 140 crore people. Empowered task forces for region-based surveillance Considering the magnitude of the disease and size of the country, it is imperative to have cross-jurisdictional region-based surveillance for geographically contiguous areas. Thus, five national-level empowered task forces (ETFs), comprising virologists, vaccinologists, epidemiologists, government officials, and other experts for five regions, namely north, south, east and northeast, central and west India need to be constituted. These ETFs, fully empowered, will ensure the implementation and harmonisation of the national strategy taking into account specific needs of any state. Each ETF will coordinate with a similar ETF constituted at the state level. Issues of regional relevance would be resolved at the level of the relevant regional ETF and only the most contentious issues could go to a national committee, headed by the Prime Minister, comprising ministers concerned, senior secretaries, leaders from pharmaceutical companies and industry. Each state may be divided into regions, each under a group of senior officials, experts, and representatives from medical associations. Mapping of all resources from hospital beds, medicines and logistics at the state, region and zone levels is a pre-requisite. The potential of urban and rural local bodies needs to be utilised adequately. They have more reliable information on the spread of the disease, possess an effective communication network, are better placed to rope in local NGOs and are better equipped to mobilise local resources. Transparency and communicationCities with municipal corporations need to be divided into optimum number of zones, each under a dedicated group led by a senior officer and comprising medical specialists, elected municipal councillors and representatives from hospitals. Other municipal areas, and each block in rural areas, can work as a single zone under a similar dedicated group. These dedicated groups can be empowered to requisition hospital beds and ambulances under their jurisdiction whenever needed. All data about available hospital beds, ambulances, oxygen and medicines should be put on a public portal of each zone. It is time for the ministers and chief ministers to lead from the front. Let each minister, in charge of one or more districts, sit at the district headquarters to coordinate this fight. Transparency and communication with public, missing so far, will enhance credibility and bulwark against growing pessimism among citizens. We need to redirect ourselves towards our strengths instead of political bickering at the common citizens’ cost. The writer is a retired additional chief secretary of Punjab.

He misused the government machinery when he was the CM. If he has proof against any politician or officer, why did he not take any action...”On Friday, Nath offered an explanation: “Many journalists and others have a pen drive of the honey trap scandal. It was first on pen drive, the matter went to police and court later.”In 2019, it emerged that a gang of five women and a men were blackmailing some bureaucrats and politicians using sex tapes shot without their knowledge. The names of the politicians ensnared in the case have not been made public to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/row-after-kamal-nath-says-he-has-clips-of-2019-honey-trap-scandal-101621642881269.html

Chased and driven by the merciless novel coronavirus, the citizenry has been driven to desperation and despair,” the bench said.Quashing the May 1 notification by the Union finance ministry imposing 12% IGST on concentrators imported for personal use, irrespective of whether they are a gift or otherwise, the court said that the “virus has brought out the best and worst in people”.Also Read| ‘Those importing O2 devices can afford 12% IGST’: Centre tells Delhi HC“….We have messiahs. We have charlatans. We have hoarders. We have seen a kind and caring hand being struck out by strangers when they could have remained cocooned in the safety of their houses. Bravehearts, there are many; doctors, nurses, and personnel manning public institutions….,” the court noted in its 33-page order.The judgment came on a plea filed by advocate Siddharth Bambha for an 85-year-old Covid-19 patient who challenged 12% IGST being levied on oxygen concentrators after his nephew sent him the equipment as a gift from the US.To check the misuse of the oxygen concentrators being put to commercial purpose, the court said individuals importing concentrators for personal use or as gift, will have to furnish a letter of undertaking to the officer designated by the Centre that the device was not for commercial use.“Till such time an officer is designated by the State, it would be in order, if the importer were to address the undertaking to the joint secretary, customs and/or his/her nominee and handover the same to the officer detailed at the customs barrier,” the court said.Pursuant to the filing of the petition, the finance ministry issued a notification on May 3 exempting IGST on oxygen concentrators coming as donation or gifts for the state government or if procured through a canalizing agency. However, individuals were not included in the list for exemption.Also Read| QR-code system to regulate distribution of O2 devices in DelhiSenior advocate Sudhir Nandrajog along with advocate Bambha for the petitioners argued that such distinction was violative of the Constitution.The court agreed and said that such distinction is “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.The Centre, in its affidavit, argued that any person importing concentrator for personal use or has sources for receiving such supplies in gifts will be in a better position to afford the nominal 12% IGST as compared to others who source it through commercial channels.The Centre said imposition of tax or deciding rates does not come under judicial review. It said that if the argument of the petitioner is accepted, then it will lead to absurd consequences and interpretations, wherein citizens will be seeking exemption from property tax, since housing is an essential facet of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/igst-on-personal-o2-concentrators-unconstitutional-says-delhi-high-court-101621634409549.html

22-05-2021||Delhi||Families homeless after rain floods over 25 hutments||Several tenements on the floodplains of the Yamuna near east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar have been inundated in incessant rain over the past two days, rendering over 25 families homeless. Locals alleged that mounds of soil and concrete waste, dumped on the floodplains this February, exacerbated the flooding.Environment activists had raised the alarm about the dumping of soil in the area in February itself. Activists had alleged that the central public works department (CPWD), undertaking the construction of the new Parliament building using private developers, had been allowing the dumping of construction waste — including debris and soil from the site on the floodplains — in violation of an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).CPWD officials had, however, denied the allegations back in February. When Hindustan Times reached out to CPWD on Friday, officials refused to respond.“Nearly 25 houses got flooded over the past two days. The situation has been aggravated by the mounds of mud and waste dumped there. A lake of sorts has formed amid the mounds and the hutments are right in the middle of the lake,” said Dev Pal, a local resident and field researcher for citizens’ group, Housing and Land Rights Network, which had filed a petition against the dumping in the area in February. While dumping has been put on hold since February, their fears of flooding have come true, said residents.“We had feared that houses will be inundated in the event of heavy rain. Our fears have come true,” said Pal, who added that people living in the area were worried about their houses getting buried under the sand mounds and were seeking rehabilitation. “Nearly 70 families are affected by all this and nearly 25 of them have been rendered homeless by the flooding. If no steps are taken, the crisis will be much worse during the coming monsoon,” said Pal.The 25 families are now living on the road till the flood water recedes. “Water has accumulated in our homes and about 60-70 people are affected. There has been no respite from the rain since Tuesday. We are struggling to get in and out of our homes,” said Meena, who goes by her first name, and has been living in the area for the past 26 years.She said residents like her only want to be rehabilitated to a safe and secure place by the authorities. “During the day, we move to the main road with charpoys and live there. The nights are more difficult. The soil mounds and water have mixed and there is slush all around us,” said Meena.Delhi Development Authority did not comment on the flooding issue nor on the residents’ demand for rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/families-homeless-after-rain-floods-over-25-hutments-101621634584973.html
22-05-2021||City||QR-code system to regulate distribution of O2 devices in Delhi||The Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC), a think tank of the Delhi government, has developed a QR code-based system to regulate the distribution of oxygen concentrators to various Delhi government hospitals. The organisation has so far coordinated the distribution of more than 2,300 such concentrators, said DDC vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah.Another 1,700 oxygen concentrators and 100 ventilators are in the process of being supplied, said the government in a press statement.Shah said, “Several donors have come forward to give critical medical supplies. At the same time, the donors were keen to ensure that these equipment were used efficiently. To address this concern, DDC collaborated with the Boston Consulting Group and Blowhorn, a logistics start-up working on a voluntary basis, to develop a state-of-the-art QR code based tracking system.”He added: “The streamlined process involves the checking of medical equipment received from donors, attaching a unique QR code, and then supplying them to various hospitals as per their needs. At each step of the process, the QR code can be scanned to track the location as well as usage patterns of these machines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/qrcode-system-to-regulate-distribution-of-o2-devices-in-delhi-101621634700389.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: Govt||At least 800,000 migrant workers travelled from Delhi to their home states in the first four weeks of lockdown in the Capital, nearly half of them in the first week, a report by the Delhi government said, highlighting that buses and other arrangements were made for labourers to avoid a repeat of last year’s crisis.Between April 19, when the lockdown was imposed to arrest a crushing fourth wave of infections, and May 14, 807,032 passengers took buses from three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi to go to other states. These buses were arranged by the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand specially for migrant workers in addition to the daily buses plying from the terminals.“The timely coordination with transport authorities of neighbouring states especially Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand by the Delhi government has helped about eight lakh migrant workers reach their destination without any difficulty. There was no complaint of overcharging as the interstate buses were owned and operated by the respective state governments,” read the report by the state transport department.On April 19, a weekend curfew in Delhi was turned into a full lockdown for six days. At the time, the city was clocking roughly an average of 20,000 cases a day, nearly every third person tested returned a positive result , and hospitals were overrun with patients, and fast running out of oxygen and key drugs. Since then, the lockdown has been extended four times even as daily infections and positivity rates have plunged.Also Read| Covid-19 cases down, Delhi begins preparations for third waveWhile announcing the lockdown, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to migrant workers to not leave the city and assured them that the government will take care of them. Soon after, migrants started gathering at the three ISBTs at Kashmere Gate, Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar.But unlike last year -- when a nationwide lockdown on March 25 prompted tens of thousands of panicked workers to throng ISBTs and wait for 12-16 hours for a bus, or walk hundreds of kilometres back home -- Delhi government officials had negotiated bus arrangements beforehand with other state governments, especially Uttar Pradesh.“The situation was better handled this time and there was visibly less crowding at ISBTs, especially in Anand Vihar, because of better coordination with Delhi Police, proper ground management by the concerned district magistrates and timely coordination with neighbouring states. We also are still offering free meals to anyone who walks up to our hunger relief centres. The UPSRTC [UP state road transport corporation] also played a very proactive role this time and deployed a huge number of buses as soon as the lockdown in Delhi was announced. So, things were planned in advance this time,” said state transport minister Kailash Gahlot.To be sure, there are no current estimates to indicate how many migrants have returned to the Capital because the lockdown is still in effect.Nearly half of the total - 379,604 passengers - left during the first week of the lockdown. In the following weeks, the number of passengers gradually declined to 212,448 (second week), 122,490 (third week) and 92,490 (fourth week), said the report. It also stated that within the city, Delhi Transport Corportation (DTC) and cluster buses facilitated 827,905 passengers to be dropped at the ISBTs and railway stations. To be sure, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed movement of people travelling through ISBT, airports and railway stations during the ongoing lockdown.Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi makes new tracing push with revised targetsAt least 21,879 trips were made by buses, of which 8,074 were carried out in the first week. Additional government data showed a majority of the passengers travelled to Uttar Pradesh, which operated 17,762 additional buses from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi ISBTs. These two bus terminals are located along the Delhi-UP border; Anand Vihar falls under the Delhi government’s jurisdiction and Kaushambi is with the UP administration. The Anand Vihar and Kaushambi terminals alone handled the 689,642 passengers during the four weeks.Uttarakhand also deployed additional 2,000-3,000 buses. Haryana, Punjab and Bihar administrations did not deploy any additional buses.Gahlot said last year, rumours of special UP government buses forced thousands of migrants to gather overnight at Anand Vihar, but transport properly began only after 12 hours, by when the crowd had swelled to almost a kilometre.Dheeraj Sahu, UP transport commissioner and managing director of UPSRTC, said on the first day of the lockdown in Delhi this year, the state transport unit arranged for at least 5,000 additional trips from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi. He said the UPSRTC pulled three-fourth of its buses from western UP and diverted them to Anand Vihar for migrant workers.“We arranged everything in a very short notice. As soon as the Delhi government informed us about the lockdown, we called a high-level meeting at Lucknow, and it was decided that UPSRTC should put all its might in transporting people from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi so that we do not see a repeat of what happened last year. It was decided that UPSRTC will deploy additional buses for migrant workers apart from the usual 1,000 buses operated per day from these points. Almost three-fourth of all our buses operating in the western UP region were pressed to service at Anand Vihar and Kaushambi,” Sahu said.The Delhi government report said that this time, the crowd was also lower because trains were operational, unlike the last lockdown when railway stations were shut. “Yet, buses are the first choice of migrant workers because it is slightly cheaper and it is more accessible to their home villages than a railway station,” said a senior transport official. Last year, trains for migrant workers were started only after a month of lockdown on May 1.HT tried to find similar passenger data from last year, but the transport department said such a record was not available because in 2020, all forms of transport were prohibited during the nationwide lockdown.The state also arranged 500 cluster buses to ferry workers from Delhi to far-flung places in neighbouring states.The buses didn’t have any restriction on who could board them but officials said the high number of outward trips in the first week coupled with the lockdown -- which discouraged non-emergency travel -- meant that an overwhelming majority of those travelling were migrants.“The report states the number of passengers who boarded interstate buses from Delhi including the additional buses deployed by various states. The weekly break-up of the same shows that the demand for such transport services was highest during the first week, indicating it is mostly migrant workers and their families who were using these buses to reach their villages,” a second transport department official said.Debolina Kundu, professor at the national institute of urban affairs, said, the governments should not only prepare healthcare facilities for the potential third wave, but also provide adequate facilities for the migrant workers to avert a mass exodus."Experts have already warned of a third wave, so to avoid similar migrant issues from cropping up the governments need to ensure three basic things before imposing a lockdown again - a place to live, a social security from the government in the form of financial assistance and free rations irrespective of identity proof. Most of the migrant workers in Delhi have no option but to leave because they are tenants and live on rent. Affordable rental housing complexes, announced by the central government should be created expeditiously to ensure they have a place to live on such occasions. They must be given some free ration and employment guarantee. But, these measures should come a little ahead of the announcement of the lockdown, so that the workers have some confidence in the system and do not leave the city," said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-800k-migrants-left-delhi-after-lockdown-announced-govt-101621636995573.html

As the world celebrates International Day for Biodiversity on Saturday, it’s relevant to put the spotlight on how seven biodiversity parks in the city not only maintain green cover, but also make an important contribution in increasing the counts of birds and animals.Delhi is home to the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Neela Hauz Biodiversity Park, Tilpath Valley Biodiversity Park, Northern Ridge (Kamla Nehru Ridge), Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, and Kalindi Biodiversity Park.Data from each of these parks show that, since their inception, the count of species within them has spiked.Faiyaz A Khudsar, scientist-in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which came up in 2002, said, “The Delhi Development Authority’s biodiversity parks have assumed global importance as models for replication. They not only help conserve the vanishing natural heritage from urban centres but also serve many more functions, such as serving as vegetation filters for non-point source air pollutants, imparting resilience to climate change, enhancing water availability to the city and providing cultural, conservational and educational services.”Data showed that in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which is spread across 184 hectares, the count of terrestrial plants increased from 90 in 2002 to 915 in 2020. The count of mammals in the park went up from just four to 22, butterflies increased from 11 to 82; number of fishes increased from nil to 18, and the number of aquatic plants went up from two to 101 last year. The bird species count increased from 37 in 2002 to 203 in 2020.In 2016, the park also saw the arrival of a leopard.The ecology at the 280-hectare Aravalli Biodiversity Park is no different. When the park was established in 2005, it had 150 species of terrestrial plants, which increased to 950 in 2020, and the count of mammals went up from five to 19 in the same period.Data also showed that the number of butterflies went up from 13 in 2005 to 113 last year, and the number of birds increased from 42 to 209.CR Babu, who heads the biodiversity parks project of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) at Delhi University, said that these parks are nature reserves, which harbour natural heritage and have functions such as carbon sequestration — a process in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and stored in the plant body and soil, recharging groundwater and controlling the micro climate of an area, among others.“Over the next few years, we will undertake more studies to find out how these parks are functioning. This will help us get important information, such as the amount of carbon they are able to sequester and whether they are able to recharge groundwater levels and control local temperature,” Babu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-birds-and-animals-make-delhi-s-7-nature-parks-their-homes-101621628814019.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Kailash Colony’s actor-cum-poet||While Delhi passes through one of its most tragic times in living history, it has citizens distilling their experiences into art.Isolated within home in Kailash Colony, actor Siddharth Sethi, 20, is away from fellow actors and rehearsals, away from the audience and the stage. “Theatre was my escape into a reality other than mine,” he says on a WhatsApp video chat. With the city in lockdown, he is flailing about in only one reality.This reality too is rich, comprising of his “dada,” parents, and younger sister, Suhani, who is holding his mobile for this photo shoot. There are online classes to stay busy—Mr Sethi is a literature student in Delhi University’s Hansraj College. Plus, he recently acted in two plays performed on zoom; the virtual audience were encouraging college mates and folks from DU’s “theatre circuit.” He also penned a poem in the ongoing isolation “as a let out to reassure myself that this too shall pass.” Mr Sethi chose an uncommon word for the title. We won’t give away its meaning. Go and flip through your heirloom dictionary or read the poem.KadotaThis fire burns my bellyThe cries mar my sleepThese silences give me shiversThe spirits wound me deepAway from the chains of my beingMy freedoms lure me strong,Rotting in my sickness, desolateI struggle every breath,I struggle to belong,But not any more.My skies crave my warmthMy seas swallow my desiresThese thorns on my skin, thrive on my memoriesMy pains suck my soul, they loathe my fallacious attire.My fears conspire against meWith the evils that reside in my eyesMy sanity give me shiversMy truths worship my liesBut not any more.My boundaries set my lengthsMy eternity fiddles with my hopeMy touch, longs for a ventMy sighs, my desires grope.Barren deserts mock my stories,With glee, they imitate my tears,The storms sing me lullabyThe tot within though,Restless it appears.But not any more.My chest enthrones my past;With pride, with power, with careMy touch comforts my soulOn my body, my scars lay bare.I’m struggling, for the good I believeFor I’m struggling for myself,against myselfTo be who I am, and not who I am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-kailash-colony-s-actorcumpoet-101621627859242.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Infant’s death: Dispute redressal commission asks Ludhiana hospital to pay ₹35 lakh||Holding a city-based private hospital guilty of gross medical negligence following the death of an infant, a day after its birth in 2016, the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed the hospital and insurance company to jointly pay ₹35 lakh as compensation. In addition to the compensation, Handa Hospital, Civil Lines, where Dr Pratibha Handa, was the gynaecologist on duty and Dr Pradeep Handa, the paediatrician, will have to pay ₹33,000 as litigation expenses to the complainant, Pulkit Kapoor, and her husband Karan Kapoor on account of “sudden loss of newly born child because of sheer medical negligence as well as the resultant loss of love and affection of the child, mental agony, harassment, and avoidable pain and suffering caused to the complainants.”While pronouncing the judgment, justice Paramjit Singh Dhaliwal, president, State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission observed that during each visit between November 27 to July 26, 2016, the complainants were informed that the mother and baby were fine, without any complications and there would be hassle free normal delivery. Initially, the expected date of delivery was July 26, 2016 but the same was later changed to August 3, without explaining the reason. Caesarean section delivery was neither required nor suggested.What happened? “After complainant developed labour pains on July 26, 2016, she was taken to Handa Hospital at 2pm. However, despite repeated requests, she was examined by Dr Pratibha only at 4.30pm. She was told to tolerate the pain and her pulse rate, blood pressure, or foetal heart rate were not monitored. She was also not allowed to meet her husband,” Bhavnik Mehta, the complainants’ counsel said. “It was only at 10.20pm, over six hours after first check up that Dr Pratibha came to attend the complainant. After a cursory examination, she noticed that the baby had passed meconium (stool). She informed complainant that the baby was in distress, due to which emergency caesarean operation would have to be performed. Thereafter, she went away, without addressing the concerns of the complainants and did not show any professionalism, sensitivity and empathy,” said the order.The caesarean section was performed and the baby was delivered at 11.04 pm.The complainant requested the paediatrician to arrange an ambulance from DMC Hospital, but Dr Pradeep took the baby in his private car. The mother was not allowed to accompany the baby. Dr Pradeep told her that he had put a breathing tube in the baby’s throat and that he would send his ward boy. There was no other equipment in the car. The baby had turned blue (cyanosed), was cold and was breathing occasionally by the time he reached DMC Hospital. The doctors at DMC Hospital said the baby was critically ill, because of lack of oxygen in his system and it had caused irreparable damage to the brain system. In all, ₹1,25,000 was spent on treatment of the child but it was declared dead at 9.30pm on July 27, 2016.The order Although, the loss suffered by the complainants due to deficiency in service and medical negligence cannot be compensated in terms of money, yet in view of the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, we award lump sum compensation of ₹35 lakh to the complainants along with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint till realisation, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/infants-death-dispute-redressal-commission-asks-ludhiana-hospital-to-pay-35-lakh-101621631693274.html

22-05-2021||Delhi||Over 100 air ambulances operated from IGIA in April||The General Aviation terminal at the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport has handled about 100 air ambulance movements in April alone. The flights were operated between Delhi and airports across the country and to several international locations like Germany, Dubai, Zurich, Kathmandu, Dhaka, etc, said airport officials aware of the matter.According to Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), which runs the airport, currently, there are 12 aircraft owned by different charter jet operators which are permitted to operate as air ambulances from IGI airport. These aircraft have completed at least 100 movements in April alone, ferrying Covid patients to different states and even abroad, said DIAL officials.“Most of these air ambulances function from the newly constructed dedicated General Aviation (GA) apron. While the pilots and the crew travel from the GA Terminal, the patients’ movement takes place through dedicated airside gates to avoid any chances of contamination inside airport terminals. On board, Covid patients are kept in German-made isolation pods, a protective cover with oxygen arrangement,” said an official.Under the current circumstances, patients are to be accompanied only by a doctor, a paramedical officer and a nurse. These are certified doctors trained to handle critical care while flying, the operator added.DIAL also said it ensures timely sanitisation of the ambulance aircraft and dedicated passage for patients to board the ambulance.“Regular fumigation and use of particular garbage bins for used PPE kits are also ensured. Our staff follow all the precautionary protocols to comply with Covid-19 safety measures while handling emergency activities at the Delhi airport,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-100-air-ambulances-operated-from-igia-in-april-101621629183448.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Gangster Jaipal Bhullar, aides used snatched police weapons to gun down ASIs in Jagraon||Gangster Jaipal Bhullar and his three accomplices, who are on the run after gunning down two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) of the crime investigation agency (CIA) in Jagraon town of Ludhiana district on May 15, had used 9mm pistols, which are strictly reserved for security personnel, to carry out the killings, police officials said on Friday. It is suspected that the weapons used to kill ASIs Bhagwan Singh and Dalwinderjit Singh had been snatched from an ASI in Doraha city, five days before the attack, police said. It is suspected that Bhullar and his aides — Balwinder Singh of Mahalla Khurd village, Moga; Jaspreet Singh of Kharar town, Mohali; and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village, Ludhiana — have at least three official pistols, including one snatched from slain ASI Bhagwan Singh, in their possession.The development has sent shock waves across the police department, which is now scrambling to connect incidents where miscreants have made off with police weapons to crimes committed using 9mm pistols. Two recent incidents where the police personnel have lost their service pistols to miscreants are under the scanner. On May 10, two occupants of a Hyundai Aura car had assaulted ASI Sukhdev Singh on the national highway in Doraha and fled with his service pistol, which was loaded with six bullets.  They had injured the ASI with the butt of a pistol they were already carrying and driven off on the wrong side of the road after removing the number plates of the car. An FIR was registered under Sections 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 379-B (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and different sections of the Arms act against unidentified accused at the Doraha police station.It is suspected that the vehicle used to carry out the crime had been snatched from an insurance company employee at gunpoint in Samrala on October 23. However, the police had failed to trace the accused.In the second incident that took place on May 3, ASI Rajesh Kumar, who is deputed in the anti-smuggling cell, had lost his service pistol loaded with 10 bullets to miscreants, who had broken into his car after smashing its windowpanes near the civil hospital. A case had been lodged against unidentified accused at Police Division 2.Inspector general of police (IGP, Ludhiana range) Naunihal Singh said the bullets recovered from the bodies of the ASIs had been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination. “Several teams are working round-the-clock to arrest Bhullar and his aides,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-jaipal-bhullar-aides-used-snatched-police-weapons-to-gun-down-asis-in-jagraon-101621629952462.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana restauranteurs elated over curfew relaxation; biz will remain hit, say traders||Ludhiana The announcement of one-hour relaxation in curfew timings from May 24 has failed to appease traders at large. However, permission to deliver cooked meals till 8pm has certainly brought respite to the food industry, which as per the May 8 orders, could not deliver food after noon, leaving them with inconvenient business hours. Those running non-essential business say their sales have dipped because of the curfew and an hour’s relaxation in the afternoon was unlikely to help drum up business. “The relaxation hours from 5am to 1pm are not conducive for business,” said a shopkeeper, who did not wish to be named. A trader, Sunil Vinayak, recommends that the curfew be relaxed between 8am to 3pm. “Under the present slot, what is the point of increasing the relaxation by an hour? It will only increase the chaos in the market. the timing should be such that it suits everybody.” Jewellers in Catch-22 situation Raman Gogna, a jeweller, says, “Gold rates are announced at 11.30am, so we are left with a very small window for sale and purchase. Thanks to the odd relaxation timings, customers are not showing up. If the timings are changed to 8am to 4pm, it will help our business. The timings right now, are as good as an airtight curfew, for the all the good it does us,” said Gogna.Nonetheless, restauranteurs welcomed the announcement. “Being allowed to deliver food will provide a major respite to the food industry. It is a step towards gradual reopening. At the very least, we will be able to meet some of our expenses. Takeaways and home delivery are a small percentage of our sales, while in-house dining is the mainstay. I do understand that under the present circumstances it is not wise to start in-house dining. However, I hope that in time, it too can be restarted, said Sukhkaran Singh Gill, who owns a restaurant in Ghumar Mandi. “Till such a time, the government should give small business owners some incentives such as tax rebates, relaxation in electricity charges and other taxes levied by the municipal corporation,” Singh added.‘Timely shot in the arm’ Another restaurant owner, Harjinder Singh Kukreja, agrees, “Timely action will save the industry from sinking. Food delivery is as essential as medicines. Many quarantined patients and senior citizens depend on food delivery,”he said.Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said the relaxation had provided oxygen to the asphyxiating food industry. “We are hoping that the government will soon allow 50 to 100 people to assemble for weddings,” Amarvir said. Bhupinder Basant, senior vice-chairperson, Punjab Traders Board (excise and taxation) has also appreciated the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-restauranteurs-elated-over-curfew-relaxation-biz-will-remain-hit-say-traders-101621629652705.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Come May 24, curfew in Ludhiana to be relaxed for another hour||In a relief to the business community, come May 24, shops in Ludhiana district will be able to stay open for another hour as the administration decided to extend the weekday curfew relaxation timings till 1pm on Friday. As per the fresh directions, hotels and restaurants, which had taken a hit thanks to the inconvenient curfew relaxation timings, will now be able to deliver cooked food till 8pm. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “Relaxation time for all shops has been extended by one hour from Monday to Friday. Earlier, the seven-hour relaxation window was from 5am to noon. However, now shops can remain open till 1pm.” “Though, the 16-hour curfew will begin at 1pm, hotels and restaurants can now deliver food till 8pm,” the DC said. The fresh directions came as a breather for the hotel and restaurant industry of Ludhiana, which had suffered huge losses due to the restrictions as even home delivery had been prohibited in curfew hours in the orders announced on May 8. “No dining in is permitted but takeaways are allowed till 1pm. Strict action will be taken against those found ordering takeaways from hotels after curfew has been imposed. E-commerce and courier companies may also function from Monday to Friday till 8pm after taking curfew passes,” he said, adding that there had been no let-up in the weekend curfew, which will start at 1pm on Friday till 5 am on Monday, as usual.Appreciating the business community’s support in reining in the cases, the DC said, “The district’s positivity rate has dropped. The number of fatalities is still high but we hope the figures will reduce in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/come-may-24-curfew-in-ludhiana-to-be-relaxed-for-another-hour-101621629172987.html

Owners of huge properties and well-established business houses are coming forward to make their wills so that everything they own can be settled without any disputes,” he said.In Ludhiana, which has witnessed 1,837 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, the maximum number of fatalities in the second wave is of those in their 50s and 60s, and the disturbing trend has provoked people to come forward to draft wills. In the past 13 days (May 9 to 21), 101 persons in their 50s and 74 in their 60s have succumbed to the virus in Ludhiana.Advocate Arpita Bector, who deals with corporate as well as insurance cases, says there has been a section of the business community in Ludhiana that has become highly proactive to drafting their wills, especially after the deadly second wave.“Life has suddenly become a lot more uncertain. There is a surge in such cases and deaths due to Covid, driving the wealthy to plan the pass down of their estate in advance. A large number of them are declaring their immovable assets,” she said adding that this trend should be further encouraged.Advocate Parupkar Singh Ghuman said there was no dearth of people making wills in Punjab even earlier. “But people in 70s or 60s used to comprise the majority of our clientele till now, which has changed this year. Over the last one month, a number of people in their 50s, 60s and even 40s have approached us for consultation or drafting of wills,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rising-covid-deaths-driving-ludhiana-s-wealthy-to-draft-wills-sooner-101621628217078.html

The state government, however, claims to have started making preparations amid concerns that the third wave of the pandemic may attack kids more. In the second wave till April 30, the case fatality ratio (CFR) in the 0-14 age group is 0.1% against 0.4% in the first wave (till December 31, 2020), according to the age-wise analysis of the positive patients. “In the 11-20 age group, the CFR in the second wave is 0.3% as compared to 0.9% in the first wave. Deaths in this age group in the first wave were more,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. However, positivity rate (number of persons detected positive against those tested) in the 0-10 age group during the second wave is 2% against 1.8% in the first wave. The Punjab government on Thursday announced to start “mission mode” preparedness to tackle the third wave by setting up special treatment facilities for children. Taking stock of the Covid situation in the state, the chief minister has directed the state expert group headed by former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar to look into all aspects and get training modules prepared for the health department. “Kids are considered to be the safe from the virus because of the natural protection they enjoy because of different reasons. What will make them more prone to the virus in the third wave is that a large number of adults would have got vaccinated by that time. Also, the way the virus is mutating, we don’t know how it will target different age groups. It’s better we get prepared for every eventuality,” said Dr Talwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/death-rate-among-kids-less-during-second-wave-than-first-in-punjab-101621628216139.html

The facility is equipped with oxygen concentrators. Accompanied by SGPC president Jagir Kaur, her predecessor Gobind Singh Longowal, former MLA Iqbal Singh Jhunda and party spokesman Winnerjit Singh Goldy, the SAD chief asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to assign districts to his ministers to deal with the crisis by ensuring all patients had access to medicines and oxygen.“The black fungus is more dangerous but medicines are not available for the disease in many hospitals. The government should have made arrangements in advance but failed to do so,” he added.The former deputy chief minister announced that the SGPC was in the process of procuring 50,000 doses of vaccine and would start a drive to vaccinate people in the days to come. He said the government should also talk to vaccine manufacturers and place purchase orders directly to meet the demand for vaccine in the state.Jagir Kaur said more Covid care centres would be set up by the SGPC in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-critical-care-facilities-in-17-districts-sgpc-to-provide-vaccine-sukhbir-badal-101621628212277.html

The state Congress must tell Punjabis if this is a part of a conspiracy to scuttle the kisan andolan at the instance of the central government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-flays-minister-tript-bajwa-for-linking-farmers-stir-to-covid-surge-in-punjab-101621628156014.html

On the other side, the dera chief has been granted the same despite committing heinous offences.”“This shows the government’s double standards. Releasing him on parole is nothing but a potential act of vitiating Punjab’s atmosphere. Peace in the state must not be disturbed at any cost and the dera chief’s parole must be cancelled,” demanded the jathedar.The Takht head added, “I think this move is politically motivated. Secondly, once again the government has discriminated against the Sikhs. On the other hand, culprits of the Sikh massacre have not been arrested yet. This is a grave injustice to the community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akal-takht-opposes-dera-chief-gurmeet-ram-rahim-s-parole-101621628155000.html

In the first wave, they were overworked, but now they have to deal with saving lives as the health infrastructure is crumbling.Doctors, including senior residents with just a few years of experience, have to make tough decisions under extreme situations. Death of patients, delay in treatment due to non-availability of ventilator beds and a shortage of medicines, are leaving doctors stressed, and mentally vulnerable.Thus, to ensure their psychological well-being, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) here has started a burnout helpline to address mental health issues.Dr Rajvir Kaur, a junior resident of anaesthesia department, who is working in Covid ward, said, “We have been on regular Covid duty without quarantine for over a year now.

Work has been quite stressful.”“Seeing people die despite every effort to save their lives is affecting our mental health. Many of us have not gone home, as there’s a chance that we may spread it to family members,” said Dr Diksha, also working in the Covid ward.To helpline will be accessible from 3pm to 7pm daily and doctors can seek help on 95677-68078 (Monday-Friday) and 88614-31673 (Saturday-Sunday).BFUHS registrar Dr Ruhee Dugg said that there is no data available regarding mental health issues, but doctors are mentally exhausted because of the workload and tough decision making. “The helpline is aimed at addressing these doctors’ mental health concerns,” she added.“The counselling will be provided free of cost by Dr Ashwani, founder of Mukta Foundation, Bangalore, and fellow psychologists, who would conduct on-call counselling sessions. The helpline would be initially available from 3pm to 7pm daily, and the same would be extended further if demand increases. Any doctor across the state dealing with stress can take these sessions,” she added.A psychiatrist said that there is too much exhaustion and fatigue among doctors while nobody has a clear idea about when the pandemic would come to an end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/helpline-set-up-to-help-punjab-doctors-on-covid-duty-cope-with-burnout-101621628154086.html

Majority of the patients suffer from anxiety, worries, non-specific psychological distress, depression, stress symptoms including PTSD, insomnia, hallucinations, paranoia and suicidal ideation, he added. “People are also worried about how will they get their medications during the curfew. Patients in isolation also have symptoms of anxiety and had been contacting us. Those in hospital isolation are highly vulnerable to experiencing psychiatric symptoms, which may be either due to direct effects of the illness, reactionary or sometimes side effects of the medications like steroids or other drugs,” Jindal said. So far, 4,854 people have reached out to doctors and counsellors through different helplines set up by the government . Out of them, 2,337 patients have been counselled since January this year.Anxiety, anger, depression, fear of contracting infection and frustration due to inability to meet people and go out freely are the common emotions with most of the people. Some people, who are vulnerable or have pre-existing mental health issues, have clinically significant depression and anxiety or even may develop suicidal ideation,” said Dr Dinesh Dutt Sharma, head of psychiatry department, IGMC.

A 40-year-old patient suffering from mucormycosis was admitted to the government medical college in Jammu on Thursday, but he succumbed today, said financial commissioner health and medical education Atal Dulloo. Principal and dean of GMC, Dr Shashi Sudan Sharma, said, “His tests confirmed him to be a case of mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus. His blood sugar had shot up to 900 when he was brought to the hospital emergency.” He was a Covid patient, who had recovered and even tested negative in RTPCR test. “He contracted black fungus due to his uncontrolled levels of blood sugar. Steroids are given to Covid patients for a long time, but in his case his blood sugar was uncontrolled and he had not been administered with proper antidiabetic medication,” Sharma said. People with weak immunity and those having uncontrolled diabetes are vulnerable to this disease, she added. Once inside the body, black fungus starts damaging blood vessels, brain and even bones. Dr Sharma said that doctors were attending to him and the first priority was to bring down his blood sugar levels and stabilise them, but he died this afternoon. “Black fungus is not related to Covid, but we have found it in corona patients in other states. Since steroids are used in the treatment of Covid for a long time, in cases of steroid-induced diabetes and uncontrolled sugar levels, the patient may get predisposition to this condition called black fungus. It is not a communicable disease at all,” she added. She said that when the patient was brought to the emergency, he not only had 900 blood sugar level, but was in ketoacidosis state. “The mucormycosis had progressed a lot in him and in such cases, we have to first control underlying diseases like diabetes and ketoacidosis. We also give anti-fungal, but first the underlying disease has to be controlled. Recovery rate vary from patient to patient,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/first-black-fungus-patient-in-jammu-dies-101621628036094.html

No action was taken to remove the blockade despite it having filed a number of complaints with the police, the firm had said.The state government in response to the plea had informed court that of the 300 loaded containers lying in the depot earlier, 275 carrying perishable goods were taken out. Only 25 containers of non-perishable goods are parked there, it added. The court was also informed that these containers are held up on account of custom clearance and not protests. Meetings were held with farmers and they have sought time to await the decision of the Supreme Court regarding challenge to the three farm laws. On the other hand, the firm had told the court that nearly 450 customers, including exporters and importers, are associated with the inland container depot that has 89 workers. The high court bench of Justice HS Sidhu said under the circumstances, it may be appropriate that the DGP in consultation with the chief secretary may take an initiative to get the blockade lifted and the exercise be carried out expeditiously. The DGP shall file a personal affidavit on the outcome by June 4, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-protest-hc-seeks-punjab-dgp-s-reply-on-adani-subsidiary-plea-101621627973155.html

It said from 2018 to 2020, as many as 75,355 machines were given on subsidy for machines which could process 6.45 million tonne stubble against 20 million tonne paddy straw produced every kharif season. Of the 20 million tonnes, half rest is set on fire, it added. Crop residue management machines include mulcher, rotavator, happy seeder, straw shredder and reverse plough. According to the action plan, 70,000 subsidised machines will supplied to farmers in the year 2021-22; 20,000 in 2022-23 and 10,000 in in 2023-24. In the upcoming season, paddy will be cultivated on an estimated 27 lakh hectares and the premium basmati over 5.35 lakh hectares.The Union ministry of agriculture had earlier given a grant of ₹793 crore to Punjab to purchase machines. In 2018-19, ₹269.38 crore was released and 27,747 machines were distributed to the farmers. In 2019-2020, as many as 23,068 machines were given when the state received ₹273.8 crore. In 2020-21, 24,540 machines were distributed to the farmers at ₹250 crore. The machines are given on 50% subsidy to individual farmers and 80% subsidy to the custom hiring centres.

So there is a break in the supply chain due to which 40% of the workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have gone back to their villages. This has resulted in the production going down by around 30%.”‘Employees suffering from Covid’“There is an acute shortage of steel due to decline in the supply and very high prices in the domestic market. Some of our employees are suffering from Covid-19, which has also resulted in reduction in production. Also due to the non-availability of containers, the exporters are not able to meet their targets. As most of the markets are under shutdown, manufacturers are not able to sell their final products,” said Vivek Kapoor, vice-president of MIA.Former president of MIA, Sanjeev Vashist, said that the production had also reduced due to the non-availability of oxygen cylinders for manufacturing. This has led to production going down by 40-50% in most of the units, he added.Around 10 industries became operational in Mohali in 1978, growing to about 10,000 units, including manufacturing and IT/ service industry. The Industrial Area is divided into different phases: Phase 1 to 4 fall under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), Phase 7, 8-A, and 8-B under the Punjab Small Industries Export Corporation Limited (PSIEC) and Phase 9 under Punjab Infotech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/industrial-production-in-mohali-down-by-30-in-three-weeks-101621627913562.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Technical institute faculty in Chandigarh to retire at 65 not 58: HC||In a significant judgment, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held that retirement age for faculty of institutes governed under norms of All India Institute of Technical Education (AICTE) will be 65 years and not 58 as fixed by Chandigarh administration. The court also directed that the petitioners who have been forcibly superannuated be taken back with consequential benefits. The high court bench of justices AG Masih and AK Verma set aside the 1992 rules adopted by Chandigarh administration according to which retirement age of faculty of institutes such as Government College of Arts and Government College of Architecture, Chandigarh, was fixed at 58 years. The high court held that retirement age of such faculty will be 65 years with an extension period of five years as applicable in central government institutes. A set of faculty members of these two colleges had moved Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) challenging the 1992 rules. However, in 2020, the CAT had dismissed their plea. Their argument was that their institutes are governed under AICTE Act, 1987, and rules with regard to regulations on pay scales, service conditions etc. would apply as followed by all AICTE governed institutes. The UT had argued that the services of the petitioners are covered by the rules framed under 1992 notification according to which Punjab government service rules have been adopted. Hence, retirement age would remain at 58 years. The high court bench said in the case of the Union Territories, the rule-making power belongs to the President. This power under Article 309 and the rules framed will operate and will have a force of law, unless and until Parliament chooses to legislate on the subject. “Once the Parliament legislates, such Act and the rules/regulations framed there under, would take over the field resulting in the rules framed by the president under proviso to Article 309 seizing to operate forthwith,” the court said referring to AICTE Act. The court said that under AICTE Regulations, 2010, the age for superannuation was 65 years with a provision for re-employment up to the age of 70 years. To the argument that funds for the colleges are provided by the UT, the court said that these are central government funds and UT is merely utilising them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/technical-institute-faculty-in-chandigarh-to-retire-at-65-not-58-hc-101621627912050.html

Vij formed a three-member committee to probe the complaints forwarded to him by Vidhan Sabha speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta. The committee, comprising state medical education and research director Dr Shaleen, additional director general of health services Dr VK Bansal and a state finance department official, will submit its report in a week. Gupta had written to the state government, requesting it to carry out an audit of bills issued to Covid patients by private hospitals. He had even visited Paras Hospital after getting complaints of overcharging. Gupta said, “I had recommended that the allegations against Paras Hospital be probed by a high-level committee after the district-level committee had found discrepancies. I have also recommended that the licence of the hospital be cancelled and the same be locked as we cannot allow them to fleece the patients.” Speaker cites three instances Gupta in his letter to the health minister had mentioned three cases of overcharging. One Jog Dhyan was handed over a bill of ₹7.6 lakh by Paras Hospital on May 13 for his treatment for Covid-19 between May 2 and 13.

Before this, the lowest positivity rate in the city was 4.64% on April 4.At its peak of the April-May surge, the positivity rate hit an all-time high of 36.24% on April 22.The test positivity rate is a crucial metric to judge the spread of an infection in an area. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a number below 5% for a two-week period for an infection to be considered under control.In the past seven days, 7.58% of all samples have tested positive in the Capital, down sharply from 17.93% in the previous week ending May 14.New cases too kept up their steady drop in the city, with 3,009 fresh infections logged, showed the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday. Delhi recorded 3,231 new infections on Thursday, and 3,846 cases the day before that.The seven-day average of cases, known as the case trajectory, dropped below the 5,000 mark on Friday for the first time in 43 days. A week ago on May 14, Delhi added an average of 12,588 cases every day.However, the daily death toll increased in Delhi on Friday, with 252 more people dying of the infection, the health bulletin showed, compared to 233 deaths the previous day. However, the seven-day average of deaths has dropped continuously for the past five days, from 312 on May 17 to 275 on Friday.To be sure, any drop in case trajectory generally takes 14 days to reflect on daily deaths as studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.Also Read| IGST on personal O2 concentrators unconstitutional, says Delhi high court“It is a good sign, but it is one day.

And, even then, we shouldn’t think about easing all restrictions immediately,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research. “A huge proportion of the population must have been exposed to the infection during the current wave; they will likely have some immunity for the next four to six months. We should use this time to prepare for the next surge.”The drop in new infections has led to a sharp fall in the active case count, which fell to 35,683 on Friday, down from 71,794 a week ago.Also Read| Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: GovtThis drop in active cases means that hospitalisations for the infection are also on the decline in the city.

22-05-2021||Delhi||Hoarding case: ED raids on Kalra and Duggal’s premises in South Delhi||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday raided the premises of businessmen Navneet Kalra and Gagan Duggal in connection with its money laundering probe into alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators, people familiar with the development said.Among the places raided included their residences at Mandi Road in South Delhi’s Mehrauli and Kalra’s restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nega & Ju – as well as Dayal Opticals in the upscale Khan Market, officials said. A team separately searched Kalra’s bank lockers.Officials told HT that the ED team recovered 150 foreign brand liquor bottles from Kalra’s residence.The agency said UK-based businessman Gagan Duggal, managing director of Matrix Cellular International Services Limited (Matrix), was working with Kalra in importing the concentrators to India and selling at inflated prices.ED’s probe, according to two officials cited above, has revealed that both Kalra and Duggal imported more than 7,000 oxygen concentrators from China in the past one month and sold at exorbitant prices by claiming that the concentrators are made with German technology.“The forensic examination of the concentrators has revealed that they were low quality equipment. Kalra and Duggal bought these in China and same were routed to India via Hong Kong,” said the first officer, who asked not to be named.ED’s probe has revealed that the import price per unit of oxygen concentrator for Kalra and Duggal was ₹15,000 but they were charging R69,999 per unit from buyers. “They took advantage of a raging pandemic and made huge profit by cheating the public,” said another ED officer, who also asked to remain anonymous.The agency registered a case earlier this week to investigate the money trail of sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators and beneficiaries of hoarded concentrators. The federal anti-money laundering probe agency has powers to attach properties if established that money made by the accused is proceeds of crime.Kalra was arrested from a farmhouse in Gurugram on Sunday evening. He is currently in judicial custody.The Delhi Police recovered 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – owned by Kalra and from the office of Matrix Cellular between May 5 and May 7. Before Kalra, five people, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, chief executive officer (CEO) and three senior officers of Matrix Cellular, were arrested after the recovery of the concentrators. However, all five were later released on bail with the court observing that it was unable to understand the offence they had committed as the government did not regulate the prices of the devices .In a statement after the arrest of CEO Gourav Khanna and other officials, Matrix said, “All materials procured by Matrix have been by way of import or purchase in India, after paying all relevant duties and taxes. Matrix has thereafter facilitated sale of such equipment / materials via it’s app or direct orders placed on the company, all of which have used formal banking channels based on tax invoices with an unimpeachable audit trail.”Samudra Sarangi, lead counsel for Matrix, said the company has filed documents before the high court to prove the allegations made by the police are misplaced. “Matrix has filed documents before the Delhi high court which prove the allegations of exorbitant pricing and deficient quality of oxygen concentrators are misplaced and incorrect. Matrix unequivocally denies any wrongdoing in the matter. The matter is currently before the courts and Matrix has faith that the legal process will vindicate it.”Kalra’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa didn’t comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hoarding-case-ed-raids-on-kalra-and-duggal-s-premises-in-south-delhi-101621626782237.html

A BJP delegation led by former Member of Parliament (MP) Kirit Somaiya met Koshyari and submitted a memorandum demanding action against Parab as well as the demolition of the resort.“Parab has constructed an illegal resort worth ₹10 crore on agriculture land. The construction was done last year during the Covid-19 lockdown. He has misused his position and indulged in forgery. For this, he should be removed as a minister,” alleged Somaiya.He added that Parab had purchased the plot at Murud from an individual on June 19, 2019, by paying ₹1 crore. “Last year, Parab got a three-storey building with 24 rooms constructed on the plot. This is an illegal construction as it violated the CRZ (coastal regulation zone) norms,” said Somaiya.The minister, however, rubbished the allegations as pack of lies.“I have nothing to do with the resort and Somaiya is just indulging in political vendetta,” he said. Parab is a close confidant of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and a senior minister in the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/governor-to-seek-report-on-bjp-s-allegations-of-illegal-resort-against-maharashtra-minister-101621627311449.html

22-05-2021||Mumbai||Elgaar Parishad case: Would prefer to die in jail instead of going to hospital, accused Stan Swamy tells HC||Tribal rights activist Stan Swamy – arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case – has refused to get shifted to any government hospital to undergo treatment for his frail health. The Jesuit priest said that he would prefer to die at Taloja jail, where he is currently lodged, instead of getting shifted to Sir JJ Hospital. Swamy, while speaking to the Bombay high court (HC) bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade through video-conferencing from Taloja jail said that when he was arrested eight months ago, he could walk, bathe and eat by himself. However, owing to the “bad conditions” at the jail, his health slowly deteriorated, and hence, he would prefer to be sent to Ranchi rather than being shifted to some hospital. In an earlier hearing, the bench while hearing Swamy’s bail application of on medical grounds was informed that as the 84-year-old was ailing from several health problems, and should be granted interim bail. His lawyers had approached HC after the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court had rejected Swamy’s bail application in March. After hearing the application on May 19, the bench had directed Taloja jail authorities to take Swamy to Sir JJ Hospital and asked its dean to constitute a committee of expert doctors to examine the octogenarian and submit its report on Friday. The court had also sought Swamy’s presence through video-conferencing. On Friday, the court perused Sir JJ Hospital’s report which stated that Swamy’s parameters were normal, but he had severe hearing and lower back problems and general weakness. When the bench asked Swamy about his health condition, he said, “I was brought healthy to Taloja jail eight months back but over that period all my body functions have deteriorated. Though I have been getting medicines it has not helped.” On the judges’ suggestion to shift him to Sir JJ Hospital for improving his health condition, Swamy said, “The economic condition of prisoners is not good and I would prefer to die here rather than be shifted to Sir JJ Hospital. I have seen JJ hospital and would prefer to remain in Taloja jail.” When the bench suggested that Swamy be shifted to some other hospital, also he again declined. His counsel, senior advocate Mihir Desai, requested the court to grant him some time to convince the Jesuit priest, which the court allowed and posted the hearing of the application on June 7. The bench permitted Desai to approach the court prior to that if Swamy agreed to get shifted to any other hospital, like Holy Family hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgaar-parishad-case-would-prefer-to-die-in-jail-instead-of-going-to-hospital-accused-stan-swamy-tells-hc-101621627252010.html

Remdesivir is in great demand as it used for the treatment of Covid patients.On the other hand, Sharma has also lodged a counter complaint with the police against the directors, alleging fabricating documents pertaining to the drug.In their complaint lodged by hospital directors–Deepak Tyagi, Virender Dhankhad and Dr Manoj Sharma— with senior superintendent of police (SSP) and sub-divisional magistrate, they have alleged that the CFO was found illegally procuring remdesivir injections and selling them at a premium to the patients outside the hospital with the help of his son.The complainant alleged that the matter came to light after one of the employees informed the directors about what was going on. The CFO allegedly used to inform the pharmacy employees to give injections to his son and would complete the inventory consumption record later. On May 1, a bill was issued in the name of directors Dr Manoj Sharma for two injections when he was out of station, the complaint said.Rubbishing the allegation, Mukesh Sharma said the directors were against him as he exposed their scams. “This complaint is the result of personal enmity. One of the directors even assaulted me and I even lodged a police complaint against him. A compromised was reached then.

22-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge P305 tragedy: Toll rises to 60||Four days after barge P305 (Papaa 305) sank off the coast of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea due to the extremely severe cyclonic storm that skirted the coastline earlier this week, the Indian Navy’s Search and Rescue (SAR) operations recovered 11 more bodies of crew members on Friday, taking the death toll to 60. Afcons Infrastructure Limited, which led a cornsortium that chartered P305 to complete a contract with state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in its Western Outshore fields, announced on Friday that it would provide compensation to the families of the deceased that would be a combination of ex-gratia pay-outs and insurance compensation and would range from ₹35 lakh to ₹75 lakh per family. The compensation would be “equivalent to balance period of service up to 10 years’ salaries” and would be paid to “not only the families of the deceased persons on its direct rolls, but also families of all deceased persons who were employed with its subcontractors,” a statement released Friday said. It also stated that it will set up a trust to support the education of the children of the deceased. ONGC on Friday also announced that it would extend an immediate relief of ₹1 lakh to the survivors and ₹2 lakh to the families of the deceased and missing crew members of P305.Afcons had on Thursday issued a statement claiming that the P305 was owned by Durmast Enterprises, and the master of the barge remained near the location even though the storm warning had been issued and conveyed to the barge on May 14. The master, Rakesh Ballav, against whom a complaint was registered at the Yellow Gate police station for endangering the lives of crew members on Friday, remains missing. The barge with 261 persons on board got unmoored on Sunday evening and sank on Monday at 7pm near Heera Oil Fields, 40 nautical miles off the Mumbai coast even as Cyclone Tauktae crossed the Konkan coastline making its way north towards Gujarat. It intensified early Monday with wind speed of 185 km/hour gusting to 200 km/hour. Five naval ships, two helicopters, an aircraft and coast guard vessels began to conduct rescue operations late Monday night onwards. So far, 186 persons have been rescued, while 15 are missing. The operations are also searching for 11 members onboard Varaprada, a tugboat which was reported missing after Cyclone Tauktae. As of Friday night, 16 bodies have been handed over to the families by the civic-run JJ Hospital, and at least 26 bodies have been identified. The Coast Guard said that the fisheries department, fishermen’s association and the coastal police of Maharashtra and Daman Diu have also been alerted to keep a lookout in shallow waters for survivors or bodies of crew members. Commander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer of the Western Naval Command, said that the SAR on Friday involved INS Kochi, Talwar, Tejas, Betwa and Beas. Their efforts were augmented by aerial survey undertaken by P8I surveillance aircraft and two each of Sea King, Chetak and advanced light helicopters. Coast Guard units have also joined the search for the missing crew of P305. The Indian Navy said that it was going to deploy INS Survey to start conducting underwater searches to locate the wreckage of the barge, and Varaprada. Naval officers said that they have widened the search to a rectangular area of around 3,200 square miles (80 miles north-south by 40 miles east-west). The search area, the officers said, leans more towards north of the spot where P305 capsized, as more bodies were found there. The Navy is relying more on visual search and aerial surveillance, but they are also using radars to track lifeboats or inflatable rafts floating in the sea. They added that possibility of the bodies of some crew members being trapped in the barge cannot be ruled out. The officers said that coastal police stations have been alerted about the possibility of bodies reaching the shore and instructed to immediately inform the Yellow Gate police in Mumbai in case they find any unidentified body or bodies along seashore. Of the 261 personnel on board the barge, 13 were Afcons employees while others were employees of the barge, including its marine crew as well as skilled and semi-skilled labourers on contract. “While the other barges moved to Mumbai port or outer anchorage, the Master of P305 chose to move 200m away from the platform where they were working, and to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location since the maximum predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 NM [nautical miles] way from the eye of the tropical storm,” a statement issued by Afcons on Thursday read. “Durmast is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the vessel owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel... Afcons, as charterer deploys its construction workmen and supervisors, who stay on the barge and carry out construction or revamp work on the platform,” the statement added.(With inputs from Vijay Yadav)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-p305-tragedy-toll-rises-to-60-101621627193121.html
22-05-2021||Other||Ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh gets relief from arrest till Monday in atrocities case||abbas.dodhiya@htlive.com Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state of Maharashtra to refrain from arresting former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in connection with a case under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act filed against him on the basis of a complaint by an Akola cop. The complainant, inspector BR Ghadge, posted at Akola city police control room, belongs to SC community. He has alleged that as he had refused to follow Singh’s illegal orders to benefit some accused in a criminal case, Singh conspired with others and registered three extortion and a corruption case between August 23 and September 3, 2015, against him. Earlier on Friday, the vacation bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade had asked the state if they were willing to continue their stand taken on May 19, that no coercive action would be taken against Singh in the case. However, after special public prosecutor Darius Khambatta for the state said that the statement could not be continued, the bench directed the petition filed by Singh seeking the quashing of the first information report (FIR) against him to be kept last on the list of cases they would hear on their last day as vacation court judges. Singh’s counsel, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, started the arguments around 10.15pm, during which he stressed that the FIR on Ghadge’s complaint was at the behest of the state government as Singh had refused to withdraw the letter he had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20. In the letter, Singh had alleged that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore every month from restaurants, bars and other establishments. Jethmalani corroborated the claim of the mala fides of the state government by referring to the conversation of Maharashtra director general of police Sanjay Pandey, who allegedly asked Singh to withdraw the claims in the letter written to CM. Jethmalani further stated that the FIR, which mentions alleged atrocities under the SC and ST Act by Singh in 2015-16 when he Thane Police commissioner, was filed belatedly. This which shows that Ghadge was prompted to file the complaint by the state government to scuttle the investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which was ordered by the division bench of HC on April 5 against Deshmukh. Jethmalani concluded that Ghadge’s claim that he was from the Mahar community was not mentioned in his previous complaints and hence, resorting to it now was also proof that the state wanted to heckle Singh. However, Khambatta refuted the submissions. He argued that the complaint by Ghadge clearly made out cognisable offences against Singh and hence, the claim that the state had prodded the Akola cop could not hold. At 11.55pm, the bench stopped the hearing and said that at the stroke of midnight, they would cease to be vacation judges and hence. “As the case is already being heard, we direct the state to refrain from arresting Singh till the next hearing on Monday,” the bench said. Justice Kathawalla in his order further asked the registry to seek the permission of the chief justice on whether the same bench could continue hearing the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exmumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-gets-relief-from-arrest-till-monday-in-atrocities-case-101621627191446.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Provide prisoners with medical reports, says Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the state prison authorities to ensure that prisoners who have been taken to a hospital for a check-up should be given their medical reports, test results and medicines prescribed as it is their right under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court further directed the prison authorities to also allow the prisoner to make a phone call to an approved family member after a visit to the hospital, outside the jail by following protocols. The directions were issued while hearing a petition filed by Maaysha Singh, the daughter of Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj. Singh had filed the petition seeking medical treatment for her mother who is lodged at Byculla Women’s prison and bail on medical grounds as she was not being provided medical attention and referral to a government hospital despite numerous requests. Singh informed the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade through advocate Yug Choudhary that after the petition was filed Bharadwaj had been taken to a hospital and was made to undergo several tests. Choudhary said that before filing the petition in HC, Singh and Bharadwaj had sent numerous requests to the prison authorities to refer Bharadwaj to a hospital outside the jail, however, the same was not heeded by the prison authorities till the petition was filed. Choudhary submitted that after the petition was filed, Bharadwaj was taken to a hospital outside the jail, hence one of the requests in the petition had been satisfied. He added that he was not pressing the second request for bail on medical grounds. He said that he had two suggestions which, if the court would accept, would apply to thousands of prisoners and cut down on the number of petitions being filed in the HC. The first was to provide medical report and prescription of medicines to the prisoner as it was his/her right under Article 21 of the Constitution and the second, was to allow the prisoner to call an approved family member after hospital visit. Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh did not oppose the suggestions by Choudhary but said the prisoner should be allowed to call the approved family member but not a lawyer. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik for state prison authorities also did not oppose the suggestions. HC directed Byculla prison authorities to provide medical reports to Bharadwaj, and as Choudhary was not pressing for second plea of bail, it disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/provide-prisoners-with-medical-reports-says-bombay-hc-101621627131390.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha vaccination drive slows down||With inadequate supply from the Centre and lack of clarity from suppliers, the current vaccine shortage in Maharashtra is likely to continue for a few more weeks, according to state officials, which means, the vaccination drive for those above 45 years of age will go on at a slow pace, while it will remain suspended for the 18-44 age group. To make matters worse, the global tender floated by the government to import 50 million vaccine doses haven’t got a response from any vaccine manufacturer or supplier till May 20, forcing it to extend the date for submission of tenders till May 25. The Central government provides free vaccine doses for those in the 45 and above age group, but for the beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, the stock has to be procured by the state government. So far, the state has procured a total of 1,989,150 doses for the 18-44 age group and has inoculated 661,016 people with first doses. The remaining stock of 1,328,134 doses is diverted for people in the 45+ age bracket, as it is not getting adequate supply from the Centre, said a senior health department official. Officials say the decision to suspend the drive for the 18-44 age group was taken owing to two reasons – Indian manufacturers have not given any confirmed supply schedule and shortage of doses for those above 45, especially for those who are due for second dose. They said the decision to resume vaccination for the 18-44 age group will be taken only when the supply is regular, which does not seem possible in the coming weeks. On Saturday, the state expects to get another stock of 521,000 doses purchased by it, but it will also be used for the 45+ age group. In addition, it will also get 26,460 doses from the Centre’s allocation. “We are expected to receive a stock of 547,460 Covishield doses on Saturday. The entire stock will be used for beneficiaries in the 45+ age group. This will continue until the state government decides to resume vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, Directorate Of Health Services. “The responsibility of making the vaccine stock available is of the Centre. The state government had prepared to vaccinate people in big numbers. We have ramped up our capacity to cover 8-10 lakh beneficiaries a day, but are vaccinating with whatever is being made available to us. This is the reason we have decided to prioritize those due for the second dose and whatever is left is being used for the first dose of beneficiaries from the 45+ age group,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. “We are following up on the issue of shortage with the Centre. We decided to suspend the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group only to cover those who are due for second dose from 45 and above age group,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister in Pune. Serum Institute of India (SII) had promised to supply 10 million doses of Covishield per month for 18-44 age group and Bharat Biotech too had assured to provide a Covaxin stock of 2.5 million doses a month, but both are yet to give any supply schedule to the state, said a senior official, requesting anonymity. In the meantime, the Centre has also decided to regulate the 50% stock expected to be divided among the states and private hospitals etc. It means that stock will also be allocated by the Centre. This is being done to ensure adequate supplies to all states,” he added. By inoculating a total of 20,593,148 beneficiaries, Maharashtra is still at the top among all the states. The state government was also hoping to import vaccine to ramp up the vaccination drive but its move to invite bids from international market has not yielded anything yet. The state floated an express of interest (EOI) on Monday (May 17) to procure 50 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration, and are being manufactured in other countries. The closing date was May 20. “As we have not got any response, the state government has decided to extend its deadline to May 25,” health minister Tope said on Friday. The state government is aiming at importing the doses of the vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Zydus Cadila, among others. “We have tried to bring in laxity in tender rules for procuring the stock, but whatever comes under the Centre’s jurisdictions will have to be decided by them only. We want the Centre to formulate an integrated policy over distribution of vaccine stock and also decide which foreign vaccine is suitable for our country,” he stressed. The shortage of vaccines resulted in a drastic drop in the weekly vaccination rate. Between May 15 and 22, 842,501 people were inoculated, against 1,834,369 in the preceding week of May 8-14 and 1,433,165 during May 1-7. In the last week of April, 2,080,998 doses were given. On Friday, 119,973 beneficiaries were inoculated, according to the Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-vaccination-drive-slows-down-101621627131903.html

The high court asked Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to deliberate upon any preventive measures, which can be taken against the spread of black fungus and apprise the court on May 25. Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain told court that five more companies have been given licence to manufacture the drug. The court was hearing a plea in which it is monitoring Covid-19 situation in two states and UT. As regards to spread of Covid-19 in rural areas of Punjab and Haryana, Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda told court the emphasis was on providing help in the villages for which health wellness centres have been set up. Haryana’s advocate general BR Mahajan said that government has decided to continue with already established helpline number by the state in rural areas and not to put out private numbers of doctors as responsibility for attending the calls from a caller cannot be fixed or there is no mechanism to have check for the same. Punjab raises poor supply of O2 After the hearing, Nanda said the court was also urged to issue directions to the Centre to provide logistics support as the state has been able to lift only half the allocated 300 metric tonnes of oxygen as it has to ferry it from Jharkhand and Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/have-ordered-30-000-vials-of-drug-to-beat-black-fungus-punjab-to-hc-101621627012061.html

22-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Ex-journalist to be quizzed for bouncer’s murder||Accused in a property grab case, former journalist with a Hindi daily, Sanjiv Mahajan, will now be quizzed with regard to the murder of bouncer-cum-financier Surjit Singh, who was gunned down in March last year. Mahajan’s is the first arrest in Surjit murder case though police are yet to nominate him as an accused. Mahajan is lodged in Burail jail in connection with the property grab case in which slain bouncer Surjit was also named as an accused. Mahajan was arrested along with realtor Manish Gupta, Satpal Dagar, brother of deputy superintendent of police Ram Gopal, and Chandigarh Police inspector Rajdeep Singh in the property grab case. Chandigarh Police on March 2 had booked around 10 people, including slain bouncer Surjit Singh, for kidnapping and torturing Rahul Mehta, the sole heir of his family, in April 2017 to secure the general power of attorney of his 338-square-yard house and selling it to Manish Gupta’s brother for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019. “We have brought him on production warrants as we had some leads against Mahajan. He was formally arrested but his involvement is part of investigations. In case his role emerges, he will be nominated as an accused,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Earlier, Mahajan moved an application for his narco and brain mapping test in connection to Surjit’s murder case which was dismissed by the court. He also moved an application before the court to allow his counsel to be present during the questioning and medical examination, which was allowed. The court, however, dismissed his request to install CCTV cameras where his interrogation will be done. Surjit’s wife suspected Mahajan’s involvement Mahajan was on Friday produced before a court and remanded to two-day police custody. Police had procured Mahajan’s production warrants after Surjit’s wife Meenakshi raised suspicion that Mahajan could be involved in the murder of her husband. “In her statement before the police, Meenakshi claimed that Mahajan and Surjit developed differences owing to financial transactions which may have led to the murder of her husband,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South), Chandigarh. She added, “We have got his remand and will question him. If anything conclusive comes up against him, further action will be taken up accordingly.” Gangster Bambiha group had already claimed responsibility for gunning down Surjit Singh (39). The gang through social media had bragged about the murder of Surjit to avenge the killing of bouncer Amit Sharma at Saketri. Surjit was shot dead by two bike-borne unidentified people around 11pm on March 16, 2020, in Sector 38 (West). As per the police, Surjit was considered a sympathiser of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. He was into business of supplying bouncers in the Tricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-ex-journalist-to-be-quizzed-for-bouncer-s-murder-101621626891909.html
22-05-2021||Other||Antilia case: Kazi dismissed from Mumbai Police||Assistant police inspector (API) Riyaz Hisamuddin Kazi – who has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare case and the subsequent murder of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran – has been summarily dismissed from service.Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Friday issued an order under Article 311(2) (B) of the Constitution, dismissing Kazi with immediate effect without a departmental inquiry. The police chief observed that Kazi’s conduct was more like a “seasoned criminal rather than a police officer”, and that he shows “very grave delinquency” which is enough to justify his dismissal under Article 311(2) (b) without holding a disciplinary inquiry. Kazi is a former colleague of controversial former cop Sachin Vaze, who was also arrested by NIA for allegedly being the mastermind of both the cases. Vaze, who was an assistant inspector, had been dismissed from service on May 11.NIA arrested Kazi on April 11 and he is in judicial custody along with the other accused in the case. After prima facie ascertaining his role in the two cases, NIA had sent a report on his involvement in the crime to Mumbai Police, following which the proceedings for his dismissal from the service have been initiated.During the process, senior police officers observed that NIA’s investigation indicates that Kazi was involved in the conspiracy along with Vaze in placing the explosives-laden SUV outside Antilia and in Hiran’s murder. He also allegedly destroyed the CPU and DVR and other important materials in this offence, which incriminates him. The hammer used to destroy the gadgets, which were important evidences in the Antilia case, was recovered from Kazi’s house by NIA.The dismissal order issued by Nagrale stated that Kazi along with Vaze was also allegedly involved in commission of offences of impersonation, forgery and disappearance of evidence. Considering all these facts, the police commissioner observed that Kazi “indulged in a grave, remiss, perverse conduct, unbecoming of a police officer, and thereby undermining the mandate of duties and responsibilities assigned to him as a police officer”.“Kazi in connivance with Vaze, allegedly abused his official position to commit serious crimes, becoming a part of conspiracy, destruction of evidence etc., having propensity to seriously jeopardise law and order in the state,” Nagrale observed. It was also observed that “Kazi was fully aware of duties and responsibilities assigned to him as a police officer. He was duty bound for keeping utmost integrity and its strict enforcement and compliance”.The former API had joined the police force as a constable on October 17, 2001. He was selected as police sub-inspector on October 7, 2010, and was promoted to the post of API on August 8, 2014. He was posted in Mumbai crime branch’s crime intelligence unit (CIU), headed by Vaze, when a Scorpio car with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to Mukesh Ambani and his family was found parked outside the industrialist’s south Mumbai residence Antilia on February 25. A case was registered at Gamdevi police station and Vaze was investigating the case for the first two days. Later, it was transferred to Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS). NIA took over the case on March 8, three days after Hiran, the owner of the Scorpio, was found dead in creek near Mumbra. Vaze was arrested on March 13, after his alleged involvement in the explosives case came to light. He had purportedly devised the plan to regain his lost glory in Mumbai Police. He was later arrested for Hiran’s murder too.Meanwhile, Kazi was transferred to Tardeo local arms division, which is considered to be a side branch.NIA has also arrested inspector Sunil Mane, former constable Vinayak Shinde – who is serving life imprisonment in a fake encounter killing case – and cricket bookie Naresh Gor for allegedly aiding Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-kazi-dismissed-from-mumbai-police-101621626831316.html

22-05-2021||Delhi||Road safety expert Prof Dinesh Mohan dies of Covid at 75||Dinesh Mohan, honorary professor of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, and leading road safety and transportation expert, the man behind the now scrapped bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Delhi, succumbed to Covid-19 on Friday. He was 75.Mohan was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at Delhi’s St Stephen’s Hospital when he died on Friday morning following a cardiac arrest.Colleagues, friends, and students remembered Mohan as a “great humanist”, and a fervent supporter of human rights, besides being a noted name in academia. An alumnus of IIT-Bombay and University of Michigan, Mohan was also known for his work in areas of advancing motorcycle helmet design.Professor Mohan started his career with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Washington DC, USA. Since 1976, he was with IIT-Delhi’s Centre of Biomedical Engineering, where he did pioneering work through the establishment of the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Program (TRIPP) at the institute.In a message on Friday, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said, “He was a great humanist and fervent supporter of individual rights. The Delhi Declaration on People’s Right to Safety is one such example, besides many others...It is a huge loss for all faculty, students, and staff at TRIPP and all those known to him at IIT-Delhi and the traffic safety community in India and the world. We pray to the almighty to give his family strength to overcome this huge loss.”Geetam Tiwari, professor of civil engineering and transportation planning, IIT-Delhi, said Mohan always rooted for more sustainable modes of public transport. “He designed Delhi’s BRT. The whole idea was there, but the press treated it very poorly, without understanding much. So, it was scrapped by the government,” she said.The BRT project was implemented by the chief minister Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government in 2008. However, it was not well-received, and scrapped in 2016.Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said Mohan was a doyen of sustainable urban transport. “A great thinker and a progressive mind, he always infused new ideas and energy for urban transport solutions in Delhi. I had sought time from him separately for guidance. But, that wasn’t meant to be,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/road-safety-expert-prof-dinesh-mohan-dies-of-covid-at-75-101621625454929.html
22-05-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER receiving at least 10 black fungus cases daily||Mucormycosis or black fungus, which has been declared an epidemic in several states, is being detected in 10 patients on an average daily at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), microbiologists say. Most of the patients are those who have recovered from Covid-19.Mucormycosis is an invasive infection caused by a class of moulds called mucormycetes. The fungus enters the body by inhalation and affects the sinuses or lungs. The infection is primarily found in Covid positive patients and is caused by indiscriminate use of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes, prolonged stay in the ICU and comorbidities.Professor Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of PGIMER’s microbiology department on Friday said the institute is recording a spike in cases of the fungal infection with most patients landing up in the emergency ward.Prof Chakraborty, one of the members who drafted the government advisory on mucormycosis and also a part of the Fungal Infection Study Forum, said there was a need to start dedicated service for the infection as non-Covid medical services are currently closed which may result in delay reporting such cases.“Currently we are detecting 10-15 infections daily. Patients from across the region are reporting in emergency with clinical symptoms. If the patient is still Covid-19 positive, they are shifted to the dedicated Covid-19 block and others are managed in different areas,” he said.Docs raise logistics issuesHowever, doctors say there are logistics issues in treating infected patients as most OPDs are shut and it is difficult to detect the fungus through teleconsultation. Prof Chakraborti said he has been raising this issue on every forum that post-Covid-19 clinics should have ENT specialists who can cater to such patients and a few states have also agreed to the suggestion.“Serious logistics issues are there. It will be difficult to detect early symptoms through tele-consultation and patients will land up in the emergency wards with acute complications. So, this needs to be dealt with on priority,” he said.6 new cases at GMCH-32On Friday, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, also reported 6 cases of this infection, taking the number of such patients in the hospital to 22.Dr Jagdish Chander, former head of the microbiology department at the hospital who is currently part of a panel constituted by the college for tracking and treating such cases, said people should check for pain in the left or right side of the face, nasal blockage, nasal discharge. Delay in diagnosis can cause double vision, blurring, or protrusion of the eye.Nine patients are from Punjab, seven from Haryana, while two patients each from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.Meanwhile, Haryana health authorities said six mucormycosis patients were hospitalised in Panchkula. Only one of the patients is a resident of Panchkula, rest are referral cases from Delhi NCR region and other parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-receiving-at-least-10-black-fungus-cases-daily-101621626606993.html

The case was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a crew member of the accommodation barge.Police have booked the barge’s captain Rakesh Ballav – who is still missing –and some others under sections 304(II) (an act done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death), 338 (causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.“We have registered a case against the captain and others on the basis of a statement given by 49-year-old Mistafizur Rahman Hussain Shaikh, who was a part of the maintenance crew of the barge,” joint commissioner of police (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil said. Shaikh has accused Ballav and others of “overlooking the weather alerts and failing to take appropriate care despite knowing that the lapse could result in loss of lives”.In his statement given to Yellow Gate police, the Malad resident said that the barge was anchored near an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields in Bombay High. “Around 11.00pm on Sunday, the wind speed started to increase and an hour later, the speed almost doubled and the crew could hear the roaring storm. At about 2am, two of the eight anchor cables of the barge gave way and the captain sent a distress message to a tug boat which was supposed to be in the vicinity. However, the boat was about 16 nautical miles away and expressed inability to move in the stormy weather,” he told the police. Shaikh added that around 4am, two more anchor cables broke and the barge started experiencing major jerks. Eventually by 8am, all the anchors gave way and the barge started drifting when the wind speed was about 60-70 knots. He said later the barge hit a platform at about 9.45am and water started gushing inside. It was then that the captain sent a distress signal to the Navy and other authorities, said Shaikh.An officer attached to Yellow Gate police station said that they have recorded statements of more than 100 survivors of barge P305 rescued by the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard.According to Afcons Infrastructure, which lead the consortium that had chartered the ill-fated barge along with its marine crew, the captain of P305 chose to stay in the sea despite receiving instructions for returning to Mumbai Harbour in the wake of warnings for Cyclone Tauktae.The Navy has so far rescued 186 on-board the barge and recovered 60 bodies of the crew members. A search is on for the 15 remaining members of P305. The Navy is also looking for 11 crew members of a tug boat, Varaprada, which had gone missing after the cyclone, which is the severest to have hit the Konkan coast in two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/missing-captain-of-barge-p305-booked-by-mumbai-police-on-crew-s-complaint-101621626592381.html

Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said the issue is strictly an organisational matter and the party high command is aware of the developments. “Of course, internally, we are watching the situation in Punjab and the high command will take a call on that,” he told reporters at a virtual press briefing when asked about the internal bickering in the state unit with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former state minister Navjot Singh Sidhu openly hitting out at each other. Sidhu, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and a couple of party MLAs have been openly targeting the chief minister ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the SIT report in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case. They are blaming the chief minister and his aides for the legal setback and seeking the party central leadership’s intervention. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Thursday cautioned party workers to be wary of leaders fuelling dissent to further their own agenda even as Sidhu gave a call to party MLAs to go to Delhi and tell the high command about the real situation in the state. There has been speculation about the constitution of a three-member committee to resolve the differences between the warring groups, but party leaders in Delhi and Punjab denied having any information in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumblings-in-cong-central-leadership-watching-situation-in-punjab-says-venugopal-101621626591902.html

The Palam observatory received 5.8mm rainfall, the Lodi Road station received 3.2mm, and Aya Nagar got 10.6mm.Weather officials said several parts of Delhi saw rain between 5am and 10am. However, Srivastava said that while Wednesday and Thursday’s showers were under the impact of cyclonic storm Tauktae, Friday’s rain was caused by a fresh western disturbance that passed over the Capital.“The residual clouds of Tauktae cyclonic storm have passed. What we saw on Friday was the impact of a fresh western disturbance. There could be some light rain in the early morning hours in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) over the weekend. But temperatures will rise now,” said Srivastava.The rain and the gusty winds on Friday kept Delhi’s air quality in the “satisfactory” category for the third consecutive day. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that the city’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 85. On Thursday, Delhi recorded an AQI of 58, also “satisfactory”.On Friday, IMD recordings showed that the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 33.1 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal.The minimum temperature was 19.4°C, also seven degrees below normal.Met officials, however, said the temperature is expected to touch 39°C by May 29.Delhi, between Wednesday and Thursday, recorded the highest rainfall to ever be recorded in 24 hours in the month of May.

Over 50 buildings, including forts, towers, gurdwaras, tanks, are said to be built under his direct supervision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paks-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-govt-to-restore-19th-century-gurdwara-101621625992553.html
22-05-2021||Lucknow||New system of appointments ordered in UP universities||Faculty members in all state universities will now be appointed in accordance with a uniform and transparent system designed by a team of five vice chancellors on UP governor Anandiben Patel’s directions.The governor on Friday ordered the adoption of the new system that gives separate weightage to measure different skills and academic qualifications of the candidates.For the appointment of assistant professor, weightage of 20 marks will be given for basic academic qualifications at the graduate level. Thirty marks have been allotted for Academic Performance Indicators (API).The candidates will be given weightage of 20 marks each for their subject knowledge and the ability to teach that subject. Another 10 marks’ weightage will be given for the interview, thus making it a total of 100 marks.Applicants will be graded using this weightage system before their selection. The process, according to experts, will make the appointment process transparent and objective.AKTU vice chancellor Professor Vinay Kumar Pathak said the old system was subjective with more weightage for the personal interview, making the process less transparent.He said, “I am hopeful that the new system will make appointments more transparent and fairer.”Under new system, a scrutiny committee will assess the basic academic score and conduct an objective examination of the subject. The marks for each weightage will be released before the final appointment, allowing the candidates to raise their objections if any.The shortlisted candidates will also be asked to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the subject and teach it to a class of 15 to 20 students to test their subject knowledge and teaching abilities.Audio and video of recordings of the entire selection process, especially the physical interview, will be made and stored for at least three months after appointment so that it can be used in case any discrepancy arises. A similar weightage system will also be used for the appointment of associate professors and professors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-transparent-system-of-appointments-ordered-in-up-state-universities-101621625931285.html

May 21 was the last date earlier, he said.Representatives of various companies told the state government that some of them were yet to get the regulatory approval from the central government, Prasad said. Others said that they needed time to maintain the vaccine stock as, according to the bid conditions, the companies would have to supply the second dose after the first one, he added. The representative of another company said that they needed time for obtaining approval for the vaccine rate, Prasad said.Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said the state government will approach foreign Covid vaccine manufacturers to ramp up the vaccine stock and get the supply soon.In the pre-bid qualification meeting held on May 13, top vaccine manufacturing companies — Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech and a Korean company — had raised the issues of storage and transportation of the vaccines and bid security.The state government on May 17 had revised the supply conditions, bid security and eligibility terms for the bidders to pave the way for the participation of maximum companies.In the revised tender, the state government has stated that the manufacturers of vaccines requiring storage or transportation at temperatures like -20 degrees Celsius, -70s degree Celsius or -80 degrees Celsius can participate in the tender. It would pave the way for the entry of foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson in the global tender, Sehgal said.“The more vaccines we get, the maximum number of people will be vaccinated quickly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-extends-last-date-for-submission-of-vaccine-bids-by-10-days-101621625331193.html

Every patient needs several injections each day; if Delhi’s requirement is, say, 4,000 injections, and we are given 1,000 injections, there will be a problem. It is similar to the oxygen situation; when Delhi needed 600 MT of oxygen we were given 300 MT and people said there was a distribution problem.”The Delhi government has set up a four-member committee that looks at hospitals’ demand for the drug after patient information is submitted and gives a go-ahead for the Directorate General of Health Services to dispatch it. As per submissions in the Delhi high court, every patient needs 42 vials of the injection per week.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.The country has seen a sharp rise in the number of mucormycosis cases as a complication in patients with Covid-19, forcing people and state governments to scramble for Amphotericin B, the only drug that can treat the fungal infection. In the Capital alone, about 200 patients are admitted in hospitals with the infection. Usually, major hospitals in the city see no more than 10 cases of the infection in a year.To address shortage of the drug, the Centre on Thursday allowed five more firms to manufacture Amphotericin B, even as the Delhi high court asked it to get medicines from abroad.To prevent the infection, Jain said, “Please take steroids only on the advice of a doctor. Do not continue taking the medicine even after the doctor has stopped it. In some diabetics, the sugar level shoots up because of steroid use and they have to be prescribed insulin injection. But, they stop taking it once they are home. Please don’t do that. At the moment, controlling diabetes is more important, you will be able to get off the injection in a few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/problem-is-supply-not-distribution-jain-on-antifungal-for-mucormycosis-101621624650713.html

The state’s total of all Covid-19 sample tests stood at 4.61 crore (46.1 million) till Thursday, it added.Additional chief secretary (information and micro, small and medium enterprises) Navneet Sehgal said the state government was organising aggressive sample testing to break the Covid-19 infection chain in the urban and rural areas of the state.Within a year, Uttar Pradesh conducted two crore RT-PCR tests, he said, adding that the state had set a target of 1.50 lakh RT-PCR tests per day.In March last year, Uttar Pradesh’s first Covid case was reported from Agra and the samples were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi since Uttar Pradesh, at the time, had no facility to test the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen that causes the Covid-19. Later, the state’s first Covid-19 laboratory became functional at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and it tested just 72 samples on March 23 last year, he added.By April-end this year, the state had a network of 125 government and 104 private laboratories. Twelve laboratories set up by the state health and family welfare department in the backward districts as well as 24 laboratories established by medical education department in the autonomous medical colleges, medical institutes and medical universities in May had given a boost to the RT-PCR tests, the senior official said. The state government was focusing on tests to check the spread of Covid-19 in the rural areas, he added.Surveillance teams have surveyed 89,512 villages and positive cases have been detected in 28,742 villages. Antigen tests are being conducted in the rural areas. Those villagers who had Covid-like symptoms despite the antigen test report being negative underwent RT-PCR test, Sehgal said.Principal secretary (medical education) Alok Kumar said the state government was constantly working to increase the number of RT-PCR tests to identify infected people and isolate them to break the infection chain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ups-tally-of-rt-pcr-tests-crosses-20-million-says-state-govt-101621624911155.html

This is the least we can do for the families of those who lost their lives,” said the SEC. He said, “There are a few things that are under consideration. We will make modifications and amendments to frame new modalities. We held a few discussions over phone and once we are able to give a final shape to the amended guidelines, we will share them with the press.” “It will not take more than three days to effect change in the state election commission guidelines. A couple of formal meetings should be enough to amend and modify the guidelines to bring a change in the rule book,” he said on telephone. Chief secretary RK Tiwari said, “Some formal order will be issued very soon in a day or two, effecting changes in the state election commission guidelines. We are revisiting the guidelines and discussions are going on. The idea is to cover more deserving cases. After the process is complete, we will issue a formal order.” Additional chief secretary Panchyati Raj, Manoj Kumar Singh said, “This has to be done with retrospective effect so that the next of kin of government staff who died a few days after completion of panchyat elections may get the benefit. Amendment is possible in election duty guidelines,” he said. To note, on Thursday chief minister Yogi Adityanath said arrangements should be made to give compensation to the dependants of those on election duty who died due to corona infection. “Since the guidelines of the state election commission were put into place when we had not even heard of corona, the commission is requested to amend the rules to provide proper help to the affected families,” the CM said. The chief minister also said: “As the guidelines are old, of a time when Covid did not exist, so there is a need to have a relook with sympathy.” The CM’s directive comes at a time when teachers’ associations have raised the issue that a total of 1,621 government school staff died after they contracted Covid infection during election duty. Hindustan Times has been reporting extensively on the issue, including the need to change the guidelines. In a report, HT spoke to several experts, including former chief election commissioner of India SY Quraishi who said the state government and the state election commission (SEC) should go for a “liberal interpretation” in case of casualty of government staff deployed on election duty, especially when the country was facing the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-deaths-during-poll-duty-sec-says-rulebook-to-be-changed-soon-101621624070922.html
22-05-2021||Other||UP govt declares black fungus a notifiable disease||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government has declared mucormycosis (black fungus), a life-threatening fungal infection increasingly seen in Covid-19 patients, a notifiable disease following the central government’s Thursday advisory. The move comes after chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked the officers concerned to take necessary action and issue the relevant order on Friday itself. The chief minister also asked them to collect all relevant details like full case history and line of treatment of all the patients who were under treatment for black fungus in government hospitals, medical colleges, or private hospitals and submit them to the black fungus medical expert committee. “This will help the experts in evolving a better line of treatment for the disease”, Yogi said. Telangana, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Gujarat have already declared black fungus a notifiable disease since the central government issued the advisory to the states. Uttar Pradesh has already reported 289 cases of black fungus infection in post-Covid patients of which eight have died. A notifiable disease is any disease that is required by law to be reported to government authorities. This allows the authorities to monitor the disease and provides early warning of possible outbreaks. The Centre wrote a letter to all the states and union territories on Thursday, asking them to declare mucormycosis or black fungus a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. At the Covid review meeting with Team-9 Yogi said: “ The state government, after consultation with the medical experts’ panel, is making arrangements for suitable treatment of black fungus cases. Following the advisory of the central government, black fungus should be declared notifiable diseases. The officers concerned should issue the order and make it effective today itself.” Yogi said that arrangements should also be made to ensure sufficient availability of drugs for black fungus’ treatment in all districts of the state. At the meeting, the officers told the chief minister that all districts had been provided drugs for mucormycosis treatment. The patients who were undergoing black fugus treatment in private hospitals may also get the medicines by applying to the divisional commissioner concerned. Mucormycosis is commonly seen in Covid-19 patients who are in the recovery phase of the disease. It usually infects people whose immune system has been compromised due to co-morbidities such as diabetes, kidney or heart failure or cancer. The symptoms of the fungal infection include blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-declares-black-fungus-a-notifiable-disease-101621623711015.html
22-05-2021||Mumbai||Health deteriorated after arrest, says Stan Swamy; seeks bail||Activist Stan Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case who has been in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail for eight months, told the Bombay high court on Friday that his health had deteriorated rapidly after his arrest and that he would rather “suffer and possibly die” than get hospitalised in Mumbai.The 84-year-old told a bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and SP Tavade that his health was severely affected after his arrest on October 2020, and the previous two bouts of hospitalisation in Mumbai had not helped improve his condition. Instead, he said he wished to go back to his home town Ranchi on bail.“The main issue is that eight months ago I could take a bath by myself; I could take a walk; I could do some writing by myself. But all of these are disappearing...,” the Jesuit priest said.The bench asked if Swamy would prefer to get “general treatment” at the state-run JJ Hospital, to which the 84-year-old responded that he didn’t think admission to the medical facility would do him any good.“What medicines will the JJ Hospital give me? I have been there twice. I know the set-up. I don’t want to go there,” Swamy said. “I would rather suffer and possibly die,” he said, insisting that he be granted interim bail.The court, however, said it was hearing arguments on the issue of hospital admission, and not on bail, in Friday’s hearing.Swamy is among the prominent activists arrested in the case related to the violence that erupted in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village in January 2018. He has been booked under the stringent UAPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/health-deteriorated-after-arrest-says-stan-swamy-seeks-bail-101621622705065.html
22-05-2021||Bhopal||Eight cheetahs to be translocated from Africa to MP’s Kuno National Park||Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park will get African Cheetahs as part of India’s first inter-country big cat relocation project, a senior state forest department official said on Thursday after the MP government received a confirmation from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Five male cheetahs and three females will be donated by Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) of South Africa, said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (Wildlife). The translocation of African Cheetah is a part of Government of India to reintroduce the fastest land animal in India after extinction of the Asiatic cheetah in the 1950s.The final call was taken after EWT national Cheetah Metapopulation manager Vincet Van Der Merwe visited Kuno eight days ago to assess the preparations and suitable habitat for cheetahs, said Kumar. Merwe found Kuno National Park to be one of the best habitats for translocation of cheetah in India. He gave a few minor suggestions including fencing to make it more suitable for the cheetah by September, said Kumar. Divisional forest officer, Sheopur, PK Verma said, “The expert, Merwe said Kuno has a perfect grassland and prey base for cheetahs. We have started preparation for translocation.”The central government has allocated ₹14 crore for the project. The state government had earlier projected an estimated expenditure of ₹22 crore under Annual Operation Plan (AOP, said a forest official, who didn’t wish to be quoted. “We don’t want to take any risk because it is a matter of pride for our country and the success of this project will decide the fate of translocation of more cheetahs in India,” said the officer.Additional PCCF (wildlife) JS Chauhan said: “The money will be used for the development of fencing, cutting thorny trees, cages for cheetah and transportation of cheetah from South Africa.” The Supreme Court approved the project in January 2020 and formed a three-member committee comprising of former director Wildlife of India Ranjit Singh, DG of Wildlife of India Dhananjay Mohan and DIG, Wildlife, Ministry of Environment and Forests to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority in translocation of the African cheetah from South Africa and Namibia to India. The expert committee visited four sites in MP and one in Rajasthan to select the suitable habitat for cheetah. In early January, the committee submitted its report to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/eight-cheetahs-to-be-translocated-from-africa-to-mp-s-kuno-national-park-101621622571494.html

Pawar was speaking after the weekly Covid review meeting at divisional commissioner’s office in Pune. He said that though the number of patients in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad has been going down, the situation in rural parts still needs attention. The existing curbs are in place till 7 am on June 1. In the last few days, the daily caseload and active cases are going south in the city. On Thursday, there were 931 positive cases recorded within Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) limits and the number of active cases was 15,043. Also, there were 716 positive patients in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) on Thursday and the number of active cases was 13,361. Owing to these numbers, Pawar was asked if the administration will consider to lift some curbs in Pune like the complete lockdown on weekends. “There is no decision regarding easing of restrictions. Whatever rules are there now, will continue till May end,” Pawar said. He clarified that the decision of lifting curbs in the state after May 31 will depend on the number of the positive cases in the 10 days. “There are still 10 days before we reach May 31. Let’s see what happens in this duration. The decision will depend on virus case count,” he said. “The number of Covid positive patients in the district has reduced and the number of discharges has increased. Oxygen, ventilator, ICU beds are available in hospitals now. There is no more oxygen shortage in the district. Even 25-30 sugar factories in the state are trying to produce liquid oxygen. But it is an expensive process,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-decision-on-easing-of-restrictions-in-pune-ajit-pawar-101621602288678.html
