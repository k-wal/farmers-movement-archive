11-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity gets Covid coordination committee||Facing flak for poor tricity coordination in Covid management, Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab on Tuesday decided to constitute a committee comprising deputy commissioners of UT, Panchkula and Mohali. The committee will meet twice a week online and coordinate on various issues pertaining to Covid-19 management, such as lockdown restrictions, hospitals, supply lines, and vaccinations.The three administrations were forced into action after directions from the Punjab and Haryana high court on setting up a unified command centre for the tricity Covid management.The division bench of justices Rajan Gupta and Karamjit Singh, which was hearing a petition related to Covid-19 surge, had last week observed: “In case a joint strategy is drawn up, it may be easier to tackle the present crisis. In case, there is a common platform to deliberate upon the strategies to be adopted, it would be easier to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic.”On Tuesday, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore called a meeting of chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana.In the meeting, it was also decided that director, health services, of Mohali, Panchkula and Chandigarh will also meet twice a week over video conference to decide uniform and coordinated approach in medical treatment of Covid patients, under the guidance of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).In case of emergencies, anywhere in the tricity, the authorities concerned will provide oxygen, medicines and medical equipment, such as ventilators, to each other to avoid any untoward incident.The UT will also request the high court for a separate quota of 5 metric ton of liquid medical oxygen, exclusively for PGIMER.Missing coordinationEven though the tricity is a de facto single urban complex, the three administrations have struggled to have a uniform policy on Covid management. Varied night curfew timings, lockdown restrictions and failure to assist to each other has plagued the pandemic management. Notably, the three DCs already attend the regular Covid review meeting chaired by the UT administrator, but it has failed to lead to any improvement in coordination.“In the scheme of state government policy formulation, the local DCs have a very limited say. The UT’s attempts at involving higher officials regularly in the tricity coordination have not yielded positive results. This has been the case during the pandemic and also previously in management of other important issues. For instance, in the current scenario, a committee comprising health secretaries of the three governments could have been constituted,” said a senior Chandigarh official, requesting anonymity.Dormant mechanismThe institutionalised interstate coordination mechanism for the tricity has been lying dormant. One such apex body – interstate coordination committee – hasn’t met for the past six years. R Srinivas, town and country planner, ministry of housing and urban affairs, said: “An interstate coordination committee for the three administration was set up by the Centre in 1975. Its last meeting was held in 2016, but since then, it is dormant. The committee comprises of chief secretaries of all three governments, and secretaries from the Union ministries.”Similarly, the apex committee of tricity, comprising the UT administrator and chief secretaries, hasn’t met for more than a year and a half. Most of its previous recommendations, too, largely remain on paper. For instance, a committee under the UT adviser, set up to look into and resolve health and transport issues of the tricity, has not much to show as results.Even the North Zonal Council, headed by the Union home minister, last met around two years ago. The council meetings are attended by state chief ministers along with the UT administrator.Urvashi Gulati, former chief secretary, Haryana, said: “Formal institutions have always been there for coordination between the three governments. Though, in normal times there have been instances when there was lack of urgency, the current circumstances require utmost coordination so that the pandemic’s impact can be minimised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-gets-covid-coordination-committee-101620757408082.html

However, the district has a requirement of around 55 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, shortage of which caused a multitude of issues over the past few weeks.NHAI officials said that site inspections have been conducted, but the work will commence only when the district is named on the priority list.“We have conducted site inspections and the planning is being done but the work will only when Gurugram figures in the priority list. We are expecting this to happen very soon. The civil and electrical infrastructure set up will be completed in 15 days,” said Suresh Kumar, project director, NHAI.Rao Inderjit Singh, the Lok Sabha member from Gurugram and union minister of state, said that he has already taken up this issue with the health ministry to ensure that Gurugram hospitals are included in the next priority list.“I have taken up this issue with the union health ministry. Not only these oxygen plants, but I have also asked the state government to ensure that large private hospitals also install their own plants as there is a strong possibility of a third wave. We must also increase the number of oxygen beds and ventilators in city hospitals and across Haryana,” said Singh, adding that the issues were also taken up with the chief minister in a virtual meeting on Tuesday.The task of creating civil and electrical infrastructure for setting up 581 pressure swing absorption plants near hospitals across the country has been given to the highways authority. Out of these 581 plants, district administration officials said that 50 will come up in Haryana and six of them in Gurugram.According to the NHAI officials, six hospitals in Haryana have been included in the two priority lists released by the authority. In the first list, civil hospitals in Charki Dadri, Bhiwani and Narayangarh (in Ambala district) were prioritised for oxygen plants. In the second list, three hospitals in Kaithal, Ambala and Bhiwani were included.NHAI officials in Gurugram said that they have inspected the sites at Civil Hospital, subdivisional hospitals in Pataudi, Sohna and one at Mandikhera in Nuh district. “We are ready to work on the design based on steel fabrication for these plants and work will be completed in 15 days. As soon as the oxygen plant is delivered, it would be ready for installation and made operational at the earliest,” said Kumar.The NHAI would be spending around ₹15 lakh for constructing each plant, said officials.The Gururgam district administration last week had said that the plant at Civil hospital will have a production capacity of 1,000 litres per minute, while those at Sohna and Pataudi will have capacities of 200 litres per minute, each. The plant at Mandikhera in Nuh will have a production capacity of 500 litres per minute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/work-on-oxygen-plants-in-gurugram-yet-to-start-district-not-on-priority-lists-say-officials-101620757348710.html
11-05-2021||Gurugram||48 RWAs express interest to set up Covid care facilities||In 10 days since the district administration allowed residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to set up Covid-19 care facilities using their own resources in their societies, as many as 48 RWAs have expressed an interest in setting up facilities, according to a release issued by the administration on Tuesday.In a Covid care facility (CCF), presymptomatic, asymptomatic and suspected patients can be kept in isolation with basic medical care. “Around 48 ​​residential societies have expressed their desire to open a CCF. As per the guidelines, senior citizens, pregnant women, children below the age of 10, and those with comorbidities cannot avail of CCF facilities, as such patients are required to be admitted to hospitals or other care facilities,” a spokesperson for the administration said.Administration officials said that such facilities will be linked with the health department’s surveillance teams, and ambulances and important telephone numbers of the RWA, NGOs, doctors, caregivers and ambulance service providers will be shared with all stakeholders as well as pasted inside each facility. The CCFs will be inspected daily by the rapid response teams, said officials.Administration officials reiterated that the facility can be set up only inside community centres, clubhouses, or vacant flats, provided they are located in a secluded area. The administration’s release did not, however, share the names of the 48 RWAs.On May 1, deputy commissioner Yash Garg had issued an order permitting RWAs to set up CCFs using their own resources. Two days later, the administration had issued guidelines for the same.Many RWAs, however, were dissatisfied with both the guidelines and Garg’s order, with their three main contentions being that they want moderately ill Covid-19 patients to be allowed treatment at the facilities, permit multiple RWAs to set up one CCF as several condominiums and societies did not have a community centre or clubhouse, and support from the administration in the procurement of Covid-19 medicines, machines, oxygen cylinders, and medical staff to monitor the health of those admitted to the facilities.“We are in constant touch with the administration regarding the setting up of CCFs. The administration has given assurance in provision of oxygen cylinders to RWAs and remaining concerns, such as the need for establishing the facility in a secluded place, among others, are also being taken up and deliberated upon,” said Pawan Tharwani, president, Carlton Estate Condominium Association (CECA), one of the members of RWAs United, an umbrella body representing 53 RWAs from across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/48-rwas-express-interest-to-set-up-covid-care-facilities-101620757347513.html
11-05-2021||Gurugram||Six booked for attempt to murder after tussle over parking escalates||Six persons were booked in Farrukhnagar on Tuesday in connection with a firing incident, in which the husband of village sarpanch Mukesh Devi had a narrow escape, said the police. The incident took place after the victim, identified as Satbir Dhankhar, had resolved a parking issue between the suspects and a local family.Dhankhar, a resident of Patli village in Farrukhnagar, said, “Two families had got into an argument over parking on Monday evening. Following this, some of the villagers urged a group of men — one of the parties concerned — to apologise to the other family for abusing and threatening to kill them for parking a vehicle outside their house. They also urged the former family to keep a check on their son who was allegedly involved in illegal activities and often fought with the villagers on different issues,” Dhankhar said.The locals had been complaining about the group of men for allegedly extorting money from shopkeepers, and often fighting with the ones who intervened.Dhankhar had resolved the matter, according to the police.Later, around 5 am on Tuesday, when Dhankhar had gone for a morning walk near a field close to Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, a person opened fire at him from inside a car. Fortunately, he did not suffer any injury in the firing.“The window glasses of the Swift Dzire were tinted, and I couldn’t see anyone inside the car. Somebody opened fire at me, and immediately fled the spot... I had noted the registration number. The car belonged to one of the men who was involved in the spar on Monday,” he said.An “attempt to murder” case has been registered against the six men — who are on the run — at the Farrukhnagar police station.Assistant commissioner of police (crime), Dharamvir Singh, said the suspects had also gone to Dhankhar’s chemist shop in Farrukhnagar around 11.45 am on Tuesday, and threatened to kill his nephew. “We have recovered CCTV footage from the shop, and are conducting raids to arrest the suspects,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/six-booked-for-attempt-to-murder-after-tussle-over-parking-escalates-101620757348109.html
11-05-2021||Gurugram||Vaccinations will be held at govt schools to tackle crowds: Health department||To tackle the heavy footfall for Covid-19 vaccination at various government health centres across the district, the health department has decided to hold vaccinations at government schools and community health centres in areas witnessing high footfalls. Officials said that elderly citizens scheduled to receive their second dose have been facing trouble due to poor social distancing norms in place.“Medical officers of 37 urban primary health centres (UPHC) have been directed to hold vaccination drives in government buildings having open areas, if they are facing difficulties in handling a large number of people at health centres. Vaccination camps cannot be set up at private facilities,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.From May 1, as private hospitals stopped inoculation due to a shortage of vaccines, a large percentage of vaccine beneficiaries who have been waiting for the second dose inoculation are reaching out to government health centres. Some of the major centres, at Tigra, Chauma and Laxman Vihar, among others, witnessed heavy footfall and subsequently, clashes due to low vaccine stock.As reported by HT earlier this week, many people above the age of 60 years refrained from standing in long queues, fearing that they might get infected due to the large crowds. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, in a review meeting last week, directed that vaccinations must be held in open spaces.On Tuesday, in some of the densely populated areas, including Gurugram village, Sukhrali and Gandhi Nagar, the vaccination drive took place at government schools. According to medical officers, multiple session sites are being conducted for different age groups, which lead to long queues.“The rush has increased. Everyone who directly walks in wants to get inoculated, but we can inoculate only a limited number of people in a day. Crowd management or even ensuring social distancing becomes difficult as people are often agitated and refuse to follow rules,” a medical officer said, requesting anonymity.The district health department has also requested the police department to deploy its staff for crowd management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccinations-will-be-held-at-govt-schools-to-tackle-crowds-health-department-101620757288783.html

Also, we have been getting fewer passengers as other state governments, too, ask for negative Covid-19 reports for the purpose of travelling. We were facing heavy losses due to this... On an average, we earn a profit of ₹35 per kilometre, but now, it has come to almost ₹20 per kilometre. So, it is not feasible to continue the bus services.”The number of coronavirus cases in Gurugram are still on the rise. As of Tuesday, there were 2,659 fresh cases, and 34,117 active cases in the district. The recovery rate in Gurugram stands at 78.55%, and the fatality rate at 0.38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-temporarily-stops-interstate-buses-amid-covid-crisis-101620757287480.html

They will be forming separate teams for this task, independent of their current operations. For delivery purposes, all teams will be using four-wheeler vehicles so that the maximum number of oxygen cylinders can be loaded, and a high number of deliveries can be done in one trip,” said a senior MCG official, who attended the meeting.The official cited above said that oxygen cylinders are being stored at a government college in Sector 14, from where they will be transported. A team of MCG officials, headed by MCG additional commissioner Surendra Singh, will be working from the college premises to coordinate with the companies for deliveries.A spokesperson for Delhivery said that the company officials overlooking the matter were not available for comment. Officials of Zomato could not be contacted for comment.For locations outside the MCG areas in the district, MCG workers will undertake the task. “A separate bank account will be opened for payment under this arrangement. Payments can be made directly to the bank account through a QR code. Each agency and team will have a different QR code,” said Jitendera Yadav, acting commissioner, MCG.Yadav said that the delivery will be done on a first-come-first-served basis.Under the initiative, officials will carry oxygen cylinders to the applicant’s residence and provide them with a filled cylinder in exchange for an empty one. “Covid-19 patients in home isolation can apply for a cylinder online on the oxygenhry.in portal. Based on the application, a cylinder will be provided to the applicant in the shortest possible time,” said Yadav.For procuring a cylinder, the patient, attendant, or relative has to submit an application on the portal along with the patient’s UID number, oximeter reading photo and a doctor’s prescription. In the application, basic details such as the patient’s name, age, contact number and address need to be filled in.MCG officials said that a person can apply only once per day. Once confirmed, the applicant will receive a message regarding the delivery. MCG officials said that their teams will be carrying out deliveries between 8am and 11pm every day.The announcement of home delivery of oxygen cylinders was in the district was announced on Saturday, a day after the Haryana government had made a similar announcement.Besides the MCG, the administration has also tied up with 20 NGOs and the Red Cross Society for the delivery of oxygen cylinders. The administration commenced operations on Monday, with 70 deliveries being done on the first day.“A cylinder bank has been created by the district administration for refilling cylinders. With the introduction of this facility, the load on beds in the hospitals will be reduced and people will get oxygen cylinders at their doorstep,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-ties-up-with-zomato-delhivery-for-doorstep-oxygen-cylinder-deliveries-101620757227462.html

Officials said that 20 tonnes of cow dung cakes have been procured for use.Ashish Singla, chief medical officer of MCG, said, “We started using cow dung cakes as an alternative to wood on Monday and have procured around 20 tonnes from our gaushalas. This is being done to reduce the pressure on fuelwood so that more trees are not cut. We are still figuring out details of how much is needed for one cremation process, but an alternative is being used.”At present, the cow dung cakes are being procured from MCG’s cowshed in Carterpuri.The number of deaths of Covid-19 positive patients has been increasing in the district putting pressure on crematoriums and leading to long waiting hours for performing the last rites. According to the records of the health department, a total of 612 Covid-19 positive patients have died in the district till now with 13 deaths reported on Tuesday.Puran Yadav, the president of the Carterpuri cowshed, said, “We have deployed two machines at the cowshed for faster production so that these can be used at crematoriums in case of shortage of wood.”The decision to use cow dung cakes was taken on Monday, after a city-based environmentalist raised the issue of reducing the use of fuelwood after the amendment norms for the lockdown released by the state government on Sunday mentioned that felling of trees will be allowed.The guidelines mentioned, “Tree felling operations of forest department and Haryana Forest Development Corporation shall remain operational subject to the condition that they will be allowed only to the extent required for meeting fuelwood requirements of municipal corporations and district administrations.”Meanwhile, officials of the district forest department said they submitted a list of trees that can be used as fuelwood at cremation sites to the forest development corporation last week.Rajeev Tejyan, divisional forest officer for Gurugram, said, “We have submitted a list of old and dry trees available with the department to the forest development corporation, which is further shared with the district administration. We have a stock of around 100-150 trees available at different forest ranges that can be used. So far, no new trees have been felled in the division and we have not received any requests too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-starts-using-dung-cakes-for-cremations-to-reduce-tree-felling-101620757107469.html
11-05-2021||Gurugram||Health dept to use only Covaxin to inoculate 18-44 age group||The district health department said on Tuesday that it was holding back Covishield doses for people in the 18-44 age group due to limited allocation of the vaccine by the state. Instead, roughly about 4,500 doses of Covaxin will be administered to those above 18 years at 37 government health centres on Wednesday.“Over 13,000 doses of Covishield were received by the state administration on Tuesday. These doses will be used for the second dose for people aged above 45 years at various vaccination centres. There has been no additional supply of Covishield doses for 18 to 44 years. The vaccination for those above 18 years will not halt, as over 4,500 doses of Covaxin have been allocated for them,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Fewer than 2,000 doses of Covishield are currently available for the 18-44 group, which, according to the district immunisation officer, Dr MP Singh, will be given at the Polyclinic in Sector 31 on Wednesday. “Only some doses of Covishield are left, therefore, it can be given to only one centre. It is likely to be utilised within a day. The remaining 36 centres will be given Covaxin for inoculation on Wednesday,” he said.The inoculation of residents aged above 18 years started on May 1. The vaccination pace, however, declined due to limited availability of the vaccine stock and shutting down of vaccination centres at most private hospitals, as they were unable to procure the stock from manufacturers.The vaccine stock that was to be used only for the prioritised population group has been now allocated in two categories, for the 18-44 year group and 45 years and above group. Many vaccine beneficiaries have also been facing difficulties getting their shot due to low stock.On Tuesday, the union ministry of health and family welfare in a meeting with the states stressed the urgent need to inoculate the large number of beneficiaries who are waiting for the second dose. States have been directed to reserve 70% of the allocated stock for second dose vaccinations and the remaining 30% for those taking the first dose.For the 45 and above group, the district has a stock of over 23,000 doses. On Tuesday, at least 11,049 people took the first vaccine shot, including 4,224 (3,597 in government health centres and 627 in private hospitals) in the 18-44 category. As many as 5,226 took their second vaccine shot at government sites and 152 at private facilities.The next allocation of the vaccine doses from the centre to states for May 15 to 31 is likely to be conveyed on May 14. Based on that, states will have to plan their vaccination sessions. “It is expected that Covishield inoculation for 18 and above will be on halt for some time now,” said Yadav.The vaccination process was drastically impacted after private hospitals were asked to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers from May 1. Many shut down their centres, while only two private hospitals, Fortis and Max, are inoculating those aged 18 to 44 years. The state has now been directed to coordinate with private hospitals to facilitate procurement directly from the manufacturers to accelerate the vaccination process.Time slot for booking appointments on Co-WINAddressing the problem faced by vaccine beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group to book online appointments for their shots, the district health department has fixed 6pm to 7pm as the time slot for residents to book their slots on the Co-WIN platform.“Only people above 45 years scheduled for the second dose can directly walk in, for they are already registered on Co-WIN. Even those above 45 years, who are yet to take their first shot, have to register on Co-WIN and book the slot,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-dept-to-use-only-covaxin-to-inoculate-18-44-age-group-101620756867451.html

Over a dozen bodies were found floating in the Ganga in Bara and Gahmar areas of Ghazipur district on Monday. Similarly, more than two dozen bodies were found from Ujiyar Ghat and Bharauli area of Ballia district on Tuesday. Ghazipur administration has initiated a probe into the matter. “Our officials are present on the spot and an investigation is underway. We are trying to find out from where these bodies came,” district magistrate of Ghazipur MP Singh said. It came to light when local people, traumatised by the sight of floating human bodies in the Ganga and fearing spreading of diseases in the area, informed the district administration officials. Bara town in Ghazipur district shares boundary with Buxar district of Bihar. It is just two kilometres from Gahmar (Ghazipur). “The bodies, found in Gahmar and Bara stretch of Ganga, are different from those found in Buxar of Bihar,” said a Local.Former village head of Gahmar Durga Prasad Chaurasia said that over a dozen bodies were seen floating. Thereafter, locals informed administrative officials. A team of administrative officials reached the spot and initiated a probe, he said. “I received information that two bodies were floating in the Ganga in Bara area of Ghazipur. I along with my team reached the spot and found that two bodies floating in the river. This is a matter of grave concern,” said Ramesh Kumar Maurya, sub divisional magistrate of Sevrai division, who reached the spot along with his team on Monday evening. Maurya said that he had no idea from where the two bodies came. He said that the bodies appeared to be a fortnight old. Maurya, however, refused to comment on Buxar administration’s claim that the bodies found in the Ganga in Buxar had come from UP’s side. A senior police official, not willing to be named, said a vigil would be maintained along the river stretch in Gahmar area of the district. At the same time, the locals have been asked to inform police in case they see anyone immersing a body in the river. Meanwhile, a social worker and village head of Mubarakpur in Ghazipur district, Shyamnarayan Singh said that he heard that a few bodies (four bodies) were immersed in the Ganga by the families of the dead as they couldn’t afford to buy wood required for cremation. “Such incidents are being reported for the last one week from several villages in the area,” he claimed. Ex-village head of Gahmar Gahmar Durga Chaurasia also backed it. “In rural pocket, this has been taking place for the last one week,” he said. Over two dozen bodies were also found floating in the Ganga at Ujiyar Ghat and Bharauli area of Ballia district, locals said. On being informed by locals, a team of administrative officials along with police personnel reached the spot and took out six bodies from the Ganga’s Bharauli stretch, and remaining from Ujiyar area, according to reports. According to ANI, Ballia district magistrate Aditi Singh said few bodies were found near the banks of the river Ganga under the Ballia-Buxar bridge last evening. Last rites of these bodies were performed by police and local administration. The incident of corpses floating in Bihar has sparked fears about the scale of the Covid crisis in the country. Authorities believe the relatives of those succumbed to the virus may not have been able to find space for the last rites. On Tuesday, Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had termed the incident as “unfortunate” and asked concerned states to take immediate cognizance. “The incident of corpses found floating in the Ganga in Buxar region of Bihar is unfortunate. This is definitely a matter of investigation. The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness ‘mother’ Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The concerned states should take immediate cognizance in this regard,” Shekhawat tweeted.

Now, all affected children of a family will be provided financial assistance even if they are more than two,” Manoj Rai, director, department of women and child development. In a virtual meeting on Tuesday, Rai apprised all district probation officers of the state about the government’s plan regarding rehabilitation of the children rendered orphan due to the Covid.The state government is collecting details of all such children below 18 years of age who have lost both their parents or either mother or father to Covid. Instructing the district probation officers to collect details of such children, Rai apprised officials of the government’s plan to extend immediate assistance to such children through the sponsorship scheme. Rai also asked officials to contact Covid hospitals and incharges of Covid command centres of their respective districts to collect details of Covid-orphaned children and provide this information to child welfare committees. Child Line (1098), special juvenile police units, district child protection units and nigrani samitis (monitoring committees) in rural and urban areas are also assisting the district magistrates in preparing the list of such children. “Efforts must be made to rehabilitate such children under the care of any family and sending them to a child care shelter must be the last option,” Rai told officials. During the meeting, he also told officials to collect details of frontline workers who have succumbed to Covid so that financial assistance could be provided to their family members too.

The MLNMC administration has already sent a proposal to the state government for approval, medical college officials said. “A detailed proposal has been sent to the state government. We have also requested sanctioning of new posts for this proposed department at the MLN Medical College,” said SP Singh, principal, MLNMC, while confirming the development. As part of the exercise, a facility of 30 beds will be added to SRN Hospital – the hospital associated with MLNMC – including six beds having intensive care unit (ICU) facilities. One operation theatre and one plaster room would also be part of this new department, he explained. SRN Hospital currently has a 1,400-bed capacity, besides a trauma centre. Students enrolling in the MBBS course from session 2022-23 will also have to study ‘Emergency Medicine’ as a subject as stipulated by the National Medical Commission (NMC)— the regulatory body that governs medical education and medical professionals in the country, they added. Noting the importance of the field of emergency medicine, the NMC had made this new department mandatory for all medical colleges from the 2022-23 academic session. It had also issued a notification in this regard on October 19, 2020, laying down the particular manpower and equipment requirement etc so that medical colleges could take necessary steps in this regard.For this new ‘Emergency Medicine Department’, sanction of one post each of professor, associate professor and assistant professor has been sought by the MLNMC administration so that proper teaching work can be undertaken. At present, the MLN Medical College has 12 departments: medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, pulmonary medicine, paediatrics, dermatology (skin), pathology, microbiology, biochemistry, anatomy, social and preventive medicine and ENT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emergency-medicine-dept-to-come-up-at-mlnmc-proposal-sent-101620753987284.html

Many families have decided not to wear new clothes on the occasion or hold ‘sewain parties’ as a mark of solidarity with those who lost their loved ones to the pandemic.Abid Ali, a resident of Kareli, returned to Prayagraj from Mumbai when Ramzan began, hoping to celebrate a grand Eid-ul-Fitr with his two sons, Amir and Danish, who also flew back from Dubai. Abid Ali’s hopes were shattered as Covid-19 started claiming lives of people. Although none in his family was infected with Covid-19, Abid Ali and his family members were shocked over the large number of deaths, including many in their locality and in their extended family. Upset by the tragedy, the family has decided not to wear new clothes this Eid.Many local leaders and religious heads have also urged community members to mark Eid with simplicity and focus on helping the needy around them who are still fighting for survival.Imam Jama Masjid and former Sheher Qazi Sayyad Maqbool Hussain urged Muslims to offer Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at home. As prayers at home will be without an Imam, only ‘namaz shukrana’ should be offered by individuals, he said. Muslims should pray for the well-being of those suffering from the pandemic and also for those who have lost their lives, he added.With just a few days are left for Eid-ul-Fitr, the Muslim-dominated Old City areas seem lacklustre and subdued, which at this time of year used to be brimming with life. With the strict implementation of lockdown, no markets are open for shopping but people are also staying away from purchasing clothes etc online.Former Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parwez Ahmad and his family used to organise grand Eid celebrations every year. This year, the family has cancelled all festivities.“My family and I used to distribute new clothes among the poor on Eid and celebrate the occasion with friends and relatives. With the pandemic claiming so many lives this year, patients have been helped and all celebrations have been cancelled,” the former MLA said.With deadly disease playing havoc, celebrating Eid is not only unwise but also meaningless, says MA Ansari, a senior High Court advocate, whose family has recently recovered from Covid-19.Hundreds of deaths in Old City localities of Atala, Shahganj, Akbarpur, Roshanbagh, Dariabad, Rasulpur, Rani Mandi, Daira Shah Ajmal, Kareli, Khuldabad etc have been reported in the second wave of the pandemic. Many infected are still fighting for their lives and their families are praying for their recovery.“Traditionally, Eid is not celebrated in homes where a member has recently died. Prayagraj has been a symbol of mixed culture and its citizens have always shared their joys and sorrows. With so many deaths this year across the city, it is impossible for Muslims to rejoice. Religious heads have already urged to offer special Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at home,” Syed Mohd Askari, a Samajwadi Party leader said.Principal of Madarsa Jammatul Abbas Maulana Kalbe Abbas Rizvi said Muslims should pray not only for themselves but also for all human beings suffering due to the pandemic.Contractor Arif Khan, a resident of Rasulpur, returned from Delhi, expecting to celebrate Eid with his large family of eight brothers. However, with the disease claiming so many lives, Arif and his kin did not purchase new clothes and other items for Eid. “Our dining table used to be full with varieties of ‘sewain’ prepared by the women in our family. Our family, relatives and friends used to flock to the house throughout the day. We will miss the festivities but will pray for a happy Eid next year,” Arif said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-new-clothes-sewain-parties-it-s-going-to-be-a-quiet-eid-101620753807217.html

Hansraj College has a hostel that caters to 200 residents. We are ready to offer the space with your support that can be converted into 100 ICU facility as the Covid patients are not getting hospital beds and that is causing anxiety," she said in a letter to Lt Governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other officials on May 9.The letter has also been sent to Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Health Minister Satyendar Jain and some officials.She also urged the authorities to set up a vaccination centre in the college."University employees and their families are also facing challenges as facilities are scattered and infected people are increasing each day. Testing and vaccination both are important to contain the spread. "We also request you to set up a vaccination (Covishield) and testing centre in the college for the university teaching and non-teaching staff. This will ensure that people above 18 years get vaccinated with Covishield immediately," the letter said.Delhi University had started a Covid-19 isolation centre with a capacity of 180 beds in Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College.The university's Lakshmibai College has also started an isolation centre as a tribute to one of its staffers who died due to the infection.Delhi University has also set up central helplines for its staffers who are looking for ventilator beds, oxygen cylinders, food supplies and even for counselling."We have put in place a centralised system. Earlier it was being done by colleges and other bodies but now we have set up helplines which will be available for varsity staffers," said the varsity's acting vice-chancellor Professor P C Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-hansraj-college-offers-to-turn-its-hostel-into-covid-19-care-centre-101620752866244.html

11-05-2021||Lucknow||Adityanath fudging coronavirus numbers, 'tower of corpses' in UP: Congress||Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu on Tuesday trashed the state government's claims on managing the coronavirus pandemic and accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of fudging statistics.While accusing the BJP government of laxity, the opposition leader said a “tower of corpses” has risen in the state.Lallu's statement came hours after defence minister Rajnath Singh's visit to Lucknow, where he praised Adityanath's handling of the Covid-19 crisis and claimed that the World Health Organization too had done so.“Can't the defence minister, who is praising the chief minister indulging in fudging the statistics, see the flames from the funeral pyres in his parliamentary constituency of Lucknow and other parts of the state,” the Congress leader said."Can he not see the deaths caused by the shortage of oxygen and the shortage of medicines," he said, adding that Singh showed a lack of sensitivity by praising the chief minister.Lallu claimed that the ground reality is that there are "no vaccines, no oxygen, no medicines" in the state. "Due to the laxity of the government, there is a 'minar' (tower) of corpses, and it is getting praise," he said.He accused the state government of being "shameless" and "disgracing humanity".Earlier, Rajnath Singh had claimed that the World Health Organization has praised the Uttar Pradesh government's work. It is not a small thing," he said.In a tweet on Monday, the WHO said, "In #India''s most populous state Uttar Pradesh, the state gov. has initiated house-to-house active case finding of #COVID19 in rural areas to contain transmission by testing people with symptoms for rapid isolation, disease management & contact tracing."The WHO has been working with the state government in these activities, the organisation's tweets indicate.Meanwhile, state Medical Education Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna dubbed Lallu’s statement as "irresponsible”."Congress leaders sometimes spread confusion about the vaccine and other times they question the government's testing campaign in villages," he said, adding that "the public is getting confused due to irresponsible statements of Congress leaders”.Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the state government is yet to accept the magnitude of the situation."The way coronavirus has affected Uttar Pradesh villages is worrying. The lives of people are at risk due to lack of medicines, oxygen and treatment. The BJP government is still not accepting the magnitude of the situation,” Akhilesh said in a tweet in Hindi.He said the truth about deaths cannot be “hidden” through “lies” of the BJP government.In a separate tweet tagging a video, he said, "The condition of hospitals in Gorakhpur is extremely pathetic."The BJP government, which is indulging in false propaganda of its success, has become a burden, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/adityanath-fudging-coronavirus-numbers-tower-of-corpses-in-up-congress-101620752505545.html

Raising the demand here on Tuesday, RLD national spokesman Anupam Mishra said there was also a lot of confusion and misgivings about the vaccines and the government must dispel the same by taking people into confidence.Questioning the Centre’s current vaccination policy, he said it was not clear yet as to when the vaccination programme would get the desired speed and how much population is required to be vaccinated to produce herd immunity. “Most importantly, it is also not known whether the vaccines being administered currently are effective against the mutated variants of the coronavirus,” Mishra said, adding “It is, therefore, desirable for the Centre to set up national task force of experts to address all these issues and oversee the vaccination programme for better results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-demands-centre-to-set-up-national-task-force-for-vaccination-programme-101620752548291.html

11-05-2021||Pune||Court orders demolition of 22-storied building in Kondhwa||A Pune city court has ordered demolition of a 22 storied building constructed by Clover Developers in Clover Highlands Co-operative Housing society in Kondhwa. Nine residents of the society had approached the court stating that the construction of buildings was not part of the plan when the society handover took place in 2007. The petition before Pune civil court senior division was filed in 2018 by the litigants in the form of a suit for declaration, cancellation and injunction under specific relief act and Section 7 of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, 1963. Judge SMA Sayyed in his order stated that all the revised and sanctioned plans after the plan dated Feb 6, 2007,stand cancelled being void ab initio. “If these defendants failed to comply the said order within stipulated time, plaintiffs are at liberty to demolish the said structure by incurring own expenses and recovered the said expenses from defendant.” the order stated. The order added that, “Defendant No. 1 (Clover Developers Private Limited) and two ( Everjoy Co­-operative Housing Society Limited (Phase­1) are hereby directed to pay rupees five lakhs jointly and severally to the plaintiffs as compensation towards damages, harassment and mental agony and inconvenience caused to them within four months from the date of this order. ” The court in its 95-pageorder directed Clover Developers Private Limited, through its directors Raj Kanaksen Bhansali and Dhiren Nandu, and the neighbouring Everjoy Co-operative Housing Society Limited (Phase 1) ‘against undertaking any construction of building 8 and building 9 (buildings in dispute)’. The judge also directed by the way of a mandatory injunction that the two buildings in dispute be demolished, within a period of four months from the date of the order. Maj R Dave, one of the petitioners said, “When the first barricades came up, I’d walk past it with my dogs and think to myself, that someone should do something about it, to restore our land and facilities to us. In time, I realized that the “someone” would have to be me. And there were some others who thought alike. We didn’t know enough when we started out, but with a determined and industrious team who put together an indisputable trail of documentation, with belief in the judicial system, resilience in the face of such odds, a gutsy advocate and some luck, we stood up to be counted.” Everjoy co-­operative housing society representative Kiran Wagaj said, “The builder is not affecting any additional constructions in the building in which plaintiffs have purchased flats. Our construction is phase wise we have completed phase 1 and now another phase is going on. Flat purchase society is well aware about the right of defendant to effect construction of second phase and they have ratified the right of Clover to effect additional construction in their general body meeting. Clover Highland society has filed suit but subsequently they withdrew the suit. Plaintiffs do not have locus standi to file suit. The court has stayed an order for 90 days i.e. until the appeal period. We are challenging this judgement before honourable high court. As per section 7A of Maharashtra flat ownership act consent of flat purchasers are not required for construction of second phase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/court-orders-demolition-of-22-storied-building-in-kondhwa-101620750447043.html
11-05-2021||Pune||Members of Azad Samaj Party in police custody for protesting outside Ajit Pawar’s residence||Ten members of Azad Samaj Party (ASP) were remanded to three days in custody of Pune police by a local court in case of allegedly attacking police officials during a protest held in front of a residence of Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister of Maharashtra. The protest was against the state government’s decision to withdraw the 33 per cent reservation in promotion to posts in government service to provide promotions of government officials of the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Vimukta jati, and nomadic tribe (VJNT) communities. The Government Resolution (GR) cited a Bombay High Court decision from August 4, 2017, that invalidated reservation in promotion of government officials to make the decision. The GR further stated that the Supreme Court has not put the order on hold which means that the HC order is still applicable. As a result, the April 20 GR that announced reservation in promotion, needed to be amended. The 10 in custody include Bhimrao Dattu Kamble (31), Abhijit Madhukar Gaikwad (32), Rafik Rustom Shaikh (37), Ankit Parshuram Gaikwad (21), Darshan Baburao Ubale (25), Datta Mohan Bhalshankar (38), Vinod Lakshman Waghmare (34), Mahesh Vaijyanath Thorat (21), Sahar Virbhadra Javai (23), and Sharad Gautam Lokhande (23), according to the police. The protesters burnt a copy of the government resolution passed on May 7 in front of the house owned by DCM in Rane Circle area of Bhosalenagar in Pune. “Members of Azad Samaj Party arrested by Chaturshringi police for protesting outside residence of Ajit Pawar, DCM, and Maharashtra state against government resolution passed on May 7 taking away reservation in promotion of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes. Defense lawyers argued for the accused that the Section 353 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) is being misused here as protesting is one’s fundamental right and so it is fundamental duty of state i.e., police to see that the fundamental right is not violated,” said a statement of the defence lawyers including advocates Tosif C Shaikh, Deepak Gaikwad, Kranti Sahane, Jaydeep Doke, and Ravi Wadmare. A case under Sections 353, 188, 269, 270, 143, 145, 147, 149 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 51(b) of National Disaster Management Act, 2005; Section 2 and 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act was registered at Chaturshringi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/members-of-azad-samaj-party-in-police-custody-for-protesting-outside-ajit-pawar-s-residence-101620750387003.html

11-05-2021||Pune||Centre praise ‘Pune model’ for drop in Covid positivity rate||Pune: On Tuesday during a media briefing, the health ministry praised Mumbai and Pune model which have successfully brought down the positivity rate. Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry said the model helped drop the positivity rate from 41.8% to 23.4%. The district reported 7,665 Covid cases and 43 deaths due to the infection, on Tuesday, according to the state health department. The district’s progressive count went up to 0.938 million of which 0.832 million and 10,160 deaths have been declared due to the infection. Currently, 95,731 are undergoing treatment in hospitals or are in home isolation. Pune city reported 2,581 new cases which took the final count to 463,524 and with 18 more deaths, the toll went up to 5,889. PCMC reported 1,441 new cases which took the total to 227,235 and with two more deaths the toll went up to 1,532. Pune rural reported 3,643 new cases which took the total to 247,715 and with 23 more deaths the toll went up to 2,681. Praising the Pune model, the health ministry stated that the model has worked effectively to bring down the positivity rate. Agarwal said, “The way in which Pune contained the upsurge of Covid-19 cases drew praise from the ministry, as a fine example that shows how containment measures can help restrict the spread of the disease. When Pune witnessed a 69.7% case positivity rate in the first week of March 2021, it started measures like night curfew, imposed from 11 pm. to 6 am. This resulted in two things, reduction in growth trajectory of Covid cases and reduction in positivity rate, as positivity rate reduced from 41.8% to 23.4 %. We have observed that strict measures like restrictions on mass gatherings and on intermingling of people along with closing of non-essential activities for a period of 15 days reduce the rate of growth of cases and cases start plateauing.” Pune saw over 12,478 vaccinations on the day. Pune city reported 6,739 vaccinations, PCMC 1,560 and Pune rural saw 4,179 beneficiaries get the jab. Of the total vaccinations, 3,746 were of Covaxin and 8,732 of Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-praise-pune-model-for-drop-in-covid-positivity-rate-101620749967019.html
11-05-2021||Other||Indirect rural polls may be deferred till Covid subsides||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government is unlikely to hold the indirect panchayat elections to elect the district and block panchayat chiefs for now due to the second wave of the Covid-19 wreaking havoc everywhere, even as lobbying by political parties and potential candidates is already in full swing in villages. As per the Allahabad high court order of February 4, 2021, the state government and the state election commission are supposed to hold indirect elections to the posts of zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons, completing the exercise by May 25 after holding direct elections by May 10. The four-phase direct elections in which around 12 crore rural voters exercised their franchise to elect village pradhans, village ward members, kshetra panchayat and zila panchayat ward members are over with counting of votes last week. Now, 75,852 kshetra panchayat members and 3,050 zila pachayat members elected in the recent direct polls will vote to elect 75 zila panchayat and 826 kshetra panchayat chiefs respectively in the final round. The state government, according to people dealing with the issue, has decided to not hold indirect elections till the pandemic subsides in the state and it may soon seek the court’s permission for the same. “Having drawn a lot of flak for not deferring the three-tier panchayat polls despite the devastating second wave of the Covid-19, the government has got cold feet about its plans to hold indirect rural polls this month”, they disclosed. Indicating that the indirect rural polls may be put on hold for now, minister panchayati raj, Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said that the government’s entire focus, as of now, was on winning the fight against the pandemic. “The current time is not conducive to holding polls and the government wants to focus on its fight against the Covid-19 that has started spreading its tentacles in rural areas as well,” he said before adding, “But no final decision on polls has been taken yet.” Additional chief secretary panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh also said the issue was under consideration. “A final call on this issue will be taken soon,” he said. Another senior official, however, disclosed that the government would soon file an affidavit in the high court, stating that due to the pandemic it was not advisable to hold indirect rural polls at this juncture. “The hearing of the case filed in January is already scheduled to be held on May 27 by the court and the government is most likely to submit an affidavit the court the same day, explaining why it could not comply with its earlier directives for holding indirect elections by May 25,” sources revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indirect-rural-polls-may-be-deferred-till-covid-subsides-101620748646851.html

Ten people died during treatment. The health department’s daily bulletin on corona released late night on Monday mentioned that 4656 samples were tested out of which 2190 were found positive. This shows that every second person in the total number of samples tested positive, which was the highest positivity in a day. Earlier, 1678 people tested positive in a single day on May 4 out of 7177 samples, which indicated that almost every fourth person was tested positive. Previously, on April 22 for the first time 1634 people were found positive out of 6635 samples. The analysis shows that in spite of every possible effort, surge in infection is continuing in the district and stricter measures are required to control the spread. So far 13,081 people have \tested positive in the first 10 days of the month and 78 patients lost their lives in the same duration. On Monday, 10 patients died during treatment. The number of deaths mentioned in the bulletin, however, mismatches the bodies cremated in a single day at the Suraj Kund crematorium. An Acharya who performs last rites at the crematorium said on condition of anonymity that on an average, 60 to 70 bodies were being cremated, including those who died of coronavirus.

11-05-2021||Other||11 neonatal Covid-19 cases has hosps worried about threat to new-borns||PUNE From zero neonatal Covid-19 cases to 11 such cases in less than a month’s time, including two with rare symptoms, three city hospitals are seeing a larger threat to unborn and neonates (0-28 days) in the second wave. This could be even more severe in the anticipated third wave as vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers is under consideration by the government of India. According to the British Medical Journal there are 44 reported cases of neonates with confirmed Covid-19. The study states: “26 observational studies (18 case reports and ei0ght case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was five days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days”. Dr Pradeep Suryanvashi, who is working as a consultant with the three hospitals, Noble hospital, Sahyadri hospital and Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said, “We have seen 11 newborn babies with Covid-19 infection after five days of life. Most of the babies had fever as a presentation, four babies presented with breathing problems and one baby presented with convulsion (viral encephalitis). This type of presentation we have not noticed in the first wave. We also saw rare cases of one case of convulsion and heart failure. In view of the anticipated third wave we have prepared six beds in intensive care for neonatal Ccovid-19 cases.”Dr Suryavanshi also added it was found that steroids worked well with the babies. He said, “Some of the common symptoms among symptomatic newborns were fever, decreased feeding, dehydration, loose motions, breathing difficulty, convulsion, cardiac failure and renal failure.” “Regarding treatment for severe neonate cases, it was found that the baby needs admission in neonatal ICU. No need of Remdesivir for newborn infection and it was found that there is no role of immunoglobulin and plasma therapy,” he added. In view of the increasing cases of Covid19 among paediatric and neonates, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) released a statement that said, “Pregnant women are not at increased risk of getting infected as compared to the general population. Just as for the general population, Covid-19 has an asymptomatic or mild course for most pregnant women. However, compared to non-pregnant women and pregnant women who are not infected, pregnant women who are infected are more likely to need hospitalisation, and critical care.” The statement added, “For pregnant women, live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated. It should be noted that none of the vaccines available in the market globally are live attenuated. Other vaccines which may have some theoretical considerations regarding transmission are the viral vector vaccines. We emphasise that these considerations are theoretical. One can conclude that based on the mechanism of the available vaccines; there is no obvious basis for excluding pregnant or lactating women from vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11-neonatal-covid-19-cases-has-hosps-worried-about-threat-to-newborns-101620748346893.html
11-05-2021||Other||4 black fungus cases in Meerut||MEERUT After Maharashtra and Gujarat, the potentially fatal and rare ‘ black fungus’ infection has been detected in four Covid-19 patients here. These are perhaps the first cases of black fungus among corona patients in the state. Black fungus or mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is ubiquitous. It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening.Assistant chief medical officer ( ACMO) Dr Pooja Sharma confirmed to the media on Tuesday that the rare fungal infection had been detected in two Covid -19 patients undergoing treatment in a private hospital here. She said one patient was from Muzaffarnagar and another from Bijnor. Chief medical officer ( CMO) Dr Akhilesh Mohan said that he had sought a report from the hospital in this regard. Two other patients with black fungus infection reported at an eye hospital and were cured. Dr Shakeel Ahmad, chairman and chief medical director of Vision Care Superspeciality Eye Hospital, said that it was a rare and potentially fatal fungal infection called mucormycosis. Dr Shakeel said that last week he also came across two patients in his OPD who developed black fungus infection after recovering from Covid-19. One of the women patients, above 60 years of age, was from neighbouring Hapur district. “I am unable to recall the native place of the other patient right now,” said Dr Shakeel. In one patient the infection was at an advanced stage and cured through surgery while in the other it was in a preliminary stage and cured with medicines. Dr Shakeel explained that use of high flow of oxygen during treatment of Covid-19 patients infused moisture inside, which caused serious problems starting with nasal congestion. In many cases it badly affected the eyes and could be detected and cured by keeping a close examination of eyes and nasal obstruction during treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-black-fungus-cases-in-meerut-101620748286886.html

Vaccination at all 44 private facilities in Patna has been shut since May 1, after the state government order, said Patna district immunisation officer Dr SP Vinayak. Against a peak of 3.75 inoculations in a single day in March, the state vaccinated 1,46,493 people on Tuesday, taking its total tally to 84,08,557. The state health department had now asked private healthcare facilities interested in vaccination to register with the civil surgeon of the respective district. This despite the fact that many private centres were involved in the vaccination process between January 16 and April 30. The Mahavir Vatsalya Hospital, which reached out to the Serum Institute of India (SII) to procure Covishield vaccines, was on Monday told to wait for another three to four months for the vaccines, said Dr Upendra Prasad Sinha, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination. “The firm’s Mumbai office has told us to access the vaccines when it becomes available in the private market supply chain channels, which will take about 3-4 months from now,” added Dr Sinha. “The medical representative of the Serum Institute has communicated the head of paediatrics department Dr Vijay Ranjan that our hospital is among the four private centres shortlisted by the firm for giving vaccines in Patna because of our bulk consumption of children vaccines for other diseases,” said Acharya Kishore Kunal, secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Temple Trust, which runs a series of hospitals in Bihar. The hospital used to vaccinate around 100-150 people till April 30. The government move has also dissuaded the Ruban Memorial Hospital in New Patliputra Colony. “I am not keen to continue with the vaccination now that the government is not providing us the vaccines. Taking it as a social commitment, we provided our infrastructure and manpower to help the government in its vaccination drive. If the government expects us to buy the vaccines on our own and administer it to people, I don’t think we are interested in it because our hands are full in management of Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Satyajit Singh, managing director of the Ruban hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH). The Ruban used to vaccinate an average 250-400 people per day, he claimed. The Paras-HMRI Hospital, another private facility accredited to the NABH said it was clueless where to get the vaccines from. “We are cluless at this point where to get the vaccines from. The state health department is also not clear about it. Our Gurgaon office wrote to the Serum Institute of India for the vaccine, but it has not responded yet. If the government provides us the Covid-19 vaccines, we are ready to administer them to people,” said Dr Syed Asif Rahman, medical superintendent, Paras-HMRI Hospital, Patna. The hospital, he said, used to administer an average 150-200 vaccine doses per day till April 30. Meanwhile, the NTPC, a public sector undertaking, wrote to the Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh on Tuesday requesting him to establish Covid-19 vaccination centre at NTPC Barh to facilitate its employees take the jab. “We have around 320 employees below 45 years of age at NTPC Barh who may please be vaccinated at utmost priority,” said Onkar Nath, deputy general manager (HR), in his letter to the Patna DM. Earlier, on May 5, regional executive director East-1, Praveen Saxena wrote to the Bihar chief secretary, urging him to establish Covid-19 vaccination centre at various NTPC plants of Bihar to facilitate NTPC employees and its associates take the shot.

The bodies have floated into Bihar from UP,” Jha tweeted, adding that doctors had confirmed that deaths had taken place four-five days ago.Meanwhile, the DM said preparations were underway for last rites of bodies. “The religion of the dead is not known and bodies are in decomposed condition. So, it has been decided to bury all the bodies. For this, large pits have been dug,” he said.According to agency reports, corpses were found floating in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday.“Our officers are present on the spot to investigate and ascertain where they came from. A probe into the matter is underway,” MP Singh, Ghazipur’s district magistrate, told ANI.Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat termed the whole episode “unfortunate” and asked the states concerned to take immediate cognizance.“The incident of corpses found floating in Ganga in Buxar region of Bihar is unfortunate. This is definitely a matter of investigation. The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness of ‘mother’ Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The concerned states should take immediate cognizance in this regard,” Shekhawat tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/71-bodies-fished-out-from-ganges-near-buxar-101620746967371.html

SHO of Buddha colony police station in Patna, Kaisar Alam, said Yadav was arrested Tuesday morning and driven in his own SUV to the police station for further investigation. Yadav, however, claimed his arrest was politically motivated. “They’ll tell you why I have been arrested. I have helped [needy] families for [the last] 1.5 months despite recently [undergoing] an operation. The government and Nitish babu (a reference to chief minister Nitish Kumar) will know what this is. Arrest doesn’t take place for violation of lockdown,” he said while being taken the police station. Yadav recently accused the BJP MP from Saran, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, of apathy, claiming the 24 ambulances funded by MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) scheme lay abandoned in Saran instead of serving Covid-19 patients during the current crisis. One of Rudy’s supporters later filed a complaint against him for “trespassing” and “vandalizing” the ambulances.Yadav’s activism had drawn praise from many belonging to poor families who credit him for intervening in time to get them admitted to hospitals during the present crisis. While being taken to Madhepura, Yadav said he had been made a scapegoat. “Nitish is working on the instructions of the BJP,” he said. Meanwhile, political parties, including HAM-S and Vikasheel Insaaf Party (VIP), which is part of the NDA government, criticized the arrest. “If a public representative is serving the people and he is arrested for that, it is dangerous for humanity. Let there be a thorough probe,” said former CM and HAM-S president Jitan Ram Manjhi. VIP leader and minister in the state, Mukesh Sahni, called it “insensitiveness” of the government while CPI-ML state secretary Kunal demanded immediate release of the former MP. “The arrest has exposed the claim of Nitish Kumar government regarding good governance and rule of law,” said Arun Kumar Yadav, an RJD leader from Purnia.JAP spokesperson Rajesh Yadav said the arrest was anti-democratic and totally illegal. (With inputs from Aditya Nath Jha in Purnia)BoxThe curious caseThe case of kidnapping dates back to 1989. Yadav has secured bail but failed to follow the order of regular submission in court. On March 22, 2021, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate-1 cancelled his bail and issued property attach warrant against Pappu Yadav for failing to appear in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pappu-picked-up-for-flouting-lockdown-packed-off-to-madhepura-in-32-year-old-case-101620746967963.html

In a video that has gone viral on social media, the woman is seen wailing and appealing to people not to trust hospitals. Narrating her ordeal, the woman is heard saying she was molested by an employee at the Glocal Hospital in Bhagalpur, who she identified as one Jyoti Kumar. The woman’s husband, a software engineer, was later brought to a private hospital in Patna where he died on May 8. The woman has alleged that a doctor at the Patna hospital too molested her and the hospital administration deliberately switched off the oxygen supply in the ICU to force people to buy oxygen cylinders. Talking to media persons in Patna, the woman said her family, living in Noida, had come to Bhagalpur to celebrate Holi and decided to stay back as Covid cases began rising across the country. On April 9, her husband fell ill and got himself tested twice for coronavirus, but the results were negative. Later, a doctor in Noida asked him to get a chest CT scan done, which showed infection in the lungs. The man and her mother were admitted to Glocal Hospital in Bhagalpur. The woman said Jyoti Kumar, an attendant at the hospital, molested her several times. She said that in the meantime, her husband’s condition worsened, after which he was referred for treatment to Mayaganj government hospital, but doctors there refused to attend to him. “We then decided to take him to a hospital in Patna and admitted him in the ICU on April 26. However, doctors there did not even visit the ICU. One of them inappropriately touched me several times during his visit to the ICU. I could not gather courage to shout as I feared for my husband,” she said. She alleged the hospital staff cut off her husband’s oxygen supply and she was forced to buy oxygen cylinders from the black market. The hospital sold an oxygen cylinder for ₹50,000 each, she alleged. When contacted, Glocal Hospital at Bhagalpur accepted that a person by the name of Jyoti Kumar worked in the hospital. “We have removed Jyoti Kumar from the services and the police are free to probe and take action,” said Dr Ajim, the hospital’s managing director. Meanwhile, Bhagalpur’s senior superintendent of police Natasha Gudia said a three-member team headed by city SP Puran Jha would probe the incident. The SSP said she spoke to the woman and asked her to send a written complaint about the incident. Meanwhile, Patna High Court advocate Sama Sinha mentioned the incident before the court and urged it to take suo motu cognizance. Sinha said she had sought an urgent hearing in the case. All India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA), Bihar, demanded that the guilty be arrested at the earliest and hospitals in question be blacklisted by the government. “It’s a matter of great shame for the entire health sector. Where will the women go if such incidents occur at the hospitals during this crisis?” said Mina Tiwari, national general secretary of the AIPWA. Shashi Yadav, state secretary of the AIPWA, demanded immediate arrest of culprits and said the hospitals concerned should be blacklisted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-patient-s-wife-says-molested-at-hospital-police-probe-101620746966850.html

Assistant chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Pooja Sharma confirmed to the media on Tuesday that the rare fungal infection had been detected in two Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at a private hospital. She said one patient was from Muzaffarnagar and another from Bijnor. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Akhilesh Mohan said that he has sought a report from the hospital in this regard. Two other patients with black fungus infection were reported at an eye hospital and were cured. Dr Shakeel Ahmad, chairman and chief medical director of Vision Care Superspeciality Eye Hospital, said that was a rare and potentially fatal fungal infection known as mucormycosis. Dr Shakeel said that last week he also came across two patients in his OPD who developed black fungus infection after recovering from Covid-19. One of the women patients, above 60 years of age, was from the neighbouring Hapur district. “I am unable to recall the native place of the other patient right now,” said Dr Shakeel. In one patient the infection was at an advanced stage and was cured through surgery while in the other it was at a preliminary stage and was treated with medicines. Dr Shakeel explained that the use of high-flow of oxygen during the treatment of Covid-19 patients often infuses moisture inside which may cause serious problems, starting with nasal congestion. In many cases, it badly affects the eyes and could be detected and cured by keeping a close examination of eyes and nasal obstruction during the treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-black-fungus-cases-reported-in-covid-19-patients-in-meerut-101620746727346.html

A division bench of Justices K K Tated and N R Borkar on May 6 heard an application filed by Karnataka’s Biovet Private Limited, seeking direction to the Maharashtra government to hand over possession of the manufacturing unit at Manjari Khurd village in Pune. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest (Pune division), said his department, which owns the land, will cooperate with the procedure while formalities related to the hand-over will be completed in two-three days, following which the pharma company can make arrangements for vaccine production. The unit was first being used by Intervet India Pvt Ltd, a multinational and subsidiary of Merck & Co, after land was granted to it in 1973 to manufacture vaccines for the foot and mouth disease. Later Intervet decided to exit business operations in India and entered into an agreement with Biovet for the transfer of the land and manufacturing unit. However when Biovet sought the Maharashtra government’s approval for the transfer, the forest department claimed the land was reserved and the initial 1973 grant itself was a violation. Biovet later approached the Bombay High Court challenging the forest department’s order.“The land belongs to the forest department. Now according to the HC order it will be given to them temporarily to manufacture Covid vaccines,” said Patil.Patil clarified that the use of this manufacturing unit is approved on a temporary basis to produce life-saving vaccines during the pandemic. “That land was assigned to the company before. Infrastructure is ready on that land. As per the court order we will handover it to the concerned party,” said Patil. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the process to activate the vaccine plant in Pune will be expedited. “We want to vaccinate everyone in the state to defeat the virus. I have directed the Pune Collector to make the land available for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine plant,” said Ajit Pawar in Mumbai at an online event. The vaccine manufacturing facility is situated in a village in Manjari Khurd in Haveli taluka, on land measuring 11.58 hectares.

In one incident, a complainant was duped of ₹2 lakh through UPI scam when all he wanted was a refund for the cancellation of his ticket. He was struggling to find a customer care number and obtained a number from Google search results. He received a call and was asked to download a mobile application called Team Viewer Quick Support on his cell phone. After following the steps told by the fraudsters, he was duped of ₹2 lakh from his bank account. The victim immediately reported the fraud,” the police spokesman said in a statement.He said that Cyber Police Kashmir was able to recover the money from the fraudsters.“In OTP frauds, multiple complaints were received regarding vishing (OTP) scams wherein the complainants get phone calls from fraudsters claiming to be bank officers. These fraudsters convince the complainants and inform them that their debit cards have been blocked and are due for renewal. In order to renew the debit cards, the complainants are asked to share the card details along with six digits OTP received on their cell phones. The gullible victims end up sharing their card details along with OTP and fall prey to such scams. An amount of ₹11 lakh was duped similarly,” the police said.Police said amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the public is dependent on cyber platforms, the vulnerability of getting trapped into cyber scams/frauds gets increased.“Public is advised to refrain from downloading any remote access apps like Team viewer quick support, Anydesk App etc. or dialling fake helpline or customer care numbers found on Google search engine.

One of the factors for the increase in cyclone intensity and frequency is warmer sea surface temperature (SST), said IMD scientists. Studies have also highlighted that pre-monsoon cyclones in the Arabian Sea are increasing.Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, said that normally the frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is one every year.“However, for this cyclogenesis, it is very early to say what path the cyclone will take and what the intensity will be. We have issued an early warning so that fishermen can be cautioned from venturing out to sea from May 14. IMD will be issuing updated forecasts of the same, from time to time,” said Dr Mohapatra.Vineet Kumar Singh, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), who has published a paper on warmer sea surface temperatures (SST) and subsurface temperatures being responsible for the rapid intensification of cyclones that India has witnessed in the recent past, said that we can expect the Arabian Sea to witness more cyclones each year.“The intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is also rapidly increasing due to warmer sea surface temperature. In 2020, we witnessed the Nisarga Cyclone, which was a category 1 cyclone. Though it is early to predict the path of this upcoming cyclone, the weather department has issued a warning to inform fishermen not to venture out to sea,” said Singh.He added that based on various national and international models, there is a possibility that this cyclone will be more intense than Cyclone Nisarga.“However, the intensity of the cyclone can be predicted only in the next few days, as the conditions get clearer. Due to the rotation axis of the earth, many cyclones in Arabian Sea take a path towards Yemen and Oman,” said Singh.He added that in 2007, Cyclone Gonu which was developed in the pre-monsoon Arabian Sea was a category 3 cyclone and had a wind speed of about 180-200km per hour.“It is the Arabian sea where an increase in intensity of cyclones is observed,” said Singh.Another study by Researchers at University of Virginia, USA, published in the journal Nature in 2011 states that there is an increase in the intensity of pre-monsoon tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea during the period 1979–2010. The study shows that the change in storm strength is a consequence of a simultaneous upward trend in anthropogenic black carbon and sulphate emissions.Cyclone watch* A low pressure area is likely to form over southeast Arabian Sea around May 14* Likely to move north-north-westwards across southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area and intensify into a depression around May 15. * It may intensify into a cyclonic storm over east central Arabian Sea around May 16 and continue to move north north-westward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/low-depression-over-arabian-sea-likely-to-intensify-into-cyclonic-storm-by-may-16-imd-101620742826541.html

Using the ‘hub and spoke’ model to streamline the oxygen supply - the model requires intensive manpower to ensure hassle-free supply – the shooters are conducting data gathering and entry, GPS Web application monitoring, oxygen tanker location tracking and monitoring with regional transport office (RTO) and medical department. Kumar said in the ‘hub and spoke’ model, the state has been divided into five hubs – Lucknow, Kanpur, Modinagar, Ghaziabad and Varanasi - for route optimization. Gorakhpur and Bareilly are functioning as co-hubs. “Each hub comprises 5-6 cities. The spokes are 57 medical colleges across UP where the demand for oxygen has increased. This model is flexible to allow modifications in case of any fluctuations in oxygen demand. The creation of an additional hub requires approximately 9-10 hours of turnaround time,” said Kumar. The shooters remain present at the oxygen manufacturing facilities where the tracking devices are installed and enabled. These devices ensure minimum turnaround times and facilitate end-to-end coordination between multiple departments for seamless movement of oxygen tankers. “We are witnessing spike in coronavirus cases across the country. Collaboration is the key to winning the battle against COVID-19. We are contributing by setting up a command centre for oxygen movement across the country like we did successfully for UP,” said Kumar. “In this endeavor we required volunteers to support us for efficient management of this entire process. I had appealed to all my fellow shooters across India to come forward and support us as volunteers. We have received a very positive response from the community,” he added. Deepak Dubey, who coached many national level shooters appreciated efforts of Kumar and his team. “It’s a real service to the people of the state by the sportspersons. Such initiatives will go a long way in alleviating the miseries of Covid-19 patients. I urge more people to come forward to join the cause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shooters-join-hands-to-combat-oxygen-shortage-in-up-101620741326332.html

Smita’s husband BD Pandey, 69, retired superintendent of customs and central excise, who suffers from a heart ailment, got infected too. “My mother’s positive approach and determination helped me and my husband overcome the infection,” Smita said. Her husband tested positive for Covid-19 infection on April 18 after experiencing mild fever and cough. Smita initially testing negative but later developed symptoms with fever and soon after, along with her 95-year-old mother tested positive on April 23. “Now, all three of us were positive. Only my sister Beenu Joshi, was free of Covid-19 infection. We decided to stay in home isolation and adhere to doctor’s advice after isolating ourselves in three separate rooms of the house in Indira Nagar,” Smita said. Smita said her sister kept providing proper meal and took care of the entire house with help of some relatives and friends, who also kept delivering food and medicines regularly. The family was also in touch with doctors over phone and kept consulting them daily. “We took our medicines on time, did breathing exercises regularly. At times, my mother’s oxygen level dipped slightly but she maintained her patience and increased the oxygen level through prone position,” Smita said. “We remained positive all through the phase and never allowed ourselves to feel low. Patience, due care and precautions regarding medicines and diet etc. paid off and we three recovered in nearly two weeks. We are doing well now”, Pandey said. “While recovering, we did breathing exercises, took steam, read books and rested,” she said adding that she felt proud of her mother for remaining positive mentally throughout the testing phase. “Along with medicines, exercise and healthy diet, positive approach is very important for recovery,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nonagenarian-daughter-son-in-law-defeat-covid-19-with-positive-intent-101620741206325.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||'Khan Chacha' owner Navneet Kalra fails to get protection from arrest in oxygen concentrator case||A Delhi Court on Tuesday refused to give any interim relief from arrest to businessman Navneet Kalra for the second time in the alleged oxygen concentrator hoarding and black marketing case. Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass also placed his anticipatory bail before the District and Sessions Judge which will now decide which court will hear the plea on Wednesday. “Bail application placed before the District Judge South East at 10 am tomorrow; they will send it to the concerned court. There is no interim relief or any sort of protection to the accused yet,” the judge remarked. The court was hearing the arguments on the issue of jurisdiction on the anticipatory bail petition filed by the businessman in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his upscale restaurants, including 'Khan Chacha' in Khan Market.  During the course of proceedings, Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said that since the matter was transferred to the Crime Branch after registration of FIR, the court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter.    “On May 7, the court had the power but now since the case has been transferred, it has no jurisdiction over the matter,” Shrivastava apprised the judge. However, advocate Vineet Malhotra, representing the accused, told the court that on May 7, the case was registered at Lodhi Colony Police Station and hence the court has the jurisdiction over the matter, despite the investigation being transferred later. “Just because it was transferred, they cannot take away the jurisdiction of this court. The court cannot be bound to their action,” Malhotra said. The court on Monday had directed the investigating officer of the case to be present in court today along with a copy of the reply to Kalra's pre-arrest bail.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra and it is suspected that he has left Delhi along with his family. These concentrators are the crucial medical equipment used for Covid-19 management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/khan-chacha-owner-navneet-kalra-fails-to-get-protection-from-arrest-in-oxygen-concentrator-case-101620740223830.html

In a release, the DJB said that due to very high turbidity in raw water from Upper Ganga Canal, the production/pumping from water treatment plants (WTP) at Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi has been affected.The DJB further said that parts of NDMC area will also be affected in the morning and evening on Wednesday.Some of the areas listed in DJB release are Saket, Pushp Vihar, Katwaria Sarai, Lado Sarai, Khirki, Saidulajab, Gokulpuri, Sonia Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Babarpur, Tahirpur, Dilshad Garden, Nandnagari, Shahdara, Laxmi Nagar, Geeta Colony, Mayur Vihar, Kondli, Dallupura, Yamuna Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Jafrabad, Jhilmil, Mandawali, Laxmi Nagar, Shakarpur, Vivek Vihar, Karkardooma, Jagatpuri, Shalimar Park, Krishna Nagar,Patparganj, Preet Vihar, Vishkarma Park, Lalita Park, Seelampur, Shastripark, Bhrampuri, Gandhi Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan, Okhla, Kalkaji, Batla House Ext., Kalandi Colony, Badarpur, Sarita Vihar, Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli, Greater Kailash, South Extn., Lajpat Nagar, Jal Vihar, Lodhi Road, Kaka Nagar and adjoining areas.The jal board has advised people living in these areas to make judicious use of water.Last week, the DJB had said that water supply will be affected in various parts of Delhi as a result of Haryana releasing less raw water into the Yamuna. The supply from Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants was "adversely" hit due to the reduction in release of raw water into the river.The water from Wazirabad pond is drawn for treatment at Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal treatment plants.On average, the DJB supplies 900 MGD (million gallons daily) water, with demand peaking at 1,100 MGD in summer months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-to-be-hit-in-parts-of-delhi-tomorrow-check-list-of-areas-affected-101620736282268.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Amid Covid crisis, free counselling helps healthcare workers cope||Concerned over the mental well-being of healthcare workers during the ongoing Covid crisis, a number of free counselling services -- both individually or as helplines -- have cropped up in Delhi.Pooja Priyamvada, a mental health first-aider and researcher, who also volunteers for one of the helplines, said mental health helplines play an important role to help frontline workers in need.“Healthcare workers feel miserable when they are unable to help a patient with beds or special interventions that are not readily available. Their workload has increased exponentially and since it is crucial work, they can’t take a break,” said Priyamvada, who volunteers for the Co-Hope helpline, launched by Human Solidarity Foundation, a city-based NGO, last week.A volunteer network, which includes psychiatrists, psychologists, life coaches, counsellors, and social workers, is working at the helpline that caters to the needs of healthcare and frontline workers. In the past week, organisers said at least 35 healthcare workers have approached them seeking mental health support.According to Priyamvada, the fear of infecting loves ones also adds to the mental burden and despite constantly feeling overwhelmed, many cannot avail help due to poor support systems within institutes. “Doctors also have families back home. Even if they are not directly involved in Covid duties, they are visiting hospitals. They fear that they will carry the virus home to their family members. This fear leads to additional stress besides the general feeling of overwhelm,” said Priyamvada.Also Read | Covid-19: MHA details steps taken to enhance oxygen supplyMedhavi Sood, a clinical psychologist, too has been offering free counselling service to healthcare workers, initially by herself through social media and now with a network of professional counsellors. Coming from a family of doctors, Sood said that she had closely seen family members and friends struggle due to the increasing death rate of Covid-19, adding that she started the service as she realised it was important for doctors to share their experiences and emotions.“Due to the system failure and lack of basic requirements from oxygen to medicines, doctors are feeling helpless and tired. I’m afraid that compassion fatigue might set in with so much unfolding before healthcare workers. They hardly get the time to process these tragedies,” she said.A 26-year-old junior resident at a city-based government hospital shared that while both physical and mental exhaustion at work were leaving doctors traumatised, most of them did not have the time to seek help. “It’s difficult to encapsulate what we face on a daily basis. There is a lot of helplessness. While we strive to save all patients, sometimes things don’t work in the patients’ favour. People hold us responsible if there is an oxygen crisis. Sometimes, critical patients die before treatment. It becomes difficult for us to break the news of death to the family which holds us accountable for things that are not in our control,” said the doctor, who declined to give her name.Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, said while doctors take care of everyone else, their own mental health is often neglected. Sagar said that it is crucial for healthcare workers to take care of their mental health. “Many deaths are happening around us. Family members of doctors are also infected. Amid all this, they are delivering in a high-pressure environment. Social events and other avenues that allowed them to relax earlier are not happening. All these factors overwhelm doctors,” said Sagar.He said that healthcare workers need to take care of their mental health and take steps to unwind and share their emotions. “Healthcare workers should not neglect their mental health. If your mental health is poor, your productivity is bound to be affected. Doctors should relax, exercise, and reach out for help, if needed,” said Sagar.He said while there were helplines for healthcare workers, there is a lack of awareness about mental health. “When it comes to self, doctors don’t take help. It’s important to build awareness about mental health and available helpline so that people are motivated to use them,” said Sagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-covid-crisis-free-counselling-helps-healthcare-workers-cope-101620735986600.html

11-05-2021||Jaipur||25,000 Pakistani Hindu migrants waiting to get vaccinated in absence of govt nod||Over 25,000 Pakistani Hindu migrants living in Rajasthan are not able to get vaccines or food assistance to protect against the challenges posed by the second wave of Covid-19 as government permissions remain held up, said an official.Hemji Kolhi, who came to Jodhpur from Mirpur Khas district in Pakistan in January 2015, is currently living in a temporary residence in Anganwa village along with 250 other migrant families. He says the community has not received any medical help to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak so far. Not just that, “Rising unemployment has led to a shortage of ration in many households,” he claims.According to the home department, 22,146 Pakistani migrants are currently living in Rajasthan on long-term visas (LTVs), however, Seemant Lok Sangathan-- an organisation fighting for their basic rights-- puts the number over 25,000. State’s medical department records suggest about 17,180 of LTV holding Pakistanis reside in 24 slums in Jodhpur alone.Recently, after some of them tested positive for Covid-19, the Rajasthan medical and health department on May 5 ordered a door-to-door survey in 24 slums, however, in absence of necessary documents such as Aadhaar card, their vaccination remains stuck. The Sangathan claims the community has also largely remained excluded from the process of screening, testing and treatment for Covid-19.“Absence of an Aadhaar card is the biggest obstacle in the vaccination of Pak migrants... We have written a letter to the chief minister and demanded that Pakistani passports, residential permits (RP) or long term visas (LTVs) be made the basis for vaccination of Pak migrants,” said Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangathan. He argues that absence of vaccination not only poses a risk to the migrants’ families, but also to Indians living around them.State’s chief medical and health officer Balwant Manda says guidelines in this regard have been sought from the state government. “After a policy decision is taken at the government level, the requisite steps can be taken for vaccination of Pak migrants,” Manda says and adds that in the interim, a door-to-door survey is being carried out in their settlements for testing and treatment for Covid-19.No vaccination also means that Pakistani migrants are struggling to find safe employment at a time when the government’s assistance with food has not been forthcoming, unlike last year, when they received food packets during the nationwide lockdown. Sodha says the state’s proposal to issue special ration cards to migrant families considering them “special citizens” under the National Food Security Act is also awaiting Centre’s nod. According to the state government proposal prepared in February, 1107.3 quintals of wheat is required monthly for migrants.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former minister Vasudev Devnani says he too has written to the Union home minister and the chief minister demanding vaccination of Pakistani migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/25000-pakistani-hindu-migrants-waiting-to-get-vaccinated-in-absence-of-govt-nod-101620734546748.html

This was announced by state health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday."The decision has been taken in the wake of the short supply of vaccines for 45-plus beneficiaries by the central government," said Tope. “Efficacy of the vaccine is largely affected if the second dose is not administered within the stipulated time period,” he further said.The state health minister added that more than 2.1 million people above the age of 45 are due for their second dose, and out of them 1.6 million are for Covishield.

He assured cancer patients that full care is being taken for their treatment.However, four persons, including three personnel of ACI hospital staff, are among four people who have tested positive since Monday. The ACI authorities were alerted about the infection status of the two staffers, including a laboratory technician, on Tuesday morning. An ambulance driver and a woman patient tested positive on Monday and the woman was admitted to the isolation ward. Also read: Delhi records 12,481 Covid-19 cases, positivity rate drops further to 17.76%Healthcare experts have already cautioned that starting the Covid care facility on the second floor of the ACI could cause the virus to spread at the institute. “Paramedic and technical staff of the ACI are working in the Covid ward. The cancer institute’s laboratory is also being used for examining samples of Covid patients. Since there is an unchecked intermingling of people in the Covid care facility and the cancer hospital, there is a possibility of people at the ACI catching coronavirus infection,” said a doctor at the cancer hospital, requesting anonymity. Despite reservations by the ACI management and health experts about using the institute to treat pandemic patients, the state authorities started a 25-bed level 2 facility with oxygen support on April 30. Sources said the average occupancy of Covid patients remains between 18-22. ACI director Dr Deepak Arora said he would take up the matter with authorities. “We are concerned about the health of our cancer patients. The line of treatment compromises the immunity level of a cancer patient, and they remain vulnerable to any infection,” said Dr Arora. OPD open but surgeries remain suspended The ACI is a constituent of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, and caters to cancer patients from Bathinda and adjoining districts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Dr Arora said in view of the patients’ needs, the outpatient department (OPD), chemotherapy and radiotherapy services were resumed but surgeries remain suspended indefinitely. The ACI sources said that the state authorities should have taken domain experts on board while turning an exclusive cancer treatment institute into a Covid hospital. Delaying therapy or surgery not an optionThey said that doctors were unable to start the new treatment schedule. A doctor said it would be unfair to conclude normalcy at ACI on the basis of the OPD footfall. “Cancer patients need a specialised treatment, and they hardly have the option to delay therapies or surgery. After resuming the OPD on Friday, we got about 100 patients on Monday, one-third of the patient load in the last few months of the pandemic. It reflects their urgent dependency on experts amid the pandemic but the doctors at ACI are unable to start new treatment, considering their exposure to the high-infection environment,” said another cancer expert at the hospital. The experts say the state authorities should take over any public complex or educational institute in Bathinda and start the level-2 centre where oxygen supply facility is needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-test-positive-at-advanced-cancer-institute-in-bathinda-101620729986704.html

The primary teacher’s union and the kin said they had no money to arrange proper treatment of the deceased, who had not received their salaries for the last four months.“Most of them were contractual teachers, who died due to the financial crisis. For the last four months, contractual teachers have not received their salaries,” said Amardeep Kumar, president of Bihar Panchayat Nagar Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh, East Champaran-- a union of district’s primary school teachers.10 teachers in East Champaran died due to Covid-19 in the month of April and 12 others succumbed in May, while the remaining two deaths were reported from West Champaran, confirmed Binod Kumar Vimal, district education officer, East Champaran.Family of Upendra Kumar, headmaster at Chakayi Tola primary school in Pakaridayal, said non-payment of salaries was a major factor behind his death.“We were unable to meet the medical expenses of private health services. There were no beds available in government hospitals,” said Neeraj Paswan, son of Upendra Kumar, who died on April 24.The district programme officer (establishment) of the education department in East Champaran, Praful Kumar Mishra said the department’s hands were tied in absence of funds due to which the teachers, both regular and contractual, were last paid 80% of their January salary. “We are waiting for the funds for the allocation of salary from February onwards,” said Mishra, adding that the salary gets paid out as soon as the funds arrive.Another official in the department said on condition of anonymity that most of the time, the fund allotment is not only late but also below the entitlement for full payment of salaries.Upendra Kumar’s son said the financial crunch made his father consult quacks after the symptoms of coronavirus first appeared. “For the first few days, my father had to depend upon unqualified rural healthcare consultants. When his condition did not improve, we took him to the government hospital but could not get him admitted there,” said Neeraj, a school van driver, who claims to be penniless.“Getting treated at a private hospital was out of question given the kind of financial problems our family suffers from,” he said when asked why his father was not taken to a private hospital for treatment.The civil surgeon of the district said he couldn’t respond to claims if Upendra Kumar was denied admission at a government hospital in the district. “We are admitting patients and providing them with treatment as and when [they are] brought to the hospital,” Akhileshwar Prasad Singh said.Ravi Shankar Thakur, a contractual teacher posted at a government school at Binwaliya in Areraj sub division of the district said they get a salary of about ₹28,000 or thereabouts. “It makes it difficult to make ends meet and the late payment of salary further aggravates the problem.”An office bearer of the district teachers’ association alleged that the state government had put these teachers at additional risk of contracting the virus.“Even though the state government has shut educational institutions till May 15, teachers were required to be present at the school on rotation basis, which increased the risk of infection,” said Jai Prakash Singh, vice president of the primary teachers’ association in the district.District officials are at a loss to explain the deaths of these 24 teachers. “The compilation of details is still underway,” said the district education officer (DEO) of East Champaran.The vice president of the primary teachers’ union has demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh for the families of deceased teachers, besides a job for one of the dependents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-teachers-in-2-districts-die-of-covid-19-amid-financial-crisis-101620728666426.html

11-05-2021||Chandigarh||JJP reaches out to villages in Haryana for shot in the arm||Foot soldiers of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the coalition partner of the BJP, will fan out in villages to buttress the Haryana government’s battle against Covid-19 that has sent alarm bells ringing in the hinterland. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Monday held three meetings with state and national executive members of the JJP followed by another round of talks with district presidents and legislators to discuss ways to allay misconceptions of villagers about Covid-19 testing and vaccination. Also read: Allow more pharma companies to manufacture Covid vaccine: Delhi CM to CentreJJP sources said Chautala enquired from participants if they had taken the vaccine. “Much to his surprise, the response was not encouraging,” a JJP leader said, requesting anonymity. The elderly JJP executive members, who had not taken the vaccine on one pretext or the other, were asked to get inoculated on Tuesday itself before heading to the villages to spread awareness. “Younger members were assigned the duty of accompanying their older counterparts to vaccination centres,” the leader said. It was on the basis of this feedback from the national and state executives of the JJP that Chautala decided to position party leaders in villages to help the already hard-pressed administration. JJP outreach in Hisar, Sirsa, Bhiwani, Jind Each office-bearer was asked to adopt a village and generate awareness among residents. The JJP workers will distribute masks and hand sanitisers besides urging people to get tested and vaccinated. Initially, the focus of the JJP outreach will be in Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Bhiwani, Jind districts. Another key task will be to discontinue the practice of groups of men sharing hookah in the villages. The JJP’s move to adopt villages is being seen as an attempt to reach out to Jat-dominated areas and make inroads into villages where JJP leaders, including the deputy CM, are unable to enter due to the boycott call of farmers protesting against the BJP-led Centre’s farm laws. Funds for isolation wards in villages JJP sources say another key outcome of the party’s executive committee meeting was the decision of the state government to release funds for setting up isolation wards in villages. The deputy CM met panchayat department officials and decided on another major step to curb the Covid spread that is growing exponentially in the rural areas. The state government will release funds up to ₹50,000 to all gram panchayats of the state to set up isolation wards with 10 beds, pulse oximeters, steam machines, thermometers and blood pressure monitoring machines. A five-member committee, comprising an auxiliary nurse, nambardar, gram sachiv and two public representatives will run these isolation wards in community centres, chaupals, government schools and anganwadi centres of the villages. The government will allocate ₹30,000 to all villages with a population of less than 10,000 and villages with more than 10,000 residents will get ₹50,000. The government has sent 8,000 teams to villages to increase Covid testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jjp-reaches-out-to-villages-in-haryana-for-shot-in-the-arm-101620725845883.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Corona numbers on the decline in Delhi, lockdown was successful: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that Covid-19 cases are on the decline in the national capital. Adding that the ongoing Covid-induced lockdown in the national capital has been successful as people cooperated with authorities.“Corona cases are going down in Delhi, so is the second wave. With your cooperation lockdown was successful,” Kejriwal said during his live broadcast.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief also said that the Delhi government has increased the number of hospital beds with oxygen facilities in the past few days, with 500 new beds added in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) near Guru Tegh Bahadur (GBT) Hospital, a dedicated Covid hospital in Delhi. Another 500 beds with ICU facility are scheduled to come up near Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital.“We've increased the number of Oxygen beds in the past few days. Yesterday we started 500 new ICU beds near GTB Hospital,” said the chief minister, adding, “Now there's no shortage of ICU and Oxygen beds in Delhi.”Kejriwal told reporters on Monday that he was hopeful of cases dwindling down as the peak of the second coronavirus wave passes."I hope the peak (of the second wave of Covid-19) has passed. I hope the cases go down in the coming days but being in the government and as the chief minister of Delhi, I would not want to give any concessions," he said.Lockdown in Delhi was extended till May 17 by the AAP-led government. Enforcing strict measures like suspension of Metro train services and prohibition of wedding ceremonies at public venues.Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain reiterated Kejriwal’s statement on Covid-19 cases declining as both positivity rate and caseload is on the decline. Jain added that until the positivity rate goes down below 5% and caseload dwindles down to 3,000-4,000 daily the government won’t be at ease. The World Health Organization has set a benchmark of 5% positivity rate for an outbreak to be considered under control. The national capital’s positivity rate peaked at 36.2% on April 22, staying above 30% for 8 more days before starting to decline.“In the last few days, the positivity rate has declined from 36% to 19.1% with the caseload also going down from 28,000 per day to about 12,500. Till we reach a positivity rate below 5% and caseload below 3000-4000 cases, we can't be at ease,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/corona-numbers-on-the-decline-in-delhi-lockdown-was-successful-arvind-kejriwal-101620724917980.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Allow more pharma companies to manufacture Covid vaccine: Delhi CM to Centre||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday urged the Centre to engage more pharmaceutical companies in Covid vaccine production as well as draft a national scheme for vaccinating the entire population of the country in the next few months.“The crisis in Delhi currently is not of ICU or oxygen beds, but the shortage of vaccines… In Delhi, currently, the vaccine turnout is high and all arrangements are in place… Currently, we administer 125,000 doses per day. Soon, we want to scale this up to 300,000 doses per day. Our aim is to ensure that the entire adult population of Delhi is vaccinated in three months. But, in Delhi, we have only a few days’ stock of vaccine left. The entire country is facing a shortage of vaccines. Some states are struggling to widen the vaccine drive because of this shortage. Vaccine shortage is a major challenge now,” the chief minister said in an online press briefing.Also Read | Delhi court to hear today Navneet Kalra’s bail plea in oxygen concentrator caseHe added, “Only two companies in India are in vaccine production. Together, these companies are capable of producing 60-70 million vaccines a month. This way, it would take more than two years to vaccinate the entire population of the country. Such a long span is likely to witness multiple waves, which would lead to more deaths. So, it is important to take up vaccine production on a war footing and draft a national scheme to vaccinate the entire population of the country in the next few months. Unless every Indian is vaccinated, we cannot win the war against Covid-19.”Currently, two Covid vaccines are available in India: Covishield, produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India; and Covaxin, produced by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.“Production of vaccines in India should not be restricted to the two companies...The Centre should take the vaccine formula from the two companies (SII and Bharat Biotech) and give it to the other companies which are capable of producing safe vaccines. In such tough times, the Centre has the powers to take such decisions… It should be ensured that any plant in India that is capable of vaccine production should be engaged in the process. This is the only way to ensure that the entire population of India is vaccinated at the earliest,” said Kejriwal, drawing parallels with the shortage of PPE kits faced during the first wave of the pandemic in India.He said, “Imagine if only two companies had the right to produce PPE kits, we would have faced a major shortage of PPE kits too. Currently, many companies in India are making PPE kits… India has top pharma companies and the best of scientists. I am sure that they will cooperate in vaccine production. A fraction of the profit made by the other companies could be given to the original two companies as royalty, for they are the ones with the formula. This is the only way we can shield our citizens against the next wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/allow-more-pharma-companies-to-manufacture-covid-vaccine-delhi-cm-to-centre-101620720565753.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Pappu Yadav arrested for violation of Covid-19 lockdown rules in Bihar||Former parliamentarian from Bihar and Jan Adhikar Party chief Rajiv Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav was arrested on Tuesday morning from his Patna residence for alleged violation of Covid-19 lockdown norms. Bihar is under a 10-day lockdown till May 15.Chief of Buddha colony police station in Patna, Kaisar Alam, said Yadav was arrested Tuesday morning and driven in his own SUV to the police station for further investigation. A case was lodged against him for alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines and the disaster management act, he added.Another police officer pointed out that Yadav has been travelling across Bihar during the lockdown apparently to assess the situation of Covid-19 treatment facilities without permission. “The police repeatedly asked him to follow the rules of the lockdown but he ignored it,” the officer added.Yadav suggested his arrest was politically motivated. “They’ll tell you why I have been arrested. I have helped [needy] families for [the last] 1.5 months despite recently [undergoing] an operation. The government and Nitish babu (a reference to chief minister Nitish Kumar) will know what this is. Arrest doesn’t take place for violation of lockdown,” he said while on the way to the police station.Yadav recently accused the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) MP from Saran, Rajiv Pratap Rudy of apathy, claiming the 24 ambulances funded by MPLAD (Members of Parliament Local Area Development) scheme lay abandoned in Saran instead of serving Covid-19 patients during the current crisis precipitated by the second wave of the disease. One Rudy supporter later filed a complaint against him for “trespassing” and “vandalizing” the ambulances.Marhaura district superintendent of police (DSP) Indrajit Baitha said Yadav was booked under sections 147 (rioting), 448 (house tress pass), 379 (theft/snatching), 384 (extortion), 427 (mischief causing damage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant). “Barring Section 378 and 384 (non-bailable sections) all other sections were bailable,” said the DSP.Earlier on May 4, another case was lodged against Yadav in Gaya for violation of Covid-19 guidelines and the disaster management act after he barged into a district hospital with his supporters, demanding to inspect the facilities to treat Covid-19 patients there.“This [Yadav’s arrest] should be condemned but at the same time one is not above [the] law. [The arrest is] condemnable because as a public representative you have the right to reach out to people, extend an helping hand but not at the cost of the provisions of law. He should have definitely taken prior permission to move around,” said Gyanandera Yadav, assistant professor of Sociology at College of Commerce in Patna.Yadav’s activism had elicited praise from many belonging to poor families who credited him for intervening in time to get them admitted to hospitals during the present crisis.In the meanwhile, the Covid crisis in the state has shown signs of easing a bit with the test positivity rate (TPR), which was at 16.1% on April 30, declining to 10.3% on May 9. The TPR measures the percentage of positive cases among all those tested for the disease on a given day.Bihar reported 10,174 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, taking the total number of cases to 601,650. Patna topped with 1,745 new cases, followed by Katihar 706, Gopalganj 541, East Champaran 478, Samastipur 463, Begusarai 435 and Vaishali 417 among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pappu-yadav-arrested-for-violation-of-covid-19-lockdown-rules-in-bihar-101620718045830.html

It is important to increase the vaccine production on a war footing and frame a national plan to vaccinate all," he said.Urging the Centre to intervene, the CM suggested that the formula to make vaccine doses should be shared with other firms capable of producing vaccines in a safe manner.

Of these, 256 above 60 years got their first dose and 594 their second dose.In the 45-59 years age group, 577 people got their first dose and 550 their second dose, while the rest of the jabs were given to health care workers and others, the data showed.Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak Ohri urged residents to book their vaccine slots through the CoWin portal or the Aarogya Setu app and not go to centres which are not allotted to them.His appeal came after chaotic scenes were witnessed at vaccination centres in the morning leading to the deployment of police to regulate the crowd, while confusion continued at some places later in the day, too.“In wake of the pandemic, vaccination for 18-44 age group people has been started in Gautam Buddh Nagar district. Residents can register on the CoWin portal or the Aarogya Setu app, book a slot and reach the designated hospital or health centre to get vaccinated,” Ohri said in a statement.“Vaccination would not be done for anyone at any other hospital other than that allotted one. Please do not go to any hospital or health centre until unless not registered and slot booked to avoid inconvenience,” the senior doctor urged.A woman from Sarfabad village in Noida said she and her husband had to return without vaccination as they thought that the process was a walk-in drive like it was for the elderly people.“I had no clue about the registration process. It was only after reaching at the centre that I was told about it. I got to know that a smart phone or computer is needed for registration. My family doesn't have either,” the woman, who works as a domestic help in the city, claimed.Hesitant to share her name, the 30-something woman said she would request the family for whom she works to get her vaccine registration done.The vaccination drive is free at government centres while private hospitals are charging ₹900 for a dose, even as none of the centres in the district showed availability of slots on the official portals for the next few coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/chaotic-start-for-vaccination-for-18-44-years-in-noida-over-2-600-jabs-on-day-1-101620708338534.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Bihar govt rate fixed for computed tomography scan higher than AIIMS, CGHS||The Bihar government has dismissed criticism that the rate it fixed for high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of thorax—being used to measure the infection in lungs of Covid patients—was on the higher side citing the unique circumstances presented by the pandemic outbreak.On Saturday, the government capped the scan at all private laboratories in the state at ₹2,500 for single-slice CT machine and ₹3,000 for multi-slice CT machine with the aim to prevent profiteering when it’s being used extensively to decide the line of treatment for Covid-19 patients.However, some questioned the rationale for the rate slab fixed by the government citing it cost less ( ₹1,200) at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and was also higher than the rates ( ₹1700-- ₹2,000) approved by the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS).While reimbursing treatment cost to any of its employees, the state government relies on rates fixed by AIIMS or the CGHS. However, this was not done while capping the rate for the HRCT test.“We do rely on CGHS and AIIMS rates while reimbursing the cost of treatment, even if undertaken in a private facility by our employees. However, this is a pandemic, where the situation is different,” said Dr Naveen Chandra Prasad, director-in-chief, disease control, health department, Bihar.The health department claims the higher rates also account for other expenses and were in line with the limit fixed by other states.“We had taken into account the rates of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand that ranged between ₹2,000 and ₹3,000, while capping our rate for HRCT scan of thorax, depending on the quality of the machine. The rate includes the cost of PPE kit, sanitisation or GST, required if any,” Dr Prasad said.Though on the higher side compared to the rates at government hospitals, the capping has still managed to bring down the cost of the computed tomography scan, which was as high as ₹5,100 in some private laboratories in Patna before the order came into effect.In the meanwhile, the Covid crisis in the state has shown signs of easing a bit with the test positivity rate (TPR), which was at 16.1% on April 30, declining to 10.3% on May 9. The TPR measures the percentage of positive cases among all those tested for the disease on a given day.Bihar reported 10,174 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, taking the total number of cases to 601,650. Patna topped with 1,745 new cases, followed by Katihar 706, Gopalganj 541, East Champaran 478, Samastipur 463, Begusarai 435 and Vaishali 417 among others.In other measures to standardise the cost of treatment for Covid patients, the state government on May 5 fixed the rates for both AC and non-AC private ambulances in the state.Private ambulances now cannot charge more than ₹1,500 for a small non-AC vehicle up to 50km (including both sides), and ₹2,500 for bigger vehicles with AC for the same distance. Last year in August, the government also capped treatment rate for Covid-19 patients at private hospitals to a maximum of ₹18,000 per day for ICU patients with ventilator support for NABH (national accreditation board of hospitals) accredited hospitals and ₹15,000 for non-NABH accredited hospitals in Patna, while the rates were lesser for the remaining 37 districts of Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-rate-fixed-for-computed-tomography-scan-higher-than-aiims-cghs-101620704724371.html

11-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The fire this time around||There’s fire raging these days across the city. The gulmohar trees are in scarlet bloom. Their flowering tend to be unpredictable. Sometimes they’re just a few vines of blossom in the tree’s dense foliage, looking like a flash of lightning in the sky. And sometimes the whole tree becomes an entanglement of that red, as if a flame is leaping about uncontrollably.The first flowers start popping out in late April, and by May the gulmohar’s glow covers the city like a blush spreading on a shy man’s cheek. One of the best places to spot them is in... well, Gulmohar Park, the neighbourhood. Nehru Park, too, possesses a few gulmohars of the most brilliant red. The gulmohar aficionados will also like to drive through Shanti Path in the diplomatic enclave. And lest we forget, a handful of gorgeous gulmohars stand on the road between Nehru Place and Kailash Colony Metro station; the broad pavement is presently covered with fallen reds that the municipal staff gathers in the morning. (One wonders where these flowers end up—in the landfills of Ghazipur, where a part of the city’s trash is disposed off?)Since these are extraordinary times, with the city in lockdown, there is no going out for gulmohar-spotting. The best is to look out in your neighbourhood, and marvel at your luck if you are able to catch a glimpse of the flowery flames through a window or balcony. Like this third floor apartment in Hauz Khas village, into which a blossoming gulmohar branch is currently peeping in like a nosy neighbour. Nearby, a forestry area is speckled with stand-alone gulmohars, each separated from the other by neems, peepals, pilkhans, and bougainvillaeas. One dare not enter this wild jungle, but the fence running along the road, connecting Hauz Khas village to Aurobindo Market, has several good observation spots. From there, the gulmohars look like bonfires. This late afternoon, some of the red flowers are falling whole on the pavement. Each flower has five petals, and curiously enough one of them is always white with streaks of red. As you gaze at the petals, you’ll note that they carry many hues of red, almost amounting to orange at places.This is also the season of the blooming for amaltas. Outside a bungalow in Vasant Vihar’s Poorvi Marg, the branches of an amaltas are entangled within the branches of a gulmohar. You are left unsure where your true loyalties lie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-fire-this-time-around-101620687823796.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||1 held for duping people on pretext of remdesivir sale||A 53-year-old travel agent has been arrested for allegedly cheating several Covid patients and their families in Delhi and adjoining areas in the guise of selling remdesivir injections, the police said on Monday.Police said the suspect, identified as Anuj Kumar Anand, allegedly demanded between ₹25,000 and ₹50,000 for a vial of remdesivir and tricked victims into transferring either the full amount or half of it to secure the vial. “Not a single person was delivered the injection,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.“Anand’s cellphone details show that he had contacted more than 200 people who were seeking remdesivir injections for Covid patients. In just two days (April 26 and 27), victims deposited ₹3 lakh in his bank account. Several WhatsApp chats and audio conversations have been found in his mobile phone. He also threatened people who were asking for refunds,” said DCP Alphonse.With Anand’s arrest, four cheating cases registered at police stations in north, southeast, outer and northeast districts have been solved, police said, adding that there are many complaints pending against him at Faridabad and Gurugram as well. “We are trying to identify other victims who were duped by Anand. For that we are examining his bank statement and call details,” the DCP added.Also read | HC: Take steps to stop hoarding, black marketingPolice said that for the last two weeks, they were receiving information about a man who had been allegedly cheating people in the name of providing them remdesivir injections. Through technical surveillance, the suspect was identified and a decoy customer was used to strike a deal with him for obtaining a remdesivir injection. Accordingly, a raid was conducted and Anand was arrested on Saturday from Lajpat Nagar area, police said.During questioning, DCP Alphonse said, Anand disclosed that he worked as a travel agent on commission basis but was left without a livelihood due to the lockdown.On April 21, he visited a private hospital in south Delhi and noticed that there was an acute shortage of remdesivir injections as well as oxygen cylinders and people were ready to pay any amount to get them.“Anand planned to earn a quick buck by assuring people remdesivir injections and started sending messages out in various groups regarding the availability of vials for ₹25,000 each. People, desperate for the medication, started calling him and he made them deposit half the amount but never delivered as he did not have any,” the DCP said.In one case, Anand demanded ₹50,000 from a woman for delivering an injection for her father-in-law, a Covid patient undergoing treatment in a hospital in north Delhi. She paid ₹25,000 as advance but never got the injection, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/1-held-for-duping-people-on-pretext-of-remdesivir-sale-101620687583855.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||DMRC fined ₹4L for felling trees during Phase 4 work||The Delhi forest department has slapped a fine of ₹4.30 lakh on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for damaging and illegally cutting trees in a deemed forest area between Vikaspuri and Mukarba Chowk, a section of the upcoming Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor of Metro Phase 4, senior forest department officials said.Documents accessed by Hindustan Times show that the deputy conservator forests (west division) Navneet Srivastava, on April 19, issued the order imposing the fine on DMRC for offences such as cutting, damaging, pruning and concreting 27 fully grown trees between Vikaspuri and Mukarba Chowk.DMRC on Monday reiterated that no tree was damaged for construction on the said stretch and that no work has been going on there since August 25, 2020.“The officials from the west division inspected the site and reported illegal cutting, pruning, head backing, and damaging of trees by DMRC... After going through the facts of the case and as empowered under Section 21 of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (1994), I agree to compound the offence,” the order issued by Srivastava read.The tree varieties that have been impacted by the Metro construction include banyan, jungle jalebi, alstonia, siras, papri, kachnar and sheesham, said the forest department. The DCF (west) said that Delhi Metro has been fined ₹20,000 each for pruning four trees, ₹60,000 each for the cutting and removal of two trees and ₹10,000 per tree for concretising and damaging the roots of 21 trees.In an e-mail response to HT, DMRC said, “Work has been stopped in the forest area since August 25, 2020, as per the directions and orders issued by the DCF (west), forest department. DMRC is taking all necessary precautions to save the trees along the (track) alignment.” DMRC said 2,958 trees are proposed to be cut between Krishna Park and Mukarba Chowk for the construction of the corridor.While the forest department order states that the penalty amount needs to be deposited by the erring agency within a period of 30 days from the date of the order, the DMRC officials privy to the matter said that they have not received any communication from the forest department regarding the fine.“Since the lockdown started in Delhi immediately after the order imposing a penalty on DMRC was issued on April 19, no exchange from DMRC has come to our notice because our office is now functioning only on a need-to basis,” said a senior forest department official.A senior DMRC official said the body has followed all the necessary protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dmrc-fined-4l-for-felling-trees-during-phase-4-work-101620687040155.html

Police said, prima facie (at first sight), it appears that the woman was working alone and used a forged AIIMS identity card.Police said the CMO wrote to the central district police on May 2 after being informed that a “nurse from AIIMS” was getting critical patients admitted to the facility. The CMO, Gurpreet Singh, alleged that, on the night of May 2, junior resident doctors spotted the woman with a 66-year-old Covid-19 patient inside the hospital.“The woman was visiting the hospital regularly and she posed as a health worker in full PPE kit. She identified herself as Heena in her identity card and to our junior resident doctors. Our officers found her behaviour suspicious, and reported the matter to the police. A police team reached the spot and took her into custody. She was taking money to admit critical patients. Our CMO suspected that she may have been running this racket for quite some time and so wrote to the police,” said a hospital official, who asked not to be named.Delhi Police officers said they took the woman into custody, and her identity was later revealed as Uttarakhand resident Geeta Saroja. Police found two forged identity cards on her, both identifying her as Heena, one as a nurse from AIIMS and other as an NGO worker.An investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said, “She was taking money from critical patients who queue up outside the hospital. So far, it looks like she was working alone. But we are still probing her contacts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-poses-as-a-nurse-to-offer-hospital-beds-arrested-101620686525585.html

11-05-2021||Delhi||Jab supplies regulated by Centre, not firms: Manish Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre was regulating the vaccine orders placed by states to the two Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers — Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — and curtailing the doses given to each state.Sisodia was reacting to the BJP’s allegations that the Delhi government had only ordered 550,000 doses and did not plan the jabs drive properly.Addressing a press briefing on Monday, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for managing Covid-19, said the Delhi government in April wrote to the two vaccine makers SII and Bharat Biotech, seeking 6.7 million doses from each. He said instead of the manufacturers replying, it was the central government that wrote back, stating that Delhi was entitled to only 359,000 doses for the month of May.“When the Centre decided in April that state governments could directly approach the vaccine companies for getting the shots, Delhi government wrote a letter to acquire 1.34 crore vaccination doses for citizens in the 18-45 year age group. But instead of receiving the requested vaccines, Delhi government received a letter from the Centre stating that we would get just 3.59 lakh vaccines, of which 92,840 doses would be Covaxin and 267,690 doses would be Covishield,” he said.Also read | Covid-19: Capital’s positivity dips below crucial 20% levelDelhi for two days has warned of an impending vaccine shortage in the city and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, seeking the Centre’s help in procuring more vaccines.Vaccines for adults below the age of 45 need to be procured directly by the states and private hospitals, according to rules by the Union government, which said that its own vaccination campaign will apply only to those aged 45 and older. Vaccine makers will need to keep 50% of their monthly production for the Union government’s procurement, with states and private hospitals eligible for the rest.Sisodia’s statement came hours after BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra accused Kejriwal and the Delhi government of being “busy in advertising”, instead of pushing the vaccination programme in the city. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said the letters shown by Sisodia stated that the city administration was only “planning” to procure that many doses of vaccine and that the actual order was for far less.“The Delhi government’s letter to the manufacturers says it is planning to procure the doses which exposes Sisodia’s claim that his government had ordered for the vaccines. The truth is that they did not place an order for vaccines in time,” he said.Sisodia retaliated by accusing the BJP of “shamelessly lying”. “We do not understand the reason behind such lies because the Centre ultimately decides how many vaccines will be distributed to states, and then to the nations abroad. The papers from vaccine companies and the health ministry itself are proof that the central government has completely overlooked the crisis at hand, and instead exported vaccines to other countries. If 6.5 crore doses that were exported, had been administered to people of the country, so many lives could have been saved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jab-supplies-regulated-by-centre-not-firms-manish-sisodia-101620685532337.html

Officials at the three civic bodies — east, north, and south — have been requesting the Delhi government to turn their schools into vaccination centres so that more number of beneficiaries in this age group are covered.The Delhi government has approved converting 15 schools run by the north corporation, 11 of the south corporation, and seven of the east corporation into Covid-19 vaccination sites.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said four of the 15 centres started functioning on Monday. “The remaining 11 will start functioning on Tuesday. We have been requesting the Delhi government to start centres in each ward to ensure that young people do not have to travel to different parts of the city to get the shot, given the present situation,” he said.In east Delhi, four schools were converted into jab centres on Monday, while the other three will start functioning from Tuesday. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said, “We wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 6, asking for permission to set up centres in our schools. Now the government has allowed us to set up seven such centres,” he said.The south corporation on Monday started four of 11 centres. South civic body education committee chairperson Mukesh Suryan said, “The government will provide us with the vaccine. We will ensure all other support systems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/corporation-schools-in-capital-turn-vaccine-sites-for-18-44-age-group-101620685039984.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC to hear plea seeking to halt Vista construction||The Delhi high court will hear on Tuesday a plea seeking to halt the construction of the Central Vista amid the raging second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex for the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh asked senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the petitioner, to file an application for early hearing after he urgently mentioned the matter.Luthra told the bench that he was mentioning the matter as the Supreme Court on May 7 asked the petitioners to seek urgent hearing before the high court on May 10.Petitioners, Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian, had moved the apex court against the high court’s May 4 order adjourning their plea to May 17.The high court had adjourned the matter saying it wants to study the apex court’s January 5 judgment which gave a go ahead to the Central Vista project.In the appeal before the Supreme Court, the petitioners had contended that the project was not an essential activity and therefore, it can be put on hold.“Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,” Luthra had told the apex court.On Monday, he made the same argument before the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-to-hear-plea-seeking-to-halt-vista-construction-101620684770755.html

The court said the while the state reeled under the effect of the Kumbh Mela, the Purnagiri Mela took place attracting a crowd of 10,000 people.The court questioned the state for the confusion over the Char Dham yatra, asking whether the annual pilgrimage will be allowed to become a coronavirus hotbed.While the government says the yatra has been cancelled, the board managing the temples has issued the standard operating procedure for the yatra, it said.On the report filed by health secretary Amit Negi on strengthening medical facilities over the past few months, the HC said it was not enough to fight the second wave, let alone the third.Allow state to use O2 produced here: CourtThe high court directed the Centre to consider allowing the state to use medical oxygen generated in the state instead of sending part of it to other states. After hearing a plea claiming that the state has to send a part of the medical oxygen produced here to other states, the court maintained that oxygen should be sent to other states only when its oxygen requirement is met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/hc-raps-uttarakhand-for-organising-religious-events-amid-pandemic-101620682684306.html

Amarvir Singh, president of the hotel and restaurant association of Ludhiana, said that most of the eateries had zero business on Monday due to the curfew.“The hospitality industry accounts for just 3% of the industry sector in Ludhiana. While all other industries have been allowed 24x7 operations, we have been neglected. The district administration should allow us to at least run home-deliveries throughout the day.”He revealed that residents rarely order cooked food before 12pm as it is perishable and can’t be stored till night. Amarvir said that most eateries are reporting a rise in orders for fish dishes. “We got more than 100 orders for fish-based dishes but could not deliver it due to the 12pm curfew,” he said.Navjot Singh, the owner of Navjot Chicken, located near the inter-state bus terminal, said that they get the delivery of raw chicken by 9am and it takes almost two hours to cook the dishes, which leaves no time for delivery. “We got only three customers today and they too came around 11.45am. As we did not get any orders for home delivery, I distributed the cooked chicken among my relatives and friends,” he said, adding that he won’t be opening up his eatery till the administration allows home delivery services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noon-curfew-spoils-the-broth-for-eateries-101620679040720.html

Maddening crowds were witnessed in stores, especially those selling groceries, around 11am – one hour before the curfew was to kick in. The situation went out of control at noon, prompting panic-stricken shopkeepers to bring their shutters down to prevent more people from entering the shops. Some even closed their stores as early as 11.30. Massive traffic jams were witnessed across the congested roads of Chaura Bazar, Kesar Gunj Mandi, Saban Bazar, Kitab Bazaar, Ghumar Mandi, Field Ganj and Jawahar Nagar camp market. At Chaura Bazar and Nanu Halwai Chowk, commuters could be seen yelling at each other to clear the passage. The infuriated traders who were busy loading and unloading the goods in their vehicles complained that if the stress of Covid-19 was not enough, the awkward timing of curfew relaxation only added to their miseries.While commuters continued to remain stranded in the jam, there were no cops to streamline the traffic flow. Panic buying was witnessed at grocery shops with buyers scrambling for trolleys and essentials, and then standing in queues to pay the bill. “Is this how Covid can be curbed? I am scared of coming out now as the virus will spread fast in such a closed environment with so many people,” said Ankita, a college student. At one time, more than 50 buyers were present in a closed environment in a grocery-cum-departmental store in BRS Nagar. “On one hand gatherings are banned and on the other, shops are witnessing huge crowds due to the narrow relaxation window,” said Naresh, a trader. While grocery store owners made saw good sales, those dealing with cloth, utensils and kitchen appliances complained of low footfall. Representations of the various market associations also expressed their reservations over the move. “It is an absolutely bizarre decision to let everything open in the morning. The timing of curfew has done more harm than good. Though the markets began to open by 7am, the customers started to arrive at 10am. By 11am, there was utter chaos and shopkeepers began closing their shops. If in other districts shopkeepers have been allowed to open their establishments from 8am to 2pm, why can’t the same be implemented here. There were almost negligible sales at garment shops due to the odd timings,” said Sanjeev Choudhary, the owner of a garment shop and president of the Chaura Bazar Market Association.In Ghumar Mandi market, which is famous for garments, jewellery and utensils stores, the shops were decked up but there were hardly any customers.Pawan Kumar Batra, president of Ghumar Mandi market shopkeepers, requested the authorities to allow shops to be opened on alternate days. Darshan Kumar Sharma, a mechanic, also demanded a change in timing. “This relaxation will not work. It is absolutely ruining our business. Customers began arriving at 9am and no one came after 11am. And those getting their vehicles fixed also started panicking when the curfew timing was nearing,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/7hr-curfew-relaxation-spells-doom-as-ludhiana-residents-throng-roads-markets-101620678621229.html

11-05-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown extended in Chandigarh till May 18||With the Covid-19 pandemic showing no signs of slowing down, the UT administration on Monday extended the partial lockdown by another week. The administration had clamped seven-day partial lockdown on May 4, which was to end at 5am on May 11. But now, it will continue till 5 am on May 18. As such, non-essential shops will continue to remain closed. Night curfew, prohibiting public movement, will be implemented from 6pm to 5am. Day time movement is allowed, but the administration has advised residents to avoid non-essential travel. Also, in line with Haryana’s directions, UT has also curtailed gatherings at marriage functions. While earlier, 50 people were allowed, the number has been capped at 20. Besides, written permission from the deputy commissioner will be needed for the event. Even for funerals, the number has been reduced from 20 to 10, though no separate permission is required. The decisions were taken at the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “The current figures relating to the pandemic, including positivity rate, are dangerous. A 15-day continuous lockdown is what the health experts have suggested. So, we have extended the lockdown by one week. The results should be visible after two weeks are completed.”But, if the situation did not improve, Parida said, the administration will rethink its strategy.Panchkula shut, partial curfew in MohaliIn neighbouring Panchkula, there is a complete lockdown till May 17, during which public movement is allowed only with an e-pass.

But, all shops are allowed to remain open in villages. Weekend lockdown will continue, when only shops selling essentials will remain open. Four-wheelers can ferry only two people from the same house at a time, while only person should ride a two-wheeler.Unified command centre for tricityKeeping in view the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court for setting up a unified command centre for tricity, the administrator will be holding a meeting with the three chief secretaries on Tuesday. “We will be discussing tricity’s Covid management during the chief secretaries’ meeting called by the administrator. Improvement in coordination with regard to the lockdown, accessibility to hospitals, oxygen supply and other measures will be taken up,” said Parida. Badnore also directed top doctors to meet through video conference every day, where senior doctors from PGIMER should guide all concerned regarding new medications and up-to-date protocol for treatment of Covid patients. He also stressed that there should be an audit of each fatality, so to improve medical treatment and rectify lapses, if any.30 areas notified as restricted zonesTwo days after the UT administration declared 33 micro-containment zones, it added 30 more areas to the list on Monday.

Besides, 7,200 eggs were also destroyed. The approximate number of birds to be culled is 75,000. On Sunday, 19,200 birds were culled. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, had confirmed avian influenza in samples of birds sent from a poultry farm at Kila Raipur on May 7 prompting the administration to order culling of birds. The samples were collected after owner of Suba Singh Poultry Farm informed the administration about the mysterious death of 1,500 birds. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma has already declared one-kilometre radius area around the farm as infected zone and up to 10km as surveillance zone. He also constituted a nine-member committee to oversee the process and ensure that no bird, unprocessed poultry meat, eggs, feed or any other material was taken out from the poultry farm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12400-more-birds-culled-at-kila-raipur-poultry-farm-101620678081150.html
11-05-2021||Chandigarh||Turmoil in Punjab Cong: 3 ministers seek Sidhu’s scalp after his fresh salvo at Captain||The ruling Congress appears to be in turmoil in Punjab over the sacrilege and police firing cases with former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu again targeting chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday and three cabinet ministers demanding disciplinary action against the “dissident MLA” for his anti-party actions. While the Amritsar East MLA, who has been hitting out at Amarinder on a daily basis, accused the chief minister of “nefarious intentions”, five party leaders, including three cabinet ministers and two senior MPs, met here at jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s official residence and discussed the disenchantment in the party over the botched-up investigation in the politically sensitive case. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi and Gurpreet Singh Kangar were among the party leaders present at the minister’s residence. “There is widespread resentment among the party MLAs who are not sure how they will go and face the people in their constituencies if justice is not delivered in these cases,” Bittu told a private channel said after the meeting, demanding prompt action against the Badals. Bittu assails AmarinderAttacking the CM, Bittu said if he cannot do anything, he should give the home ministry to some other party MLA or member of his cabinet to ensure justice in the matter. “Our fight is not against any individual, but it is a question of our identity and existence. We are trying to pressure our government to get the new SIT to file the challan in the police firing cases in a month and ensure day-to-day hearing,” Bajwa said after the meeting.The chief minister’s camp tried to placate Randhawa, who had offered his resignation at a cabinet meeting two weeks ago over the special investigation fiasco. Randhawa and Channi, who has also been critical of the state government’s handling of the matter, were among half-a-dozen MLAs who met Sidhu and his close associate, Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh, in Panchkula last week. The meeting was seen as an attempt by the Captain’s detractors led by Sidhu to bring together the ministers and MLAs upset over the 2015 incident. One of the discontented ministers also called up the SC MLAs for a meeting here on Tuesday. “He asked me to come to Chandigarh to discuss issues related to the community,” said a party legislator who did not want to be named. Taking exception to Sidhu’s continued no-holds barred attacks, the chief minister’s camp has demanded strict disciplinary action against him. Cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot said the dissident MLA’s unmitigated onslaught on the CM was an act of gross indiscipline and an attempt to undermine the Congress government. Sidhu’s personal attack on Amarinder was an anti-party act, which called for immediate disciplinary action, they said in a statement. Open rebellion can trigger unrest: Capt camp“The open rebellion is damaging the interests of the Congress at a time when the state assembly elections are less than a year away,” they said. The ministers warned that the failure to take action against Sidhu now could trigger unrest in the party’s state unit, which would be fatal for the party, which has suffered major electoral blows in the recently concluded assembly polls in five states. The ministers appealed to the party’s central leadership to nip this insurgence in the bud. The demand for action came hours after Sidhu accused Amarinder of first attacking the high court and then accepting its orders from the backdoor to deflect people’s attention. “Nefarious intentions are evident. No high court stopped you in four-and-a-half years! When DGP/CPS appointments are set aside, orders are challenged in higher courts. Now, first you attack the high court, then from backdoor accept same orders to deflect people’s attention,” Sidhu posted on Twitter, sharing the video clip of the chief minister’s interview to a private channel in which he called the court order as “totally political” and “one sided”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/turmoil-in-punjab-cong-3-ministers-seek-sidhu-s-scalp-after-his-fresh-salvo-at-captain-101620677182198.html

Though, as a part of the nationwide programme, Jammu and Kashmir also kick started the vaccination drive for optics at Srinagar and Jammu, it has not gained the desired momentum since then. A senior health official said, “Doses for the 18-45 age group haven’t arrived in sufficient quantity and as a result, the vaccination drive is moving at a snail’s pace.” The J&K had ordered 1.24 crore doses for the age group but given just 1.5 lakh — 75,000 for Kashmir and as many for Jammu. “Inadequate amount of doses were given to us and hence the vaccination has been slow for this age group. As and when the Centre provides us more stocks, the 18-45 age group will be vaccinated accordingly,” said the official. He, however, informed that the vaccination of people above 45 years of age was going on without any hiccups. The Jammu and Kashmir had ordered 1.24 crore Covid vaccines to cover the entire 18-45 age group. It may be stated here that on April 30, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had stated that the inoculation will not begin on May 1 for the age group as stocks were awaited. However, on May 1, the government all of a sudden came up with a brief statement with some pictures of the youngsters showing them getting the first jab in Jammu and Srinagar. “It was purely an exercise for optics,” said another health official, adding that they didn’t have sufficient stocks with them to inoculate the age group. The government had also requested those falling in the age group not to crowd vaccination centres without booking slots. The government has asked the age-group to register themselves on COWIN App for getting first jab. On Monday, a couple of slots were opened in Jammu and Srinagar. It may be stated here that the L-G Manoj Sinha announced free vaccination to the 18-45 age group as well in Jammu and Kashmir. “Covaxin will be administered to this age group free of cost. It will be by prior registration and prior appointment only,” he had said. A youngster, Shruti, 21, said, “I am trying to get myself registered on the COWIN, but the portal is not being opened. What sort of arrangement this government has made amid this raging pandemic?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/18-vaccination-drive-moves-at-snail-s-pace-as-j-k-awaits-stocks-101620676941063.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Capital’s positivity dips below crucial 20% level||There were 12,651 new cases of Covid-19 reported in Delhi on Monday, the lowest since April 12, and the test positivity rate dipped below 20% for the first time since April 14 as more indications emerged of the Capital having been able to arrest to some degree the fourth wave of the coronavirus outbreak.While the numbers reported in the government’s Covid bulletin corresponded to the typically fewer tests carried out on a Sunday, these are still lower than the numbers for the last three Sundays, when the city reported 23,582 (May 3), 20,201 (April 26) and 23,686 (April 19) cases.More importantly, the fall in the positivity rate – the proportion of samples turning up a positive result – reinforced the signal, which was also supported anecdotally by several doctors who said they now have some room to let in new patients to their otherwise overburdened health care facilities.At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20, soon after the chief minister expanded the night and weekend curfew protocols into a lockdown. That protocol has now been renewed several times, and will stay at least till May 17 in order to further flatten the curve.The Capital’s active case load too has come down from 99,752 recorded on April 28 to 85,258 on Monday, while the number of available hospital beds has nearly doubled from 1,683 to 3,229 in this period, the Delhi government’s health bulletin.Also read | Delhi records 12,651 fresh Covid-19 cases, 319 deaths; positivity rate dipsThe test positivity rate reached a peak of 36.2% on April 22, and stayed above 30% for eight more days before starting to decline. In Monday’s bulletin, it dipped below the 20% mark for the first time in over three weeks. To be sure, this number needs to come down below 5% for the outbreak to be considered under control, according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.Experts said the surge in cases was a stark reminder of why India cannot afford to be careless in its preparations. “The number of cases being reported has come down but the hospitals and ICUs are still full. To prevent another surge like this, we need to look at why it happened. It happened because of the absolute complacency -- people not wearing masks, having parties and weddings, travelling and thinking that Covid is in Maharashtra but Delhi is free of it.“The second reason is the natural course of a viral disease -- Covid-19 resurges every 50 to 100 days or so. Third, there were variants of concern causing infections,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.According to staff in two hospitals, the rush of patients seen towards the end of April appears to have abated, and improvements in the supply of medical oxygen has alleviated a crisis that at one point led to repeated distress calls.“We have now set up an oxygen generation plant that augments our daily requirement. We are better off now and are able to admit more patients. We have 110 oxygen-dependent patients at the moment against our listed capacity of 76 oxygen beds,” said Dr Sunil Kohli, head of the department of medicine at Hakeem Abdul Hameed Centenary Hospital. Several beds were not being utilised as the supply of oxygen was uncertain last week.Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj Hospital said, “Now that the supply of oxygen has stabilised we have increased the number of beds in our hospital from 120 to 150 and the number of ICU beds have been increased from 53 to 63 now.”In all, the city has recorded 1,336,218 cases and 19,663 deaths, of which 319 took place on Sunday.This is the fourth distinct wave of cases in the Capital -- at the peak of the first, there were 84 deaths recorded in a day on average in mid-June. In the second wave, which peaked in early October, 42 people died in a day.Watch | Oxygen Express with highest volume of LMO leaves from Hapa to Delhi﻿A third surge occurred after Diwali, claiming the lives of 116 people on average a day in the third week of November.Till now, in the fourth wave, the most number of deaths recorded as an average of seven days is at 398, which was recorded on May 3.On Sunday, Kejriwal announced the extension of the lockdown and said the curbs will be stricter, with the Delhi Metro services halted and people no longer allowed to hold wedding ceremonies in public places.“We must prepare for the third wave. In this wave, Delhi recorded a maximum of 28,000 cases in a day. The whole infrastructure was under pressure after this. The scale at which we are creating infrastructure, we will be able to deal even if 30,000 daily cases are reported in next wave,” Kejriwal told reporters on Monday.Experts now believe the city will need to accelerate the vaccination campaign in order to avoid a crisis as the one seen in recent weeks if it wants to allow businesses, offices and shops to reopen. “Along with the lockdown we need to increase vaccination. The vaccination drive started with a bang but has slowed down for the want of doses. Unless we vaccinate a large number of people transmission will not stop in the long run,” said Dr Khilnani.The city has raised an alarm about the availability of its vaccine stocks, with the process becoming shrouded in uncertainty since the Union government stepped away from a part of the process, leaving states and private hospitals to negotiate with manufacturers directly.“There is only one day of Covaxin left in Delhi and only three to four days of Covishield. We need vaccines at the earliest,” Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-capital-s-positivity-dips-below-crucial-20-level-101620676268609.html
11-05-2021||Chandigarh||56 people succumb to virus, 3,614 more test positive in J&K||As many as 56 people lost their lives to Covid-19 and 3,614 fresh infections were reported in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, taking the overall death toll to 2,782 and total cases to over 2.2 lakh.So far, 500 people have died of the disease this month in the UT, making it the highest monthly death toll since the pandemic began in March last year. In September last year when the first wave had peaked, as many as 478 persons had lost their lives to the virus. Of the 56 deaths in the UT, 39 were reported in Jammu division and 17 in Kashmir. The month of April so far has recorded the highest monthly case tally of 45,123 infections besides 289 deaths this year as against 4,519 cases and 37 deaths in March. Of the new cases, 2,118 are from Kashmir while 1,496 are from Jammu, besides 75 travellers.“Wearing masks below the chin doesn’t serve its purpose, venturing out unnecessarily is affecting the management and containment of virus. The public needs to understand that efforts are being made to break the chain of transmission of coronavirus and there is no need to create panic,” said Dr Khurshid Ahmad Bhat, consultant, endocrinologist at Super Speciality Hospital in Srinagar. “More and more people should come forward to get vaccinated. Besides, repeated testing after an asymptomatic person has recovered is also not required,” he added. Officials said with 701 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 658 in Jammu district, 343 in Budgam, 254 in Kulgam and 187 in Kupwara.The number of active cases has reached 49,951, officials said. Most of these cases have been added after February 9 when the UT had the lowest active case tally of 593.Dr Khurshid cautioned that venturing out unnecessarily will assist the spread of virus. “During the first wave of Covid, there was fear among people and they avoided going out which is why the cases were less. But now people have been moving out freely without fear or concern of getting infected which has resulted in increased number of cases, morbidity and deaths,” he added. Nearly 2,855 patients recovered on Monday, including 1,785 from Kashmir and 1,070 from Jammu.As many as 1,67,813 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 76.08% against 98% in the first fortnight of February.

11-05-2021||Chandigarh||3 govt docs quit job to join pvt hospitals in two weeks||At least three specialist doctors of Punjab health department who were deputed at Covid care wards quit the government service in the past fortnight to join as private healthcare facilities. This has given way to debate within the medical fraternity on the ethical side of such decisions at a time when their services were required more than ever before. Two of the doctors were posted at Bathinda civil hospital and temporarily attached with the Covid care wards keeping in view the increasing number of serious Covid-19 patients. The third doctor belongs to Muktsar district and was posted as a specialist (medicine) at Gidderbaha civil hospital. According to a senior health department official, one specialist doctor of Bathinda civil hospital, who was a Doctor of Medicine (MD), quit the government job and joined a private hospital of his relatives that offers treatment for Covid patients. Having served for two-and-half years in the department, he was serving the probation period, the official said. The second case, a lady doctor, also posted at Bathinda civil hospital, who was also a specialist in medicine, joined a private hospital providing Covid care, disclosed a senior district health functionary. The medico who was posted at Gidderbaha also joined a prominent private hospital providing Covid care. Two of three anesthesia specialists posted in Fatehgarh Sahib, who were also attached with Rajindra Medical College at Patiala, joined work at the health facilities for critical Covid patients after a delay of a week that too after the intervention of the senior officers, it is learnt. Third one is yet to report at the medical college, a senior officer from Patiala said. Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Tejwant Dhillon said the doctors cited personal reasons behind the resignations. “We tried to persuade them but they didn’t budge. While one has deposited his one-month salary advance, the lady doctor is yet to clear her dues,” he said. A senior government functionary of the health department, requesting anonymity, said, “Initially it was said that the pressure of dealing with the Covid patients made these doctors to resign but now we have learnt that they have joined private hospitals treating patients infected with the virus.” Meanwhile, the medical fraternity is raising questions over the resignations of the doctors when society needed them the most. Punjab Civil Medical Services (PCMS) association president Dr Gagandeep Singh said, “To be in government service or not is a personal right of a doctor but leaving the job at this hour is something unethical.” President of Punjab Rural Medical Services Association Dr Aslum Parvez said, “If any doctor is under stress due to Covid duties, he or she has so many other ways to address their problems, including getting psychiatric consultations or psychological evaluation. But if a government doctor leaves the job in lure of private practice during the pandemic, a criminal case should be registered against him or her under the Pandemic Act.” Health minister Balbir Sidhu said the department was aware of the stress or the other issues the staff was facing. “But it’s the time to show the human as well as the national character. It’s a fact that private hospitals pay more money to specialists but it’s the time to rise to the occasion. Doctors should lead by example,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-govt-docs-quit-job-to-join-pvt-hospitals-in-two-weeks-101620676162298.html

Acting on the HC orders, the state government constituted the new three-member SIT headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav, who will be assisted by Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and Faridkot range DIG Surjit Singh.The new SIT has been directed to complete the investigation within six months.An official, who is part of the government’s legal team, said that the Yadav-led SIT needs to find something beyond call records to prove the conspiracy theory. “Kunwar Vijay’s team had mainly relied upon the records of telephone calls to prove this was a conspiracy hatched by the cops and politicians, but there is not one substantiate evidence to prove the nature of conversation on record. So, the new SIT needs to look into other angles to back this theory as right now evidence only limits to cops being present on the spot,” the official said.To claim conspiracy between then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA and then senior police officers, Kunwar Vijay relied upon call records exchanged between them on October 14, 2015. His SIT named former SAD MLA Mantar Singh Brar as accused claiming it was probing the contents of 157 calls he exchanged with the chief minister’s office (CMO), then DGP office, some ministers and local administration officials on the night before the firing took place.However, the high court had stated that the SIT had claimed that then CM Badal talked through the phones of his principal secretary and OSD. “However, none of their versions have been taken on record by the SIT to substantiate the nature of conversation. No other witness is stated to have even remotely suggested that then CM conspired to kill the protestors by police firing,” the court had said.“Mere factum of a CM talking to the district administration or DGP in a situation where the law and order is disturbed, in itself, would not be sufficient to infer his conspiracy to kill or injure anybody through firing by the police upon the protestors, unless there is some other material collected by the investigating officer to establish a prior meeting of minds for conspiracy and then directly linking the CM to such conspiracy,” the court had added.Role of protesters to be looked into The new SIT will investigate the role of the protesters as the high court has observed that police firing was not “unprovoked”. Sources said that the probe team will also investigate the role of Sikh preachers who were declared “innocent” by Kunwar Vijay’s SIT.Kunwar Vijay’s team had declared Sikh preachers Bhai Panthpreet Singh, Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, Amrik Singh Ajnala, Harjinder Singh Manjhi, Giani Kewal Singh, and 18 others as innocent in the Kotkapura violence case registered in 2015 claiming they were framed by cops. On October 14, 2015, police registered an FIR against 15 Sikh preachers and unknown persons at Kotkapura city police station for allegedly instigating the protesters to attack the police with sharp-edged weapons and opening fire on cops.The high court said the magistrate present on the spot had assessed the situation and granted permission to use tear gas in the first instance, lathi charge thereafter, and the gun firing at the third stage. “Before that, as per records, the protestors were recorded on video to have chased and attacked the police, even with swords. Therefore, the conclusion that the protestors were sitting peacefully when the police started firing and also, the conclusion that firing by the police was unprovoked is against the record even on this count,” the HC had said.A total of 77 medico-legal reports (MLRs) of policemen who were injured in the firing incident are on the record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kotkapura-firing-tough-task-ahead-for-new-probe-team-101620675804064.html

However, the worries about our children increase anxiety because we spend the nights at home. Every day that a doctor and other health staff return home after work, there is high risk of them carrying the virus. Though I have got a vaccine shot, my young daughter is not entirely safe till she gets vaccinated too. The government should think about our families,” said a senior government doctor not wanting to be named.Dr Amandeep Aggarwal, executive member of Indian Medical Association’s Sangrur chapter, said risking their own health and lives, all health workers are doing their best to treat Covid patients in these difficult times, but their families are exposed to threat too.“The government must make necessary arrangements for taking responsibility for the best treatment of doctors and their family members. It’s unfortunate that even a fully equipped hospital per district hasn’t been reserved for doctors and their families. The government has not even offered priority vaccination to the family members of health workers,” added Dr Aggarwal.Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said that the concerns of doctors and other staff will be taken up with the state government to address their demand. However, vaccines for the 18-plus population will be available in a short period, he assured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doctors-on-covid-duty-seek-vaccine-for-children-on-priority-101620675800738.html

Ramneek hails from Patiala and has served in many sensitive places, including Kashmir.It was after the appeal of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh that the army decided to join the administration in the fight against the virus.Patiala Development Authority chief administrator Surbhi Malik, who is the coordinator between the army and the hospital authorities, said the forces will run a facility independently at Rajindra Hospital. “This initiative will further boost the Covid treatment facilities at Rajindra Hospital, which is catering to a huge population of the state,” she said.The army is already deployed at the hospital to handle the bodies of Covid victims.Meanwhile, the Jalandhar police commissionerate has opened its hospital to civilians to ensure vaccination of all citizens against Covid-19. “Due to a deadlier second pandemic wave, it is imperative that all eligible citizens be inoculated, so the police hospital has opened doors to the public for the same,” said police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar. He added that till now 3,168 people have been vaccinated at the police hospital out of which 789 were cops and 2,236 were civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/army-to-run-covid-facility-for-civilians-at-patiala-hospital-101620675740851.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||Internal, entrance exam surveys: FYJC aspirants remain confused||The state education department’s move to conduct surveys asking students and schools for feasibility of internal assessments and entrance exams for Class 10, and first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions has created confusion in the absence of clear guidelines from the department. More than two weeks after the Maharashtra government declared the cancellation of SSC (Class 10) exams in the state, the education department on May 9 asked schools to fill out a survey form indicating whether or not marking students on internal assessments will be feasible. The department has also sent out another survey form asking for feedback on the conduct of entrance exams for FYJC, a plan that it has been mulling over the past few days after receiving suggestions to that effect.More than 83% schools are prepared for internal assessments, while over 66% students are ready for entrance tests, said an official So far, the education department has got responses from over 19,000 schools and more than 2.73 lakh students and the last date to submit is May 11.Schools said that while they have been asked to fill out the forms indicating their preparedness, it has led to further panic among students as they do not know what decision will be ultimately taken for marking and admissions to junior colleges. “The government cannot ask students who have studied for an entire year for their boards if they can give an entrance exam now for admissions to colleges. Students are not prepared for it and even if they agree to undergo these exams, there is a lot of uncertainty around what their syllabus will be and how they will be conducted. The government should first come up with a decision basis its consultations with stakeholders such as schools, experts and students, instead of creating further confusion,” said the principal of a suburban school.Officials at the education department claimed that a majority of students and schools have said that such a format is feasible.Many however questioned the survey methodology and said its results cannot be trusted. “It is an open Google form which anyone can fill and one has no idea whether the people filling it are from schools,” said a teacher. Meanwhile, the BMC education committee in its meeting held on Monday discussed the need to stay prepared for vaccinating students as and when guidelines with regards to come from the Centre and state. “We’ll also have to ensure that all teachers and staff are vaccinated in coming days,” said Sainath Durge, member of BMC education committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/internal-entrance-exam-surveys-fyjc-aspirants-remain-confused-101620675500770.html

Bajwa said he has been consistently raising the issue of the incompetence of the AG with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and it is essential to remove the albatross from around the government’s neck by showing Nanda the door. “Nanda has continuously been hiring special counsels from New Delhi at high costs to burden the public exchequer. The continued failures in important cases have led to public questioning his competence for the job,” he said in a statement, reiterating his demand for Nanda’s removal. The MP said the son of Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who was killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan in 2015, has declared that he will not cooperate with the new SIT, especially as the AG failed in his duty to competently argue the case in the high court. He said the fact that families of victims have started speaking out against the AG and have begun to refuse to help the SIT shows the serious lack of faith the citizens have in the AG in this most important fight for justice. “We have reached at a crossroads, both in the state and the party. The AG must be removed if the government wishes to truly rebuild bridges with the public. Anything less would also be breaking the solemn promise of the INC in bringing the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/partap-bajwa-demands-removal-of-ag-nanda-101620675441284.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbaiites say they’re being sent back sans shot, portal shows they got 1st dose||In the midst of vaccine shortage, there’s a new hassle. Potential beneficiaries with appointments are being sent back home without jabs, only to receive auto-generated messages from the centralised Co-WIN portal about completion of vaccination, leading to panic and confusion among citizens. Take for instance, Sunita Madhur, 37, who, after trying for two days finally got a slot for vaccination at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre on May 9. She reached the centre by 4pm, and after waiting in the queue for an hour was informed that vials for those above the age of 18 years got over. She, along with many others in the same age category, were asked to try again the next day and sent back home. But on reaching her Parel home, she got a message stating completion of her first Covishield shot The message also contained a link through which she could get the final vaccination certificate.“There is so much harassment. We are unnecessarily exposing ourselves to contracting the virus at overcrowded centres just to be sent back home. Also, due to this technical glitch, I can’t even book another slot,” she said. In another incident, S Ramanathan, 61, went to Cama Hospital on May 9 to take his second shot of Covishield. After waiting for three hours, around 3.15pm in the afternoon, he couldn’t get the shot as the vials got over. But in the evening, he got a similar message about completion of the second dose. Later, when he logged into the Co-WIN portal, it showed that he had completed both the shots. “I was extremely confused and didn’t know what to do. I called BMC’s helpline number for guidance but didn’t get much help. Yesterday, I visited the hospital again and explained the technical glitch. Thankfully, they understood and gave the shot,” he said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has informed the central health department about the technical glitch. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said such a technical glitch has been observed in a few cases. “It is not in our hands as the error is in Co-WIN, so we have informed the central government about it. People who are witnessing such issues should visit the centres again immediately and explain the issue.” People across the state are experiencing a similar situation. Shruti Nair, 33, a resident of Pune went to get her first shot at rural Kanhe Phata hospital around 9.30am on May 5. Later, those public above 18 years were referred to another vaccination centre. But still didn’t get the shot. However, like many others, she also received a message of completion of the first dose. Now, to get the vaccine, she had to re-register on the Co-WIN portal again with a different number and identify proof. “When I tried to book the slot again, I was shown June 2 as my next appointment date for my second shot. I didn’t have any other option but to create a new profile. But I will wait until the state has enough vials, as I don’t want to go through the same harassment,” she said. Despite repeated attempts, Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, did not respond to calls or messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiites-say-they-re-being-sent-back-sans-shot-portal-shows-they-got-1st-dose-101620675321357.html

Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that is found in immunodeficient patients.“In a few districts, patients suffering with Covid-19 and high diabetes have been found infected with a fungal infection called mucormycosis. Taking a serious cognisance of it, the state government has decided to provide free treatment to those infected with the disease under MJPJAY,” Tope told reporters in Jalna on Monday. “There is no need to panic as patients will have to keep diabetes under control by means of proper diet, regular exercise and advice from the doctors,” he added.He said the state has also decided to create public awareness drive about the disease. “A delay in its treatment results in respiratory problems. It is also found to have an adverse effect on the brain and eyes. Its early diagnosis is necessary, and hence a public awareness drive will be undertaken,” Tope said.MJPJAY facilitates cashless treatment of needy patients at government-empanelled hospitals for 1,100 diseases and surgeries . The state also made Covid-19 treatment free under the scheme. Transfers put on hold till June 30The state government on Monday decided to hold the transfers of all its employees till June 30 amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. “Considering the rise in cases, no transfer, be it regular or those in exceptional cases, of the officials and employees will be made till June 30.

11-05-2021||Mumbai||₹1,100-crore Mission Oxygen to add 1,000 MT in six months||To prepare for the third wave and take the state to self-sustainability in terms of oxygen supply for medical purposes, the Maharashtra government has planned a ₹1,100-crore Mission Oxygen. It is expected to get a cabinet nod this week.Under the plan, the state has set a target of taking the daily generation of oxygen to 2,300 metric tonnes (MT) in the next six months, and to extend it to 3,000 MT in two years. It is also considering an option to invest in oxygen plants, instead of depending entirely on private sector. The state’s current requirement of oxygen is 1,600 MT daily. Maharashtra has a local production of 1,295 MT a day, and gets around 400-500 MT by way of allocation from the Central government from other states. Although the state has been able to fulfil its current demand for Covid-19 patients, it has chalked out a plan in anticipation of the third wave. Its Mission Oxygen will have short- and long-term plans, with the first phase of addition of 500 MT to be achieved in next three months and additional another 500 MT in six months as its short-term goal. Currently, a majority of plants are owned by private sector, but now the state wants to invest in plants to build its capacity at the earliest. “38 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants have already started generating 53 MT a day, while work orders to set up 240 such plants with a generation capacity of 240 MT a day have already been issued. The daily oxygen generation capacity of these plants vary from 0.5 to 5 MT and cost ₹20 lakh and above. Similarly, we are planning air separation units (ASUs), which take some time for installation across the state. Besides it, we are planning to utilise the existing capacity of 600 MT of generation plants in gaseous form, by providing compression and bottling facilities to them. This would help take the generation to 2,300 MT in six months,” said an official from Mantralaya. The official, who does not wish to be quoted as the proposal is yet to be formally approved by the cabinet, said that some of the liquid medical oxygen plants are expected to be installed by private players. He said the programme also includes capacity building by private sector to add to their current generation of oxygen.The official said the state government is also augmenting its storage capacity to more than 10,000 MT by installing tanks at district and divisional levels. “Currently, we have been consuming the stock we get on daily basis, without having any buffer stock. It is not an ideal situation during the time of a pandemic. We waste hours filing the oxygen from steel plants in other states and then its transportation. By creating storage capacity of over 11,000 MT, we will be in position to stock the oxygen to last for at least for seven days,” the official said. The state cabinet is expected to give its formal nod to the ₹1,100-crore programme in its meeting this week. By implementing the programme, the state government wants to end its dependence on Central government for additional oxygen for Covid patients. “Though the Centre has been allocating 400-500 MT in addition to our domestic consumption of 1,295 MT, the Central government may ask Maharashtra to supply oxygen to other states from domestic consumption. We have been asked to supply 11 MT from generation in Kolhapur to Goa, when we have been facing shortage locally. Besides its allocation of 60 MT from Bellary in Karnataka was blocked leading to shortfall in the supply. By ramping up our own capacity through Mission Oxygen, we want be self-reliant in the next six months,” said another official.Meanwhile, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), India’s premier container port, successfully executed the handling of four containers carrying 80 MT medical oxygen in cryogenic state in the vessel MV. GSF GISELLE of AXS service. The medical oxygen containers were sent by United Arab Emirates.MV. GSF GISELLE, carrying the containers reached JNPT on Monday, after departing from Jebel Ali, on the southern outskirts of Dubai on May 5.

Sources from various airlines said that as pilots and cabin crew were not vaccinated on a priority basis, they are contracting Covid-19. Sources in Air India said in Mumbai and Delhi alone, six senior pilots are in intensive care units (ICU) fighting the virus. A senior Air India pilot said, “At least six of our pilots are critical and many are getting treated for Covid-19. We recently lost our fellow pilot to the virus, and this has brought fear among the pilots and their families.”Meanwhile, international carriers Etihad and Singapore Airlines vaccinated all their pilots and cabin crew in February. In March, Qatar Airways operated the world’s first fully vaccinated flight with all 188 passengers, two pilots and 18 cabin crew having received the vaccine. The airline has been advertising the same in order to assure safety to its customers.Blaming the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) for not making it mandatory for airlines in India to vaccinate their pilots on priority, pilots across the airlines said the situation of the crew is currently grim because they are not being vaccinated on time.“Crew across airlines are either home quarantined or hospitalised. These include the ones in critical condition too. We operated flights with life-saving drugs and cargo materials throughout the pandemic only to see our colleagues lose their battle to Covid-19,” said a senior private airline pilot, adding that they are facing the brunt due to a delayed action by authorities. While MoCA had not responded on the matter till the time of going to press , an Air India spokesperson said, “The vaccination programme is charted out after an elaborate study carried out by the government in the best interest of all. Air India is following all the guidelines in this regard and is determined to stand by its employees during this crisis. We have mobilised all resources to counter the crisis. A fully 24-hour Covid assistance cell manned by medical department has been set up to cater to the needs of the affected. A network-wide vaccination plan was in place and eligible employees were being vaccinated. The moment government announced vaccination for citizens from 18 years, Air India rolled out a schedule with a deadline to vaccinate every employee by May end.”MoCA had on May 6 issued guidelines to ensure vaccination of all stakeholders (airline crew, ground staff and air traffic controllers) after civil aviation secretary TK Pandey wrote to states to accord priority status to vaccination in the first week of May. While private airlines have begun vaccination drives, Air India is expected to commence drives from May 15. However, it seems that the airline is facing issues for arranging the drive, at least in Delhi. An internal message sourced from Air India on Monday read, “The proposed vaccination camp at GSD complex IGI (Indira Gandhi International Airport) on 11.05.2021 and 12.05.2021 stands cancelled because govt authorities have expressed inability to hold these camps due to non- availability of vaccines. Fresh dates will be notified once we get re-confirmation from govt authorities (sic).”The guidelines issued by MoCA advised airport operators to establish dedicated vaccination facilities at their respective airports to facilitate expeditious vaccination for aviation personnel. They came in days after pilots of Air India, earlier this week, threatened to stop work if the airline failed to set up vaccination camps across the country for its flying crew.“We’ve been writing to MoCA and our management to vaccinate the crew on priority since long. If our crew would’ve been fully vaccinated by February, the situation would have been much better,” the senior pilot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aviation-ministry-should-vaccinate-crew-on-priority-basis-say-pilots-101620675080107.html

The trader lodged the complaint in February after his order for 5,000 A+ quality Nitrile gloves, for which he had made the payment, did not reach him though the applicant had showed him documents pertaining to the dispatch. Though the applicant claimed that he was cheated by another supplier, the court held that as he portrayed himself to be the seller and had issued fake documents of the delivery of the gloves, he could not be granted anticipatory bail. A single bench of justice Prakash Naik, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Saiyed Faiz Hasan, was informed by advocate Shahid Pathan that after the complainant had placed the order for gloves with his client in January, Hasan had contacted another supplier of the gloves at Greater Noida who agreed to supply the order. Hasan then issued the invoices, e-way bills and LR copy (lorry receipt) to the complainant, based on which he remitted ₹17.6 lakh to the accused. Pathan informed the court that Hasan had transferred the complainant’s payment to Shoeb Khan and Atif of Sabri Enterprises, and they had issued the tax invoice and railway transport bill with the railway parcel booking services on January 14. However, after the goods did not reach Mumbai on January 16, the complainant inquired with the railways and found that the documents were forged. Pathan submitted that his client was willing to cooperate with the investigation and was not the main perpetrator. However, the complainant’s advocate and the state opposed the anticipatory bail application, stating that Hasan was not traceable at his office and residence addresses. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “There is every likelihood that the applicant and Shoeb Khan and Atif acted in connivance to deceive the complainant.” HC held that the transaction appeared to be suspicious and as Hasan was not agreeable to pay the complainant over ₹20 lakh (the money paid for the gloves and the expenses incurred for the case), his application was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-pre-arrest-bail-to-mumbai-man-for-failing-to-supply-17-6-l-gloves-to-trader-101620675020062.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||How Mumbai NGOs are helping spread the vaccine safety net||As the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has made it compulsory for citizens across all age groups to have a prior online appointment for vaccination, several non-government organisations (NGO) and corporators have stepped forward to help slum dwellers who have no access to smartphones and internet or don’t know how to use the booking app or portal. The BMC, on May 6, citing overcrowding at several vaccination centres across the city, suspended the walk-in vaccination drive, and made it mandatory for citizens to register and book an appointment to take the jab. This came in the backdrop of a stampede-like situation reported at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo vaccination centre. Starting May 7, the BMC has been allowing only those with online appointments for vaccination, which has added to the struggle of senior citizens and those with no access to the internet. Sachin Nachnekar from NGO YUVA, said, “The vaccine help desks in 12 slums of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have reached out to 860+ people and helped 260+ people on board the Co-WIN platform since April 29. In Mumbai, we have set up help desks in areas such as Dahisar, Kandivli, Malad and Jogeshwari with 116 volunteers helping citizens.”Maharashtra Peco Net – a group of NGOs, citizen volunteers, corporate and government bodies – have reached out to around 1.1 million citizens in the state and assisted around 77,902 citizens get vaccinated by setting up 51 vaccination help desks. Poornima Nair, director-health & disability from NGO Apnalaya, said, “We are training around 20 volunteers who will tour Shivaji Nagar in Govandi, spread awareness about Covid-19 vaccines, manage misinformation of vaccines and lastly helping citizens register and book online slots. We are operating door-to-door and will cover a population of 52,000-55,000 citizens.” Another NGO Alert Citizen Forum is also helping many get vaccinated by helping them book a slot online. Several corporators across the city too have lent a helping hand to senior citizens and those who are not tech-savvy. Corporators across party lines are opening up tele-guidance and setting up help desks in their wards. Abhishek Ghosalkar, former corporator from Dahisar, said, “I have formed a team of 10 youngsters who are available in my party office for four hours. In these four hours, we take requests from senior citizens or slum dwellers. Later, when the slots are open, we book slots for them. We help around 40 to 50 citizens in the 45+ age group daily… Earlier, we were arranging buses, but citizens did not show up for vaccination, and now citizens want to get vaccinated, but we are not able to ensure a slot to everyone. However, in the coming days, as more stock arrives, I will increase the number of volunteers to ensure more citizens get the benefit.” As per the 2011 census, of the 12.4 million population in the city, over 4 million lives in slums and not everyone has access to smartphones. Raees Shaikh, Samajwadi Party corporator from Mumbai Central, said, “Aadhaar card is not enough to get the jab. Rather, a car and high-speed internet are also a big necessity. It can’t get more elitist than this. When we talk about online registration and appointments, we are forgetting senior citizens, those who do not own a smartphone, and those residing in slums.” Sandeep Patel, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator from Goregaon, said, “Earlier, when walk-in vaccination was allowed, we used to ensure that senior citizens and every citizen who does not know how to go online and register gets vaccinated. We had set up a help desk to register citizens outside the vaccination centre in my ward. But today, nothing is in our hands and the complete system is online.” Patel said, “I am getting calls from citizens in my ward that many from outside the ward are coming to the centres near their houses and are getting vaccinated. This is injustice to locals. We will have to allow walk-ins.” On Monday, a BJP delegation led by leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar met municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal to raise the issues of citizens. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, which covers Dharavi, said, “We are taking help from NGOs and elected representatives for vaccination of citizens in Dharavi. Earlier, we organised buses for citizens to travel till vaccination centres, but now we are having a dedicated vaccination centre in Dharavi. NGOs are helping citizens complete the online registration.” Prithviraj Chauhan, assistant municipal commissioner covering Chembur, said, “We are having citizen desks at ward offices and even vaccination centres are guiding citizens on how to book online. It is also expected that every house has at least one person who is tech-savvy. But all this will change once we have more vaccine doses and walk-ins will be allowed.” On Monday, 31,043 citizens were vaccinated in the city, of which 4,837 were between the ages of 18 and 44, 11,047 in the 45-59 age group, 10,591 were senior citizens and the rest were healthcare and frontline workers. The BMC said on Tuesday 16 additional vaccination centres will be made operational in the city from the 190 centres, as of Monday. The BMC has stock of around 100,000 vaccine does of which around 20,000 are Covaxin and the remaining are Covishield. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The vaccination drive will continue on Tuesday and all those given appointments will be accommodated.”Reacting on those who cannot book appointments online, state minister Aadtiya Thackeray said, “We are working on a way to make vaccines more accessible to people who are unfamiliar with technology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-ngos-are-helping-spread-the-vaccine-safety-net-101620674960698.html

While the LLM exams were earlier scheduled to start on May 17, the university on Saturday issued a revised schedule announcing that exams will kick off on June 1. Confused with the university’s decision to hold exams on May 17 – which would have affected at least 800 students across six LLM divisions of MU – many had approached the examination department for clarity. A spokesperson from the exam department said that the dates have been pushed to accommodate the demands of students. However, law students are not too happy with the decision as the revised schedule does not provide breaks between the exams. “We have been telling the university that we need gaps between exams. We never asked for a postponement. Now the university has postponed exam and tests will be held every day. When will students have the time to prepare,” said Sachin Pawar, president of Student Law Council. Ashutosh Choughle, one of the LLM students, said, “Our online classes have barely started and we are already staring at an exam schedule with no breaks in between.”After a long wait, MU had declared dates for commencement of exams across departments and courses in the first week of April. Considering the delay in admissions to the undergraduate law (three-year and five-year) courses, exams for the first-year LLB students had been pushed to June, while those for LLM students were scheduled to begin in mid-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-plaints-university-of-mumbai-postpones-llm-exams-to-june-101620674960092.html

These medicines will be donated to the primary health care centres in rural districts across India for the timely treatment of the underprivileged, who are infected with Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. On May 1, Dr Marcus Ranney and his wife Dr Raina, both aged 37, started Meds For More — a citizen initiative to collect unused medicines from Covid-19 recovered patients – from their apartment building Atur Terraces. Since then, residents from around 100 buildings have donated their unused, unexpired medicines for the campaign. “Covid-19 patients all across the country are facing an acute shortage of medicines. So why waste even a single dose? These can be used for treating those living in rural and tribal areas, who are the most affected. Through this initiative, we want to help such underprivileged people,” said Dr Ranney, who along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), worked in the slums of Dadar for the screening and treatment of Covid-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic last year. Meds for More collects all kinds of unused medicines such as antibiotics, Fabiflu, pain relief, steroids, inhalers, vitamins, antacids, among others, that are being used to treat Covid-19 patients. Additionally, they are also collecting basic medicinal equipment like pulse oximeters and thermometers.“All donated medicines are segregated and checked for expiry dates. We have collected around 2kg of Fabiflu, 1kg of steroids, 6kg of vitamins, 4kg of acetaminophen like paracetamol, among others,” said Dr Ranney. With the growing awareness about the initiative, residents from neighbouring buildings have started volunteering to collect medicines. Colaba resident Meghna Chhabria, who is a volunteer, said, “I wanted to help underprivileged people in this pandemic but I was too scared to go on the field as I haven’t been vaccinated yet. So when I got to know about this initiative, I helped in collecting the unused medicines from my building and neighbours.” The 39-year-old also handles the social media account of the campaign to raise awareness about the cause. The team has tied up with different non-government organisations (NGOs) to dispense medicines to needy patients. They have also finalised their first consignment which will be sent to the tribal residents in Gujarat. “At present, our first priority will be tribals from Maharashtra and Gujarat. We will then gradually, expand it to other states,” Dr Marcus said. The initiative is not only limited to south Mumbai. “Any recovered patient from any part of the city can send us their unused medicines. There are no geographical restrictions. We want to extend the initiative all across the city. It is extremely feasible and can be also replicated in other cities,” said Ruchie Kothari, 37, a team member.Those interested in donating their unused medicines, can contact medsformoreindia@gmail.com or reach out to their Instagram page @medsformore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-doctor-couple-collects-20kg-of-unused-covid-19-meds-in-10-days-101620674840044.html

Currently, BMC gets Covishield and Covaxin vaccine doses of domestic manufacturers from the Central and state governments. BMC also issued detailed guidelines allowing housing societies and private establishments to tie-up with private hospitals for vaccinating residents and employees, respectively, in their premises.“Looking at the need for adequate vaccines to ensure that vaccination is swift and efficient, after discussing the issue with CM (chief minister) Uddhav Thackeray ji, as guardian minister of Mumbai, we have asked BMC to explore possibilities of global procurement of vaccines (sic),” Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted.“Today the @mybmc has also issued guidelines for vaccination policy of housing societies partnering with hospitals for vaccination within society complexes,” read Thackeray’s tweet.A circular signed by civic body commissioner IS Chahal stated that it is necessary to expand the number of vaccination centres in Mumbai and also ensure swift vaccination before the third wave hits. “Our efforts to increase vaccination centres are constantly on going and the BMC shall be having a centre in every municipal ward, along with a drive-in vaccination centre across all zones of Mumbai. I request all other cities to also have the drive-in vaccination for citizens above the age of 65 for their ease and comfort,” Thackeray said in another tweet.According to BMC officials, the civic body will explore possibilities to get vaccines including Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson and Russia’s Sputnik V and the tender to procure around five million doses will be floated in a week’s time.Additional civic commissioner Suresh Kakani said that all the manufacturers who have licences will be allowed to supply vaccines directly to the city. According to BMC guidelines, the payment for each dose would have to be mutually decided by the private hospital and workplace/housing society. Workplaces and societies are required to designate one of their senior staff as nodal officers to coordinate with private centres. The nodal officer shall oversee and facilitate all aspects of vaccination at the workplace/ society like registration of beneficiaries and availability of physical and IT infrastructure. The beneficiaries must be registered on CoWIN app prior to the vaccination drive. In case of a workplace, on-the-spot registration shall be available only to employees, while their family members have to register on CoWIN.Each team from a private vaccine centre should compulsorily have a doctor, a vaccinator and a vaccination officer who will verify the CoWIN details and an additional officer to manage the crowd. An ambulance has to be stationed at the place of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-to-procure-5mn-vaccines-from-global-market-101620674780157.html

The 72-year-old Rampur Lok Sabha MP, along with his 30-year-old son Abdullah, had been brought to the private hospital in the state capital on Sunday from Sitapur district jail, where they had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 30.The oxygen requirement of former Uttar Pradesh urban development minister Azam Khan shot up to 10 litres per minute and this required shifting him to ICU, according to the medical bulletin released by Medanta hospital. Currently, he is under strict observation of doctors.His son Abdullah as recovering, and his condition was satisfactory, the bulletin added.The duo had been in jail since February 26, 2020, when a Rampur court rejected their bail application in a case related to alleged forgery in age-proof documents of Abdullah, a jail official had said on Sunday.In September 2019, the court had issued summons to Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatima and their son taking cognizance of the charge sheet filed by Rampur police, in which all three were charged with forgery and cheating. On January 3, 2019, local BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged a complaint alleging that Azam and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates – one from Lucknow and another from Rampur – following which an FIR was registered.In December 2020, the Allahabad high court had granted bail to Tazeen Fatma in all 34 cases registered against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/spleader-azam-khan-shifted-to-icu-as-his-oxygen-requirement-goes-up-101620674362358.html
11-05-2021||Kolkata||Centre brings all 77 BJP MLAs in West Bengal under VIP security cover||The Centre on Monday accorded ‘X’ category VIP security cover of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to 61 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs in West Bengal in view of the alleged violence against the party leaders and workers in the state, people familiar with the development said. With this, all newly elected 77 MLAs of BJP in the 294-seat assembly are now being provided security cover by the central forces. BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said, “We had requested the home minister to provide security to our 77 MLAs as they were not able to travel anywhere, including their constituencies to their work. If the violence goes down, then they can rethink (the security cover) but for now we need this”. Leader of opposition in the state, Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Mamata Banerjee from Nandigram seat, already has a second highest ‘Z’ category security cover from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Officials cited above said the ministry of home affairs (MHA) approved the security cover for 61 MLAs, who had no protection till now, after taking into consideration a report prepared by intelligence agencies as well as the inputs shared by the four-member team that visited the state last week to assess the post-poll violence there. BJP has claimed that 14 of its party workers have been killed by Trinamool Congress goons while hundreds had to flee as their workplaces were burnt and family members attacked. Under the ‘X’ category cover, three to five armed commandoes will protect each MLA wherever they travel in the state. Others are already enjoying the central security cover under the next category of ‘Y’, which comprises 10-12 men. When contacted, TMC leader Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said, “Narendra and Amit (first names only, since they do the same to women politicians) ran a vile and filthy campaign. They should answer your question”. However, a TMC leader said on condition of anonymity that “the real reason for giving security to all the BJP MLAs is that half of them will now run away from the party. The BJP feels that the MLAs are very unhappy with Suvendu Adhikari being the Leader of Opposition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-brings-all-77-bjp-mlas-in-west-bengal-under-vip-security-cover-101620674360808.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees rise in vaccinations with 288,581 beneficiaries on Monday||A day after clocking around 110,000 vaccinations, the Covid-19 immunisation drive in Maharashtra saw a slight improvement with 288,581 beneficiaries getting inoculated on Monday across 4,404 centres in the state. So far, the state has vaccinated 18,374,452 beneficiaries and 3,489,266 of them have received both the doses. In the past one month, the state has administered over 8.1 million doses.However, the state government has a vaccine stock that would last only for the next two to three days, officials said. A state health department official who did not wish to be named said, “We have received stock in the weekend that has allowed us to continue the vaccination drive. Our vaccination drive will continue on a slow pace for want of enough doses. We are expecting another batch of vaccine from the Centre during the week to allow us to continue vaccination across all centres.”In case of failing to get more doses from the Centre, the state could reduce the number of active vaccination centres. “Looking at our speed, the Centre ought to send us 1.5 to 2 million doses in a week, but it is not happening. We received a little over 700,000 doses in the weekend. After Monday, there would be around 350,000 to 400,000 vaccines remaining, which will suffice for two or three days,” the officer added.Meanwhile, the state is still awaiting the stock of Covaxin from the Centre even as nearly 550,000 people in the state are due for the second shot of the Bharat Biotech vaccine. The state government has written to Centre seeking Covaxin and has received a meagre 36,000 doses. “Despite following up with the Centre, they are not giving us Covaxin for people aged over 45 years. It is their responsibility to provide it. People are getting agitated. I will again speak to the Union health minister over this,” said Rajesh Tope, state health minister. Officials added that the state government will decide to divert its stock of Covaxin to inoculate the people who are yet to take their second shot.Tope also said that the state government will decide on the categorisation of the 18-44 age group this week. The state is expected to give priority to people between the age of 35 and 44, with preference to people with comorbidities. “The plan for categorisation will be ready within this week. We will add criteria such as comorbidities,” Tope said. He further added that they intend to start vaccination of 18-44 age group on their app, but so far they have not received a go-ahead from the Centre to create a new app for the state. Officials added that one option before the state is to start offline vaccination. However, officials are wary to start offline vaccination of such a large group. Offline vaccination could also require a go-ahead from the Centre. When asked if the state plans to write to Centre seeking permission to allow offline vaccination of 18-44 group, Tope said, “We can do offline, but the issue is that keeping a record is a major issue. We have to record each vaccination properly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-rise-in-vaccinations-with-288-581-beneficiaries-on-monday-101620674240077.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||BMC to add 500 beds to treat Covid-19 in children and infants||To prepare for a possible rise in Covid-19 cases among infants and children in the projected third wave which is likely to hit mid-year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to add at least 500 beds to exclusively treat Covid-positive children and infants. These can be increased as and when needed, civic authorities said. As part of the plan, the civic body will convert three maternity homes — one each in the island city, and eastern and western suburbs — into dedicated Covid-19 paediatric hospitals. This is among decisions taken by the civic body last Friday in a meeting chaired by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We aim to start by adding 500 beds in the paediatric wards. But if the need arises, this can be scaled to as many beds as we need. All existing jumbo facilities will have a reserved paediatric ward. The jumbo facilities have a capacity to add 200 to 250 beds to the paediatric section.” Presently Mumbai has six jumbo facilities — NSCI at Worli, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Nesco in Goregaon, Dahisar jumbo facility which has two wings, Mulund, and one at Richardson and Cruddas. BMC will also identify maternity homes across the city where a part of the beds will be reserved for children and infants. Kakani said, “Presently, some hospitals have maternity wards that are already treating pregnant women who are Covid-positive. For example, BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central has a maternity ward for pregnant women with Covid-19 infection. Such wards will have partial number of beds reserved for Covid-positive children and infants.” The civic body has asked all private hospitals in the city to prepare their maternity wards to handle Covid cases in kids and to ramp infrastructure to handle such cases. Presently, at least 173 municipal, private and government hospitals treat Covid-19 patients in the city. The four upcoming Jumbo facilities at Malad, Sion, Kanjurmarg, and Mahalaxmi will also have dedicated paediatric wards, Kakani said. Meanwhile, Mumbai has reported a steady decline in the number of daily Covid-19 cases with 1,782 cases and 72 deaths on Monday. The city has reported less than 2,000 cases for the first time since March 16, when it had reported 1,922 cases. There are now 677,412 total cases in Mumbai and the toll is 13,855.

The daily bulletin of health department about Covid showed that till May 9 the district had 16,238 active cases, that included 2009 patients in 27 hospitals and 6020 in home isolation. This adds up to 8029 active cases which is 8209 short of the cases shown by the health department bulletin. Responding to the issue of difference in numbers, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Akhilesh Mohan described it as a discrepancy in managing the data. He claimed that many hospitals, who admitted and discharged patients, didn’t upload their data. Therefore, data of active cases are showing more than actual number of patients undergoing treatment. He also mentioned that his office was facing shortage of staff as more than 150 staff members were infected. But he assured to “look into the issue”.

The student, Dev Karthik, had moved HC contending that his name appeared in the merit list prepared and displayed by the state common entrance test (CET) cell on January 28, but JBIMS illegally refused to admit him to MMS course under the CIWGC category. His lawyer pointed out that the petitioner had approached the institute on January 25 but was asked to wait for the merit list prepared by the CET cell. He submitted that the petitioner, though having secured position in the merit list prepared by the CET cell, has been deprived of an admission to the course purely on account of the illegal manner in which the admission process was implemented by JBIMS. He had, therefore, urged the court to direct JBIMS to create a supernumerary seat in CIWGC category and give him admission for the course. Advocate Rui Rodrigues, who represented Mumbai University (MU), which runs JBIMS as an autonomous institution, pointed out that admissions under CIWGC category are made at the institute level and the CET cell had no role to play in it. Rodrigues opposed the petition contending that the petitioner was entirely at fault for not having participated in the admission process initiated by the institute, which was given due publicity. He also pointed out that the list prepared by CET cell was just a list of candidates seeking admission through CIWGC category and not a merit list. Besides, advocate Rodrigues also pointed out that the course had started in January and from April 1, even the summer internships had started. Thus, the petitioner, who moved HC on February 10, was way late for seeking admission. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice CV Bhadang accepted the arguments advanced on behalf of the institute and the university, and rejected the plea for interim relief. The bench took note of the fact that the foot note of admission notice for CIWGC category candidates instructed them to directly approach the institutes where such quota seats were available for admission but the petitioner did not formally apply to JBIMS and therefore, no case for creation of the supernumerary seat was made out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-refuses-admission-to-mms-course-aspirant-by-creation-of-supernumerary-seat-101620672619722.html

Police officers said that during investigation they found that George Puthhu Seri, chief executive officer of Privilege Health Care which owns Sunrise Hospital, had in connivance with Haresh Dayalal Joshi of fire safety inspection firm Pona Corporation obtained a fire no-objection certificate (NOC) for the mall by certifying that its fire safety system was functional, whereas it was not working. Police found water pumps and smoke detectors were not functional at the mall. Pona Corporation, a licenced agency authorised by the Mumbai civic body, claimed to have tested the fire-fighting system in the mall and submitted bogus certificate. Based on this, the fire department issued an NOC to the mall, said Dhakane. “Both were arrested on May 5. After five days of police custody, they were produced in the court which sent them to judicial custody for 14 days. Further investigation is going on to find out who else are responsible behind the fire. There are several people affected due to Covid-19, so we have to take precautions before arresting others, but soon action will be taken against responsible persons,” said Dhakane.Bhandup police also booked several people, including HDIL directors Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang; Nikita Amitsingh Trehan and Deepak Shirke, as well as Amitsingh Trehan and Sweetie Jain who are the directors of Privilege Health Care Services Private Limited, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder soon after the fire incident. Police have added sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 465 (forgery) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code to the case on May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dreams-mall-fire-started-at-computer-shop-101620672559667.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt procures 990 ventilators for 15 hospitals||In order to scale up intensive care unit facilities in the national capital, the Delhi government has procured 990 portable ventilators for 15 hospitals and temporary Covid facilities. Of the 990, the highest allocation -- 150 ventilators -- is for the newly constructed Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka that the Delhi government is currently operationalising for Covid-19 patients. Health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said the hospital would start functioning with 500 oxygen beds for Covid patients. “To augment medical resources, optimum utilisation of space is being done. A 500 oxygen bed centre will be set up here by next week,” Jain had said last Wednesday. Two new hospitals in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar, operationalised last year by the Delhi government for treating Covid-19 patients, have also been allocated 80 ventilators each. Other hospitals that are to receive 80 each ventilators are Deen Dayal Upadhaya in Hari Nagar and Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini. The government allocated 80 ventilators each to temporary facilities such as the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in Chhatarpur, an extension of Burari hospital, and the Sant Darshan centre. Two hospitals of the Employees State Insurance Corporation in Okhla and Jhilmil were allocated 50 ventilators in total. Currently, Delhi has 5,872 intensive care unit beds, of which about 98.9% of the beds are occupied, but not all of them have ventilators. The occupancy is likely to reduce over the week as the number of Covid cases in the city has started going down once again. After recording over 20,000 fresh Covid-19 cases from April 16 to May 5, the numbers fell below 20,000 on May 6, when 19,133 fresh cases were reported. On Monday, Delhi recorded 12,651 fresh cases with a test positivity rate of 19.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-procures-990-ventilators-for-15-hospitals-101620672560141.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||33 MCD schools to have vaccination centres for 18-44 age group||After Delhi government schools, municipal schools in the national capital were turned into Covid-19 vaccination centres on Monday to inoculate the 18-44 age group. Officials at the three civic bodies -- east, north, and south-- have been requesting the Delhi government to turn their schools into vaccination centres so that more beneficiaries in this age group are covered.The Delhi government has approved to turn 15 schools of the north corporation, 11 of the south corporation, and seven of the east corporation into Covid-19 vaccination sites. North Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said four of the 15 centres started functioning on Monday. “The remaining 11 centres will start functioning on Tuesday. We have been requesting the Delhi government to start centres in each ward to ensure that young people do not have to travel to different parts of the city to get the shot, given the present situation. Municipal staff are already working at vaccination centres in Delhi government schools and some of them can be deployed to these schools as well,” he said.In East corporation, four schools were converted into vaccination centres on Monday and the remaining three will start functioning from Tuesday. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said, “We had also written to the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 6, requesting permission to set up vaccination centres in our schools. Now the government has allowed us to set up seven such centres.”The South corporation on Monday started four of 11 centres. South civic body education committee chairperson Mukesh Suryan said, “I had written to the Delhi government on Saturday requesting that it allow the south corporation to open vaccination centres in its schools. We had highlighted that some wards under the south civic body, including west Sagarpur and Dwarka assembly 46, had no vaccination centre for the age group of 18-44. We appreciate that the government quickly reacted and gave the nod for us to do so.”Suryan said the staff at these centres will mostly be deputed from the respective corporations. “The government will provide us with the vaccine. We will ensure all other support systems,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/33-mcd-schools-to-have-vaccination-centres-for-18-44-age-group-101620672499679.html

Under this, the students getting promoted will be given an extra 7 per cent numbers in each subject over the marks scored by a student in the previous year’s exam which he or she has passed. The examination committee has approved this promotion formula and the same has been uploaded on the official website of AU, said central varsity officials. Public relation officer (PRO), AU, Jaya Kapoor said, “As per the formula developed by the varsity, the graduating third year students will be passed with an additional 7 per cent marks granted over marks obtained in the second year. This additional score will be awarded in each subject. Apart from this, the students of BA and BSc who had to appear in backpaper will also be given 7 per cent extra marks in each subject over the marks obtained by him/her in second year.” Students of BCom and BSc home science will be given these additional marks in each subject, considering the average marks obtained in the first and second year of graduation, she explained. “If there are two papers in a subject in the second year of graduation and three papers in the third year, then the average marks obtained in the two papers of second year will be taken as the basis for the marks in the third paper,” said the PRO. In addition to this, if maximum marks of a subject paper is 50 in the second year of graduation and the maximum marks in the third year is 75, then the simple scaling procedure will be adopted. Apart from this, it has also been clarified those marks of viva-voce and practical exams will be given by the department concerned, Kapoor said. “The results of UG backpaper examination of BA, BSc, BCom and BSc home science will be declared by May 30 and similarly the result of examination for BCA, MCA, PGDCA will be held in online mode in this very month and results will also be declared by the end of this month”, said the PRO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/au-finalises-promotion-formula-for-students-sans-exams-101620672319740.html
11-05-2021||Delhi||Govt prepping for 3rd wave, city will be able to tackle 30k daily cases: CM Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the national capital is preparing for the third wave of Covid-19 by augmenting infrastructure to a level where the city will be able to handle even 30,000 daily cases.“We are increasing oxygen beds... We must prepare for the third wave. In this wave (second for the country and fourth for the city), Delhi recorded a maximum of 28,000 cases in a day. Going by the scale at which we are creating infrastructure now, we will be able to handle the situation even if 30,000 daily cases are reported in the next wave,” Kejriwal said during a visit to the makeshift Covid care centre near GTB hospital in east Delhi.As on Monday, Delhi had 22,801 Covid-19 beds of which 3,242 were vacant. Also, of the total 5,839 ICU beds, 56 were vacant.Emphasising that vaccination can play a major role in curbing fresh cases, Kejriwal said the Delhi government has been left with 3-4 days stock of Covid vaccines. “Vaccine has played a major role in curbing the Covid-19 cases. We can prevent the third wave, if we vaccinate people on a large scale but the supply of vaccines is an issue,” he said.Elaborating the infrastructure augmentation plan, senior government officials said it includes increasing beds in hospitals as well as creating more centres in open grounds, sites run by religious organisations and stadiums.Government officials said they are already implementing plans to ramp up beds, opening up makeshift centres as well as adding infrastructure in the hospitals.Also read | Covid-19: Capital’s positivity dips below crucial 20% levelAt least 12,200 beds are ready and can be made available in a week or two. These include nearly 1,000 across all hospitals in the city, 11,000 across non-Hospital centres and around 200 in the municipal corporations, senior government and civic body officials said.Experts pointed out that the current Covid wave has shown that besides normal Covid care centres which accommodated patients with moderate symptoms, the city will need more beds with oxygen and critical care support both in hospitals as well as the informal set ups, if it encounters another wave of the infection.“The number of cases has gone down, but the hospitals and ICUs are full. For now, we must focus on breaking the chain of transmission; along with the lockdown we need to vaccinate more people. We also have to keep in mind that the current surge happened because of absolute complacency -- people were not wearing masks, they were gathering for parties and marriages, and travelling. The pandemic is not yet over,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Hospital bedsThe number of ward and oxygen beds in Delhi have gone up by 1,380 and intensive care unit beds by 689 over last week, according to data on Delhi Corona app.Health department officials said Delhi government-run hospitals such as Lok Nayak, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, and Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospitals have added 237 ICU beds. Others such as the Rajeev Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, which rolled back its number of beds from 550 to 350 due to paucity of oxygen, have added 25 beds. “We will slowly scale up the number of beds again now that the oxygen supply has stabilised,” a senior doctor at the hospital said.The Delhi government on Monday also allocated 990 ventilators to 15 hospitals and makeshift healthcare facilities in order to ramp up ICU beds in the city. Currently, there are 5,872 ICU beds, 98.9% of which were occupied.At the Delhi government’s new 370-bed Burari hospital, the admissions had been restricted for a couple of days when there was an acute shortage of oxygen. “We are not facing any problems now. The supply has stabilised. In addition to that the requirement for oxygen has also gone down. There are fewer new admissions. The pressure on the healthcare system is slowly easing,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. The hospital plans to scale up the number of beds from 370 to 500 in the coming days.The private hospitals too have started admitting more patients.Also read | Hoarding of oxygen devices: Look-out circular against Khan Market restaurateur“We have now set up an oxygen generation plant that augments our daily requirement. We are better off now and are able to admit more patients. We have 110 oxygen-dependent patients at the moment against our listed capacity of 76 oxygen beds,” said Dr Sunil Kohli, head of the department of medicine at Hakeem Abdul Hameed Centenary Hospital. Several beds were not being utilised at the hospital as the supply of oxygen was uncertain last week.Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj hospital said, “Now that the supply of oxygen has stabilised we have increased the number of beds in our hospital from 120 to 150 and the number of ICU beds have gone up from 53 to 63 now.”Non-hospital bedsThe Delhi government has readied at least 11,000 beds which is in addition to the Covid care centres that are already operational. This includes 5,000 beds at Radha Soami Satsang’s South Delhi campus, 2,500 beds in two places in Burari, 1,000 beds in Commonwealth Games Village, another 1,000 beds in Yamuna Sports Complex, 1,000 ICU beds at two Ramlila grounds and at least 400 beds at the Rakabganj Gurudwara.Apart from this, a number of schools and colleges are also being cleaned and readied so they can be converted into isolation centres. On Monday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited Mount Carmel School where its auditorium has been converted into a 40-bed covid care centre equipped with oxygen concentrators and medicines.From Tuesday, the government is opening its 500-bed ICU centre at Ramlila ground outside east Delhi’s GTB hospital. Another 500 ICU beds will be operational in the “next 2-3 days” at the main Ramlila Ground near Lok Nayak hospital, officials said.“There has been a huge demand for ICU beds. We hope that these 1,000 additional ICU beds will help meet the demand. By this evening, we are expected to receive 1,000 oxygen cylinders, and in the next 3-4 days we expecting more oxygen cylinders to arrive. We are creating new oxygen beds across the city, and hope that Delhi will no longer see any shortage of beds,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.Similarly, the air-conditioned facility at the Rakabganj Gurudwara is also now ready to admit patients, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Monday. “The centre has been attached with Lok Nayak hospital. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee has set up this fully AC infrastructure. The Delhi government has supplied medical facilities and equipment. Similar Covid care centres have been set up in various parts of Delhi. We do have ample number of beds and in case patients admitted here go critical, they can be shifted to the ICU ward of the hospital they are attached to,” Jain said.Watch | Oxygen Express with highest volume of LMO leaves from Hapa to Delhi﻿Beds in municipal facilitiesThe three municipalities — north, south and east— are treating Covid patients at nearly six facilities, including hospitals and community centres. Civic bodies officials said at least 610 beds are currently operational across the facilities being run by the three corporations, of which 440 beds are under the north civic body, 85 in east and 60 in south DMC.Officials said that nearly 200 more beds will be created in a week’s time for Covid-19 patients. Out of 610, nearly 440 beds are operational in the north civic body, 85 in east and 60 under the south corporation.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “In Hindu Rao hospital, we have dedicated 280 beds for Covid treatment; 100 in Rajan Babu and 35 in Balakram hospitals. We will add 65 more beds at Balakram and convert two more community centres in Ashok Vihar and Nabi Karim into Covid dedicated facilities of 25 beds each. So far we have also no dearth of oxygen supply for the three hospitals where Covid patients are being treated.”South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) nodal officer for bed augmentation and Covid management programme, Radha Krishna, said the south body’s Kalkaji hospital will start functioning as a Covid facility with 20 beds and the Tilak Nagar Super Speciality Covid-19 hospital could add 40 beds. He added that to meet the oxygen supply requirements, the SDMC is also installing a plant at its Tilak Nagar hospital.Similarly, the east Delhi municipal corporation (EDMC) has dedicated 85 beds at its Swami Dayanand Hospital. “We will create 25 more beds here. It is a partially Covid-19 facility as maternity and child care facilities are also being provided here,” EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-says-govt-preparing-for-next-covid-19-wave-as-city-augments-health-infrastructure-101620672259668.html

11-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra likely to extend lockdown by two weeks||The Maharashtra government is likely to extend the lockdown till May-end, even as it reported its lowest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases in 41 days. With 37,236 new Covid-19 infections (27,918 cases were reported on March 30), the state’s tally went up to 5,138,973, while the toll rose to 76,398 with 549 more deaths.The significant dip in cases on Monday can be attributed to the drop in number of tests to 192,330 in 24 hours, below the daily average of over 2,50,000 tests over the past few weeks. The test positivity rate on Monday stood at 19.36%, against the weekly rate of 20.82%. Mumbai, too, saw its lowest one-day spike in 56 days (1,782 cases), after reporting 1,713 infections on March 15. The state government is, however, all set to extend its current lockdown by another two weeks after it ends at 7am on May 15. The lockdown will be as strict as it is currently, while in some districts where the cases are on the rise, the local administration is expected to impose stricter curbs. The decision is expected to be taken in the state cabinet on Wednesday. At present, cases are on the rise in 21 districts and dropping in 15, including Mumbai and Thane. The slowed-down vaccination drive is another reason for extension of the lockdown.“Though the daily caseload has stabilised over the past few weeks, it is still at the average of over 55,000, which is much higher than the peak of the first wave, when the highest daily peak was 24,886 cases on September 11 last year. We will still have to follow stricter curbs to bring the cases down. The strain on the health infrastructure has been reduced significantly with more than 25% beds in the state vacant. In some districts, the percentage is 40. But some districts like Kolhapur, Sangli are witnessing rise in the number of cases. More than half the districts are still logging rise in daily cases. In such a scenario,the lockdown will continue in its current form at least for two more weeks,” said an official from Mantralaya.Currently, only essential establishments are allowed to operate between 7am and 11am, while attendance in government offices has been brought down to 15%. People are not allowed to venture out without a valid reason. The inter-district travel, too, has been restricted only for the medical and valid reasons.A senior Shiv Sena minister said that the decision of extension by two weeks was taken in the cabinet when it was unanimously decided, in last week of April, to impose lockdown. “We had decided to extend it by two weeks instead of announcing it for four weeks at a go,” he said.Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh on Monday said the decision over the lockdown will be taken after discussion in the cabinet. “We have been augmenting our health infrastructure during the lockdown to face the second wave and in anticipation of the potential third wave of the pandemic. We have been witnessing good result of the lockdown as cases in Mumbai and other cities have come down significantly. Considering this, the decision over giving relaxations in the districts with a drop in cases and stricter norms where cases are on the rise, will be taken,” he said.Some of the districts have imposed stricter lockdown amid the rise in cases. Buldhana district’s guardian minister Rajendra Shingne announced that the district has terminated internal public transport service until May 20. The shops, too, have been shut down for more than a week beginning from Tuesday.Pune district remains on the top in term of daily cases with 4,685 cases reported on Monday, followed by 3,813 cases in Ahmednagar, 2,545 in Nagpur, 2,234 in Nashik. The daily caseload in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) dropped to 4,883 on Monday from over 10,000 cases a few days ago. After Mumbai, Latur (51), Beed(42), Kalhapur (26) districts reported high number of deaths.With the drop in active cases to 590,818, the state’s recovery rate improved to 86.97%. Highest active patients, 97,593, are in Pune, followed by 47,054 in Mumbai and 34,185 in Thane. State has 3,670,320 people in home quarantine and 26,664 institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-likely-to-extend-lockdown-by-two-weeks-101620672019691.html
11-05-2021||Lucknow||‘Thai woman who died of Covid was spa therapist in Lucknow’||The police team formed to probe the controversy around the death of a Thai woman, who reportedly died of Covid-19 in Lucknow last week, on Monday claimed the deceased was a professional therapist and worked at a local spa in the city.“The woman was a professional spa therapist and worked at a local spa centre. When she contracted Covid-19 virus, she was admitted to a hospital by spa centre manager Salman, who also performed her last rites as per the wish of members of the deceased family following permission from Thai embassy officials,” said DCP Sanjiv Suman, who is heading the team set up to probe the matter.The probe was initiated after reports on social media claimed she was an escort and was invited to Lucknow by son of a politician and a prominent builder at a time when cases of Covid-19 were rising.On Sunday, the said politician refuted the claims and wrote to local police requesting an investigation into the matter.The probe team found that the deceased was a regular visitor to India since 2010 and to Lucknow since 2019.“We questioned the owner of the spa and the manager regarding the matter and have not found anything suspicious or illegal yet. The investigation is still on, and we are looking into other aspects of the case,” said the officer.The woman was admitted to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, on April 28 and she died on May 3, as per ADM (administration) Amar Pal Singh. Later, her family was contacted in Thailand via embassy. As per their wishes, her last rites were performed by the police and district administration on May 5, he had said.An official statement released by the Lucknow police said the probe team had spoken to people connected with the case.“Further investigation in the case will be done on the basis of facts collected by the team,” read the police statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/thai-woman-who-died-of-covid-was-spa-therapist-in-lucknow-101620671659596.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Horror sinking in, bodies found floating in Ganga||Amid the current wave of Covid-19 infections, over two dozen partially decomposed bodies, some bloated, were found floating in Ganga river near Chausa in Buxar district of Bihar on Monday, setting off panic among locals and prompting a probe by the district administration.“There are 30-35 bodies floating in Ganga in a spread of over 2 km,” said K K Upadhyay, subdivisional officer (Sadar), who has been asked by the district administration to probe the matter.Upadhyay, however, was quick to claim that these bodies could have floated downstream from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.“Here at Chausa, there is curve in the river. These bodies seem to have floated downstream from other places and washed up near the bend. It is not clear how they died. The administration is making arrangements to dispose of the bodies,” he said.Ashok Kumar, block development officer at Chausa, which borders UP, said, “We were alerted by the local chowkidar that many bodies had been spotted floating from upstream. We have so far recovered 15 of these. None of the deceased happens to be a resident of the district,” he told PTI.“Many districts in UP are situated right across the river and the bodies may have been dumped in the river for reasons not known to us. We cannot confirm whether the deceased were indeed Covid-19 infected. The bodies have started decomposing. But we are taking all precautions while ensuring that these are disposed of in a decent manner,” he said.Addressing a press conference in the evening, Buxar’s district magistrate Aman Samir said the bodies found floating in Ganga near Chausa were three-four days old. “This makes it clear that the bodies are not from Buxar but have floated downstream from neighbouring UP. We have contacted officials from neighbouring districts. To prevent a repeat of this, it has been decided to start boat patrolling,” he said.However, social activist and lawyer Ashwani Verma countered the claims of the administration. “For the last 10 days, I have been approaching the local administration over bodies in the river. Because of the lockdown, people do not prefer to go to Buxar and instead dispose bodies in Ganga. You never know they could be infected with Covid-19,” he said.A large number of villages, situated on the banks of Ganga, use river water for drinking purposes as several villages have reported presence of arsenic in ground water in Buxar and adjoining Bhojpur district.A K Singh Kushwaha, a local, said there is hardly any facility at Chausa funeral ground. “People have to bring wood from a distance of 1 to 1.5 kms to the funeral site,” he said, adding that those manning the funeral ground ask for exorbitant sums for a wooden pyre.While enforcing the lockdown, the state government had announced free funeral (at government cost) for all Covid-related deaths and made urban and rural development departments as nodal agencies for this.Former MP and Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) leader Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, who has been exposing the malfunctioning of system by visiting different districts, called for a thorough probe into the manner. “This is government failure. Poor people are hesitant to take bodies to villages or consign them to flames. They simply dump bodies directly into the Ganga. The state has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Yadav.Meanwhile, Bihar on Saturday reported 11,259 new Covid cases, taking the number of active cases to 110,814.Buxar district on Saturday reported 62 new cases, which increased to 81 on Sunday. The district has so far reported 26 deaths and has a total of 1,216 active cases.The positivity rate in the state, for the first time, showed signs of a declining trend, from a high of 16.1% on April 30 to 10.3% on May 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/horror-sinking-in-bodies-found-floating-in-ganga-101620658938427.html
11-05-2021||Pune||Corporators accused of running pvt token system for vaccine drive; Pune mayor defends allegations||PUNE Even as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has increased the numbers of vaccination centres in the city, citizens and activists, allege that the entire vaccination process is being hijacked by corporators. Corporators, and their followers, are being accused of setting up a token system for those wanting to get jabs, especially for the second dose. The PMC has a total of 116 vaccination centres across the city. However, five wards have only one vaccination centre each, while all of the remaining wards have at least two centres each. Of these 116 centres, five are reserved for vaccination of those in the of 18-to-44 year age group. Corporators have provided basic support, such as chairs, covered waiting spaces, water and other necessary backup aid.Bhapu Kamble, a resident of Vimannagar said, “My wife and I took the first dose of Covishield on March 23. I got a message for the second dose due on April 20. I was trying to book an appointment and it did not happen. At the Viman nagar centre volunteers asked me to come at 7am for a token. I went continuously for three days to get a token, but did not get it. Finally, my son approached the local corporator’s office. He arranged for the vaccination without a token.” Citizens allege that tokens also go to party workers who bypass the queues.Mulrlidhar Mohol, mayor, said, “There is a lot of pressure on the PMC health staff. They have to take care of swab collection centres, crematoria management, and ambulance services. There is a lack of manpower to provide these facilities. Corporators are helping medical staff manage the crowds by distributing tokens. They also take care of senior citizens with seating, water and snacks.” Mohol added: “I appealed to all to avoid any irregularities with the vaccinations and to help PMC increase its vaccination numbers.” Haribhau Joshi, a resident of Kothrud said, “When I could not get an appointment for my second shot, one of my neighbours told me to approach my local corporator. I called the office, and he fixed my appointment without a token.”Suryakant Devkar, PMC’s assistant medical officer said, “Central government provides vaccines for 45+ and above and the state is getting vials for the age group of 18 to 44. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal takes the decision on how to distribute these to each centre. Normally, we distribute 100 doses to each centre. We hand it over to the ward medical officer.” Another medical officer, requesting anonymity, said after the mistreatment of two senior medical officials by public representatives, the morale of the staff is down. “We are feeling insecure and we don’t confront corporators or political parties. We just do our job of vaccinating people. We don’t bother who sends or recommends them. If we question them, they put pressure and mistreat us. ” Dr Abhijit Vaidya, founder and national president of the Arogya Sena said, “The rate of vaccination in the country is three per cent. Corporators are interfering. How can people take political advantage in this pandemic situation?”Prashant Jagtap, city president of the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) and corporator of Wanowrie, said, “Vaccination is controlled by the mayor, standing committee chairman and leader of the house in the PMC. They decide the slots. They are unevenly distributing vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/corporators-accused-of-running-pvt-token-system-for-vaccine-drive-mayor-defends-allegations-101620658038383.html

Crediting his victory to Hindu-Muslim unity, Hafiz Azimuddin said: “My victory is an example of Hindu-Muslim affinity not only in village Rajanpur but entire Ayodhya.” Listing out his priorities for the village, Azimuddin said: “All funds for gram pradhan will be utilised for development of the village. Basic amenities will be augmented, and jobs will be provided to all those entitled under the MNREGA.” Radhay Shyam, 53, a native of village Rajanpur, was happy with Azimuddin’s victory. “Azimuddin’s victory is a signal of Hindu-Muslim unity in this village and the rest of Ayodhya. The day Azimuddin filed for his candidature, most of us decided to vote for him.” Sampat Lal, 61, points out that Azimuddin’s victory will also ensure that there is no animosity between any castes in the village. “As Hindu candidates had also sought votes on the basis of their caste, victory of any candidate other than Azimuddin might have led to bitterness between various castes of the Hindu community,” said Sampat Lal.Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the state government has postponed oath taking ceremony of gram pradhans and zila panchayat members. The government has also postponed election of chairman, zila panchayat and block pramukhs. Newly elected zila panchayat members elect zila panchayat chairman in all 75 districts of the state. Now, these elections are expected to take place after June 15. Ayodhya, around 155 km from the state capital, has been in focus for the ongoing construction work of Ram Mandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dominated-by-hindus-ayodhya-village-elects-muslim-man-as-gram-pradhan-101620655999395.html
11-05-2021||Mumbai||Beechcraft aircraft lands on belly after wheel falls off, probe initiated||It was around 5.50pm when Ravi Kanth Avala, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) head constable, was on duty at the watchtower number 12 on the airside of the Nagpur airport. His INSAS rifle resting by his side, as he turns towards the active runway, Avala spots a Beechcraft King Air C90 plane taking off.“For some reason, I kept watching the plane as it was speeding on the runway. I noticed that the moment it took off, the rear left wheel of the plane broke and got separated. The speed of the aircraft was such that the detached wheel went rolling at least half a kilometre (km) ahead, towards the left of the runway, before it came to halt. The plane, however, took off, unaffected,” Avala, the only witness to the incident, told HT.Sensing the gravity of the incident, the 48-year-old head constable immediately picked up his rifle and rushed towards the runway, which is barely 300 metres from watchtower number 12.“I went to the spot where the wheel had fallen. As it was a charter jet, I was sure it would land somewhere within a maximum of two-three hours. I also knew that such planes have a capacity of seven-eight passengers and therefore lives are at stake. At that time, I didn’t know that it’s an air ambulance carrying a Covid-19 patient. Thinking that it can lead to a fatal accident upon landing, I immediately reported the matter to my superiors who further alerted the authorities concerned. It was found that the plane was destined to Mumbai and officials there were briefed about the incident to be able to make the timely arrangements to handle the aircraft as it prepared to land,” Avala said.The medical flight which was on its way to Mumbai from Bagdogra, had stopped at Nagpur for refuelling.On Friday, CISF also announced a reward of ₹10,000 for Avala and the director general’s commendation certificate and disk for his mindful action that saved lives and averted a major disaster from happening.Avala said he feels fortunate to have saved a tragedy from unfolding.“My seniors and colleagues appreciate my quick reaction. My alertness and promptness was lauded. My family members, wife and children are also proud of me,” said Avala, who has been posted at Nagpur airport since 2017.The Jet Serve Aviation’s Beechcraft C-90 aircraft, registered as VT-JIL, had to make a belly landing at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Thursday evening. The non-scheduled medical flight with five people on board had taken off from Bagdogra to land in Mumbai. It however had to land on its belly, as its left rear wheel got separated immediately after take-off and fell off at Nagpur airport, where it had a halt for refuellingWhile Avala’s presence of mind played a vital role in saving the lives of five passengers on board, top AAI sources said that after learning about absence of rear left wheel, the pilot had requested the ATC to get in touch with the aircraft type’s (C-90) expert from DGCA to figure out the best possible procedure to be followed in the situation.At times when a full emergency is declared at airports, all the stakeholders get into action to prepare for the extraordinary situation. While the role of every stakeholder matters, air traffic controllers (ATC) play one of the most crucial roles at such times. From deciding on the line of action to coordinating with the pilot, airport operator and safety experts, if needed, ATCos swing into action with an aim to make the aircraft land safely.“The checklist with the pilot did not state his course of action needed, in case one of the rear wheels went missing,” claimed an AAI official. “Though the pilot had communicated to go for belly landing, he shared a contact with an expert for C-90 aircraft and asked the on-duty controllers to re-confirm the course of action needed,” the official added. It is then that the air traffic controllers (ATCos) got in touch with two experts from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to have their view on the situation. The experts also agreed and asked the ATCos to go ahead and perform belly landing.Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert and former instructor pilot of Boeing 737, said, “Absence of standard operating procedure on partial landing gear failure is a very serious lapse on DGCA’s part.”DGCA director general Arun Kumar said that investigation will reveal the facts. “We will not like to speculate,” he added.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), however, confirmed that they have taken over the investigation.“AAIB is conducting an investigation as per Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, into the causes of the occurrence,” read AAIB’s reply to the email sent by the paper.At times when a full emergency is declared at airports, all the stakeholders get into action to prepare for the extraordinary situation. While the role of every stakeholder matters, air traffic controllers (ATC) play one of the most crucial roles at such times. From deciding on the line of action to coordinating with the pilot, airport operator and safety experts, if needed, ATCos swing into action with an aim to make the aircraft land safely.“Those two hours were not only challenging but also worrisome for all those involved in planning safe landing of the Beechcraft C-90 aircraft. Thankfully, the aircraft had fuel for two and a half hours more even after reaching Mumbai. This gave us good time to consider all possibilities and take a call,” recalled an Airports Authority official who was on duty on Thursday night.AAI officials said that the Nagpur ATC contacted Mumbai ATC around 6.45pm to inform them that the aircraft’s wheel had fallen off in the airport premises.“The pilot was unaware of the situation until the Mumbai ATC got in touch with Capt Kesari Singh to inform him about it. However, none of us knew which wheel of the aircraft was detached,” said the AAI official.AAI officials at Mumbai airport said in order to understand which wheel fell off at Nagpur, Capt Singh suggested to ‘low pass’ the runway. This means the aircraft passes around 50m above (adjacent) the runway. It was during the low pass at around 7.30pm that the Mumbai ATC with the help of fire department officials learnt that the aircraft’s rear left wheel was missing.“The pilot was cleared to conduct the ‘low pass’ immediately at around 6.45pm when the aircraft was 200Nm away from Mumbai,” said a controller at Mumbai.A Delhi-based AAI official said that the absence of either side of the wheel is riskier as compared to issues with the nose wheel.“This is because the two rear wheels come in contact with the runway first, followed by the nose wheel.”“ATCos were asked to go ahead with belly landing after which the airport operator was contacted and asked to prepare for foam-based landing. Arranging for foam and making it available at the touchdown point of runway 27 took some time,” said a senior AAI official in Mumbai.“At first, when the arrangement of foaming the runway was taking time, we were even thinking on the lines to send the aircraft back to Nagpur, however, by then the airport operator confirmed that foam was being arranged,” the official added.The aircraft however touched down safely at 9.09pm after which the fire department officials took over and handled the situation so that the aircraft did not catch fire. Though the aircraft suffered substantial damage, there were no injuries. The mid-aged male patient, who was one of the passengers was being treated for Covid-19, was rushed to Nanavati hospital. Sources from the hospital said that the patient is on oxygen support, but he is conscious and stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/airbus-wheel-falls-off-lands-on-belly-aircraft-accident-body-to-probe-101620414421780.html
