This jail is under construction and 20% of its work is yet to be completed.BS Yadav, assistant superintendent of special section of Rewari jail, said 450 inmates have been shifted here in the last 10 days.“We are adhering to social distancing and following the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs. A team of doctors, including a medical officer, nurses and other staff are deployed here for 24-hours to check the health status of inmates,” he said.“The inmates are stable and some of them are suffering from fever, cough and cold. If any inmate in Haryana tests positive, he will be shifted here,” Yadav added.As many as 284 inmates of 512 (60%) tested positive at Nasibpur jail in Mahendergarh on May 5 and 6.“The situation is being monitored closely,” Mahendergarh deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar said.VACCINATION NOT GIVEN TO INMATESA senior health official, pleading anonymity, said jails are overcrowded and it is a difficult task to maintain social distancing among inmates.“Even the jails are overcrowded and there are chances of further spread of the virus.

In addition, many patients with other diseases continue to require oxygen.With the introduction of the facility of refilling oxygen cylinders at home, such patients will be benefited. This will curb black marketing of cylinders. He said application request can be made through the portal - http://oxygenhry.in/As soon as a patient registers on this portal, the application will be reflected in the NGO and the Red Cross Society. If any of them accepts the request, the information will be conveyed via a text message on mobile number of the applicant.The applicant will have to upload photo of the oxygen level in oximeter and aadhaar number while applying. In addition, it will be mandatory to write the age and address of the patient. An application can be made only once a day from a mobile number. This facility will start from May 9.Dr Agrawal directed officials to discuss with deputy commissioners for refilling cylinders and set a location.

PM Modi on Thursday night spoke to Soren, besides chief ministers of few other states. After the conversation, Soren took to social media platform Twitter and said PM Modi only did his “Mann ki Baat” during the conversation. “It would have been better had he listened to, and spoken on important matters,” the Jharkhand chief minister tweeted.Hitting back, BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi termed Soren as a “failed CM”. “Hemant Soren is a failed CM. Failure in governance. Failure in tackling Covid in the state. Failure to assist people. To hide his failures, he demeans the office he holds. Wake up and work, Mr Soren. The clock is ticking,” Marandi said on Twitter. Several other BJP leaders, including former chief minister Raghubar Das, Union tribal minister Arjun Munda, and state BJP chief and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Prakash hit out at the incumbent CM, many of them reminding Soren about the “failure” of his own government in handling the crisis in the state. Reacting to Soren’s statement, Union health minister Dr Harshvardhan advised him to “fight Corona and not the Prime Minister”, as it’s time to take on the pandemic together.

However, hospital authorities on Friday said the deaths occurred due to critical illness.Following the incident, health minister Banna Gupta on Friday set up a probe into the matter. “This is a grave issue. I discussed it with chief minister Hemant Soren. The health department’s principal secretary has been asked to conduct a detailed probe into the matter. Some technical snag could have developed in the system but it is important to find out if it was due to deliberate lapses on the part of staff on duty or someone else,” Gupta said.According to available information, the technical snag occurred around 4.45 am due to leakage in MOX regulator in the manifold room. This led to a sudden disruption in the smooth supply of oxygen, as its flow dropped to 12 from 50 level.It was alleged that soon after this, two critically ill patients, who were on ventilator support and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), died. Three other patients also died in quick intervals even after the oxygen supply was restored within an hour through different manifold system.The sudden disruption led to chaos in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU), where around 50 patients were surviving either on ventilators or HFNCs. “The unit, however, had a jumbo oxygen cylinder but that could not be made functional. The oxygen flow level dipped to 12 from 50, causing much unease to patients. Attendants of many patients used small size cylinders attached with the beds for the time being but some patients didn’t have this facility too. Soon after, two-three patients died,” claimed a patient’s attendant.Speaking to media persons on Friday, Ranchi’s in-charge civil surgeon Dr Vinod said, “Not a single death occurred due to disruption in oxygen supply. Those who died were critically ill. These deaths occurred at different points of time. The snag that developed in the manifold system was rectified and oxygen supply was restored within half an hour.”Earlier on Tuesday, as many as 17 Covid-19 patients also died at Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital at different points of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/oxygen-supply-disrupted-in-ranchi-hosp-5-covid-patients-dead-101620404040394.html

On Friday, there were 1,15,066 active cases across the state, with Patna contributing 22,330. The state also showed a marginal improvement in recovery of patients, up from 78.65% on Thursday to 79.16% on Friday. Meanwhile, hospitals in Patna continue to face oxygen crisis, necessary in management of Covid-19 patients, forcing some to reduce oxygen pressure to patients, while also refusing admission to new patients. The Ruban Hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), is one of the prominent facilities in Patna which is grappling with oxygen scarcity and has had to curtail admission of new Covid-19 patients. “Our oxygen requirement is 600 cylinders (1 cylinder is 340 litres) per day, but we are able to get a maximum of 400-450 cylinders only in a day. When there is a delay in refilling of oxygen cylinders, we even have to temporarily reduce oxygen pressure by 15-30 minutes to patients so that they do not run out of life saving gas,” said a spokesperson of Ruban hospital. “We maintain pressure enough not to harm a patient, but at the same time also not run out of gas,” the spokesperson said when asked if reducing oxygen pressure did not put patient life at risk. He said the hospital had up to 230 beds for Covid-19 patients, but was unable to admit as many patients. “We have had to restrict admission to 170-190 patients only because of oxygen scarcity. Nearly 40% of our 170 Covid-19 patients are under critical care, requiring high oxygen up to 15-30 litres per minute. We cannot admit more patients unless the government assures us full oxygen,” he said. Almost similar is the condition at most other hospitals too. The Sahyog Hospital in New Patliputra Colony, which has 30 beds for Covid-19 patients, has a daily demand of 30-40 D-type jumbo oxygen cylinders (each having up to 7,000 litres oxygen), but gets up to 25 cylinders per day. “We have a shortage of up to 15-18 cylinders every day. As such, we admit only mild to moderate patients, while refusing the severe to critical cases, requiring more oxygen support,” said the spokesperson of Sahyog hospital. The Mediversal Hospital at Doctors Colony in Kankerbagh has 40 beds for Covid-19, but it had to stop admission of patients due to shortage of oxygen a few days back, said Partha Dey, its general manager, facility. “We require 200 cylinders but get only up to 160-170 cylinders, leading to oxygen shortage. However, we try that our patients do not suffer,” he said. The oxygen requirement of AIIMS-Patna had gone up more than four times from 2,000 kilo litres a day to 9,000 kilo litres since February, said its superintendent Dr CM Singh. It was, however, able to meet the requirement as it had a 30,000 kilo litre oxygen tank and got its supply of oxygen from Kolkata. Similarly, the oxygen demand of Paras-HMRI, too, had also doubled from 900 litres to 1.8-2 kilo litres in about a month, said its superintendent Dr Syed Asif Rahman. He, however, said oxygen supply was sufficient as it had a 20 kilo litre oxygen tank. The Centre has allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but it was able to lift only 167 metric tonnes because of logistic issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patna-hospitals-still-battle-oxygen-crisis-101620403980374.html

We saw such messages on social media,” said Rajkumar, social welfare director who handles government care institutions and adoption centres. “This is alarming. Adoption without the permission of the CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) and SARA (state adoption resource authority) is quite illegal. Those who want to adopt a child will have to follow the adoption process,” he said. “People are also advised to inform DM and the child protection unit in case they find such cases in their neighbourhood or the in the village. Their identity will not revealed if they so wish,” he said. Rajkumar said though all government care institutions and adoption centres in the state have remained shut for the outsiders since March this year to avoid Covid-19 infections, things will be managed if a child needs government care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-rush-to-adopt-children-orphaned-due-to-covid-101620403980887.html

In Bhojpur district, 1,600 applications have been submitted till Friday afternoon in different police stations of the district regarding information about marriages. The state government, while announcing the lockdown, had made it mandatory for people to inform their respective police stations three days in advance if they wished to hold marriage ceremonies. The state had capped the number of wedding guests at 50. Though curfew timings has been relaxed till 10 pm for marriages,orchestras and processions have been prohibited altogether.However, a day after announcing the lockdown, the CM had appealed to people to defer marriages “if they can.”Bihar has enforced lockdown from May 5 till May 15 following an unprecedented surge in Covid cases. Many a family expressed their helplessness. “My son’s marriage was fixed last year but was deferred due to the pandemic. Now that the pandemic has returned this year, we decided that the marriage ceremony will be held with fewer people,” said Chatthu Prasad of Ganauli whose son’s “tilak” ceremony is on May 14. He has submitted his application in the police station concerned. In Purnia district, 161 applications have been submitted, giving information about marriages. District officials in East and West Chamapran pleaded ignorance about the number of wedding scheduled during the lockdown and said only the in-charges of police stations could tell.“We have already received around 20 applications for weddings,” said Rohit, station house officer (SHO), Mufassil police station, Motihari. Ugranath Jha, SHO, Mufassil police station, Bettiah, put the number of applications at two to three in the areas within his jurisdiction.Meanwhile, Sanjay Kumar, subdivisional police officer of Chakiya in East Champaran, said one person had been arrested and two firearms seized in connection with celebratory firing at a wedding, a video of which had gone viral on social media.In Patna, however, there is a rush to cancel weddings. “There were a number of auspicious dates between May 5 and 15, but most of the bookings have been cancelled,” said a marriage hall employee, wishing anonymity.Kumud Sharma, the manager of the luxury Panache hotel in Patna, told PTI that almost 90 per of the advance bookings for weddings have been postponed.“A few people, for whom shifting the date was unavoidable, are going ahead with a simple wedding. Only a handful of guests will be present and there would be no band- baajaa-baaraat,” he said.The situation has left decorators and ‘band parties’ or orchestra groups staring at losses.“We had four-five bookings per day during this period but all of them have been cancelled,” said Mohd Tajuddin, the proprietor of the famous Patna Bachcha Band.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cms-appeal-for-putting-off-weddings-has-few-takers-101620403860992.html

The committee, to be headed by Patna AIIMS director, would suggest and advise the government. The HC asked state’s advocate general Lalit Kihsore to inform the court about the committee on Monday. Meanwhile, the Bihar government submitted its affidavit, as asked by the HC on Thursday, outlining steps being taken with the cooperation of the Centre to ensure full lifting of the quota of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) allocated to the state. The affidavit said the initial phase of uncertainty for oxygen was over and the government was constantly working with the Centre to augment supply. “Within a week, the state will be in a position to lift the entire quota, as additional tankers have been deployed for the purpose. In the beginning, oxygen supply was too little in view of sudden surge in demand, but things have improved significantly and it would improve further. The oxygen supply is being monitored round the clock. Even oxygen cylinders are being transported with police escort,” said Bihar government’s counsel Vikas Singh.The court had earlier sought to know steps being taken to lift the allocated quota of oxygen from the Centre and ensure supply of essential medicines. Justice Shivaji Pandey, who was in the bench with chief justice Sanjay Karol, wanted to know how the state proposed to fulfil the oxygen needs of a large number of Covid patients, who are encouraged to live in home isolation. Justice Pandey, who retired on Friday, also asked about the ways of determining oxygen requirement for hospitals. The HC has been hearing the matter related to management of Covid situation and shortage of oxygen supply in Bihar since April 15 on a regular basis.The next hearing is scheduled for Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-to-set-up-experts-panel-to-fight-covid-crisis-101620403860356.html

A total of ₹1.5 lakh was siphoned off from a 55-year-old’s account while ordering beer online during lockdown. However, the quick reporting by the complainant generated hope as officials expressed possibility of the recovery of the funds after the Pune police cyber cell managed to freeze the funds that had gone into one of the accounts of an e-commerce site and would be returned to the victim’s account in a week time.According to officials, the fraudsters duped the gullible customers ordering liquor online by sending remote device control apps and taking control of the victim’s smartphone and siphoned the money from the accounts.Ravindra Gawari, police sub inspector, cyber cell, Pune police, said, “As no wine or liquor shops are open due to the restriction, a man in the city browsed for a number to purchase beer online. During his search, he found one number and called; the person asked him to pay ₹10 as some charges and sent him a link to download an app.”He added that unsuspecting, the complainant downloaded the app, presuming that it could a portal through which he needed to order the beer online.“However, the link which was sent by the man was nothing but remote device control app link through which he gained the access of the complainant’s smartphone and while asking him to transfer ₹10 as some charges, the fraudster stole the bank credentials such as id and password and transferred ₹1,50,900 lakh from his account,” said Gawari.After the transaction of the amount, the complainant immediately called one of his retired police officer friends who advised him to approach the cyber cell without wasting time.“The man came to the police station with the complaint. We immediately verified the transaction message and found a mention of an e-commerce firm. We then approached the nodal officials of the e-commerce site and appraised them about the dubious transaction and requested them to freeze the payment,” said Gawari.Gawari said that at the pan India level, there is a group called “Stop Banking Fraud’ which comprises police officers from various states, nodal officers of all the banks, nodal officers from payment gateway firms, and e-commerce sites.“So, if we receive such complaint, without wasting time, information about the dubious transaction is shared on that group and the concerned nodal officer helps to freeze the payment and stops it from going to the fraudster’s account,” said Gawari.He added that in the present case, the nodal officer has stopped the payment, and now the legal process to bring the funds into the complainant’s account is on and the funds will be returned to his accounts in a week’s time.“The fraudsters might have tried to purchase something through the e-commerce site and made the transaction by transferring the funds from the complainant’s account,” said Gawari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-save-online-beer-buyer-rs-1-5-lakh-101620402540277.html

The civic body has now decided to call a meeting of banks officials to discuss the issue. The civic body has, so far, spent ₹465 crore on the project. The administration raised ₹200 crore through bonds in June 2017. In March 2021, the PMC floated a tender for a loan of ₹200 crore. As per PMC officials, some of the banks approached the PMC, stating a “negotiable” interest rate but, avoiding being specific. Ulka Kalaskar, PMC’s chief account officer, said, “After floating tenders and calling for proposals we have not received much response from the banks, so far. We have decided to call the bank officials for a meeting and discuss the interest rates. At present, banks have only mentioned negotiable interest rates. We want exact interest rates to proceed on the loan.” Other senior officials of the PMC, requesting anonymity, said, “Due to Covid-19, most of the project works has been hampered. The deadline will be missed, and priorities have changed. Though PMC has a good credit rating (AA+), banks are over cautious about project completion. After all, it is a project loan. If it gets delayed or hampered, it will affect repayment of the loan.” He added, “At present, municipal bonds are not viable for PMC as interest rates by financial institutes are below 7 per cent.”In 2017, PMC raised ₹200 crore through municipal bonds at an interest rate of 7.59 per cent for 10 years. It also received one per cent concession from the central government for the municipal bonds. Hence, the PMC is paying ₹15 crore per year as interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-call-banks-for-meeting-to-push-for-24x7-water-project-loan-101620396359642.html

"Other than four-five people, we have not arrested anyone else though our investigations are on," a police officer probing the matter told PTI."We are not going by what's being circulated in the social media.We are limiting our investigation to what is there before us, that is, we are investigating only the bed blocking scam," the officer added. According to police, those who have been arrested in the 'bed blocking scam' are Nethravathi, Rohith, Venkat Subba Rao, Manjunath and Punith.Police said searches were carried out in the COVID war room on Thursday and technical data was obtained to check any irregularity.In addition to this, doctors, who are in charge of each zone war rooms, are being questioned.CCTV footage of all war rooms has already been collected and identification is being done about any unauthorised person in the war room and reasons for it, they said. BJP MP Tejasvi Surya had recently alleged that hospitals here 'blocked' beds in fake names to make money, at a time when COVID-19 cases were rising in Karnataka. Surya said officials of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike 'colluded' with private nursing homes and hospitals to block beds and reserve it for exorbitant fees.The Karnataka government has ordered reserving 80 per cent of the beds in the private hospitals for COVID patients.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (city corporation-BBMP) was assigned to allot beds for the COVID patients seeking treatment in private hospitals.However, due to the alarming rise in COVID cases, most of the beds are fully occupied even as the demand is growing manifold.To deal with the demand, the BBMP has set up nine COVID War Rooms at its zonal level and entrusted an employment firm to deploy its workforce on a contract basis.A BBMP official said the War Rooms have 214 people and not just 16 as has been presented by the BJP MP.Hitting out at Surya, Chamarajpet Congress MLA B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan Khan said in a video message:"There were over 205 employees of Crystal Company, who were deployed in the COVID War Room on contract basis but you singled out only 16 Muslims.How fair is this?..

Those found to be involved in such activities will be booked for selling and buying of kids under the Juvenile Justice Act 2016, said an officer of the Women and child development department. Child rights expert and lawyer Anant Kumar said, “Good intention is immaterial in these circumstances. Adopting children illegally and selling or purchasing them are serious crimes and are punishable with jail terms from 3 to 7 years. There should be a system to check the fake information and or any information which promotes illegal adoption and buying and selling of kids. Registering case against wrongdoers is a right step to stop such illegal activities”The department decided to take this step after messages, video appeals and photos of kids and bodies of their parents were shared by people to raise funds for the kids. When the officers of the department verified the authenticity of messages, many were found fake, said the officer quoted above. To prevent online fraud in name of adopting children, the Madhya Pradesh government will issue an order to all districts to book such persons under section 81 of the Juvenile Justice Act which has a provision of rigorous imprisonment of five years and a fine up to ₹1 lakh, said Suresh Tomar, joint director, women and child development department. Three days ago, a woman died of Covid-19 in Shivpuri district leaving behind her three kids. Different organisations started posting a video of the body of the woman to raise funds for her kids with a message that the kids lost their father two years ago and now they have lost their mother as well. A social media post claimed that the children are starving and locked inside their house. When a team of the WCD reached the spot, they found that the kids are staying with their paternal aunt and were doing fine, Tomar added. Officials said this was not the only case as there were many such viral messages seeking financial help for orphan kids who have lost one or both their parents due to Covid-19. Childline, Bhopal, director Archana Sahay said, “It is necessary to take strict steps to stop the illegal activities as Childline is flooding with such messages and mainly are fake ones. People are sharing pictures of kids with an appeal to adopt them. This is completely prohibited under JJ Act.” However, the department is also introducing a system to help the children in need. “We can’t trace every post on the social media so we have decided to take action against people, who are posting such messages. But to help children in need, we are introducing a helpline number for such kids and also putting district protection officers’ contact numbers. If anybody comes to know about orphaned kids, they can contact us for protection through child helpline,” said Swati Meena Naik, commissioner, WCD. “Child welfare committee will decide how to help these kids. First, we will search their relatives and if they agree to take care of the kids, we will provide them ₹2,000 per child as per Integrated Child Protection Scheme. If we don’t find any relatives, we will send them to shelter homes and initiate the process of adoption under CARA,” she added. The officer quoted above said the government will rope in NGOs and other genuine social organisations to help. “We are developing fit facilities in every district for children in need,” said the officer. Two days ago, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson, Priyank Kanungo, also cautioned state governments against social media posts to seek help or donations for orphaned children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/collecting-funds-online-for-kids-who-lose-parents-to-covid-19-to-be-cognizable-offence-101620390246545.html

They have not received additional stipends for almost nine months. On Friday, #BMCbetrayedus and #BetrayedStillWorking trended on Twitter as resident doctors took to social media to register their protest against the non-payment of stipends and arrears.In a statement on Wednesday, the Mumbai chapter of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said that doctors will shut down Covid services in the next seven days if the BMC does not release the stipends.“We do not want to stop our services to Covid-19 patients. We are hoping and trying that it does not come to that. We are putting up posters at the hospitals and making our voices heard as we continue our work,” said Arun Ghule, president, MARD, Mumbai.From May 2020 till January, over 3,000 resident doctors at the four BMC-run hospitals—KEM, Sion, Nair and Cooper—were paid ₹10,000 a month. It was then discontinued as Covid-19 cases started to go down. In September, the government announced an increase of ₹10,000 in the stipend for resident doctors. The BMC only released a circular regarding it in March.Also Read | War rooms, field hospitals helped Mumbai in battle of second wave: OfficialsWhen doctors demanded the arrears for the stipend increase, they said the BMC informed them that the arrears were adjusted against the ₹10,000 paid to them last year during the first Covid-19 wave. “This is unfair, especially since doctors have been working non-stop, risking their lives in the pandemic,” said Ghule.MARD said the arrears for each doctor amount to ₹1.2 lakh. Despite repeated attempts, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health, and TP Lahane, medical education director, were unavailable for comments.The Maharashtra State Association of Resident Doctors has also extended its support to the doctors in Mumbai. “This tragedy is greater than the pandemic Itself for the resident doctors.

There was no rush at the markets and people adhered to social distancing norms. The usually crowded Mall Road and The Ridge also wore a deserted look. All government and private institutions remained closed. Vehicles supplying essential goods and construction material also plied on the roads.Meanwhile, there were reports of liquor vends operating despite the ban during curfew in Rohru area of Shimla district.“We are asking the administration to fix timings for dhabas and restaurants too. What is the use of closing bars, if the eateries remain open? If people gather there, how the eateries will ensure adherence to social distancing norms in the absence of proper directions,” said president of Shimla Beopar Mandal Inderjeet Singh.Confusion over guidelines In Kangra district, the curfew evoked a mixed response. People moved freely in some parts while social distancing norms went for a toss in public and private transport.Most of the markets remained open as there was confusion due to the unclear guidelines.Atul Kumar, a shopkeeper in Kangra, said that the state government should have closed everything except daily needs shops.“However, almost everything is open except for cloth shops. The guidelines issued by the state and district authorities are not clear,” he said.There was also confusion related to weekend lockdown. As per the new guidelines, there will be no weekend lockdown. Kangra deputy commissioner (DC) Rakesh Prajapati said that Section 144 of the CrPC would be enforced in the state under which gathering of more than five persons is banned. People would be free to move out of their houses but cannot gather in groups of more than five. He clarified that weekend curfew will continue in the district.As per the state executive committee guidelines, hardware stores will remain open for uninterrupted construction activities.

It was then that I realised the extent of struggle that people are going through, for we faced a great difficulty in arranging a bed for him. That’s when I resolved to help others in need,” says Ghritashri Bhuyan Narula, the Delhi Police Northeast Representative (DPNER). Over the last fortnight, Narula has single-handedly helped many Delhiites find hospital beds, plasma, oxygen cylinders and more. “I get hundreds of queries, especially from people from the Northeast, and try to help everyone with right from arranging consultations with doctors to procuring medicines. I’m available 24X7 on calls for anyone in distress,” says Narula. As soon as she gets an enquiry, she starts making calls to all possible leads, verifying their authenticity amid the deluge of information circulating online, and then helps connect the people in need with the correct resources. “A big problem that I’m facing currently is the shortage of plasma donors. People aren’t coming out to donate, after recovering, for the fear of getting reinfected. I’m trying to convince more and more people to donate plasma, and have even managed to inspire a few.” The Delhi-based social worker is presently in talks with representatives in the Northeastern states to make essential medicines, including Remdesivir, available to the locals. “People from the Northeast who are based in Delhi, and need these medicines are calling me. But I can’t send medicines through someone because they may get lost en route... There is a nexus of black marketeers who are profiting from the current scenario, and I want to tell people to not to buy medicines from the black market as many are being duped. Only verified links should be approached,” she opines. It’s challenging to keep one going in such tough circumstances, but Narula says that when she sees recovery of people who she has helped, it gives her strength to carry on. She shares, “Recently, I got a call from a girl in Gurugram, who was Covid positive. Her oxygen level had dropped to 61. I had to make many calls to arrange for a cylinder and a mask, and also sent her medicines. After she was full recovered and I got to know about it, I felt how rewarding all this was.

07-05-2021||Mumbai||War rooms, field hospitals helped Mumbai in battle of second wave: Officials||A system of ward-level `war rooms' where hospital beds are allocated by civic officials and the decision not to dismantle field hospitals were key to Mumbai's success in tackling the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, officials believe.As much of the country is reeling under an unprecedented surge in cases, the "Mumbai model" has drawn appreciation even from the Supreme Court.Since May 1, Mumbai is reporting less than 4,000 cases every day, a significant fall from over 8,500 cases a day in the first week of April. On April 4, the city logged 11,163 cases, the highest so far. On May 6, it recorded 3,056 cases.To be sure, the financial capital of the country is still reporting more cases daily than the peak of 2,848 cases recorded on October 7 during the first wave last year.But there is no shortage of hospital beds and oxygen for patients, civic officials claimed.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court lauded the efforts of authorities to ensure adequate oxygen supply in Mumbai."Bombay Municipal Corporation is doing some great work, with no disrespect to Delhi. What they are doing, how they are managing, we can learn from them."I also understand that Maharashtra also produces oxygen which Delhi cannot do," said a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud, hearing pleas on the dire situation in Delhi.As the second wave began, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation focused on testing, contact tracing and treatment besides ensuring that people followed guidelines.But the decision not to take down the infrastructure put in place during the first wave proved to be more crucial."There would have been chaos if we hadn't kept jumbo COVID centres (field hospitals), oxygen beds, ICU beds ready before the start of second wave," said Mayor Kishori Pednekar.Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani, who insisted that jumbo centres should not be dismantled till March 31, said the BMC was ready for a new surge."The whole system -- oxygen, catering, house keeping, doctors and nurses -- was in place at jumbo centres," he said.The civic body continued to augment availability of oxygen and ICU beds and medicine stocks, he said."This is why the BMC had sufficient stock of Remdesivir when everywhere there was a shortage," Kakani said.The number of beds was doubled from around 12,000 to 24,000 within a month when cases began to rise in February. At present, Mumbai has 31,695 Covid-19 beds, including 12,754 oxygen beds and 2,929 ICU ones.There is no shortage of medical oxygen in the city now, but there were some scary moments when on the night of April 16-17 the BMC had to shift 168 Covid-19 patients from six civic hospitals as oxygen supply ran out.Learning a lesson, it started monitoring the movement of oxygen cylinders from plants to hospitals in real time."We have now deputed six officers at control rooms to ensure seamless supply of oxygen. There is also a monitoring committee headed by a deputy commissioner," Kakani added.During the first wave, the BMC set up a `war room' in each of the 24 wards to guide patients. Thanks to this system, people are not needed to run from one hospital to another in search of beds, as allocation of beds is done by war room officials.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said during a recent interview to the Indian Express that war rooms, dashboards for bed management, prohibition of release of test report directly to patients and the decision not to dismantle jumbo Covid facilities proved useful.The system is on "auto pilot" now, he said."When I joined, we did not have a dashboard, our control room operators used to check with individual hospitals if a bed is available," he said.After the April 17 incident when oxygen in six hospitals ran out, the BMC sought a protocol for oxygen consumption from the Maharashtra government's Covid-19 task force.It was decided that oxygen saturation level need not be maintained beyond 94 per cent, high-flow nasal oxygen should not be used indiscriminately, and there should be an oxygen consumption audit, Chahal said. The protocol was conveyed to all 176 hospitals in the city.Mayor Pednekar said the BMC also focused on setting up oxygen plants. "We didn't rely only on oxygen cylinders, but we set up liquid oxygen plants. Because of this, not a single person died due to lack of oxygen," she said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's decision to enforce fresh lockdownalso helped, she noted.The civic body has already started preparing for the possible third wave of the pandemic, she said.The number of jumbo Covid facilities will be increased from nine to 15, including dedicated facilities for children and the disabled, Pednekar said."Jumbo centres, dashboard, oxygen supply and all other things worked effectively. Their effectiveness was visible in last three-four weeks. This infrastructure needs to be maintained because one can not predict if Covid-19 has run its course or not," said Dr Om Shrivastava,an infectious diseases expert who is a member of the state task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/war-rooms-field-hospitals-helped-mumbai-in-battle-of-second-wave-officials-101620388210971.html

If there is a total lockdown, the government should give at least a 48-hour notice to people to prepare,” he said. He sought better management of health institutions and added that of the 15,306 posts of doctor and paramedical staff in the state, 5,984 posts were vacant. “These vacancies should be filled at the earliest. The AIIMS at Bilaspur, which is under construction for six years, should be made functional as soon as possible,” Rohit Thakur said. He said to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control as it happened in Delhi and other cities, oxygen plants should be made functional in all medical colleges and major hospitals. He urged the state government to provide help to the agriculture, horticulture and tourism sectors, which are the mainstays of Himachal Pradesh’s economy Vinay Kumar, the Congress MLA from Renuka and former chief parliamentary secretary, said the testing needs to be stepped up and community health centres should be equipped for it.

Hence GST needs to be exempted completely,” Patnaik wrote.Last month, Patnaik had announced that Odisha would give free Covid vaccines to 1.93 crore people in the 18-44 age group that would cost it around ₹2,000 crore. A finance department official said though the state would get half the amount of 12 per cent GST imposed on the vaccines, even that amount would burden the state exchequer in the pandemic year.The chief minister has also sought financial assistance to states from cess and surcharges collected by the government of India.Patnaik in his letter said it was important that the states are supported so that the entire country fights as one. “Lack of finances should not affect any state as it might affect the entire country in turn. Hence, the additional resources raised through various cess and surcharges on petrol, diesel, liquor etc which are exclusively available to the Union government may be suitably shared with state governments at this critical juncture.“Sharing of financial assistance with states will strengthen the fight against the pandemic including the provision of vaccinations, free treatment, undertaking preventive measures and so on,” he wrote.Odisha and several other states have been demanding that the Centre should share a part of the revenue it is earning from fuel via excise duty, cess and surcharge as the central devolution to states has gone down by 20 per cent. Last year, the Centre earned over ₹3 lakh crore through cess and surcharge on fuel. The central government in March told the Parliament that since May 2020, it has been earning ₹33 per litre of petrol and ₹32 on a litre of diesel in form of central excise duty, including basic excise duty, cess and surcharge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-cm-writes-to-finance-minister-seeking-waiver-of-gst-on-covid-19-vaccine-purchase-101620386279421.html

After the break in March and April, when prices had either stabilised or declined, they have started to soar from May 4.The transporters have expressed deep discontent over the price fuel price hike and especially the record prices of diesel.“Now passenger transport is completely closed and only goods transportation is going on. Most transportation is of the essential goods as the pandemic is raging. The hike in diesel price is a major blow to the transporters.

So much so that most of my acquaintances are talking about skills as much as they are talking about Covid-19. Apparently, it’s Covid-19 that’s got them worried about it in the first place. You see, the world is changing. “Do you know that 85 million jobs are likely to be displaced because of emerging technology?” “Where did you read that?” “I don’t remember where! I don’t have any of the skills required for all the new jobs! That’s what matters!” “But you already have a good job,” I pointed out. “But that job may not be there in the future, see?” Now all conversations are not so panic-stricken: “Can’t talk right now, am busy doing online courses,” “Which course?” “Many courses. Leadership, Design Thinking, Critical Thinking, Programming, Sustainability,” “But you are 12! Why aren’t you playing online games and being a kid?!” “The future is coming, without these new skills I won’t succeed.” So, I stopped to think. What skills do I have? What is success? And what is failure? And why haven’t I been thinking about it? In school I remember playing. And reading. And writing. And making and doing and talking. Oh yes, I remember talking a lot. In class. And therefore, kneeling in front of the classroom because talking in class wasn’t such a good thing when the teacher was teaching. And then, I remember talking across the classroom as I was serving my punishment (kneeling), and so I would be sent outside the classroom to kneel there so that everyone passing by would know I was punished. And there, in that lonely corridor, I would talk to teachers, and students and staff who happen to pass by. I think by the time I reached Grade 2, the whole school knew I was a talkative kid. I think I can put it down as a skill then. I got through school and college well enough. Not at the top, not near the bottom, not in the middle, but well enough. And I didn’t worry about getting a score, or fret about what would happen if I didn’t get a good enough score. I didn’t sit for competitive exams, didn’t aim to be an engineer or pilot or doctor, or anything actually. Through college and after, I took up many jobs and learned stuff and did stuff and wrote stuff and then, I discussed it with others, and then, I read and wrote and did and discussed some more, and so on. I held 11 jobs from age 18 through 24. I remember friends and family being worried about me all the time and telling me that I shouldn’t quit jobs so soon, because I wouldn’t be able to build a career. I didn’t stop to think about all that good advice because I was restless and obsessed with finding out who I am, what I could do, what I liked, didn’t like. Today, when I stop and give my back-trail a thought, I would say my life is a perpetual “work-in-progress”. I am just the same kid I was in school, in awe of all that is around me. Asking, running, doing, writing and talking - always talking still - and thrilled with the gift: How beautiful is life! Everything is in motion, occurring simultaneously, nothing is complete, not my work, not my learning, not my youth or middle age or childhood. I am father and child at the same time! Only at the end of my life, will it all be complete. So on the matter of skills, yes, there is a List of Future Skills. It comes from the World Economic Forum’s report on the Future of Jobs (it’s available free from the WEF site). Nasscom has one too, as does Pearson, and many other organisations. The long and short of it is that yes, there’re changes happening right now. There will always be changes in the world we live in. If you are in a job or looking for one, or changing one or studying to get a job soon, it is important to remember that the rules of figuring out how to make a living aren’t too complicated. Figure out what the world needs. Figure out what you are good at, what you are great at, and what you suck at. Then see if the world needs anything that you are good or great at. If not, then see if you can learn to become better at some of the stuff the world does need. If the world doesn’t need what you are good at, then you’ll just have to pick a range of jobs you can become efficient at, without losing your mind because you have to do it 8-10 hours a day. Then, do what you want the rest of the time. That’s what the gig economy’s all about anyway. Whichever way you go, there’s not much point fretting your way through it all.Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

07-05-2021||Delhi||Battle for survival vs greed: Strict action demanded||The deadly second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has brought strangers together offline and online, trying to help each other in every way possible. Even the heartbreaking stories of death and bereavement have not stopped some from indulging in unethical and immoral practices such as black-marketing of medical life-saving necessities, hoarding and cheating in the name of Covid-19 medical supplies and charging exorbitant fees for ambulance service. The Delhi Police recently seized 419 oxygen concentrators after they raided a fine-dining restaurant, Nege & Ju in Lodhi Colony. These were being sold at an exorbitant price of ₹69,999 with fake MRP stickers pasted on them. And in the latest development, 96 oxygen concentrators were confiscated from Khan Chacha, a popular food joint in Khan Market. City’s eminent personalities call for strict actions against perpetrators of such illegal and inhuman activities when Delhi-NCR is reeling under the worst crisis ever. AD Singh, managing director, and co-founder, Olive Group of Restaurants, recalls being victim to a fraudulent incident. “In my own family, my mother in law was tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of a trip while the rest of us tested negative. Ten days later, we saw in the papers that a doctor at the lab and the collection agents involved were arrested for running a scam and giving random results and pocketing the tests fees,” he says. He feels lucky to have survived but believes that it was criminal behaviour.He adds, “There is a huge need for medical supplies in the city including oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders, and key medicines. Despicably this has led to a roaring black market and a huge number of scams making a very difficult situation for all of us even worse.”Model Sonalika Sahay feels that unprecedented times shows extreme behaviours of humans. “There are people like Sonu Sood working relentlessly and even auto-rickshaw drivers trying to save lives with no resources because they want to help people around. And on the other hand, some are trying to make a quick buck when people are losing their lives,” says Sahay who reiterates that this is not the time to make money but open hearts and come together.Resonating with Sahay’s view, designer Rahul Mishra too feels tough times shows true colours and real side of human beings as he elaborates, “It’s a privilege for many to be able to be at home protecting our loved ones while corona warriors are out there fighting and saving lives. But taking advantage of such a situation, becoming greedy of opportunities and hoarding and black marketing life saving drugs - people really need to introspect.” Mishra also feels, “When masses at large are scared and there is panic buying, it leads to giving big sharks opportunities to hoard and black-market.”Designer, JJ Valaya, feels that the pandemic has shaken India like never before is known to all, yet in the midst of all this and shockingly, greed thrives in the form of hoarders and black marketeers who are exploiting sickness for profits. He says, “They will be dealt the hand of fate when karma comes knocking but all of us too have a similar responsibility of not hoarding life-saving medicines and oxygen because of our fear ... our insecurities are costing needy patients their lives and we must do all we can to help, not hoard. Let’s all be an empathetic part of creating solutions and miracles will happen.”FDCI chairman, Sunil Sethi, too narrates an incident where they had to run from pillar to post in search of medicines but were fortunate to be able to manage at nominal price. He says, ”The problem is of 10 times the cost of medicines, scrupulous activities – which is neither acceptable to me, nor to the citizen of the country. However, when there’s a black marketer, there are good Samaritans who are coming forward to offer free of cost help. I am fortunate to be connected with them. My heart goes out to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/struggle-for-survival-during-the-second-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-hit-by-greed-strict-action-demanded-101620382499720.html
07-05-2021||Other||‘Make Covid-19 negative certificate mandatory to enter’: HC tells Goa govt||The Bombay High Court at Goa has directed the Goa government to make it mandatory for all people arriving in Goa to have tested negative for Covid-19 saying that there was “no justification … [for] not insisting upon a negativity certificate from persons who seek entry into Goa at this crucial juncture.”“We see no justification in the state of Goa not insisting upon a negativity certificate from persons who seek entry into Goa at this crucial juncture when reports indicate that the positivity rate in Goa is as high as 52%,” the Bombay High Court at Goa bench of Justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar said. Hearing a bunch of petitions filed by a group of lawyers, activists and volunteers, the High Court ruled that while making sure that no Covid-19 positive person enters the state, its directions were not meant as an order to ‘seal the state’s borders’ while also directing that essential supplies to the state were not hampered. Noting that the state government should have come up with restrictions on its own (without waiting for the intervention of the High Court), the High Court said that it was unfair to the state’s resident population that Goa being a tourist destination was being cited as a reason for not making it mandatory for a negative test on arrival. “Based on this unrestricted entry, Goa is touted as one of the few tourist destinations where all is well. This is neither fair to the populace in Goa already suffering from the overstretched medical infrastructure nor to the unsuspecting tourists who have to very often avail of the overstretched facilities at a great price,” the High Court observed.“By way of an interim order, we direct the state Administration to ensure that no persons are permitted entry into the state unless they possess a negativity certificate obtained within 72 hours from the time they seek entry into the state,” the High Court ruled.The High Court has, however, allowed the state government to seek a modification of its orders on Covid negative certification before entry into the state, provided the state government sets out its reasons in detail through an affidavit that should be filed by Monday. “Until modified, however, a negativity certificate will be a must for entry into the state of Goa,” the High Court said.The state Advocate General had argued against making it mandatory for people to either produce a Covid negative certificate or be tested upon arrival telling the court that “the decision as to whether a negativity certificate should be insisted upon or not is basically a policy decision.”“Goa has to rely on its neighbouring states for most of the essential supplies and the insistence of any such negative certificate will again impact supplies. Even the central government does not support sealing borders of any states during these times,” he told the court. The High Court, however, wasn’t convinced. “No doubt, some difficulties are bound to arise when it comes to essential supplies… For this, the state administration will have to come out with some adequate protocol to ensure that the essential supplies are not disturbed and at the same time, Covid positive persons are not granted easy entry into the state whose medical infrastructure is already overstretched… but citing such instances to justify wholesale waiver of restrictions in such critical times is not justifiable,” the High Court said.“This is only a case where steps are taken to ensure that the persons who are entering into Goa are not already tested as COVID positive so that they do not contribute to the spread of the epidemic and at the same time are cared for better in their own state,” the High Court said. The High Court has also asked the government to file a status report on the availability of oxygen, beds, crucial drugs as well as to make operational mechanism so that the people know how many beds are available, where and what type as well as to provide security to doctors performing their duties. Goa recorded 3,869 fresh cases of Covid-19 the highest single-day tally since the pandemic began while continuing to report a positivity rate of 51% for the second day in a row. 58 deaths were recorded in 24-hour period ending on Thursday taking the state’s toll to 1501, while nearly 30,000 people -- nearly 2% of the state’s population -- are currently active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/make-covid-19-negative-certificate-mandatory-to-enter-hc-tells-goa-govt-101620382319248.html

07-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi burial grounds out of space with Covid death toll high||Abdul Wahid, a resident of east Delhi’s Khichripur area, wanted to bury his 55-year-old woman neighbour, who had succumbed to Covid-19, at the nearby Mulla Colony burial ground on Monday. But he, like many others, were turned away by the burial ground for want of space, Wahid said.“We got her admitted to GTB Hospital on Sunday -- she had some lung infection. However, she succumbed to the virus on Monday. Hospital authorities told us we could choose one of three burial grounds -- at Mulla Colony, Shastri Park, or ITO-Delhi Gate. The first two refused to accommodate the body, leaving us in a fix,” said Wahid.The family then had to arrange for the burial at the ITO-Delhi Gate facility, which is already full, given the sharp rise in daily fatalities due to Covid. The second wave of Covid-19 across the country -- and the fourth in Delhi -- has turned out to be the deadliest one yet in terms of cases and deaths. Delhi is currently recording an average of 23,000 new Covid cases and 375 deaths over the past six days.Amid such high numbers, several smaller burial grounds have been facing a shortage of space and are having to turn away bodies.Also Read | Glimmer of hope: Covid care facility at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj SahibSuleiman Ali, who manages the one acre Shastri Park burial ground in north-east Delhi, said they have been turning away Covid bodies for 15 days now. “In April itself, we buried around 100 bodies, well beyond the capacity of 25 bodies a month. We had no space left and had to divert the bodies to other burial spaces. We have also asked our attached hospital [GTB hospital] to send bodies elsewhere.”Ali said the burial ground committee has decided to hold meetings with managements of nearby burial grounds to figure out a way to handle the crisis.East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said apart from the two burial grounds designated for Covid burials -- Mulla Colony and Shastri Nagar -- they were also preparing burial facilities at Sunder Nagri. “We are currently in the process of preparing the Sunder Nagri burial ground to accommodate more bodies. We have also asked local burial grounds, including Mulla Colony and Shastri Park, to try and accommodate more bodies instead of sending them elsewhere.”The three civic bodies have allotted five burial grounds for Covid-19 deaths -- ITO-Delhi Gate, Mangolpuri, Mulla Colony, Shastri Park and Madanpur Khadar. Since the smaller burial grounds have refused to take in more bodies, the load falls on the ground at ITO-Delhi Gate, which is one of the largest burial grounds in the capital.Mohammad Shamim, supervisor at the ITO-Delhi Gate burial ground, said, “We have been facing a space crunch for about two weeks and have informed the Waqf board about it. We have been assured of another plot. But unless we get that, we have to struggle to accommodate all bodies and, sometimes, we are forced to divert them elsewhere.”Amanatullah Khan, chairman of the Delhi Waqf Board, which manages most burial grounds in the capital, said there are around 45 active burial grounds in the national capital of which five have been allocated for Covid burials.“The number of burials has dwindled in the past week and most burial grounds are receiving fewer than 10 bodies a day. The ITO kabristan received 10 bodies in the past two days. We have another burial ground near Indraprastha and have been in touch with the police to allow burials there as well,” he said.Last week, Khan also provided assistance to the Okhla burial ground to use the adjacent plot after they reported a shortage of space. “Due to the shortage of space and issues faced by burial grounds, we have also asked people to bury their dead by following Covid protocols in their localities itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-burial-grounds-out-of-space-with-covid-death-toll-high-101620377398591.html

They are not abiding by our warnings. Hence, lockdown could be inevitable," he told reporters near Annamma Devi Temple here ahead of a crucial meeting later Friday in view of the alarming rise in coronavirus cases.According to him, the government will finalise in a day or two about the stringent measures required to control Covid."If people wish that stringent measures should not be taken, then people should cooperate by wearing masks and maintaining social distancing," the Chief Minister said.Otherwise, strong measures will become necessary, he added.Regarding the oxygen crisis, Yediyurappa said he has been trying to resolve the issue honestly.To a question on Covid patients and their relatives coming to the CM's house and Vidhana Soudha seeking a hospital bed, he said this was improper and people should stop it."I won't say it is wrong to voice their woes. I understand their sufferings and I am trying to resolve their problems because we are pro-people," the Chief Minister said.He said people should avoid coming to CM House or Vidhana Soudha as the officials would get in touch with them.The Chief Minister hailed Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya for exposing the hospital bed scam in which the beds reserved for Covid patients in private hospitals were blocked by a few people and allotted for a bribe."Tejasvi Surya had obtained the list (of scamsters) after much effort and brought the irregularities in allotment of bed to the Covid patients to the notice of the government," Yediyurappa said.He, however, took a dig at Congress MLA and former minister B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan for speaking ill of Tejasvi Surya.Yediyurappa was referring to the expose`by the young MP and BJP Yuva Morcha president Tejasvi Surya who claimed that 4,065 hospital beds were blocked and allotted for a bribe in the city.During the live expose, Surya read out the names of 17 Muslims, who were deployed at the Covid war room, seeking their credentials.The Basavanagudi BJP MLA Ravi Subramanya, who accompanied Surya, asked the officials whether they have converted the COVID War Room into a Madrassa.Taking strong exception to framing only Muslims, Khan said in a video message in social media as to why Surya did not see anyone else other than Muslims."There were 205 employees of Crystal Company, who were deployed in the Covid War Room on contract basis but you singled out only 16 Muslims. How fair is this? It shows how venomous you are, Tejasvi Surya," Khan said.Khan even claimed that only one person, Mohammed Zaid was assigned with the task of bed allotment while others were given different jobs.The Covid cases in Karnataka have increased at an alarming proportion.The state is reporting about 50,000 cases daily and has about 5.5 lakh active cases.The daily fatalities too were exceeding 300.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lockdown-could-be-inevitable-in-k-taka-if-people-do-not-cooperate-yediyurappa-101620375300059.html
07-05-2021||Bangalore||After Tejasvi Surya’s comments, police quiz 16 Muslim Covid warriors: Official||Sixteen Muslim men, whose names were read out by Bengaluru south MP Tejasvi Surya, were questioned till 3 am on Wednesday after the WhatsApp chats alleged that they were “terrorists”. Even though these men were not mentioned in any of the FIRs registered by the Bengaluru police in connection with the “bribe for bed” scam, they were allegedly questioned after the MP raised questions about their qualifications, said an official of Jayanagar police station.Describing the events that followed Suraya’s remarks, a manager at the agency Shivu Naayak said soon after their names started coming on social media, they came to the office seeking help. “They were concerned because the messages that followed MP’s remarks called them terrorists. On Tuesday, Jayanagar police contacted us, and all the 16 employees and I were summoned to the police station,” he said.He added that all of them were questioned till 3 am and they were left off, with instruction that they should report police when required.Following the interrogation, all the men have been placed under suspension by the agency until the police investigation is over. “These 16 men are currently placed under suspension till the allegation against them is cleared. They will not be paid during their suspension; however, they have been told that they will get their jobs back once the enquiry is over,” Naik added.The manager dismissed the allegation that these men were involved in a bed booking scam. “WhatsApp messages are calling them terrorists, but except for one person, none of them was directly involved in bed booking. They were responsible for the helpline, home isolation, indexing, death and discharge. Even the person working in the bed allotment had joined recently,” he added.Talking about recruitment, he said that none of them was recruited together. They were among the many candidates who applied and got selected for the post.During the inspection on the centre as part of exposing the bribe for bed scam on Tuesday, Surya, who was accompanied by MLAs Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya, was seen reading out the names of the 16 Muslim employees at the centre and demanded the qualifications of these persons.Soon after the MP’s press conference about his inspection, a WhatsApp message titled “List of terrorists working in BBMP WAR ROOM killing thousands of Bengalurians” began doing rounds in Bengaluru. The message listed 16 of the 17 names mentioned by the Surya in his live stream. HT could not ascertain the origin of the WhatsApp message.On Thursday, workers of Karnataka Pradesh Congress filed a criminal complaint against Surya for making communal and inflammatory remarks during his visit to the BBMP south zone war room. Five different complaints have been filed against Surya by Congress leaders and workers across the city.Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Harish Pandey denied that any person other than those relevant to the investigation has been called for interrogation. “The doctors who were in custody have given the names of a few people and we have questioned them. We are not following any particular list that has been doing rounds on social media. We are following police procedures. We have questioned only those who were relevant to the case,” he said.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress on Thursday alleged that MP Tejasvi Surya and a party MLA, were behind the scam involving blocking of hospital beds meant for Covid patients in the city. The Congress mounted the attack citing reports in a section of the media alleging BJP MLA Sathish Reddy’s involvement.“It’s like the pot calling the kettle black. The truth has come out now that the BJP leaders are behind the bed blocking scam. Arrest Satish Reddy who has been operating the bed booking scam with the help of his supporters, and the young MP (Tejasvi Surya) who accompanied him, and carry out a detailed investigation,” the Congress tweeted.Satish Reddy was not available for his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/after-tejasvi-surya-s-comments-police-quiz-16-muslim-covid-warriors-official-101620372633145.html

Two live pangolins, one adult female and a cub, were recovered from the accused who have been booked under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) by the Maharashtra forest department.Pangolins are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Act, putting them in the same bracket as tigers, lions, rhinos and several other species. Smuggling or hunting of pangolins -- which are classified as endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species -- attracts the highest penalties as per the law.Also Read | Wildlife board meeting raises concerns on ecotourism in forestsThursday’s arrest was made in Navghar region of the Sudhagad Pali forest reserve in Alibag.

With a capacity of 250 oxygen beds, and all other services absolutely free of cost, this centre is nothing short of a glimmer of hope that one needs in such times of crisis, when the second wave of Covid is posing serious obstacles to those critical patients who are looking for hospital beds. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, says this facility will be “dedicated to humanity”. “Hospitals mein jagah nahin hain. People need oxygen, which is also not available. So many people have been calling us. Itni umeed se phone karte hain ki shayad unki jaan bach jaayegi,” says Sirsa, whose team has worked day and night to put in place the infrastructure at the facility, within a span of one week! The hall that has been converted into a Covid care facility has a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 people. “It was earlier used for religious and social purposes... This is the place where Guru Tegh Bahadur was cremated. And this is the first instance when we are using it for medical purposes; considering Guru Sahib ki jagah hai, sab jaldi theek bhi ho jayenge!” says Sirsa, hopeful that the Omnipotent will heal and bless everyone. He adds: “The doctors will be staying here as well, and we’ll be providing every facility ranging from medicines to doctors and nurses. We’ve imported oxygen concentrators from New York and Singapore, and more are lined up. Today, we have 200 concentrators and 150 oxygen cylinders with us. So we can use both together. Plus we have 15 ambulances as well. In the next one week, we’re getting another 100 bedded hospital.” The facility, which will be operational from May 10, will also be connected to an ICU hospital in case of any emergencies. “Health minister Satyendar Jain has suggested that we run it as a 400 bed facility. He said that they will link it to one newly made special ICU hospital, and in case of emergency the patient could be transferred to the ICU as well,” informs Sirsa. A volunteer at this centre, Gurmeet Singh Tinku, says, “God has gifted us humanity. I’ll be helping here with langar, three times a day. Kayi sansthaye humare saath mil ke kaam kar rahi hain. Humari yehi koshish rehti hai ki jis patient ki need kahi aur poori nahin ho paa rahi, uski need yahan poori ho.”Jujhar Singh, another volunteer, who will be helping by providing milk, fruits and dry fruits to the patients, says, “Itna bada centre banana aasan kaam nahin tha. Aur ab jab ye banke almost tayyar hai toh hygienic and nutritious food is very important to provide, since a Covid patient needs it to recover soon. One patient needs 2,000+ calories, and we consider it as our responsibility to provide it!”Author tweets @Nainaaroa8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/glimmer-of-hope-covid-care-facility-at-gurdwara-rakab-ganj-sahib-101620371116595.html

Residents of border villages of Shaktot and Churup, who have started sowing crops, noticed that the PLA has operationalised its stone-crusher for raw material to build the post. An Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) recce team also reported seeing PLA officials inspecting the road and foot bridges across the Pareechu, a tributary of the Spiti river. Also read: Year after Gogra trespass, PLA dragging feet over restoring status quo antePareechu originates in Indian territory but meanders back in the mountains of China before reaching the confluence with Spiti. A glacial lake burst on the course of the Pareechu on the Chinese side in 2004 and damaged road bridges on the banks of the Spiti and its main Sutlej river, also known as the powerhouse of the Himalayas for its hydel potential. During the routine recce recently, the ITBP patrol reported seeing PLA soldiers, who had arrived in a vehicle, negotiating with the stone-crusher owner to supply construction material. The PLA is building more roads and buildings in the upper regions of Barangkali. A permanent army camp of China is located at Dunmur village close to the Indian border post at Lepcha. There has been no construction activity along the Indian border for the past one year. Himachal Pradesh shares a 260-km border with China in Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts. Of the total border length, 140km is in Kinnaur district, while 80km falls in Lahaul and Spiti district. Five battalions of the ITBP guard the border with China in the state. In all, there are 20 ITBP posts along the border and Kaurik is a sensitive one being the last village beyond Sumdoh. Last year, after the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh, China accelerated road construction at Tango and Yamrang, which are close to Chitkul and Charang villages on the Indian side. Both Yamrang and Tango are in China-controlled Tibetan Autonomous Region. China stepped up activity in the region after air incursions in Kaurik sector in April last year. Chinese helicopters violated Indian airspace twice in April 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chinas-pla-resumes-building-border-post-along-kaurik-in-hp-101620367078126.html

07-05-2021||Lucknow||Oximeters, thermal scanners at UP's 'gaushalas'||Amid the surge in coronavirus cases, the Uttar Pradesh government is providing oximeters and thermal scanners for cows housed in the state’s ‘gaushalas’.That is what a government press release said. But an official later clarified that the medical equipment was meant for people who work at the ‘gaushalas’.A recent press release from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s office also said the state government has issued instructions to set up help desks in every district for the welfare of cows, taking forward its cow protection agenda.The government has issued instructions that all cowsheds must strictly follow the Covid-19 protocol, and made wearing masks and frequent thermal screening mandatory there.The press release on cowsheds said the ‘gaushalas’ will be “equipped with all the medical equipment such as oximeters and thermal scanners for cows and other animals as well”."In view of the current Covid situation, a total of 700 help desks for the welfare of cows have been set up across the districts of the state. With this, 51 oximeters and 341 thermal scanners have also been provided to ensure better animal care and testing," it said.The statement said stray cows in large numbers are being given shelter at the 'gaushalas' due to the efforts of the chief minister.The government is also rapidly increasing the number of the existing cow shelters to deal with the stray cattle menace, it said.Giving overall figures, it said 5,268 cow protection centres have ensured the well-being of 5,73,417 animals so far in the state. Apart from these, there are larger cow sanctuaries as well in the state.The statement also referred to “fodder banks”, set up during Adityanath’s tenure. There are 3,452 of them, feeding stray cattle.Under the "Mukhya Mantri Besahara Gauvansh Sahbhagita Yojana", the UP government gives ₹900 per month to farmers who take care of stray cattle.In 2020-21, the state government gave ₹38.98 crore to 130 cow shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/oximeters-thermal-scanners-at-up-s-gaushalas-101620363075111.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||What is the Mumbai 02 model and how it cracked the code||When the worst surge in infections amid the second Covid-19 wave triggered oxygen shortage across the country, Mumbai fell back upon 15 big and 11 smaller Liquid Medical Oxygen [LMO] tanks installed at six hospitals and as many jumbo Covid-19 centres between May and June last year. The tanks helped meet the daily demand for medical oxygen that went up from 210 metric tonnes (MT) in the first wave to 270 (MT) last month.“Building the additional LMO tanks helped us cope during the second wave,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said.The success in coping prompted the Supreme Court on Wednesday to ask the Centre and the Delhi government to examine the “Mumbai model” of optimal utilisation of oxygen. It said the Delhi government should consider replicating this model as Mumbai has also made arrangements for buffer storage.Velrasu said the tanks, their construction, fitting, and piping, cost them over ₹14 crore. “At that point, we did not know if they would be utilised, but we still went ahead and created that infrastructure.”LMO tanks are highly pressurised and installed on reinforced concrete structures. They require certification by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation under the ministry of commerce and industry, which has been overseeing the supply and distribution of oxygen during the crisis.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai’s civic body, plans to build 10 more LMOs in preparation for a possible third wave expected anytime between July and September.Also Read | 414,188 new Covid cases recorded in India in biggest daily spike, 3,915 deathsIn April, when the city’s daily average cases touched 7,786, many patients were shifted from one hospital to another due to a shortfall of oxygen. For instance, 168 patients were alone moved out of six government hospitals to jumbo centres on April 17 after oxygen supply was affected.The BMC has announced the appointment of six officials for coordination between oxygen suppliers, assistant municipal commissioners of the 24 civic wards, and the Food and Drug Administration. The officials will be responsible for maintaining the existing oxygen supplies and ensuring they are used sparingly.Civic officials said they have also ensured the safe transportation of oxygen cylinders. Only two BMC-run hospitals, Kasturba Hospital and HBT Trauma Care, have oxygen generation plants. Other big hospitals have LMO tanks, which are refilled at least once daily. Other hospitals rely on oxygen cylinders. All hospitals are mandated to keep cylinders as a backup. When the crisis hit, the civic body deployed six quick response vehicles to ferry cylinders and concentrators to hospitals in need.“Ward-level teams were formed to coordinate and move surplus oxygen from one site to another...,” said Krishna H Perekar, BMC’s chief engineer.Officials said a resource inventory of oxygen use and infrastructure at hospitals proved helpful. Oxygen was often supplied to suburbs such as Navi Mumbai and Thane. “Our inventory has micro-details like the number of jumbo oxygen cylinders, dura cylinders, and capacity of the LMO tanks at all hospitals. We also have exact details of the oxygen usage at each hospital,” Velrasu said. “We formed crack teams to ensure that the LMO tanks reach Mumbai smoothly. These teams were also deployed at the cylinder refilling plant at Navi Mumbai to ensure that Mumbai gets its quota of cylinders.”At the peak of the oxygen demand, Mumbai faced a shortfall of 15 to 20MT oxygen. This was managed by moving surplus stock from one place to another and seeking oxygen from Gujarat.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force also recommended that doctors should stop the use of High Flow Nasal Cannula (HNFC) to deliver oxygen (up to 80 litres/min) when the demand increased last month. Hospitals were encouraged to use Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machines, which deliver oxygen either through a flowmeter (up to 15 litres/min) or a non-invasive ventilator (up to 30 litres/min), and with lower pressure.“Soon after the advisory, we completely stopped use of HNFC and alternatively started using non-invasive ventilation such as BiPAP,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BMC-run Nair Hospital.Dr Gautam Bhansali of the Bombay Hospital said that they reduced the use of HNFC too. “It is hard to completely stop its use because most patients are comfortable with the nasal cannula. With the BiPAP, we have to use a face mask which some patients find uncomfortable.”The BMC plans to set up 16 oxygen generation plants at 12 hospitals to reduce the dependence on LMO and cylinders. “We may still require LMOs as they provide better pressure, mainly for patients in the Intensive Care Units,” said Velrasu. “But having oxygen plants at all facilities will reduce the dependency to a large extent.”On Thursday, the Bombay high court said BMC chief Iqbal Chahal should hold a video conference with other municipal bodies and explain how the city managed the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/whats-the-mumbai-model-sc-has-asked-delhi-to-emulate-to-deal-with-o2-crisis-101620362397320.html

He only spoke his 'Mann Ki Baat'. It would have been better if he would have talked business and heard the issues," the Jharkhand chief minister said in a tweet.Official sources said Soren was unhappy as he was not allowed to present the issues concerning his state before Modi and instead, it was only the prime minister who talked about the Covid-19 situation.Jharkhand is among the 10 states and Union territories that are collectively accounting for over 75 per cent of daily Covid-19 deaths in the country, according to latest data. The others in the league are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.Jharkhand reported 133 Covid-19 fatalities on Thursday, taking the death toll due to the viral disease in the state to 3,479, while 6,974 cases pushed the state's infection tally to 2,70,089.The mortality rate in the state remains higher at 1.28 per cent against the national mortality rate of 1.10 per cent.

These oxygen storage tanks played a crucial role for Mumbai, which saw its daily demand for medical oxygen go up from 210 metric tonnes (MT) in the first wave to 270 (MT) in the past month alone.The “Mumbai model” has won praise from both the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court. The apex court on Wednesday appreciated Mumbai’s efforts and recommended that the Centre and Delhi take a cue on how to handle oxygen supply in the face of the severe shortage that the Capital city has been facing for the past three weeks.So what did Mumbai do to control the crisis?“Building the additional LMO tanks helped us cope during the second wave,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said.Also read | Air ambulance lands on belly in Mumbai as wheel falls off in NagpurIn April, the city’s daily average cases had touched 7,786 and this is when the oxygen crisis was felt most keenly.

The most crushing consequence —“I want my daughters to have a good education. I’m unable to give it to them.”“I’m helpless,” he says, chatting on the phone from his one-room home in Sheetla Colony. It’s seven in the morning, and Mr Nivediya woke up a while ago. A tailor, his wife and son died some years ago, leaving him alone to take care of his two girls. Every morning he rides a bicycle to his little establishment in Sector 31, but is obliged to stay at home due to the lockdown. “My earnings plummeted since the start of the bimari (disease), most customers stopped coming.”Some kind acquaintances, including long-time patrons in the apartments, have helped him survive this tough period, giving him cash and sometimes food rations.But that’s not enough to support the education of his daughters, he admits. The private school closest to home, he explains, is unaffordable for him, and the government school “is beyond a road where my girls might not be safe”. Until early last year, Harshita and Sonakshi were in another private school, with affordable fee, but it was only going till 8th standard, which the elder girl finished before the first lockdown.Yes, of course, the father is aware that schools have been doing online classes throughout this year, “but we have only one smartphone, which made it impossible for both the girls to attend their respective classes at the same time.”A few times the sisters downloaded educational apps on the phone, “but those apps charge money.”So, since last year, Mr Nivediya’s daughters spent most of their time indoors, doing the housework, such as cooking the meals. The father’s limitations have made them prematurely thrifty for “they no longer ask me to buy chips or fruits for them.”Until last year, Harshita, who was then in 9th standard, and Sonakshi, who was in 7th, longed to be an engineer and a doctor (the pic is from that year-old chat). But now? “I still want to be a doctor and didi still wants to be an engineer, but papa doesn’t have enough money,” explains Sonakshi. “Maybe things will improve by next year and we will go back to school,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-father-s-pandemic-101620338207417.html

07-05-2021||Delhi||Water supply to Capital hit but Covid hospitals spared||Water supply to several parts of the city was affected on Thursday after the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) alleged that Haryana was releasing less water into the Yamuna. The utility, however, assured people that the supply to Covid-19 hospitals and care centres was not impacted.In a statement released on Thursday, the DJB said the water production at the Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal water treatment plants was hit because Haryana was not releasing the requisite amount of water to Delhi.“However, special attention is being paid to hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to ensure that there is no shortage of drinking water in hospitals. Area officials shall be in constant touch with hospital authorities to ensure that a sufficient quantity of drinking water is supplied,” DJB said.Officials added that apart from ensuring piped supply, water will also be provided to these hospitals through tankers.Also read | New quarantine rules for those from Andhra and Telangana“Delay in supply to Covid hospitals will be dealt with seriously,” the statement read.The supply from Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants has been hit due to the reduction in the release of raw water into the river and a reduction in water level at Wazirabad pond.The worst hit areas were Civil Lines, Kamala Nagar, Shakti Nagar, Karol Bagh, Paharganj, Kalkaji, Patel Nagar, New Rajinder Nagar, Govindpuri, Tughlakabad, Sangam Vihar, and Ambedkar Nagar among others.On average, DJB supplies 900 MGD (million gallons daily) water, with demand peaking at 1,100 MGD in summer months.In a release, the DJB said on Wednesday that the depleting water levels in the Yamuna is leading to a shortage of drinking water in several parts of Delhi, and may also affect hospitals in the coming days. Chadha had urged urged Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to release more raw water into the Yamuna so that sufficient drinking water is available in the national capital. The Haryana government did not respond to email and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-to-capital-hit-but-covid-hospitals-spared-101620337718265.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi government caps rates of private ambulances||After putting a cap on RT-PCR tests and hospital beds, the Delhi government came out with an order on Thursday capping the price on private ambulance services and said overcharging will be punishable with cancellation of the driving licence of the ambulance driver, cancellation of the ambulance registration and impounding of the vehicle.“It has come to our notice that some private ambulance drivers or service providers are charging exorbitant rates in Delhi. It has therefore been decided by competent authority that maximum rates … shall be capped in Delhi,” read the order from special secretary (health) Sandeep Mishra.A patient transport ambulance, used to move stable patients from home to hospital or back, can charge a maximum of ₹1,500 for a 10km trip and an additional ₹100/km after that, read the order.Also read | Delhi govt asks hospitals to conduct more antigen testsA basic life support ambulance, for transporting non- critical patients and has monitoring equipment, medicines available, can charge ₹2,000 for the first 10km and ₹100/km after that.An advanced life support ambulance for transporting critical patients can charge ₹4,000 for the first 10km and ₹100/km after that, read the order.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal put out a tweet saying it has come to his notice that private ambulances were charging exorbitant rates and hence the government took the decision to cap rates.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Gurugram, ambulance operators called off their strike on Thursday after the district administration hiked the fares for private ambulances. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said fixed charges of ₹500, ₹750 and ₹1,000 have been set for distances up to 3km, 3-7km and more than 7km, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-caps-rates-of-private-ambulances-101620337359403.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||New quarantine rules for those from Andhra and Telangana||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday said people who arrive in Delhi from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by any mode of transport will have to quarantine themselves for 14 days either in a government centre or at a paid facility. This is only applicable if they arrive without a negative RT-PCR test report -- valid for up to 72 hours from the time of issue.If such travellers possess a negative RT-PCR report with the above-mentioned validity or even if they are fully vaccinated, they shall have to mandatorily home quarantine themselves for seven days.Also read | Delhi govt asks hospitals to conduct more antigen testsThe step was taken in the light of a severe spike in cases in the southern states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The order from the DDMA said, “A virulent variant of Covid-19 has been reported to be found recently in the state(s) of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and this new strain of Covid-19 has a shorter incubation period and high transmission rate and the progress of disease is much more rapid. Therefore additionally precautionary measures in respect of persons coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to Delhi via airlines, trains, buses, cars, trucks or any other mode of transportation are required to be taken in public interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-quarantine-rules-for-those-from-andhra-and-telangana-101620337074275.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt asks hospitals to conduct more antigen tests||After a recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) testing advisory recommended that states increase the number of faster rapid antigen tests (RAT) amid a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government has directed all its hospitals to conduct the tests at their flu corners, fever clinics, and emergency departments round the clock.The tests will also be conducted on Sundays and other national holidays, according to an order by principal health secretary Dr Ashish Chandra Verma.Almost 80% of the tests conducted in Delhi over the past seven days were the more accurate RT-PCR tests.The RT-PCR test amplifies the genetic material of the virus to detect an infection, and hence is more accurate than the rapid antigen test, which detects the presence of viral proteins on the swab sample without any amplification.Also read | Panel recommends releasing prisoners in view of ‘threatening’ situation in CapitalBut daily testing numbers have reduced in the capital over the past three weeks, shows the data from the state daily health bulletin. Delhi tested 114,000 people on April 10, the highest figure for the city till date. The numbers have declined since then and on Thursday, Delhi conducted 78,780 tests. The use of more RATs may boost testing, though they do throw up more “false negatives”. “RAT has a shorter turnaround time -- of 15 to 30 minutes -- and thus offers a distinct advantage of quick detection of cases and opportunity to isolate and treat them early for curbing transmission and for favourable outcome,” the order from Verma read.The order also directed all hospitals to ensure that a follow-up test, the more accurate RT-PCR test, is done only for symptomatic persons whose RAT is negative. “It is reiterated that all teams must adhere to the ICMR norms …follow up RT-PCR testing of symptomatic individuals detected as “negative” by the rapid test and updation of results on ICMR portal in a timebound manner,” the order read.ICMR on Tuesday issued the fresh Covid-19 testing advisory recommending the conducting of antigen tests, a deviation from its previous policy of ensuring that at least 70% of tests conducted are done using the more accurate and gold-standard RT-PCR.Currently, ICMR approves RAT kits if they have a sensitivity of 50%, meaning that the test might actually give a false negative report for as many as half the positive cases. However, a positive RAT result is considered accurate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-asks-hospitals-to-conduct-more-antigen-tests-101620336821054.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||Home isolated patients may apply on govt portal for O2||Those in need of oxygen supply for patients in home isolation will soon be able to apply on the Delhi government’s website www.delhi.gov.in with a valid photo ID, Aadhaar card details, and a Covid positive report.In an order issued on Wednesday by Delhi government’s principal secretary (revenue) Sanjeev Khirwar, the process was to start from Thursday, and the link to “Online booking for refilling of oxygen cylinder-Delhi government-corona relief” was made available on the government’s portal.The link was yet to be made operational, and is expected to function in the coming days. Officials aware of the matter said the government decided to start the online booking of oxygen cylinders for people in home isolation in view of the long queues outside oxygen plants.There were also complaints from residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and people who had patients at home about difficulties being faced by them in arranging oxygen cylinders. There are 50,562 Covid-positive patients in home isolation in Delhi, according to Thursday’s government bulletin.The government ordered the district magistrates to process the online applications and direct people to authorised dealers from where people can get or exchange an oxygen cylinder.“District magistrates have been directed to streamline the process. People will apply online, and they will be informed about the dealer from where they can collect the oxygen cylinder,” a second official said.Also read | Control room starts today to monitor oxygen supplyAnother senior Delhi government official said the link could not be made operational from Thursday because of some pending preliminary work to link the dealers with refillers.“The district administrations have started the work to streamline the process. Some districts are identifying areas close to dealers from where people can collect the oxygen cylinders. The details are being worked out. The date from which the process will start will be notified soon,” the official said.Once the online process starts, people can book for a refill or a new oxygen cylinder by uploading the patient details on the link provided on the Delhi government’s website.All district magistrates have been directed to depute officials to process applications and e-passes to people who want oxygen cylinders.“This may be accorded top priority….The DMs shall identify dedicated dealers/deports to distribute such cylinders to individuals who shall not be redirected to refilling plants under any circumstances,” read the order issued by Khirwar.The DMs will issue passes to people depending on the availability of cylinders with dealers. The passes will contain the date, time and address of the depot or dealer from which oxygen cylinders can be issued or exchanged. “Before issuing the pass, the DM must ensure that a filled oxygen cylinder is available as per the pass issued,” read the order.On Thursday, people complained about not being able to apply online. SB Singh, president of Lajpat Nagar-3 RWA, said, “It is a good move to streamline the process but the web link to place the request for booking a refill is not working. We tried doing it the entire day. The government should immediately start the process.”Currently, people have to go to the oxygen refilling plants authorised by the Delhi government in areas such as Mohan cooperative area, Mayapuri, Bawana, etc. “This process will continue for the time being,” said the official.Satyajit Vaish, President of Manav Vikas Society and a resident of Panchsheel Park who has been helping people in home isolation arrange oxygen cylinders, said, “The government should advertise it before starting it. We had to rely on our sources outside Delhi. The system needs to be streamlined.”Amid a raging fourth wave of the cases in the past 15 days, Delhi has been hit by an unprecedented medical oxygen crisis. Most people have been managing their individual demands through crowd sourcing on social media, or by word of mouth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/home-isolated-patients-may-apply-on-govt-portal-for-o2-101620336492764.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||Panel recommends releasing prisoners in view of ‘threatening’ situation in Capital||The high powered committee constituted to decongest jails to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has said that there is a need to release prisoners on interim bail for 90 days or eight weeks’ parole in view of the “alarming” and “threatening” situation of the pandemic in the national capital.The committee, headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi, observed, “The entire country was engulfed by the second wave of Covid-19, which according to the medical and expert opinion is more virulent and fatal in comparison to the last year’s strain and in a matter of few weeks has left everyone gasping for air.”“Right to Life under Article 21 is the most precious Fundamental Right of every citizen of India. It unconditionally embraces even an under trial/convict walled off from the society,” the committee said while laying down the criteria for release of around 4,000 under trial prisoners (UTPs) on interim bail for 90 days.The recommendation by the panel comes a week after the Tihar Jail administration wrote to the Delhi government, asking them to release prisoners in the wake of over 200 Covid cases in the jail at a time when it was at its congested worst. The jail has over 20,000 inmates as on date, more than double its sanctioned capacity of 10,000.Last year in March when the pandemic broke out, nearly 6,000 undertrial prisoners were released on bail or special parole to decongest Tihar. Most of them surrendered on court orders in February.The committee said since its last meeting in February this year, the situation “has taken a 360 degree turn and is becoming alarming with each day”.Also read| HC: State must ensure treatment to all patients“Accordingly, there is an imminent and urgent need to take affirmative and effective steps to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19 inside jails and for ensuring social distancing inside prisons by identifying and determining the class/categories of prisoners who can once again be released on interim bails/paroles,” it has said.It has further said that according to statistical data of Covid-19 cases in the national capital, the situation was “not only alarming but threatening” as not only the positivity rate but the death rate in Covid-19 positive cases was also “spiking sharply”.The committee has said that in such a situation, which was much more dangerous than last year, and with the prisons in Delhi holding almost double their capacity of prisoners, it has not only stressed the jail administration but has also “jeopardised the necessity of observing social distancing, which is the need of the hour to prevent the spread of virus amongst the inmates”.The committee has laid down 11 categories of undertrial prisoners like those in civil imprisonment, senior citizens who are facing trial for offences with a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail, those who are suffering other serious illnesses and are facing trial for offences with punishment ranging from 10 years to life, would be eligible for grant of up to 90 days interim bail on furnishing of a personal bond.With regard to release of convicts on parole, Director General of Prisons told the committee that a letter was sent to the Delhi government on April 26 to grant emergency parole of eight weeks to those prisoners who surrendered after expiry of emergency parole granted to them last time during the first wave of the pandemic.The committee then recommended grant of emergency parole to eligible convicts and the principal secretary (home), Delhi government assured the panel that necessary efforts will be taken to get the needful done.Vaccination for inmatesThe Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the superintendent of central jail-6 of Tihar on Wednesday to send a request for Covid vaccines for the inmates in the 18-44 years age group within 48 hours and said the ministry of home affairs (MHA) will supply the requisite doses within 15-30 days.Justice Prathiba M Singh issued the direction after the prison authorities told the court that the jail has not received any vaccine for its 279 inmates in the 18-44 age groups.The prison authority said it has only received vaccines for the 136 inmates in the 45-plus age group, but just 12 of them have been vaccinated as the others were either hesitant to get the jab or did not have an Aadhaar card, a pan card or a mobile phone number to be put on the CoWIN portal for registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/panel-recommends-releasing-prisoners-in-view-of-threatening-situation-in-capital-101620336170170.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||Control room starts today to monitor oxygen supply||The Delhi government will start a control room from Friday to monitor the oxygen supply and demand in the city on a real-time basis, even as the administration received only 10 urgent calls from hospitals on Thursday, with the administration saying the Capital received sufficient oxygen.The government has also roped in e-commerce giant Amazon to track the cargo carrying liquid oxygen in the capital.“Now that we have somewhat sorted the supply chain, our focus is on strengthening or improving the demand side. A control room will be set up by Friday, May 7, to monitor the real-time dashboard of the oxygen supply and demand in the city,” said Ashish Kundra, principal secretary transport and OSD, health.He said the Delhi government has got a GPS tracking system on 41 tankers carrying oxygen in the city. Amazon has been roped in as a partner to track the cargo carrying the liquid oxygen in the national capital, he said.Kundra said the increased allocation of oxygen for Delhi has eased the crisis to a great extent. “From 60 SOS calls we got from hospitals on May 2, the number of SOS had come down to 10 on May 5. The supply side change has had an immediate impact,” he said.Also read | Can add 9,000 beds if O2 quota is met: Arvind Kejriwal﻿The government also said that oxygen supply has been strengthened by the containerised cargo movement through railways.“The volume of oxygen increasing from 120 MT till May 4 to around 360 MT through the railway route on May 5 has expedited the supply. The movement is further being ramped up. Movement through railway is more efficient as there is no road congestion or chances of breakdown, etc,” Kundra said.The Delhi government has appointed two IAS officers at the Kalinga Nagar facility of Tata Steel where oxygen is being produced. The government has formed a decentralized management system for the distribution of oxygen within the city to various hospitals and institutions, it said.Besides, Delhi is also getting oxygen supply from cities such as Ghaziabad, Modinagar, Panipat and Rourkela (Odisha) through tankers and containers.“Delhi on Wednesday received 730 MT oxygen – the highest so far – even though the demand is 976 MT. What we received on Wednesday was nearly 75% of total demand and came as a big relief. We thank the central government for this. But there is something that is concerning. Out of the 730 MT, around 250 MT were sourced through ad-hoc arrangements by the central government,” said Raghav Chadha, vice chairperson of Delhi Jal Board who is monitoring the day-to-day oxygen supply system in Delhi.“We appreciate the initiative but we are also concerned about instability in supply in the coming days. We urge the central government to ensure that they send 700 MT oxygen from stable sources. If needed, permanently add all the sources from which ad-hoc 250MT was sourced on Wednesday to Delhi’s supply chain,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/control-room-starts-today-to-monitor-oxygen-supply-101620335595484.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||HC: State must ensure treatment to all patients||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the Delhi government to ensure treatment was available to all Covid patients from the national capital, and said that medical facilities in city was unable to hold up to the test it was put under by the pandemic’s current wave.The remarks and directions were given by a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which was hearing a plea by a 53-year-old Covid patient who was unable to get an ICU bed with a ventilator after his oxygen saturation fell to around 40 (from the ideal 95 and above).“The existing medical infrastructure in the state is completely exposed... when it was put to the test... The obligation of the state to provide sufficient infrastructure to protect the lives of the people cannot be understated. At the same time, one cannot lose sight of the fact that we are faced with a once-in-a-century pandemic and even most economically advanced nations have found their infrastructure to be lacking to deal with the massive surge of cases,” it noted in its oral order.When senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, argued that the court should not say the medical infrastructure was in “shambles”, the bench responded: “Now you are behaving like the ostrich with its head in the sand. When you defend this situation, then you are not rising above the politics. We always call a spade a spade.”Mehra admitted that existing infrastructure is “struggling”, but requested the court that it is not in shambles as that has a different connotation to it.Also read | Can add 9,000 beds if O2 quota is met: Arvind Kejriwal“In the absence of oxygen what could the infrastructure do? Hospitals were reducing beds due to lack of oxygen,” he said, adding that the city government has taken several initiatives, like augmenting beds by 15,000 and ICU beds by 1,200, which are in the pipeline and the oxygen is also coming in.To this, the bench said: “It is not just oxygen. Is oxygen enough? If you have oxygen, do you have everything? Pipeline is pipeline. They are not there now.”Mehra withdrew the statement saying that he only wanted to state the reasons behind the infrastructure failure.The court said that it was bound to issue directions to the state for the petitioner, and several others like him, because it was their fundamental right.“The petitioner needs an ICU bed with ventilator facility and ideally the same should be available. We are bound to issue a writ to the state to provide the infrastructure to enable the petitioner to undergo the treatment required to save his life... At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that thousands of others are afflicted by the same disease in the city and whose condition may be as bad as that of the petitioner, if not worse,” it said.The court added that just because the petitioner was able to approach the court cannot be a reason to pass an order in his favour so that he can steal a march over others who may not have had the same option.“We, therefore, dispose of the petition with a direction to the respondent (Delhi government) that they shall provide facility for medical treatment as may be required by all the residents of Delhi who are suffering from Covid-19.“In case they require hospitalisation, it shall be provided. If medicines, it shall be provided. If oxygen, it shall be provided. If ICU with or without a ventilator, the state would be obligated to provide that too,” the bench said.Meanwhile, another bench of the Delhi high court on Thursday asked why the Delhi government was not using a 150-bed multi-speciality hospital, which was closed down due to an insolvency resolution process against its parent company, and whose services were being offered by the doctor who established it.The high court said the Delhi government should “think out of the box” in view of the Covid wave, which has led to a shortage of beds for patients in the national capital.“150 beds are there. We are struggling to find beds every day. We are fighting for it everyday, and you are saying you will not touch it (hospital)... He (petitioner-doctor) is offering his hospital, he is ready to bring in his medical team, what else can you ask for?”chief justice DN Patel said.The bench was hearing a plea by Dr Rakesh Saxena seeking permission to operate the Febris Multispeciality Hospital to cater to Covid-19 patients in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-state-must-ensure-treatment-to-all-patients-101620335053367.html
07-05-2021||Delhi||In minutes, Delhi goes from torrid to cool, wet||Several parts of the national capital received rainfall on Thursday, bringing some much awaited respite from the scorching heat. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) added that Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also received moderate to heavy rain, coupled with thunderstorm and hail in several parts.A senior meteorological department official said gusty winds with a speed of 45-60kmph hit the national capital on Thursday afternoon, followed by moderate rain and thunderstorms.“This was an intense western disturbance activity that impacted Delhi, Gurugram, Hodal, Hisar, Panipat, Karnal, Jind, Rohtak, Narwana, Jhajjar, Faridabad, Ballabhgarh, Gohana and Gannur, etc. Some parts of Delhi and NCR also received hailstorms,” the official said.The official said that rainfall during this time of the year is not unusual. Delhi-NCR experiences showers during the onset of summer, as temperatures rise and humidity levels increase.On Thursday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 39.7 degrees Celsius.The day, however, started with the minimum temperature soaring to 26.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year.Also read | Monsoon set to keep June 1 onset date with KeralaAccording to the Met department, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station on Wednesday was 40.5 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity recorded on Thursday morning was 59%, which increased to 67% by 5pm.The IMD has forecast that in the next two days the temperatures are expected to hover between 38-39 degrees Celsius. However, this respite will be brief, as the temperatures will rise again from May 9, IMD scientists said.“But from May 10, we are likely to experience another impact of western disturbance, which will be stronger and the spell will also last for a longer duration. We might see rainfall activities in Delhi-NCR from May 10 to May 15,” another IMD official said.In its long-range forecast, the IMD on April 16 said the annual monsoon rains are likely to be normal at around 98% of the long period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rainfall. It added there could be a variation of 5% over or under the prediction.Private weather forecasting agency Skymet Weather’s assessment earlier in April said that monsoon is likely to be a “healthy normal” at 103%. The IMD’s forecast indicated it at the lower end of its normal LPA range. The LPA is the average rainfall (88cm) recorded from 1961 to 2010. Rainfall between 94-106% is considered “normal”.India has recorded above-average monsoon rains for two consecutive years. A normal monsoon this year will significantly help the agriculture sector.Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-minutes-delhi-goes-from-torrid-to-cool-wet-101620334737437.html

In the first five days of May, the UT has recorded at least 20,500 cases, of which 13,800 (67%) were reported in Kashmir and 6,600(32%) in Jammu. In the same period, J&K lost 228 people to the virus, of which 82 (36%) were in Kashmir and 146 (64%) in Jammu. “In the last fortnight, Covid-related deaths in Jammu have been more than Kashmir. There may be multiple reasons for this and a threadbare analysis is required to come to a conclusion,” said Dr Rajiv Gupta,head community medicine, Government Medical College, Jammu. In April, of approximately 45,000 cases, the highest monthly total since the pandemic outbreak in the UT, Kashmir had reported 28,500 cases and Jammu 16,500. Of the 289 people who succumbed to Covid in April, 136 were in Kashmir and 153 in Jammu. Gupta said one of the reasons for more fatalities in Jammu was people’s hesitance to report to hospitals on time. “Because of social stigma, people reach hospitals after their oxygen levels have dropped significantly. This shows that the people of Kashmir report to health care facilities immediately,” he said. “The mutant virus also appears to have more transmissibility and virulence. Besides the health infrastructure in Kashmir is slightly better than Jammu,” he said. However, the overall Covid situation is worse in Kashmir than Jammu. The overall cases till May 5 were 1,96,585 — 120,405 in Kashmir and 76,180 in Jammu. Of 2,510 fatalities, 1476 were recorded in Kashmir and 1,034 in Jammu division. A health official of Kashmir, on condition of anonymity, said he believes many Covid cases may be getting missed in Jammu even though testing rate is same in both divisions. “Covid cases can be missed but deaths cannot be missed. The quality of testing and whom to test makes the difference,” he said. He also said that Kashmir’s healthcare status was better than many other Indian states. “We have better management here,” he said. Social Reforms Organisation, Kashmir, an NGO providing oxygen, equipments, ambulances and burial support to Covid patients in Kashmir, said that the community support for coronavirus patients in Jammu was lacking. “Our call data reveals that there is very little community support prevalent in Jammu. Everyone who needs oxygen support at home does not get it,” it said in a tweet. “Many people who died could have survived, if provided with help on time. Jammu has to fill the void,” the organisation said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-leading-in-deaths-kashmir-in-infections-101620332574663.html

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Pressure Centre for timely supplies to combat Covid: Capt to party MPs||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged Congress MPs from the state to pressurise the Centre to augment supplies of oxygen, tankers, vaccines and vital medicines even as some of them suggested to him to consider a “full lockdown” to curb the virus spread in the state. The chief minister, who held a virtual meeting with the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs of the Congress from Punjab on the Covid situation, exhorted them to push the central government to increase the state’s oxygen quota and dispatch additional tankers on priority to enable lifting of the full allocated quota of 195MT on daily basis. “Punjab is being meted out a step-motherly treatment by the Centre in the matter of supplies needed urgently to battle Covid,” he claimed, adding, “BJP-ruled neigbouring Haryana has got a bigger oxygen quota and more tankers than Punjab”. The meeting was attended by all party MPs from the state except Ambika Soni who is unwell. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar was also present. Bajwa, others suggest complete lockdownAt the meeting, some MPs stressed the need for more stringent measures, including a total lockdown, to fight the second wave of the pandemic. “The suggestion was to consider it as several leading health experts have suggested a full lockdown to stop Covid spread. We understand the lockdown will mean lots of hardships on smaller shopkeepers, daily wagers, etc, but we cannot allow the virus to get out of control. If it can be controlled without lockdown, then there is nothing like it. We have to save lives first,” Bajwa, who along some other MPs advised the CM to consider this option, said after the meeting. On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also stated that the only way to stop the spread of Covid-19 infection now was a full lockdown. The state has imposed a “soft lockdown” unlike during the first wave when it was among the first states to impose a statewide curfew in March 2020. The MPs also urged the chief minister to approach the high court for enhancement of its oxygen quota, besides calling a meeting of the cabinet to make oxygen plant mandatory for private hospitals with 25 beds and government hospitals with 50 beds. They also urged the state government to again try and get permission from the central government for import of oxygen from Pakistan and take measures to ensure vaccination of Punjab farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders. The MPs promised to utilise their MPLAD funds to set up oxygen generation plants in government hospitals. Amarinder said the state was facing issues even on the ventilator front, since there was no BEL engineer to install 108 of the 809 ventilators received from the central government. On the vaccination front also, the MPs expressed concern over the low supplies and repeated delays from the Centre. The chief minister said the Centre’s apathy towards Punjab was also reflected in the fact that many other states had been given more vials of Tocilizumab. The state had sought 650 vials but was given only 200 in the initial stages, which were distributed to government and private hospitals, he added. Even Remdesivir continued to be in short supply, as delivery of the 50,000 vials allocated to the state was extremely slow, he said. The MPs expressed concern over the chief minister’s disclosure that genome sequence results had not been received for the past one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pressure-centre-for-timely-supplies-to-combat-covid-capt-to-party-mps-101620330234273.html

All these services would be free of cost, and the patients would be taken care by the doctors and staff of Sri Guru Ramdas University of Health Sciences,” she said. “The state government was aware about the second wave. The government could have made adequate arrangements, but nothing was done. Besides the paucity of oxygen in many hospitals, ventilators are not functioning,” said Kaur.She said the SGPC had ordered oxygen concentrators from Russia, but the consignment was stuck for customs clearance in Delhi for five days. “Such life-saving consignments should be cleared on priority,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/countrys-reputation-took-a-hit-due-to-covid-mismanagement-jagir-kaur-101620329574882.html

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Long wait for beds as Jammu’s Covid triage facility overwhelmed||Amid a surge in coronavirus cases, the government Chest Diseases Hospital, the first contact point and triage facility for Covid patients in Jammu, has started bursting at the seams. The hospital witnessed a heavy rush of the patients on Thursday. Patients with oxygen cylinders were seen sitting on hospital stairs, lying in the park, ambulances and stretchers. Ambulances with sirens and lights flashing could be seen converging on the hospital premises. However, patients and attendants had to wait for hours for their turn. “We have been waiting for over two hours now. I have brought my elder brother from Lalyana in Bishnah. The hospital staff told us that they have no beds and asked me to take him home. However, they did provide us with an oxygen cylinder,” said a youngster tending his ailing brother. A technicians of a 108 ambulance, swathed in personal protective equipment said, “The ambulances have brought patients to the hospital but they are not being admitted.” A woman technician of another 108 ambulance said, “The hospital should admit the patients quickly as we are getting an increasing number of calls.” Though doctors and paramedics are working round-the-clock, manpower shortage has also hit the functioning of the hospital, said an official, on condition of anonymity. The hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Rajeshwar Sharma said, “A large number of people had rushed to the hospital and many had to wait for their turn but within six hours, from 10am to 4 pm, we received 125 Covid positive patients, all of whom were examined. Forty CT scans were conducted. Some patients were sent to Covid care centres and 22 were hospitalised.” “Every patient was given an oxygen cylinder the moment they reached the hospital. Examining and treating 125 patients in six hours takes time. We have to examine each one of them and check their oxygen saturation level,” said Dr Sharma. “We have a triage area with sheds and chairs but the patients prefer to sit in parks instead,” Sharma said. Every CT scan takes 10 minutes and then we have to wait for the report. We conducted 40 CT scans today in four to five hours,” he said.

Other blocks of the under-construction compound of AIIMS can also be utilised to treat coronavirus patients,” said Singh.AIIMS has recently started a 40-bed facility, with 10 beds reserved for critical patients who need ventilators.The institute director said an internal audit conducted on Wednesday stated that construction activities undertaken by a hired agency have almost stopped due to shortage of workers.“The construction agency was conveyed that workers should be encouraged to drop travel plans to their native villages in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal as Covid is spreading at an alarming rate and the institute can take care of their health, but they have left work,” Singh added.Expressing concern over reluctance by a sizeable section of Punjab’s rural population towards vaccination and testing, Singh said religious leaders should motivate people.On Thursday, Bathinda reported 858 new Covid cases and nine deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-aiims-to-set-up-temporary-300-bed-covid-care-facility-101620329334920.html

07-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Reservations over relief for Marathas remain||A day after the Supreme Court scrapped the reservation given to Marathas by the Maharashtra government in 2018, the state has started deliberating on legal options and ways to pacify the upset community. Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed it, saying people from the community can’t be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, setting a 50-% cap on reservation, to a larger bench for reconsideration. As chief minister Uddhav Thackeray hinted on Wednesday, the state is expected to approach the Centre for intervention to establish the backwardness of the community and hence, inclusion in the reserved quota. The Centre may also be requested for a legislation to restore the state’s powers to enact a law to accord reservation to any community. The government is also looking into the option of filing a review petition in the top court. “Our legal team and counsels have been studying the 569-page order by the SC, after which the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation will have a meeting with them. We are requesting the Central government for intervention, after the SC categorically said the powers to notify any caste as backward class lies with the National Commission of Backward Classes (NCBC). The Centre can also reinforce its stand that the 102nd Constitutional amendment has not suppressed states’ powers to give reservation. There are legalities related to these options as the report by State Backward Class Commission headed by MG Gaikwad, too, has been struck down by the court. The option of a review petition is being considered, but we will need to put forth a strong base for it,” said public works department minister and head of cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan. According to legal experts and counsels representing the state, there is a limited scope for restoration of the reservation. “The SC order has clarified that there was no need to approach the 11-judge bench for a review of Indra Sawhney judgment. It also questioned the findings of the Gaikwad Commission report, which was the basis of the reservation given in “extraordinary and exceptional circumstances” of backwardness. Even if we decide to approach the NCBC, the question on the basis of backwardness of the community remains,” said one of the counsels, on condition of anonymity. A state official said they don’t have any immediate remedy. He said the state could go for a new law by addressing the flaws pointed out by the SC, but only if the Centre takes the legal recourse to empower the state to do so. “The state can now follow it up with the President of India and the Central government. Simultaneously, the state should ensure the community gets the benefits and schemes they would have got from the quota. A large chunk of Marathas is poor and needs the benefits,” said Balkrishna Renke, former chairman of the National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi Nomadic Tribes. The state is also planning a meeting with Maratha outfits later next week to take them into confidence. The government has already announced that the community will continue to get benefits such as hostels for youths, funding to SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute), the institute established for educational, social and financial development of the community and scholarships for higher education of the students from the community. The state government is also open to extending the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota of 10% reservation to the community. Chavan said they have already announced various schemes for the community and will soon have a meeting with the outfits. Rajendra Date Patil, one of the petitioners in the SC, said, “The Centre had tabled a bill to expand the scope of reservation beyond 50% about a decade ago, as 28 states have crossed the limit. The Centre can take a comprehensive view and get the law enacted to give respite to communities such as Jats, Gujjars and Marathas. The Central government has said in the top court and in Parliament that the 102nd constitutional amendment does not suppress the states’ powers of giving reservation. It will have to make the necessary amendment for it,” he said. A leader closely associated with the developments said they had anticipated the SC verdict and so had requested the SC to transfer it to the 11-member constitution bench. “We also ensured that similar petitions of other states pending in the SC are clubbed with ours. Had it been referred to the larger bench, the verdict could have been different,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reservations-over-relief-for-marathas-remain-101620329273784.html

The non-scheduled medical flight with five people, including a Covid patient, on-board had taken off from Bagdogra to land in Mumbai. It, however, had to land on its belly, as its left rear wheel got separated and fell off at Nagpur, where it had a halt for refuelling.CSMIA spokesperson confirmed the full emergency and said the flight safely landed at 9.09pm as all passengers were safely evacuated.The flight had one patient and his relative, a doctor and two crew members on board.Airports sources confirmed the aircraft’s pilot had contacted the Mumbai air traffic control (ATC) at around 7.20 to inform about the issue as a result of which the ATC declared a full emergency and informed all the stakeholders at CSMIA. “As preparations for the crash landing had to be made, the aircraft was on hold until the runway was foamed, so that the aircraft did not catch fire. It finally approached and landed runway 27 at 9.09pm,” said an airport official.Sources from the airport added that the aircraft had sufficient fuel to hold and hence the crew decided to land on belly after the airport prepared for the landing. Aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted, ‘A Jet Serve Ambulance with a patient onboard lost a wheel during takeoff from Nagpur. Showing immense presence of mind Capt Kesari Singh belly landed the aircraft on foam carpeting in Mumbai. All onboard are safe. Commendable effort by @DGCAIndia @CSMIA_Official & other agencies.’The airport’s emergency response team including the fire and rescue responders, follow-me vehicles, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), firefighting team immediately got into action and were on standby to provide immediate assistance to ensure the safe evacuation of the passengers. “As a precautionary method, CSMIA also foamed RWY 27 in order to avoid the aircraft catching fire. All passengers were evacuated safely and flights operating in and out of CSMIA remain on schedule,” CSMIA spokesperson added. Airport officials said that the onboard patient- fighting Covid-19, was immediately rushed to Nanavati hospital.

Parents have been approaching the education minister and the education department but nothing happened in the past one year and schools are still exploiting parents by demanding 100% fees. In line with the Supreme Court decision, we demand a similar waiver for parents in the state,” read the letter.Anubha Sahai, president of the association said that if schools oppose the waiver, they should be audited and their income accounts should be checked “to keep a check on the profiteering and surplus fees collected.” Officials from the education department refused to comment on the issue. On May 3, the apex court ordered a reduction of fees of private unaided schools by 15% in lieu of unutilised facilities by students. The court also said that schools should not debar students on account of non-payment of fees or outstanding fees. On May 4, the director of primary education in Maharashtra ordered that documents pertaining to fees of private schools- such as papers of PTA approvals, finances of school etc be sent to the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/private-schools-must-waive-fees-parents-write-to-maharashtra-govt-101620329213786.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Endless challenges for Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Ever since chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray took up the job, his government has been stumbling from one crisis to another. Three-and-a-half months into his tenure, Maharashtra was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. For the second year in a row, a tired Thackeray government is battling the raging pandemic. With Supreme Court striking down the quota for Maratha community on Wednesday, Thackeray now has fresh crisis to deal with. Sixteen months into office, Thackeray has battled on various fronts including tackling Covid-19 outbreak with empty coffers, natural calamity, political crisis leading to resignation of two cabinet ministers. The tussle with Maharashtra Raj Bhavan played out elaborately last year with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari not recommending Thackeray to the Upper House of the state Legislature to keep his chief ministership; ultimately, forcing him to dial Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The strong opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is getting more aggressive and he’s under constant threat of MLAs being poached by BJP. Besides this, Thackeray is dealing with a hostile government at the Centre, but he’s carefully manoeuvring through it without antagonising those in power in New Delhi. The challengesMaharashtra continues to be the most-affected state due to Covid-19 outbreak. While the state government somehow managed to tackle the epidemic in the first wave, the second wave has become a bigger problem with more than 50,000-60,000 cases being reported daily along with a high number of deaths. While Thackeray government is battling with the massive second wave with limited resources, the vaccination too is not taking off well due to shortage in supply of vaccine. On the other hand, Antilia bomb scare-Sachin Vaze episode followed by allegations and resignation of home minister Anil Deshmukh has damaged the reputation of the Thackeray government. Earlier, Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod had to quit his post after his name was linked to the suicide of a young woman in Pune. Before he took over as chief minister in November 2019, Thackeray had no experience in handling the administration. As such, his ability is put to test in every crisis for which he is getting appreciation and also brickbats. Covid crisisPolitical analysts say the onset of health crisis in early days of his chief ministership made it easier for him to strengthen his government. He compensated his lack of administrative experience with emotional connect with the people of the state, they add. Surendra Jondhale, political analyst and former professor of political science at Mumbai University, said Thackeray was sailing the troubled water right since the outset, adding that his initial challenge was to consolidate, strengthen and keep his flock together. “His initial task was to see there is no in-fighting or internal friction, because he was dealing with two ideologically opposite parties.”Political analyst Prakash Bal said, “He had only led a political party and had absolutely no experience in running the state government. Within three months of him coming to power, Covid-19 outbreak shut down the state and nation. But if you look at the larger view and compare it with CMs of neighbouring Karnataka and Gujarat, Maharashtra has done well under him. The state and Mumbai have dealt with the pandemic well so far.”According to Jondhale, the two strengths of Thackeray as CM were his “resilience” and the move to “establish a dialogue with the people”. “Covid-19 has been testing for Thackeray, but his resilience and his addresses to the state have helped him establish a dialogue with the people and build a rapport. He would tell everybody the challenges and give solutions. If the Centre is not giving vaccines or oxygen, he would tell it to the people,” he said. ControversiesThe political challenges faced by Thackeray and the three-party government have damaged the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) reputation. Allegations of crime against a woman forced Thackeray to seek resignation of Rathod in February-end. Subsequently, allegations against NCP minister Anil Deshmukh rattled MVA. Many Sena leaders privately maintain that the Rathod and Deshmukh crisis should have been managed better by the MVA and the party. Jondhale said, “From the point of view of the voter, the allegations against Rathod and Deshmukh were not unheard of. People have seen and heard what happened in the BJP government with Chikki scam, allegations Prakash Mehta, etc. These allegations definitely cast a negative shadow but nothing politically detrimental which would lead to a collapse.” Both Jondhale and Bal added that Thackeray had the able backing of NCP chief Sharad Pawar when MVA went through any crisis.“Not just CM, but like family member”Sena MP and chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant took a mythological reference from the epic Mahabharata and said Thackeray is not the one who will be caught in the chakravyuh. “Uddhav ji is not Abhimanyu who cannot escape the chakravyuh; he can break it. Natural calamity happened last year [Nisarg cyclone], Covid-19 outbreak happened, social issues erupted over the Maratha reservation issue and political crisis also came on him, but he has overcome them calmly and with patience... No CM has faced so many challenges one after another,” Sawant said.He claimed Thackeray’s addresses to the people “inculcated calmness”.“The manner in which he speaks to the people, they consider him a family member who is advising them. He just doesn’t advise but has the onus of delivering. He is the man who thought of building a field hospital when nobody in the country did. The man who was not in electoral politics, had never seen the Assembly house or a civic house, he is now steering Maharashtra,” Sawant added. Opposition speaksAccording to Bal, the BJP is making shrill noises on Covid-19 management but it is not backed with unrest among people. “Only BJP leaders are making a noise. Even when people were not getting hospital beds and oxygen, there was no negative atmosphere or sense of failure of the Thackeray government.”The BJP, however, says Thackeray government is nothing but a complete failure. Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said there has been complete “lack of administrative leadership” in Maharashtra since November 2019. “This government does not have any kind of direction or will, consequences of which have to be borne by the people of Maharashtra. The Sena-led MVA government has given the people more than one reason to complain about its incompetence in dealing with crisis situations. It completely failed to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak last year. Maharashtra found itself reeling under the pandemic, un-kept promises to farmers affected due to unseasonal rainfall and cyclone, people facing electricity supply cuts for defaulting payment of hiked bills by the state’s power supplier, rising atrocities against women, the unresolved issue of reservation for OBCs and Marathas, the Sachin Vaze episode, etc,” he said.If 2020 was a tough year for him, 2021 is going to be a bigger battle for the “accidental chief minister”. As the state is still battling to control the second wave of Covid-19, there have been projections of a third wave towards the latter half of the year. Following which, Thackeray will gear up for his next major political challenge—the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation election in February 2022, in which the BJP will try to wrest control of India’s richest civic body that has been Sena’s source of strength for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/endless-challenges-for-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101620329154346.html
07-05-2021||Other||Bombay HC grants bail to man accused in Dr Dabholkar’s murder case||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday granted bail to Vikram Bhave – an accused in rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar’s murder case – on furnishing a bond of ₹1 lakh. While granting the bail, the court expressed its doubts over the material collected by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to connect the 37-year-old with the crime.“We have proceeded on the basis of the material on which respondent No 2 [CBI] has placed emphasis and we find that the same does not appear to show reasonable grounds to conclude that the accusations levelled against the appellant [Bhave] can be said to be prima facie true,” said the division bench of justice Sambhaji Shinde and justice Manish Pitale court while granting him bail. Dr Dabholkar was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants on August 20, 2013, in Pune, when he was out on morning walk. Initially, an offence was registered by the Deccan police station in connection with the murder, and on May 9, 2014, the case was transferred for CBI for further investigation.According to CBI, Virendrasingh Tavade of Sanatan Sanstha is the key accused in the case, while Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andure are the assailants who shot Dr Dabholkar. Kalaskar said Bhave had helped him and Andure conduct a recce of the area where the rationalist was fatally attacked. Kalaskar also claimed that Bhave had also helped the duo identify the escape route after the attack. Bhave was subsequently arrested on September 25, 2019.The special court at Pune rejected his bail plea last year on September 15, following which Bhave moved HC, contending that there was no material to connect him to the crime.In support of its case against Bhave, CBI counsel, advocate Sandesh Patil, relied on Kalaskar’s confessional statement, recorded in the murder case of journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead in Karnataka. In his confessional statement, Kalaskar had named Bhave as an accused in Dr Dabholkar’s case. CBI also claimed before HC that Kalaskar had identified Bhave on the basis of his photograph as the person who had helped him and Andure conduct the recce and had also pointed at him during the scene recreation.HC, however, held that Kalaskar’s confession in the Karnataka case could not be used against Bhave in Dr Dabholkar’s murder case, as the confession could only be used against a co-accused. Bhave has not been named an accused in Lankesh’s case. HC expressed doubts about the material regarding photo identification and the separate scene recreations involving Andure and Kalaskar, after noticing material discrepancies in the memorandum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-in-dr-dabholkar-s-murder-case-101620329153773.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Reply to Anil Deshmukh’s plea in 4 weeks: Bombay HC to CBI||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday heard a clutch of petitions including one filed by former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking interim protection from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which recently completed a preliminary enquiry (PE) on allegations of corruption against him, as well as those filed by senior Indian Police Service officer Rashmi Shukla and former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh which sought protection against coercive action in two separate FIRs filed against them by the Mumbai Police.A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale directed the CBI to respond to Deshmukh’s petition in four weeks and told the counsel representing the former cabinet minister to move the vacation bench in case of “extreme urgency”.The petitions are the fallout of a letter that Singh wrote on March 20 alleging Deshmukh ran an extortion racket. The letter, addressed to the chief minister also referred to an August 2020 report by Shukla, who was commissioner of the State Intelligence Department at the time, on a purported “money for transfer” scam involving police officers, middlemen and politicians.The HC on Thursday extracted a promise from the Maharashtra state that it would not arrest Shukla, who is on central deputation in Hyderabad, till the next date of hearing her plea, and directed Singh to move the vacation bench for relief as it could not hear his petition due to a paucity of time.Deshmukh, who initially brazened out the allegations of corruption, resigned on April 5 citing moral grounds after the Bombay HC directed the CBI to probe Singh’s allegations. The CBI lodged an FIR on April 21 against Deshmukh under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act [which pertains to illegal gratification obtained by a public servant] and section 120(b) [criminal conspiracy] of the Indian Penal Code and submitted the findings of it PE in a sealed envelope to the court on April 30.The politician filed a petition on May 3 which claimed that the FIR was filed with a “biased, dubious and ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta” against him and sought interim protection from the CBI.“We cannot pass any orders without hearing the parties concerned. If there is extreme urgency, then you (Deshmukh) can move the vacation bench of the HC. You (Deshmukh) have that liberty,” the court told Deshmukh’s counsel Amit Desai. It asked the CBI to file an affidavit in response to the plea.Senior advocate Darius Khambata appearing for the state told the bench on Thursday that Shukla would not be arrested till the next date of hearing her plea challenging the FIR registered by the Mumbai cybercrime police for alleged illegal phone tapping and alleged leaking of sensitive documents related to police postings.Shukla, who is currently in Hyderabad serving as the additional director general of Central Reserve Police Force, South Zone, moved the court on May 3 after she received a summons from Mumbai cyber police asking her to appear before the investigation officer on the following day. She had also failed to appear at two previous summons -- on April 26 and 28.The Mumbai police filed an FIR against unidentified persons on March 26 under the Official Secrets Act, the Information Technology Act and the Indian Telegraph Act, which are punishable up to three years only, for allegedly illegally tapping phones and leaking confidential documents, based on a complaint filed by the Maharashtra intelligence department.The IPS officer sought the quashing of the FIR or its transfer to the CBI for further investigation.In her petition, Shukla said that she had “exposed the nexus between ministers and politicians” narrated the events during her posting in the state between October 11, 2018, and September 3, 2020, in which time between July 17-29, 2020, she had intercepted the calls of six men who were acting as middlemen in a purported “money for transfer” scam.Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte however had said in March that the interception was done under the guise of “public safety” and “misguided the authorities”, and that there was no evidence of such a scam.“We will hear this petition after the summer vacation. Until then it will be graceful on the state government’s part to make a statement that it would not take any coercive action,” Justice Shinde said.“It is a fairly important investigation. We don’t know when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. Hence, the police are willing to send a team to Hyderabad where they could record the petitioner’s statement,” Khambata said.Shukla’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani said the IPS officer is willing to cooperate with the investigation.Singh’s petition sought quashing of an FIR registered against him under the Prevention of Atrocities Act last month based on a complaint by police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge posted at Akola in Maharashtra.Ghadge made a series of allegations of corruption against Singh and other officers when Singh was posted with the Thane police.The bench asked Singh to move the vacation bench in case there was any urgency and did not hear a fresh petition filed by Singh challenging the state government’s decision to entrust two enquiries against him to DGP Sanjay Pandey.The bench also did not hear the petition filed by the Maharashtra government seeking direction to the CBI to delete two topics from the purview of their investigation into corruption charges against Deshmukh: the reinstatement of controversial Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, arrested in connection with the Antilia bomb scare and subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, and the purported corruption in police transfers and postings of senior police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reply-to-anil-deshmukh-s-plea-in-4-weeks-bombay-hc-to-cbi-101620329093767.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid second wave hit 60-74 age group worst in Himachal||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has been most fatal for senior citizens, who account for nearly 40% of the total deaths, in Himachal Pradesh. The health department data shows that as on May 4, a total of 1,647 people died of Covid-19 in the state since the pandemic broke out. Of them, 650 are in the age group of 60 to 74 years. This is 39% of the fatalities. The mean age of the Covid dead is 63 years. “There is high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Himachal Pradesh, which is one of the primary reasons why senior citizens succumb to the disease,” says Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital medicine department head Jitendera Mokta. Patients aged between 45 and 59 years were the second most vulnerable group with a total of 416 deaths reported till date. This age group constitutes about 25% of the state’s fatalities. The next affected section is those above 75 years. A total of 368 deaths have been reported in this age group. This is 22.34% of the Covid casualties. Similarly, 139 (8.4%) fatalities occurred among people aged between 30 and 44 years, while 20 (1.2%) victims were aged between 15 and 29 years and six (0.3%) were children. “The state government has urged the Union government to provide oxygen cylinders to the state. The health department is working on ways to reduce the delay in getting reports of Covid tests. We are trying to rope in the private laboratories in Himachal. The government has sanctioned ₹7 crore for setting up laboratories in Una and Kullu,” said health department spokesperson Dr Gopal Berry. Case fatality higher than national average The case fatality ratio has gone up to 1.5% in the state, which is higher than the national average of 1.1% and also one of the highest among states in the region. Berry said, “So far we have not been able to gauge the exact reason the increase in fatality rate,” adding that the CM has directed officers to bridge the gap between home isolation and hospitals as it has been felt that the fatality rate in the state was increasing due to delay in shifting of serious patients in home isolation to hospitals, which is matter of concern. The CM has also directed the health department to ensure a smooth supply chain of oxygen, PPE kits, medicines and other logistics during the curfew. Among the Covid-19 casualties, a total of 1,057 (64.1%) were male and 590 (35.9%) female. Co-morbidities were present in 1,062 (64.5%), while 585 (35.5%) were non co-morbid. A majority of co-morbidities include diabetes 532 (50%), hypertension 476 (44.8%), chronic kidney disease 113 (10.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 87 (8%). Recovery rate lower than national average The state’s recovery rate has been low as compared to the national and global average. Himachal Pradesh has a recovery rate of 78.1% as compared to 81.9% at the national level and 85.4% at the global level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-second-wave-hit-60-74-age-group-worst-in-himachal-101620329035154.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota scrapped: Community gears up for agitations||The Maratha community is unhappy with the recent Supreme Court (SC) order in which it has struck down the provision of reservation to the community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. Various organisations representing the community have decided to hold a series of agitations to put pressure on the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to take steps for restoring the reservation.In a statewide meeting of convenors of Maratha Kranti Morcha, an apex body of various organisations of the Maratha community, they have decided to hold virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders from across the political spectrum. On the other hand, some outfits decided to stage protests at various places in the state. The convenors said they do not want to risk the lives of the people by asking them to come out on roads in this pandemic. At the same time, they want to build pressure, compelling the governments to take necessary steps to get reservation for the community, be it the state or Centre. They have also roped in experts to examine the SC judgement and help them in determining alternatives, based on which the next course of action will be decided.On Wednesday, SC struck down the SEBC Act, which was enacted to grant 16% reservation to the Maratha community in government jobs and education in November 2018. In June 2019, while upholding the reservation, the Bombay high court (HC) had reduced the reservation limit to 12% and 13% in government jobs and admissions, respectively, as recommended by Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) in its report submitted to the state government in 2018.“We have decided to hold digital (virtual) agitation as we cannot allow the people to endanger their lives by taking to the streets, considering the pandemic situation. We will be holding social media campaigns and target leaders from all the political parties in the state,” said Virendra Pawar, a convenor, who also represents Maratha Mahasangh.Pawar said they already have a social media team, with the help of which the entire agitation demanding reservation was successfully conducted in 2017. The team will now launch online campaigns and devise other ways to target the politicians.“We have several pages on Facebook having lakhs of members in each of them. We also have thousands of WhatsApp groups formed for better coordination which will also be used for the agitation. In the meantime, our team of experts will examine the judgement and help in finalising alternatives, on the basis on which further decision will be taken,” he added.Meanwhile, offices of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Satara district were attacked by unknown people on Thursday morning. In two different incidents, a group of people hurled stones at the offices leading to damage of windowpane and other accessories. Local police are probing both the incidents, according to Lokmat, a Marathi daily.In another meeting held by Maratha Kranti Thok Marcha (MKTM) in Beed district, it was decided to start agitation for reservation on the lines of guerrilla warfare that was adopted by Maratha warriors during the regime of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji.Abasaheb Patil, convenor of MKTM, said, “We are not going to disclose our plans on how agitations are going to be held. We have lost all the faith in this government because it has failed in the legal battle, and the community is at the receiving end. We want reservation to be restored; that’s it.”Sanjiv Bhor Patil, president of Shiv Prahar Sangathana, said they were examining the SC order and are yet to decide on the next step. “We have asked experts and researchers, who have studied the case, to give their opinion after examining the judgement copy. We will find out the root cause of this judgement and then decide whether we have to continue the legal battle, fight a political battle or hit the roads,” Patil said.Vinayak Mete, who heads the political outfit Shiv Sangram, declared that they will start an agitation from Beed district and subsequently hold them in other districts from May 16. He demanded that the state file a review petition in the Apex court against the order. He will also be seeking time from the chief minister in this regard. Mete had contested the state Assembly elections in 2014 from Beed constituency as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and had extended his support to the erstwhile BJP government.“We want justice which was snatched from us because of negligence of the state government. It is now the responsibility of the chief minister to provide reservation benefits to the Maratha community. We have decided to start the agitation from Beed,” Mete said.He further suggested that the government should constitute a study and rectify the findings of the MSCBC that were rejected by the Apex court. “The state government should consider providing reservation to the community in the existing quota of other communities. It should also look into providing benefits to Marathas under the 10% reservation of economically weaker section (EWS) passed by the Centre last year,” Mete said.The Centre has decided to provide 10% reservation to all those under EWS category who are not covered under the existing scheme of reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. The amendment to the act was cleared by the Parliament in 2019.Meanwhile, public works department minister and head of state cabinet’s sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan alleged that some people have been inciting Maratha community which could endanger lives of the people during the pandemic. “People should keep in mind that the safety of the citizens is important as we are in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nobody should incite the Maratha community just for the purpose of cornering the MVA government politically,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-scrapped-community-gears-up-for-agitations-101620329033753.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||IIT-B researchers design a surface that makes coronavirus evaporate faster||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have designed a surface that can expedite the evaporation of residual droplets carrying Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, from surfaces. According to the World Health Organisation, Covid 19 primarily spreads when small liquid particles are released into the air when a person infected with the virus coughs, speaks, sings or sneezes. The disease can also transmit via droplets settled on surfaces of objects, often known as fomite transmission. However, fomite transmission is now widely regarded as the least transmissible mode of spread of the virus.When a person infected with Covid-19 coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets containing the virus are released into the air. This is primarily how Covid-19 spreads. However, the disease can also transmit via droplets settled on surfaces of objects, often known as fomite transmission. IIT-B researchers have proposed a way of designing surfaces for accelerating the evaporation of the residual droplets on surfaces by tuning surfaces’ wettability and creating geometric microtextures on them. Their paper titled— Designing antiviral surfaces to suppress the spread of Covid-19—was published in the Physics of Fluids letter of the peer-reviewed journal AIP Publishing on Wednesday.The lifespan of the respiratory droplet on the surface determines how likely the surface is to spread the virus. While 99.9% of the droplet’s liquid content evaporates within a few minutes, a residual thin film that allows the virus to survive can be left behind. On some surfaces such as glass, the film can last up to four days and on plastic or stainless steel up to seven days.Sanghamitro Chatterjee, Janani Srree Muralidharan, Amit Agrawal, and Rajneesh Bhardwaj — all researchers from IIT-B — had in the past shown that the survival time of the Covid-19 virus was correlated to the drying time of a respiratory droplet on an impermeable (non-porous) surface along with a residual film left on it by the droplet. In a follow-up study in February, they demonstrated how the mass loss of a respiratory droplet and the evaporation mechanism of a thin liquid film is different for porous and non-porous surfaces. In their new study, they’ve found that an optimally designed surface will make a viral load decay rapidly, rendering it less likely to contribute to the spread of viruses.“We’ve extended our findings from the previous studies to design a surface that can make droplets evaporate faster. It works just like a lotus leaf. The surface of a lotus leaf has microscopic pillars on them that make the water droplets roll-off. Bioinspired from lotus leaf, the proposed antiviral surface has microscopic pillars on them,” said co-author of the study Rajneesh Bhardwaj, associate professor of Mechanical Engineering, IIT-B. They designed microtextures or microscopic pillars on surfaces to accelerate the evaporation of liquid.“In terms of physics, the solid-liquid interfacial energy is enhanced by a combination of our proposed surface engineering. The pressure inside the liquid film increases and helps it to dry quickly,” said Chatterjee, lead author and a postdoctoral fellow in the mechanical engineering department. The researchers tried a combination of surface microtextures to determine the most optimal one. “Continuously tailoring any one of these parameters wouldn’t achieve the best results,” said Agrawal, institute chair professor at the department of mechanical engineering and co-author of the paper. “We also propose a design methodology and provide parameters needed to engineer surfaces with the shortest virus survival times,” said Muralidharan, an assistant professor in the department of mechanical engineering. The researchers discovered that surfaces with taller and closely packed pillars, with a contact angle of around 60 degrees, show the strongest antiviral effect or shortest drying time. “This study lays the foundation for fabricating antiviral surfaces that will be useful in designing hospital equipment, medical or pathology equipment, as well as frequently touched surfaces, like door handles, smartphone screens, or surfaces within areas prone to outbreaks,” said Bharadwaj.“Since we analysed antiviral effects by a generic model independent of the specific geometry of texture, it’s possible to fabricate any geometric structures based on different fabrication techniques — focused ion beams or chemical etching — to achieve the same outcome,” Bharadwaj added.“This study helps understand how nanosurfaces work and how they can be used to prevent the spread of Covid-19. These surfaces can be used at healthcare facilities,” said Shyamprasad Karagadde, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering, IIT-B, who was not a part of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitb-researchers-design-a-surface-that-makes-coronavirus-evaporate-faster-101620328973713.html

The inflow of patients in medical colleges and hospitals has increased manifold as people are reporting at the hospitals at advanced stage, leading to high death toll,” he said.Soni added that at Rajindra Hospital, 125 additional beds will be set up for level 2 patients, who need oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/state-to-increase-covid-bed-capacity-by-25-soni-101620328914393.html
07-05-2021||City||Can add 9,000 beds if O2 quota is met: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi can add 9,000 to 9,500 more beds for Covid-19 patients if the Union government continues to send 700 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, as he thanked the Centre for the increase in supply – a measure sought by the state government and ordered by the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court.Since the third week of April, Delhi has battled an acute shortage of oxygen supplies as the surge in Covid-19 cases crushed the health care system, forcing many to pare back the number of beds they have even as people struggled to get life-saving medical attention.“For the shortage of oxygen, several hospitals in the city had started reducing their oxygen beds. A prominent hospital reduced total oxygen beds from 300 to 100. Our aim is to keep increasing oxygen beds,” said Kejriwal during an online press briefing.Also read | Delhi adds 19,133 new Covid cases, 335 deaths; positivity rate below 25%He listed GTB, Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality as hospitals where beds were reduced. “I appeal them to increase beds. Also, several hospitals approached us in the past few days saying they can further augment capacity of oxygen beds if the supply becomes stable. Now that the supply is stable, I request them to increase oxygen beds,” he added.Delhi received 730 MT on Wednesday after days of repeated warnings and prodding by the high court as well as the apex court. Prior to that, the most the city received was on Tuesday when it got 555 MT of oxygen, and the average for seven days before that was 398MT.“Delhi needs 700 MT oxygen, and yesterday was the first time that the Central government sent 730 MT oxygen. But, I request the Centre to continue sending 700 MT oxygen daily until the country’s second wave doesn’t ebb. It shouldn’t be the case that one day we receive 700 MT and the next day we again get only 300-400 MT, because that will create a turmoil in the hospitals again,” the CM said.Rajeev Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, which treats only the sickest patients in need of high flow oxygen and ventilator support, had to reduce the number of beds from 550 to 350 on April 23. A day later, the neighbouring Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which had 900 Covid-19 beds, had to reduce it to 700 beds. The hospital later added 50 beds.Also read | Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to PM Modi, expresses gratitude for supply of oxygen“We will observe the trend for a few days and then slowly increase the number of beds,” said a senior doctor from Rajiv Gandhi Superspecialitiy hospital, asking not to be named.The Delhi government-run Burari hospital, which runs 370 beds for Covid-19 patients, had to restrict admissions due to the erratic oxygen supply. The hospital has a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant, but needs an additional 250 to 260 oxygen cylinders to support Covid-19 patients. “We have had to restrict new admissions depending on the availability of oxygen,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.Several private hospitals, too, said they were keeping beds empty due to the uncertainty of oxygen supply.Hakeem Abdul Hameed Centenary Hospital on Thursday had at least 200 beds that were not being utilised for want of oxygen. “We have more feet on the ground than any other hospital, so we can look after more patients. We have 200-plus beds empty because we do not have wherewithal to get oxygen,” said Dr Sunil Kohli, head of the department of medicine at the hospital. The hospital does not have a large storage quantity and needs several refills a day.Watch | India’s oxygen crisis: IIT Kanpur alumni raise over 3 crore to help Delhi, UP“Patients are dying and hospitals have vacant beds because of the uncertainty of oxygen supply. If Delhi starts getting enough oxygen regularly, the number of beds can be increased by at least 5,000 across city hospitals,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospitals Forum.Government records seen by HT showed that Delhi has now inched closer to its augmentation target of 4,625 oxygen beds and crossed the target of 1,126 ICU beds.To be sure, these augmentation targets were to be met by April 27.As on May 6 afternoon, Delhi had 19,330 oxygen beds, including 5,400 ICU beds, according to the government’s app. On April 20 afternoon, the first day of the ongoing lockdown which was imposed to strengthen the health care infrastructure, Delhi had 15,230 oxygen beds, including 4,139 ICUs. In the 16 days, the oxygen beds have increased by 4,100 and ICUs have increased by 1,261, government records said.According to officials, the exercise was delayed because of the severe shortage of oxygen and by April 27, the government managed to increase oxygen beds and ICU by hardly 40% of what was targeted. Now, the government plans to add 15,000 beds in hospitals and facilities attached with hospitals and add 1,200 more ICUs by May 10, according to the documents seen by HT. “Things look better now with better supply of oxygen since May 2,” said one official, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/can-add-9-000-beds-if-o2-quota-is-met-arvind-kejriwal-101620328302364.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B’s O2 generator model gets 1,000 queries in a week||A week after the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay ((IIT-B), set up a demonstration unit converting nitrogen generators into oxygen generators, the institute has been receiving requests from policymakers, industry and hospitals for adopting the technology.So far the institute, along with its industry partner Tata Consulting Engineers Limited (TCE), has received over 1,000 inquiries from across the country for implementing the technology to beat the severe oxygen shortage for Covid-19 patients. On April 29, IIT-B and TCE demonstrated a simple method of converting nitrogen generators, which are found in all parts of India, into oxygen generators by fine-tuning the existing nitrogen plant set up. Milind Atrey, institute chair professor, department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT-B, along with TCE demonstrated a proof of concept using a model nitrogen plant available on campus.“Along with TCE, we have set up a helpline for helping people use this technology in an existing nitrogen plant. The helpline has been flooded since the announcements We’ve received interest from government bodies, hospitals and even industry bodies that want to convert an existing nitrogen plant into oxygen generators. We are providing handholding support for easy adoption of the technology,” said Atrey, who is also the dean, research and development of IIT-B.The institute has made all technical specifications available in the public domain. “Those interested can write to us at tceconnect@tce.co.in,” Atrey added.Nitrogen generation plants, which take in air from the atmosphere and separate oxygen and nitrogen to give out liquid nitrogen, can be found in various industries such as oil and gas, food and beverages. Nitrogen is dry in nature and is used commonly for purging and cleaning oil and gas tankers. Most nitrogen plants work on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, where air from the atmosphere is sucked in, filtered of impurities and nitrogen is extracted. The team has proposed to switch the filter used for nitrogen extraction in the PSA unit with one that can extract oxygen instead.The team replaced the carbon molecular sieves, used in nitrogen plants, with zeolite molecular sieves in the PSA nitrogen plant in the Refrigeration and Cryogenics Laboratory of IIT-B. Zeolite molecular sieves are used for separating oxygen from the air. By controlling the flow rates of the containers, the researchers were able to convert the nitrogen plant on campus into an oxygen generating plant. Spantech Engineers, a city-based company that deals with PSA nitrogen and oxygen plant production, partnered on this pilot project and installed the required plant components as a skid at IIT-B for evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-s-o2-generator-model-gets-1-000-queries-in-a-week-101620328434203.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Nair hospital launches mental health helpline for its Covid patients||Mumbai Central-based BYL Nair Hospital has become the first civic-run medical college to start a mental health helpline wherein in-house Covid patients and their relatives can call exclusively for counselling. The helpline number —8828315805 — was launched on Thursday in association with Naraindas Morbai Budhrani Trust. Nair hospital’s ‘Virtual Counselling and Mental Health support for Covid-19 patients and caregivers’ will be functional between 9am and 7pm everyday. It will be manned by six psychologists from the trust who have been trained by the psychiatry team of the hospital.“Our psychiatry department has started this helpline with Budhrani Trust. During the training, we provide them [patients and their relatives] reading materials to acquire knowledge about Covid-19. Any infected patient who gets admitted to the hospital or any suspected patient with Covid-19 symptoms who visit the out-patient department (OPD) for check-ups can call at the helpline number for counselling. This helpline number is dedicated only to the hospital’s patients and their relatives,” said Dr Henal Shah, head of the department, psychiatry, Nair Hospital. However, in case anyone who is not associated with the hospital calls on the helpline, the psychologists will not refuse them help. A poster near the emergency ward and OPD, with the helpline number, reads, ‘It’s normal to feel sad, stressed, fearful or angry during a situation crisis. Talk to people you trust and get relieved.”Speaking to HT, Tushar Yarmal, programme manager of the trust, said, “The number of Covid-19 cases has doubled in the second wave, which has increased anxiety and fear among people. In the first wave, we had started a helpline number focusing on the dissemination of authentic information to the public. Now, with this new helpline number, we want to focus only on counselling.”Amid the pandemic, several psychiatrists and non-government organisations (NGOs) have started various helpline numbers. King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), also runs two Covid-19 helpline numbers. But unlike Nair hospital, staff at KEM make calls to the patients to check on their health and callers can’t ring them. “We have an in-house helpline number where we call the kin of the admitted patients at KEM Hospital for counselling. We maintain the data bank of all the admitted patients. Then the second helpline is run in association with BMC where we call the recovered Covid-19 patients for counselling outside KEM,” Dr Ajita S Nayak, head of psychiatry department, KEM Hospital, said.Lokmanya Tilak General and RN Cooper hospitals do not have any helpline solely dedicated for patients suffering from Covid-19.A psychiatrist at Cooper Hospital said, “We are managing the department with four-five doctors. With this strength, we have to attend Covid-19 patients, counsel them and also handle the department. We don’t have the manpower to launch such a helpline number.”Doctors have said that Covid-19 not only affects patients’ physical health but takes a toll on their mental well-being. Patients who are kept in isolation and intensive care units (ICU) often develop mental ailments such as anxiety and depression, which continue to linger long after they are discharged from the hospital. Recently, urban development minister Eknath Shinde also suggested that psychiatric help should be provided to patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-nair-hospital-launches-mental-health-helpline-for-its-covid-patients-kin-101620328374143.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra:Coxavin for 18-44 group to be used for 2nd dose receivers?||In another round of the state versus Centre battle, the Maharashtra government has blamed the latter for delay in providing Covaxin doses, permission to procure medical equipment such as Remdesivir, oxygen, liquid oxygen tanks, and reducing the supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to the state from Karnataka by 50 metric tonnes. Health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said that Maharashtra could temporarily suspend the administration of the first dose of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and divert the state’s 479,000 Covaxin doses, purchased on Tuesday, for those awaiting their second shot. The move is being contemplated as the Centre is not providing enough stock of the vaccine, Tope said. “We might have to suspend Covaxin for 18-44 category [temporarily] and utilise some of these doses for the second shot, because as per scientific advice, those who have received Covaxin shots must be given their second dose within 42 days. The policy decision will be taken by the chief minister in a day or so,” the minister said, adding that is crucial that the Centre provides Covaxin doses for second shots. “We are following up with the Centre to get the second dose of Covaxin. If need be, we are prepared to utilise the stock state government has purchased for 18-44 age group. Our first priority will be to secure the doses from the Centre. If that is not possible, we will take a call to use our stock as the second dose for inoculating those over age 45,” he said.The shortage of vaccines is now limited to Covaxin, as Covishield is available in enough quantity.Maharashtra vaccinated nearly 450,000 people, up from Wednesday’s 250,000, on Thursday. According to the data on Cowin app, Maharashtra administered 447,956 vaccinations across 5,627 centres in the state, making it the second-highest inoculation done in a single-day. The state had vaccinated 534,228 beneficiaries on April 26. So far, Maharashtra has inoculated 17,286,448 beneficiaries, of which 3,077,962 have taken their second dose, as per data.Meanwhile, Tope also said that the decision to reduce Maharashtra’s quota of LMO from Karnataka will have an impact as the state is managing on the supply from other states while completely utilising 1,250MT of LMO manufactured in Maharashtra. “Maharashtra needs 1,750MT of oxygen daily. If Karnataka reduces its supply, then we will definitely feel the shortage. It is not right to reduce our allocation. We are going to appeal against this injustice,” Tope said, adding that the only ray of hope for the state is the installation of around 28 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants. The state has placed orders for 150 PSA plants which will commence operations in the coming week, he said.Tope also said that the Centre’s Department of Pharmaceuticals has not granted clearance for the essential items that the state intends to import in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases. “The Department of Pharmaceuticals is not giving a speedy approval for the various essential items that we have to order from abroad. We are confident that in the next two days, the permission to procure 350,000 Remdesivir injections will come from the Centre. This has to expedite so that we can give a purchase order for it,” he said. The minister said that the state is preparing for the third wave so that the districts become self-sufficient for oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtracoxavin-for-18-44-group-to-be-used-for-2nd-dose-receivers-101620328313654.html
07-05-2021||Other||HC asks Centre to decide on oxygen allocation to Tamil Nadu||Chennai: The Madras high court has directed the Centre to take a decision by Friday on the revised allocation of 475 metric tonnes of oxygen to Tamil Nadu after the state health secretary J Radhakrishnan informed the court that the revised quantum was agreed upon by the Centre but an order issued on May 5 did not include Tamil Nadu. More alarming is the fact that if the Centre does not release the agreed upon revised allotment, the reserve oxygen in Tamil Nadu will last only till Friday and that there might be a shortage from Saturday, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) Secretary P Umanath told the court. The state produces 400 MTs of oxygen per day and current usage is between 400-450 MTs per day. The state explained that the INOX plant in Sriperumbudur is the lifeline as it supplies 150 MT but the Centre has diverted 60 MT to other states. The central government has revised the data to 475 MT and said that it requires approval of the empowered group, but it has still not come through. Umanath submitted the gist of the meeting with the Centre on the sharing of oxygen to nearby states of Kerala and Telangana. “The diversion of oxygen from Sriperumbudur to other states has put us in a difficult situation. There is no alternative supply to southern states and we are managing with the reserves and it will run out tomorrow,” Umanath told the court. The submissions were made during a suo motu case of Covid-19 second wave preparedness in Tamil Nadu being heard by the first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy. On the demand for beds, the health secretary submitted that oxygen beds and ventilators are fast filling up and 875 new ones will come up Friday. The court also asked the health secretary about the deaths in Chengalpattu government hospital. Thirteen patients died between late Tuesday night and early hours of Wednesday. The state informed the court that they have formed a committee to establish the cause of death but submitted that there were provided oxygen. Doctors in the hospital had protested on Wednesday alleging that it was due to oxygen shortage. But the hospital dean said that there was only a drop in oxygen pressure and the patients died due to critical illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-centre-to-decide-on-oxygen-allocation-to-tamil-nadu-101620328193629.html
07-05-2021||Other||Stalin cabinet to be a mix of veterans, young leaders||Chennai: Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Thursday accepted DMK’s list of 34 ministers who will take oath with chief minister elect M K Stalin on Friday. At a party meeting, it was decided that Stalin, who will be sworn in as chief minister at 9am on Friday, will hold the portfolio of the home department, welfare of differently-abled persons among other portfolios. The cabinet is a mix of Stalin’s close aides, veterans and young leaders.Perhaps the most important portfolio amid the pandemic is the health ministry which has been handed over to former Chennai mayor M Subramanian. He is one of Stalin’s closest aides having been together from their youth wing days. Subramanian, who was mayor from 2006-2011 is elected an MLA from Chennai’s Saidapet constituency where he defeated former AIADMK’s Chennai mayor Saidai Duraisamy. Subramanian is also a marathon runner and an accessible leader.Another crucial portfolio during the pandemic will be handled by Palanivel Thiagarajan who will be finance and human resource minister. Thiagarajan, an MBA graduate from MIT Sloan and a former investment banker with stints in Lehman Brothers, Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore and US, returned to India. He is currently the DMK’s IT-wing head and was re-elected as MLA from Madurai Central constituency. The old guard such as party organising secretary Duraimurugan, K N Nehru, E V Velu and K Ponmudi have been made ministers for water resources, municipal administration, public works and higher education respectively. Former AIADMK transport minister V Senthil Balaji who sided with TTV Dhinakaran and was among the 18 rebel MLAs who were disqualified and joined the DMK in 2018, will be the new electricity, prohibition and excise minister. P K Sekar Babu who works immensely in Stalin’s constituency of Kolathur will be minister for Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments. Stalin’s son Udhaynidhi who is elected as an MLA in his electoral debut didn’t make it to the list but his close aide and Thiruverumbur MLA from Trichy, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi has been handed the responsibility as school education minister. Only two women have been given ministerial posts- Geetha Jeevan gets social welfare portfolio and Kayalvizhi Selvaraj who defeated the state BJP chief L Murugan will be minister for Adi Dravidar Welfare.Political observers say the new cabinet is a gamble. “It’s a blend of old guards and green horns. Durai Murugan is gracefully sidelined with a portfolio which ‘will coordinate with all departments’’ says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “Subramanian and Anbil Mahesh are given crucial portfolios in which they don’t have experience or expertise. It is a gamble. Thiagarajan is a good choice as FM. Delta region is not represented while Kongu is given heavy representation-- may be to win them back.” Kongu or western region is the AIADMK’s bastion-- the only region where DMK couldn’t make inroads even in this election.Stalin has asked his cadre to watch the swearing in ceremony from home to prevent the spread of Covid-19. It would be low-key event at the Raj Bhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stalin-cabinet-to-be-a-mix-of-veterans-young-leaders-101620328075878.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) observatory at Sector 39 recorded 14.2mm rain between 6pm and 8:30pm, which was accompanied by winds blowing at speeds up to 50 kilometre/hour.After a sunny start to the day, which saw maximum temperature reach 36.1°C, mercury fell to 22°C by 8:30pm. The IMD, Chandigarh, has predicted light rain on Friday as well, which is likely to be followed by cloudy weather on Saturday and another spell of light rain on Sunday. In the next three days, maximum temperature is expected to remain between 33 and 35 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 23 and 24 degrees.“A system of western disturbances had led to the showers and winds on Thursday. Light run up to 20mm is likely on Friday, while another spell is expected on Sunday. Gusty winds blowing at speeds up to 50km/hour along with thunder can also be expected,” said an IMD official, adding that another system of western disturbances is likely to affect the city around Tuesday as well.Meanwhile, the winds led to power outages in many parts of the city. While Sectors 35, 36 and 43 remained without electricity for up to three hours, power was restored at Sectors 27, 33 and 48 after a short outage, though many residents complained that the UT electricity officials were not picking up their calls. Many villages, including Dhanas, Raipur Khurd and Maloya, also remained without electricity for hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-gusty-winds-lash-chandigarh-more-to-follow-101620328075407.html

Soon after the incident, paurakarmikas in the ward staged a protest in the streets demanding better equipment for them. They demanded that they have not been provided with the required safety equipment even though they are frontline workers, and they perform a high-risk job. Nayanamma, one of the sweepers at the protest said that the government has not provided them with any safety apparatus but also, they are made to walk for hours since no public transport is available. “We come to work every day knowing the risks involved in our jobs. Susheelamma was one of us and she is no more. The authorities have no paid attention to our demand for safety equipment and our demand for providing us transportation to reach our workplaces,” he said. On April 28, pourakarmikas in Bengaluru staged a protest, demanding protective gears like masks and gloves. They alleged that for the past nine months, they have not been provided any masks or gloves. In a letter to the commissioner of BBMP, BBMP Civic Workers’ Union demanded gloves, sanitiser and shoes for workers. “We are working in these times without any facilities. We also humans, just like you,” said Rathna, a civic worker, in a statement to the media following the protest on April 28. “We have been working for many years and despite the Covid (pandemic), we continue to work. But we haven’t received any of the facilities that we should have. The last time we got masks and gloves was last year. We have been asking for three weeks but we still haven’t been given masks and gloves,” she added. The workers have said that despite their protest, no safety gear has been provided to them and most importantly, many civic workers are yet to receive their vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-civic-workers-demand-safety-gear-after-one-dies-of-covid-101620328013530.html

07-05-2021||Other||Covid scare moves beyond K’taka capital||Bengaluru: Despite the exponential surge in Covid-19 cases in Karnataka, the focus of the state government has primarily been on the capital city of Bengaluru, from where a major chunk of the daily cases, 49.5% to be precise, are being reported in the second wave of the pandemic. However, it changed after the death of 24 Covid-19 patients at two hospitals in Chamarajanagar allegedly due to shortage of oxygen. Experts have alerted the government about a likely spike in other districts of the state by next week. An initial trend of this change can be gauged from the statistics of Covid-19 cases in the state. An analysis of infections reported between April 27 and May 3 by the state Covid war room, shows that Bengaluru city does not even feature in the first three spots in terms of case positivity rate. As per war room data, Mysuru district reported the highest positivity rate at 28.8%, followed by Tumkuru at 25.6% and Ballari at 25%. Bengaluru Urban with a positivity rate of 24.7% came in fourth place, while the state’s average was recorded at 20.9%. Even in terms of case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths per 100 cases, several districts have surpassed Bengaluru. Haveri in north Karnataka reported the highest CFR of 2%, much higher than the state’s average of 0.6%. While Bengaluru city has a CFR of 0.5%, districts like Chamarajangara (1.8%), Ramanagara (1.4%), Chitradurga (1.3%) and Bidar (1.2%) have reported high CFR rates. In terms of absolute numbers, however, no district in the state is anywhere closer to Bengaluru city. On Wednesday, Bengaluru Urban reported 168 deaths, while all other districts reported less than 50 deaths. The city also accounted for 23,706 new Covid-19 cases out of the total 49,058 reported from across the state on Thursday. The active caseload in Bengaluru and Karnataka stood at 332,732 and 517,075, respectively as on Thursday, according to the state health department. Ashwin Mahesh, an urban expert said Bengaluru is still the biggest headache for the state government. “One out of every 35 people in Bengaluru currently has Covid. If you consider the active cases, which are mostly counted among adults, it could be as high as one in every 25 adults. This is our current situation, and we are not talking about people having had Covid at some time, but only the current cases,” he said. Even though the absolute numbers make Bengaluru a bigger problem for the government, experts fear that unlike the city, most districts lack health infrastructure to handle a spike similar to what has been witnessed in Bengaluru. “The expert committee has asked the government to increase the ICU and bed capacity in the vulnerable districts and increase the oxygen supply,” said Giridhar Babu, a member of the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19. According to experts, an increase in infections across the state can be attributed to the exodus of people from Bengaluru to various parts of the state ahead of the statewide “closed down” announced on April 27. Officials familiar with the development said that following a meeting with experts, chief minister BS Yediyurappa has been advised to extend the lockdown like restrictions in the state. Officials added that there are chances of a further extension of the lockdown, but the decision will be taken on May 10. Experts also added that the government has been making some decisions lately despite the repeated advice from the TAC for a coordinated effort. “Recently, the government has decentralised the responsibilities for taking care of remdesivir, oxygen and beds to different ministers. The health minister has been stripped of several powers. We are not saying the health minister was doing a fantastic job, but a reshuffle of responsibilities during a crisis is not a wise decision. By the time these newly appointed ministers learn about the situation on the ground, we would have lost precious time,” said a member of the TAC on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, during a hearing on the deaths of 24 Covid-19 patients allegedly due to shortage of oxygen, the Karnataka high court on Wednesday directed the state’s chief secretary to seize all records related to oxygen supply from the offices of deputy commissioners of Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts, and also from the Chamarajanagar district hospital. The bench asked the chief secretary to keep all the documents in his safe custody till further orders of the court. It came after the deputy commissioners of the two districts were involved in a blame game over the deaths of 24 Covid-19 patients in Chamarajaganar. The Karnataka government on Wednesday appointed retired high court judge Justice B A Patil as the one-man commission to inquire into the Chamarajanagar incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-scare-moves-beyond-k-taka-capital-101620327834139.html

He said this at his first virtual meeting with the panel of 14 experts headed by Dr RK Dhiman, director of the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow. “The panel must meet every day to discuss Covid-19 and send its reports to the state health department, the state medical education department and the CM’s office. The panel should also update the government medical institutions, hospitals and other such institutions in the state regarding Covid treatment,” he said The role of medical experts and doctors was praiseworthy in putting up an effective fight against the virus in the second wave, he said. “This is not the time for negative talk. Instead, diversion of energies should be towards joining hands in the fight and also boosting the morale of doctors, health workers, paramedics, sanitation workers, and all frontline workers. Such an approach will be a big support and psychological strength to the society,” he said. He also asked the expert panel to devise ways for publicity campaigns to make people aware of the safety against the disease. Dr Dhiman said medical experts should give information on the mass media about Covid safety and treatment. “Protection is more important than treatment so far as Covid is concerned. Covid appropriate behaviour, use of masks, gloves, sanitisers, social distancing, and vaccination would help a great deal in overcoming the fight against the virus,” he said. He made a presentation before the team regarding Covid and told the chief minister that the panel will follow the mandate given to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-1st-meeting-with-medical-experts-yogi-asks-them-to-analyse-covid-situation-challenges-101620327833522.html

Due to the non-availability of ICU beds in the hospital, 2 persons, Venkata Subbarao & Manjunath, connected to the hospital and in connivance with Punith -- working as Arogya Mitra in another hospital -- demanded & extorted ₹120,000 from Lakshmisha, the son of the patient, for allotting a bed in a reputed hospital. ₹50K was paid via GPay & ₹70K was paid in cash,” Pant said in two-part tweets on Thursday.He added that the patient died a few hours after being allotted a bed, after which his son Lakshmisha filed a complaint with the police.The two accused were arrested on Thursday, said police, adding that further investigation was on.The incident comes two days after a section of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators made serious allegations against the administration of Bengaluru civic body.Lok Sabha member Tejaswi Surya along with two legislators from Bengaluru had alleged that there were at least 4,065 instances in which hospital beds were booked in the name of asymptomatic persons and later allotments were changed by people employed at the Covid war room with the help of officials and outside agents.“Yesterday (Wednesday) searches were conducted at 8 zonal war rooms. Lot of data has been collected. Eight teams led by one PI each are scrutinising all data. Further action will be taken based on information taken out from this data.

Police custody will be taken for further interrogation,” Sandeep Patil, the joint commissioner of police, Crime, said.The scam was, however, given a communal colour by Surya and the two legislators -- Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya -- as they singled out names of Muslims working in the war room.Meanwhile, Reddy’s name has also cropped up in the scandal, with allegations that his supporters were also part of the racket.There have been rising complaints against government officials for helping touts to profiteer from the sale of antiviral drugs and injections like remdesivir, taking bribes for hospital beds and even jumping the long-winding queues outside crematoriums.All these come at a time when Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru in particular have seen an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic. On Thursday, the state reported 49,058 new infections , taking the active caseload to 517,075. Bengaluru accounted for 23,706 new infections, taking its total active case count to 332,732. As many as 328 people succumbed to the viral disease in Karnataka on Thursday, taking the toll in the state to 17,212. Bengaluru reported 139 deaths on Thursday, taking its toll due to Covid-19 to 7,145, according to the daily bulletin of the health department. According to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Central Hospital Bed Management System website, there are over 1,738 beds vacant out of the total 11,074 in government and private hospitals and medical colleges. However, several incidents of critical patients denied admission at hospitals have been reported in the past two weeks.On Thursday, a family drove the ambulance straight to the official residence of CM Yediyurappa, crying for help. In a video that was circulated widely on social media, a man and his sister desperately cry for help to find a bed for her husband who is critically ill and in the ambulance. “We are willing to pay and do not want any money from the government. All we want is a hospital bed,” the man is heard saying. “We have gone to almost 20 hospitals but everywhere they tell us that there are no beds. But the government comes on TV and says that there are enough beds. Please help us get justice,” he pleads with the police and media personnel present there. The woman said that she has two children and wants to save her husband’s life.Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP, on Thursday said the city administration was looking to convert around 50% of the beds in Covid care centres meant for asymptomatic patients, into oxygenated beds. He added that there are around 15,000 hotel rooms in the city and at least 945 of them will be converted as ‘step-down’ hospitals to ease the pressure on the existing and inadequate healthcare infrastructure in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/black-marketing-of-bengaluru-hospital-beds-continues-101620327773483.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||PGI staff with high-risk exposure due to own laxity to go on casual leave||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has ordered that the quarantine period of healthcare workers, who are at high risk for exposure due to their own laxity in following Covid-19 norms, will be treated as casual leave. In the month of April, around 500 employees of the institute had tested positive, which makes it around 30% of the total employees found positive since the outbreak last year. Justifying the directive, the institute said that it is being observed that despite a huge surge in Covid-19 cases, some health workers do not observe Covid-appropriate behaviour and thus there should be some sort of deterrent so that precautions are observed while performing the duties. The PGIMER administration has brought it to the notice of employees that if someone falls under high-risk exposure due to “sharing of food” and “chatting during duty hours without a mask” or “not wearing proper personal protective equipment due to an unjustifiable reason”, his quarantine period will be treated as casual leave or leave of the kind due. The administration has also given powers to the supervisory officer and in-charge of the area to take necessary action while the department heads have been asked to bring the directive to the notice of every employee working under them. The directive has not gone well with different groups of workers who have been at the forefront of managing critical patients. “The order should be taken back immediately. If the administration is concerned about infection spread among health workers, they should revise the policy on breaks after Covid-19 duties. Earlier, we were being given seven-day breaks after being on Covid duty now we are getting just two. This new policy, which was implemented on April 1, has led to infection spread among employees,” said Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary of the Nurses Welfare Association. Meanwhile, the Resident Doctors Association has said that the order is unjustified and they hope that the order is not followed in letter and spirit. “Doctors are also humans. Sometimes, it may not be possible for them to take the required precautions, which makes this order unjustified. But at the same time, health workers should also follow the precautions wherever they can,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of PGIMER’s RDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgi-staff-with-high-risk-exposure-due-to-own-laxity-to-go-on-casual-leave-101620327714069.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three naval ships to bring in oxygen from Persian Gulf||The Indian Navy’s three warships INS Kochi, INS Tabar and INS Trikand, ferrying liquid medical oxygen (LMO) and associated medical equipment from the Persian Gulf, are currently on their way to Mumbai as part of the mission Samudra Setu-II.The Indian Navy had launched ‘Samudra Setu-II’ last month to meet the country’s oxygen requirement amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. As part of the mission, seven ships - INS (Indian Navy Ship) Kolkata, Kochi, Talwar, Tabar, Trikand, Jalashwa and Airavat have been deployed for shipment of oxygen-filled cryogenic containers and associated medical equipment from various countries. INS Kochi and INS Tabar departed Kuwait and INS Trikand departed Doha on May 6 with a total of seven tanks, each of 20 tonnes (total 140 tonnes) liquid oxygen tanks and 14,000 oxygen cylinders, said Navy official.INS Kolkata and INS Airavat are already en route from Kuwait and Singapore respectively with more than 4,000 oxygen cylinders, two containers each have 20 MT (40 tonnes) oxygen-filled containers and eight oxygen tanks. Earlier, Indian Naval Ship Talwar arrived at the port of New Mangalore in Karnataka on May 5 with the first consignment of 54 tons liquid oxygen tanks from Bahrain, said chief public relation officer (CPRO) and commander Mehul Karnik. Also, a 26 member medical team including seven doctors, two nursing officers, two paramedics and 15 battlefield nursing assistants (BFNA) have been deputed from Eastern Naval Command (ENC) to augment the frontline medical team at Dhanvantari Covid hospital in Ahmedabad, added Karnik.The medical personnel from various units of ENC were airlifted from Visakhapatnam to Ahmedabad on May 6. The 26 member team is in addition to 58 doctors, 30 nursing officers, 64 medical assistance and 62 Battle Field Nursing Assistance (BFNAs) deputed earlier by the Indian Navy for duties at Covid hospitals established at New Delhi, Patna, Ahmedabad and Kavaratti island for providing aid to the civil population, said Karnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-three-naval-ships-to-bring-in-oxygen-from-persian-gulf-101620327413516.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 853 deaths, 62,194 new Covid-19 cases||With 853 deaths on Thursday, Maharashtra recorded a total of 4,702 deaths in the first six days of April, bringing the average number of deaths to 783 per day. The number is almost three times higher as compared to last month’s 1,402 deaths from April 1 to 6, which averaged 233 deaths per day. From March 1 to 6, 286 deaths were recorded, which averaged 47 deaths per day.The total number of deaths in the state since the outbreak of the virus has now touched 73,515. On Wednesday, the state recorded 920 deaths which was the second-highest one day toll in the state. The highest toll was 985 on April 28 last month.On Thursday, the state recorded 62,194 new Covid-19 cases, as 2,77,086 citizens were tested for the virus.There are currently 6,39,075 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 1,15,182 patients followed by Nagpur with 61,178 active patients. The death toll has now reached 73,515 with Mumbai leading with 13,580 deaths followed by Pune with 9,942 patients.According to Dr Tatrarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), the deaths have increased corresponding with the surge of the virus. “We saw increasing deaths due to the second wave which was more lethal than the first one. The current deaths are of those who have been affected mostly two weeks ago. Due to the lockdown, we will see the deaths stabilising and even coming down in the coming days,” said Lahane.Dr Satyendra Nath Mehra, director, Masina Hospital at Byculla, attributes the increase in the death rates to two main factors. “The younger generation is suffering from ‘Happy Hypoxia’ a condition where the patient does not realise that his oxygen level is low and is happily continuing his normal activities. This results in the progression of the disease and are causing deaths,” said Mehra.“The second is that whole families are getting infected and the worst sufferers are the elderly family members who are already suffering from other diseases. Their condition is deteriorating faster due to this new strain,” he added.As the Covid-19 virus continues to rage in many places, the state government has now decided to enforce an eight-day strict lockdown at Badlapur city in Thane district from Saturday onwards. Badlapur now follows six districts like Ahmednagar, Baramati, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Beed where a strict lockdown is already in place due to the surge in Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, a company, Genetek Lifesciences located at Wardha has started its operations of producing Remdesivir injections. Union minister Nitin Gadkari was able to procure licenses for this company within three days as it will be producing 30,000 vials of the injections daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-853-deaths-62-194-new-covid-19-cases-101620327353477.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body installs 15 LMO tanks in 40 days||In a span of 40 days between May and June last year, Mumbai civic body installed 15 Liquid Medical Oxygen [LMO] tanks with a capacity of 13 kilolitres each and 11 smaller tanks with a capacity of up to six kilolitres each in the city’s six civic-run hospitals and six jumbo Covid-19 centres. These oxygen storage tanks played a crucial role for Mumbai, which saw its daily demand for medical oxygen go up from 210 metric tonnes (MT) in the first wave to 270 (MT) in the past month alone. The “Mumbai model” has won praise from both the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court. The apex court on Wednesday appreciated Mumbai’s efforts and recommended that the Centre and Delhi take a cue on how to handle oxygen supply in the face of the severe shortage that the Capital city has been facing for the past three weeks. On Thursday, the HC said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation chief Iqbal Chahal should hold a video conference with other municipal bodies and explain how the city managed the second wave. So what did Mumbai do to control the crisis? “Building the additional LMO tanks helped us cope during the second wave,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said. “The tanks, construction, fitting, and piping altogether cost us over ₹14 crore. At that point, we didn’t know if they would be utilised, but we still went ahead and created that infrastructure,” he said. That’s barely 0.32% of the BMC’s total budgetary allocation for healthcare in 2020-2021. LMO tanks are highly pressurised tanks that are installed on reinforced concrete structures and require certification by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a department under the ministry of commerce and industry, which has also been overseeing the supply and distribution of oxygen during this crisis. The tanks were installed in facilities with greater bed capacity. For instance, NESCO’s jumbo centre in Goregaon which was opened last June and currently has 2015 beds was fitted with two LMO tanks, but only one was used last year. The BMC plans to construct 10 more LMOs across the city in preparation for a possible third wave expected anytime between July and September, civic officials said. Crack teams and quick response vehicles In April, the city’s daily average cases had touched 7,786 and this is when the oxygen crisis was felt most keenly: many patients were shifted from one hospital to another due to a shortfall of oxygen [for instance, 168 patients were moved out of six government hospitals to jumbo centres on April 17 after oxygen supply was affected], hospital staff struggled with getting supplies and often left with only a few hours of oxygen, some facilities had to refuse admissions. By mid-April, the city had only 41 ICU beds and 15 ventilator beds out of a total of 2,664 and 1,339 respectively. That’s when the BMC announced that it would appoint six civic officials to act as coordinators between oxygen suppliers, assistant municipal commissioners of the 24 civic wards and the Food and Drug Administration. The officials will be responsible for maintaining the existing oxygen supply and also ensuring that the same is used sparingly. Part of Mumbai’s oxygen supply model evolved to ensure the safe transportation of oxygen cylinders. Only two civic-run hospitals, Kasturba in Arthur Road and HBT Trauma Care in Jogeshwari, have oxygen generation plants. Other big hospitals, like civic run KEM, Sion, Nair, Cooper hospitals and private-run Bombay Hospital, have large capacity LMO tanks which are refilled at least once daily. Other hospitals rely on cylinders; in fact, all hospitals are mandated to keep cylinders as backup. When the crisis hit, the civic body deployed six quick response vehicles [tempos] that would ferry oxygen cylinders and concentrators to hospitals in crisis. “Ward-level teams were formed to coordinate and move surplus oxygen from one site to another where there was a shortfall,” said Krishna H Perekar, BMC’s chief engineer (Mechanical and Electrical). A resource inventory of oxygen use and infrastructure of the city’s public as well as private hospitals proved helpful, as Mumbai’s oxygen often needed to go to far-flung suburbs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, like Navi Mumbai and Thane, which also faced severe shortage of supply. “Our inventory has micro-details like the number of jumbo oxygen cylinders, dura cylinders, and capacity of the LMO tanks at all hospitals. We also have exact details of the oxygen usage at each hospital,” Velrasu said. This inventory came in handy when oxygen had to be transported from one hospital to another or in instances where patients had to be moved. “We formed crack teams to ensure that the LMO tanks reach Mumbai smoothly. These teams were also deployed at the cylinder refilling plant at Navi Mumbai to ensure that Mumbai gets its quota of cylinders,” he said. The civic body has a contract with a private agency, Satramdas Gases Pvt Ltd, whose refilling station is located in Navi Mumbai. When a train carrying three liquid medical oxygen tanks arrived from Gujarat to Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai last month, a crack team consisting of engineers, staff, and guards from the BMC was already waiting on the platform of the goods yard of Kalamboli station. The tankers were swiftly offloaded and routed to Mumbai. At the peak of the crisis, the city still faced a shortfall of 15 to 20MT despite all these efforts: this was managed by moving surplus stock from one place to another, and seeking oxygen from Gujarat. Medical protocolLast month, as the demand for medical oxygen, began to rise, the Maharashtra Covid-19 task force recommended that doctors should stop the use of High Flow Nasal Cannula to deliver oxygen (up to 80 litres/ min) due to the high pressure in the machine. Hospitals were encouraged to use the Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machine, which delivers oxygen either through a flowmeter (up to 15 litres/min) or a non-invasive ventilator (up to 30 litres/min), and with lower pressure. “Soon after the advisory, we completely stopped use of HNFC and alternatively started using non-invasive ventilation such as BiPAP,” said Dr. Ramesh Bharmal, dean of civic-run Nair Hospital. Dr. Gautam Bhansali, who consults at the Bombay Hospital said that they reduced the use of HNFC too. “It is hard to completely stop its use because most patients are comfortable with the nasal cannula. With the BiPAP, we have to use a face mask which some patients find uncomfortable,” he said. As the cases in the city have also decreased, the city’s daily requirement of oxygen has now come down to 240MT per day. The civic body now plans to construct an oxygen generation plant at each hospital, so that the dependency of LMO and cylinders reduces. “We may still require LMO as they provide better pressure, mainly for patients in the Intensive Care Units,” said Velrasu. “But having oxygen plants at all facilities will reduce the dependency to a large extent,” he said. The BMC has announced that it would set up 16 oxygen generation plants in 12 hospitals across the city, each of which will produce an estimated 43MT of oxygen. The project will cost ₹90 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-installs-15-lmo-tanks-in-40-days-101620327293482.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Second Covid-19 wave: 13.05% of Maharashtra’s cases from Mumbai||During the second wave of Covid-19, in April 2021, Mumbai has contributed to 13.05% of Maharashtra’s total Covid-19 cases, and 10.1% to Maharashtra’s total deaths, showing a decrease from figures reported in October last year, when cases in the city also peaked. In October 2020, Mumbai contributed to 17.76% of Maharashtra’s cases and 18% of deaths. Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, Maharashtra has experienced two waves, one until October last year, and the second since March his year, according to experts. Mumbai’s cases during these two waves peaked on October 7 at 2,484 cases, and on April 4 at 11,206. While the number of daily cases in Mumbai during the second wave was much higher than the first wave, its share in Maharashtra’s overall cases has declined. In October 2020, Maharashtra reported a total of 293,960 Covid-19 cases and 7,249 deaths, whereas Mumbai reported 52,229 Covid-19 cases, and 1,271 deaths. In April this year, Maharashtra reported a total of 1,789,492 Covid-19 cases and 14,182 deaths, whereas Mumbai reported 233,698 cases and 1,435 deaths. Experts have attributed this to other cities and rural parts of Maharashtra catching up in terms of Covid cases and deaths, migration. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 taskforce said, “This is a relative thing. Now rural Maharashtra and other cities are also reporting a higher number of Covid-19 cases.” In May 2020, Mumbai contributed to 57% of Maharashtra’s cases and to 54% of its deaths. Dr Pandit said, “Now cases are not concentrated to Mumbai alone. Our share in deaths has decreased because of better infrastructure, and policies and protocols Mumbai put in place to reduce mortality. We are effectively utilising our resources such as general practitioners, small nursing homes and clinics as well.” In June last year, the BMC devised it’s Mission Save Lives - a nine-point strategy to reduce Covid-19 fatality. Effectively, Mumbai’s overall case fatality rate dropped from as high as 6% in the first half of 2020, to 3.5% in the second half, to under 2% now. Mumbai’s CFR for the month of October alone was 2.6%, which has dropped to 0.6% in the month of April 2021, even as cases have increased. However, experts point that even though this second wave has recorded fewer deaths due to Covid-19, it is more intense in terms of post-recovery complications. Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant of pulmonology and critical care at Global Hospital in Parel, said, “Independently, Mumbai has recorded higher cases in this wave as compared to the last wave, as the new variants of Covid-19 are more infectious. But in the first wave, patients did not need as many days of ICU care as now. Now patients are recovering more slowly. Moreover, within 21-30 days, patients are developing fibrosis due to Covid-19, which has serious effects on mortality in the long run, post recovery.” On Thursday, Mumbai reported 3,028 covid-19 cases and 69 deaths, taking the tally to 668,085 and toll to 13,580. However, deaths per day in Mumbai were in single digits in the first week of March. On Wednesday, Mumbai conducted 30,942 tests, with a daily positivity rate of 9.7%, down from 18%-20% recorded last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-covid-19-wave-13-05-of-maharashtra-s-cases-from-mumbai-101620327233432.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MLAs must talk about Centre’s work during Covid-19 pandemic, says BJP||While Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government is drawing flak over handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and its alleged non-cooperation with the non-BJP governments, the Maharashtra unit of the party has asked its legislators to educate people about the Central government’s performance.While addressing the legislators of the party May 1, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis narrated the steps taken by the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi government to manage the second wave of pandemic witnessed across the country and told them to put the same in front of the people.Fadnavis also slammed Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra and said it was blaming the Centre to cover its failures. “The second wave has indeed hit India very badly and our healthcare system has been badly affected. But it is because 15% of the infected patients need oxygen and hospital care. To address this emergency (PM) Modi government imported a fair amount of oxygen, invoked special powers to give loan licences for the production of Remdesivir. This has helped in meeting the rising demands for oxygen and life-saving drugs,” he said during his recent virtual interaction with the MLAs. BJP released the videos of the meeting on Thursday.Fadnavis said, “Maharashtra has been the largest beneficiary of Remdesivir injections, liquid medical oxygen and even the vaccines. Maharashtra has got an allocation of 475,000 Remdesivir in 10 days, 1,800 metric tonnes per day and it is the highest allocation among other states. Maharashtra government has failed to install 10 centrally sponsored PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants for which the fund of ₹402 crore was allocated by the Centre in January. Similarly, MVA leaders have been blaming the (PM) Modi government for the export of vaccines to other countries, but it was part of international diplomacy. The Maharashtra government has been boasting of having done the highest vaccination in the country. It should answer who provided the vaccines for it,” he said.In a recent meeting with the party legislators, he also asked them to explain these facts to the people of Maharashtra.Fadnavis also said that a few ‘leftist liberals’ were trying to defame India with the help of international media. “But all of you should take the reality to the people with pride as there were honest steps taken by the Centre to fight back the situation,” he said.BJP’s damage control initiative comes in the wake of a blame game between non-BJP state governments and the Centre over supplies of medical equipment and cooperation. Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders in Maharashtra slammed the Centre for the disruption in supply again.Maharashtra’s public health minister Rajesh Tope has blamed the Centre for the delay in granting clearance for the import of the medical equipment and drugs. The department of pharmaceuticals is not giving the expected cooperation for the import from other states, he said. Tope said that they were expecting 3.5 lakh Remdesivir from other countries in the next couple of days.Maharashtra has floated a global tender for the import of Remdesivir, liquid medical oxygen, oxygen storage tanks, oxygen concentrators amid the shortage during the second wave of the pandemic.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant has criticised the Central government for its negligence in dispatching the medical material to states. “(PM) Modi government sent 60 ventilators to Nashik corporation 10 days ago from the PM Cares funds, but they did not have connectors with them. The ventilators are lying unused even when there is a dire need. How can such negligence be accepted? It is an example of laxity in planning and management of the Modi government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mlas-must-talk-about-centre-s-work-during-covid-19-pandemic-says-bjp-101620327113497.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai is a model for entire country in Covid management: HC||charul.shah@htlive.com “Mumbai is a model for the entire country for its efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and the government should consider emulating in other parts of the state,” said a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni of the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday, praising the efforts taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The HC was hearing public interest litigations concerning treatment, shortage of facilities and drugs across the state.The court said the BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal should hold a video conference with commissioners of other municipal corporations in the state and share the details of the model adopted by the civic body. During the hearing, the counsel for BMC had submitted a data sheet detailing the ground position of the facilities and availability of medicine, oxygen and beds at the various Covid centres. Looking at the data the court noticed that Mumbai’s Covid facilities have availability of more beds. The court hence asked the BMC to share the data regarding the availability of extra beds and check if patients from nearby districts can be shifted to facilities in Mumbai for treatment. During the course of the hearing, the bench expressed concern over a considerable increase in cases and a huge number of active cases in Pune district and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) area. The court suggested that the state government and PMC should consider imposing drastic measures to contain the spread of the deadly infection in the area. HC said, if required, PMC should take help from BMC, which according to the court managed to control the numbers and situation in the city. HC has now directed the PMC commissioner to file a detailed affidavit listing the steps being taken to control the spread of Covid-19. “Don’t wait for our orders. We don’t want to pass any directions crossing our boundaries. But you start taking immediate actions. You may take help from the BMC commissioner about their model,” the court said to the counsel representing PMC. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted a note containing a detailed status report on Covid management across Maharashtra. Taking note of reports suggesting the impending third Covid wave, HC asked the state government to set up a group that would study the data to prepare for the state machinery for the third wave. The court asked the government if there was any group of expert set up to analyse the area-wise data, as to which areas have recorded a surge in cases and why. You should try to find out as to why there was a surge in only one particular part, the judges said. Observing that the data would be of great use to prepare for a future crisis, the judges said “we must be prepared for the third wave.” “There needs a scientific approach to understand this,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-is-a-model-for-entire-country-in-covid-management-hc-101620326634001.html
07-05-2021||Mumbai||Walk-in vaccinations suspended in Mumbai||Amid reports of crowding in several Covid-19 vaccination centres across the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday announced that no walk-in vaccination will be conducted in Mumbai from Friday across all age groups. The BMC has made it mandatory for every citizen to get a prior appointment on the Cowin portal in order to get vaccinated. The civic body also plans to start drive-in vaccination centres in all seven zones of the city for citizens above 60 years of age and the specially abled.According to the BMC, drive-in vaccination centres have been proposed in the following open grounds — Wankhede stadium, Oval Maidan, Brabourne stadium, Reliance Jio Garden, Andheri sports club, Cooperage Maidan, Shivaji Stadium, MIG Ground (Bandra), MCA Ground (BKC), Sambhaji Udyan (Mulund), Subash Nagar Ground (Chembur), Tilak Nagar Ground (Chembur), Ghatkopar Police Ground and Shivaji Maidan (Chunnabhatti).The above decisions were taken by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal after a meeting with guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on the issue of crowding across several vaccination centres in the city. On Wednesday, a stampede-like situation was reported outside the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo vaccination centre. Thackeray took to Twitter on Thursday saying, “With regards to the crowding at some of the Vaccination centres and the opening up of more “drive in” vaccination centres across the city,@mybmc Commissioner Chahal ji and I had a discussion this morning and new guidelines would be released soon.”Post this meeting, in a circular issued by him, Chahal stated, “Covid-19 vaccination centres are getting overcrowded, and it becomes difficult to maintain social distancing and Covid appropriate behaviour at the vaccination centres. Therefore, it is hereby directed that all citizens who wish to get vaccinated against COVID-19 shall in advance register themselves on the Cowin portal and also book the appointment slot at the vaccination centre of their choice on the same portal before proceeding to the vaccination centre.”The civic body however has given exceptions for appointment on three grounds. “All citizens above 45 years of age who are due for the second dose of Covaxin only are subject to production of the provisional certificate of 1st dose in either soft or hard copy followed by health care workers and front-line workers due for 2nd dose and 1st dose.”Further, in context of coming up with drive-in vaccination centres across the city, BMC, in a circular, stated citizens above the age of 60 years will be vaccinated at drive-in vaccination centres. Only Covishield vaccine will be administered at these drive-in vaccination centres. “The beneficiary citizen to be vaccinated shall not self-drive and he/she shall be accompanied by an attendant or a driver in each vehicle to deal with AEFI (Adverse Event Following Immunization), if any,” read the circular signed by Chahal.It adds, “The arrangements such as proper single lane barricades for manoeuvring of vehicles, inlet/outlet control etc. shall be done inside the ground/ stadium so that there will not be any traffic jam on the adjoining roads.”The BMC officials are also ordered to make adequate and proper temporary shelter for vaccination area to accommodate vaccination staff, the order also directs to make necessary arrangements for patients of AEFI, ambulance parking, mobile toilets and drinking water facilities. The concept of drive-in vaccination centres is being adopted after good response to the BMC’s first such centre.On Tuesday, BMC set up the first drive-in vaccination centre, where people can visit in their cars to get jabs, at a public parking lot of Kohinoor Square building at Dadar. Hundreds of beneficiaries queued in their cars at the centre to get vaccines in the past three days, according to BMC officials.Meanwhile, on Thursday, vaccination was conducted between 9am and 5 pm across all age groups. However, the BKC jumbo vaccination centre turned down several citizens in the age group of 45+. The BKC centre said it is only vaccinating the first dose for those within the 18-44 age group with prior appointment. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC vaccination centre, said, “The vaccination for 45+ is shut as there is inadequate supply. Yesterday we got 8,000 doses and it is not sufficient for our requirement.” Further, long queues were also observed across several vaccination centres in the city including Dahisar Jumbo Centre, NESCO jumbo centre, Rajawadi Hospital, KEM Hospital in the city.On Thursday, the BMC added three new centres for the vaccination drive of the 18-44 age group. Starting Friday, first dose of Covaxin will be given to 18-44 age group at these three centres — Maa Saheb Meenatai Maternity Home in Chunnabhatti, PWD Community Hall in Bandra east and The World Tower Parking in Lower Parel.

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid crisis exposes gaping holes in Chandigarh’s health policy||“The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war,” goes a proven military dictum. As Chandigarh struggles in its war against the Covid-19 pandemic, it is evident that the UT administration didn’t sweat out enough when it could.The pandemic has exposed gaping holes in the administration’s health policy and preparedness — from failure to ramp up health infrastructure to recruitment of enough manpower. Senior officials concede that the capacity of the UT’s health infrastructure didn’t expand in correlation with the increasing patient burden, and now during the pandemic it has been found to be severely wanting.“The central issue is unavailability of medical professionals. Recruitment of more than 150 doctors, against new and old posts, has been pending for several years, as Chandigarh awaits the Centre’s approval,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity. In fact, the new infrastructure created in the form of the Civil Hospital in Sector 48 had to be handed over to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, as the approval for creating 80 posts of doctor never came from the central government.Recently, after several hiccups and hanging fire for years, construction of the new emergency-cum-trauma centre started at GMCH. “But, in the absence of additional health care professionals, it is doubtful whether we will able to use these facilities adequately,” said the official.In fact, there are more than 200 sanctioned posts across all categories lying vacant at various government hospitals in Chandigarh.“This tells you that nobody wants to invest in health care,” said Dr RS Bedi, former president of Chandigarh Chapter of Indian Medical Association. “They have not recruited doctors in ages. Also, they are inclined only to employ them on contract basis. There is uncertainty of job; so people don’t want to join. They struggle even during the routine days because of pressure of patients.” Another instance where slow decision-making process is now impacting the city’s capacity to contain this unprecedented crisis is the upgrading of Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. The proposal to convert it to a medical college is pending for more than a year and a half. “Currently, there is very limited scope for expansion of medical infrastructure in the hospital. The proposed new branch in Sarangpur could have helped us during the pandemic,” said the official.Also, the proposal for allowing nursing homes in residential areas has been shuttling between sub-committees of the Administrator’s Advisory Council for years. Not only this, the pandemic has also exposed the lack of interstate coordination among the UT, Punjab and Haryana to devise common policies for the tricity. R Srinivas, town and country planner, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, said: “An interstate coordination committee was set up for the three administrations by the Centre in 1975. Its last meeting was held in 2016, but since then, it is dormant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-exposes-gaping-holes-in-chandigarh-s-health-policy-101620326513994.html

Once the benchmark for me was playing the lead and that did happen. But soon I realised that it’s just not enough. Infact playing a protagonist was the real accomplishment. Thankfully, today I have reached there. So, for me this means I have arrived on the scene,” said the versatile actor who was all set to shoot in Lucknow before the second Covid wave began. “I am super selective and try my level best to take up roles that help me challenge my craft. That’s what makes me happy at the end of the day. I ask filmmakers to give me roles where I have scope to add my nuances to the characters and today the result is there in front of us. Keval’s role in ‘Raat Akeli…’ won me many accolades and all my hard work was paid off,” he said. Ravi is awaiting the release of his new OTT series. “Thankfully it was all set for streaming else like many other projects it would have been put on hold due to alarming rise in Covid cases,” he said. “It’s actually a very low and sad phase that our country is presently going through. As an industry we are doing our best to support (people) and as performers it’s our job to entertain the masses. We are trying to do that too,” he said. His series ‘Crime Next Door’ is slated for this month and as the name suggests it’s a crime thriller drama directed by Deepankar Prakash. I play the lead. I am essaying the role of an investigating officer who is caught in a series of mishaps. I was supposed to start another series as well as a couple of other projects but now all of it will resume once things are back to normal,” said the actor who was born in Purnia, Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-performers-we-have-to-entertain-the-masses-101620326453448.html
07-05-2021||Gurugram||Expert committee to decide on tocilizumab case by case||Considering the shortage of drugs to treat Covid-19 cases, an expert committee constituted by the director-general of health services of Haryana will decide on the distribution of tocilizumab available with the state to individual Covid-19 patients in public or private health facilities.“In the last few days, we have received complaints that doctors and hospitals have been randomly and frequently prescribing tocilizumab drugs to Covid-19 patients, which is not even required in most of the cases. Now, with the formation of the expert committee, including a team of three senior doctors, the drug will be provided based on the case history of the infected patient,” said Amandeep Chauhan, district drug control officer.Tocilizumab is an imported drug, which is used to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients under certain conditions. Due to the ongoing surge of coronavirus infections, the demand for medicines like remdesivir, fabiflu and tocilizumab has increased in the city. In Gurugram, at least 10-12 vials are issued every day, said the drug control officer.Earlier this week, the union ministry of health and family welfare issued a statement regarding the unavailability of the drug and import of fresh stock, which has been allocated to different states. Even the Delhi high court observed that there is a severe shortage of the drug. It stated that lack of supplies from foreign shores and no local manufacturing is completely unacceptable in a pandemic situation, especially when consumers are willing to purchase the drug. Keeping rea cord of the drug usage is now a critical exercise, as the Central government has to inform the court about the usage of 500 vials of tocilizumab that has been consumed and the stock currently available for administration in different states.In Haryana, the three-member committee of senior doctors along with drug control officers will keep a tab on the tocilizumab usage. Doctors and hospitals have been prohibited to issue a prescription for tocilizumab for purchasing it from the market and will have to directly apply to the expert committee with complete details of the patient’s case historyThe committee will meet twice every day, during the morning and evening, to take decisions on the applications submitted by hospitals. If an application is approved, the hospital concerned will deposit the charges for the injection with the chief medical officer, who will be authorising the release of the drug from the government warehouse.As per the guidelines, the drug has to be issued the same day. The hospital will also have to submit a report regarding the usage of the drug. In case a patient dies before the injection can be, the hospital will have to reimburse the amount of the drug to the patient and keep the drug in stock and use it only if approved by the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/expert-committee-to-decide-on-tocilizumab-case-by-case-101620326394559.html
07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh urges Centre to increase oxygen quota||With demand and supply of medical oxygen running “neck and neck” in Chandigarh, the administration has requested the central government to increase its daily quota by 15 metric ton. The Centre has allotted 20MT oxygen to Chandigarh, which is supplied from a plant in Solan and distributed among all government and private hospitals. The administration is also able to generate around 5MT oxygen at its newly developed plants.With a sudden jump in the number of active cases and the infection numbers not seeing any decline, officials fear the requirement might increase manifold in the coming days.“With the high court ordering provision of oxygen to patients in home isolation, we have to make arrangements for them too. In view of this, we have asked the Centre to enhance our daily quota from 20MT to 35MT,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida, while urging NGOs setting up mini Covid care centres to provide oxygen concentrators with each bed to reduce the demand. Officials claimed the UT is not even receive the allotted quota, and a gap of 4-5 MT is seen daily, which is being fulfilled through internal sources of hospitals.“We are almost running neck and neck in terms of demand and supply. If there is any lag in the supply, it can result in a crisis-like situation. Also, the requirement is expected to increase as more ICUs are coming up in hospitals,” said Yashpaul Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supply in Chandigarh. Status in neighbouring districtsIn Mohali, the daily oxygen demand is 27 MT, which is being met through multiple sources. Liquid medical oxygen tankers are arriving from Bokaro, Roorkee, Panipat, Uttarakhand and Solan, while two local companies are supplying oxygen cylinders to Mohali hospitals.Meanwhile, an oxygen plant is being set up at the civil hospital in Phase 6, which is expected to become operational in 15 to 20 days.In Panchkula, there is a demand for 11MT oxygen. While it is receiving 8MT liquid medical oxygen, the remaining 3MT is met through cylinders.On Thursday, an oxygen plant was made operational at the civil hospital in Sector 6, which will provide 24x7 supply to 30 beds. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said another plant with threefold capacity is also being set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-urges-centre-to-increase-oxygen-quota-101620326394064.html

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||All beds occupied at Mohali’s lone government Covid facility||A week after the Punjab health department declared the civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, not a single bed was available there on Thursday evening. While there is no ICU facility at this government hospital, the number of oxygen beds were upgraded from 60 to 120 recently. Filled to capacity, it was attending to 124 patients on Thursday.Meanwhile, all 336 ICU beds with ventilators were occupied at private hospitals in the district, and only 15 of the 565 oxygen beds were available.The second wave is witnessing more complications among patients, with a large proportion needing critical care or oxygen support. As many as 62 people have succumbed to the virus in just six days this month, while 159 died in April. The number of active cases stands at 8,910. There are around 30 big private hospitals in the district, which has emerged as a medical tourism hub, but all are finding it difficult to meet the surge as patients are pouring in from other parts of the region as well.While there are nine government facilities in the district, only the civil hospital in Phase 6 is attending to Covid-19 patients, and that too only those needing oxygen support. Critical cases are being referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, which too is saturated.  Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said: “All the beds are occupied in the civil hospital, but we are making arrangements in some other government hospitals. Meantime, the army is also coming up with a 100-bed hospital at the civil hospital campus.”Gurtej Singh, chairman of Ivy Healthcare Group, said: “Whatever beds we created for Covid patients have been occupied. However, we are striving hard to create additional capacity and are investing in requisite infrastructure depending upon the availability of oxygen.”Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said: “Though beds are occupied in most of the hospitals in the district, we are making arrangements for more beds for patients requiring oxygen and ventilator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-beds-occupied-at-mohali-s-lone-government-covid-facility-101620326153931.html

We sent a team to inspect the area and a forest offence report has been filed in the matter. We also wrote to the police station concerned for lodging an FIR.” The land in question is notified under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, which extends protection against land-use change to certain specified Aravalli areas and forests and trees. He further said that no decision has been taken so far over the demolition of the wall. “Due to the lockdown, it could have been easy for the wall to be built but our staff regularly patrols the area to keep a check on such activities. One or two more incidents of encroachments were reported from forest areas away from the main road and FIRs have been registered for those cases as well,” added Kumar. In March, a little over 25 acres of forest land in Ankhir village under the Faridabad forest division has been encroached upon, said officials. Ankhir is one of the two villages in Faridabad district (the other being Mewla Maharajpur), where over 90% of the village common land is notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900. As per previous Supreme Court orders, this accords the land legal ‘forest’ status with protection under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wall-built-around-one-acre-of-aravalli-land-in-faridabad-case-filed-101620325554100.html
07-05-2021||Pune||Priority for second-dose beneficiaries, limited stock leave 18+ group to await their jab in Pune||Pune: Even as there is an increasing demand in Pune for Covaxin among those in the 18-44 age group, they may face acute shortage of indigenously made vaccines considering that the state government is planning to take out doses meant for youngsters to those above 45 years scheduled for second dose. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said there has been an inadequate supply of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to Maharashtra. This, according to Tope, is leading to a situation where many of those above 45 years and scheduled for second dose, are not getting it. The Covaxin second dose, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and central health ministry guidelines, has to be given within 42 days unlike Serum Institute manufactured Covishield, which can be administered till 56 days for second dose. “In view of the shortage of Covaxin, we will have to give doses meant for the 18-plus category to those above 45 years. These people above 45 years cannot wait more than 42 days for the second dose, which is extremely important and is considered a booster dose,” said Tope while speaking to the media in Mumbai. In Pune, Rubal Agarwal, PMC additional municipal commissioner said that for May 7, the vaccine doses are distributed. “Covaxin and Covishield will be available for May 7 at the designated centres with 111 centres for Covishield and four centres for Covaxin. However, the situation from May 8 is unclear as of now as the vaccine stock with the PMC is over. If we get fresh stock on May 7, then the centres will be functional on May 8,” said Agarwal. She said as on Thursday, Covaxin is available for first dose and not for second dose. In the last two days, vaccination among 18 years and above in Pune city has increased due to three new centres where Covaxin was administered to beneficiaries. However, now this supply will also be limited as the stock will be diverted to inoculate 45 years and above beneficiaries. On Thursday, 6,096 beneficiaries of 18-plus age group reported receiving the first jab of vaccines in Pune district. Of these, 2,851 beneficiaries were in PMC limits, 2,474 were in Pune rural and 2,122 in PCMC. Of 6,096 beneficiaries in the district, 3,535 beneficiaries were administered with Covaxin and 2,965 were given Covishield on Thursday. Nisha Parkhe, a 28-year-old beneficiary from Kothurd, said that she had booked an appointment at vaccination centre for Covaxin. “The slots for Covishield vaccine are already booked and despite several attempts in the last few days, I have not been able to book the slot for Covishield. Hence, I booked the slot for Covaxin and will take the jab on May 7,” said Parkhe. Another beneficiary, Harshal Shelkar, 35, who received the jab on Thursday said that he preferred Covaxin over Covishield. “I prefer the indigenously made vaccine Covaxin. The efficacy of Covaxin is also better. Moreover, due to limited doses of Covishield, there was a huge rush to book an appointment. I got the Covaxin appointment right away and was able to take the jab on Thursday,” said Shelkar. Vaccination drive for 45 years and above Pune district on Thursday reported a total of 22,957 beneficiaries receiving the jabs. Of this, 16,457 were beneficiaries above the age of 45 years. On Thursday, 7,506 beneficiaries in PMC, 7,170 beneficiaries in Pune rural and 1,781 in PCMC received the jabs. On Thursday, there were a total of 285 vaccination centres in the district.

The positivity rate of the city has also come down to 21%. Yet, these numbers have not eased the patient load at hospitals. The count of hospitalised patients and demand for ICU has not reduced. According to the medical experts, home quarantined patients who have developed moderate symptoms are being now getting admitted. Also, patients from outside civic limits are getting admitted at city hospitals. The number of patients on oxygen support has increased by 600 since April 20. “Patients in home isolation are getting admitted now, besides admission of outstation cases,” said Dr Sanjeev Vavre, assistant health officer PMC. Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble hospital, said that the number of patients in Covid OPDs has decreased, but hospital admissions have not come down. “Home quarantined patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms are getting hospitalised. The condition of patients admitted in small hospitals is unmanageable but then tend to shift them to big hospitals. For example, admission of critical patients from the outskirts of PMC has increased. In the last few days, ICU demand is going high. Now there is scope to admit patient on oxygen beds. It was impossible last week,” Sale said. Covid cases from rural parts of the district, which have emerged as new hotspots, are also getting admitted in city hospitals. The COEP Covid Jumbo facility was restated from March 22. Of its 2,250 patients admitted, 650 are outstation cases. “These patients are from PCMC, rural parts, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur. Saving lives is priority. Over 2,250 patients are undergoing treatment at the jumbo facility since the second wave,” said Rajendra Muthe, PMC deputy commissioner. “Number of patients who do not need critical care has reduced, but the demand for ICU is still high. Ventilators are still not vacant. Outstation patients visit hospitals in the city after seeing the Pune dashboard system bed availability status online. The hospitals are under pressure because of the patient count,” said Dr Vinod Bharati, Rising Medicare Hospital Kharadi. According to the Pune division dashboard for bed availability, there are 210 designated hospitals in PMC area to admit Covid patients and 12,080 beds are allotted for Covid patients.
