More than 170 people were administered Covid-19 vaccine at the two sites on the first day of the drive that was conducted from 9am to 5pm, officials said.According to the officials, at these centres, people aged 45 years and above can get their vaccination done while sitting in their cars. However, prior registration on the Cowin portal is required, they said. “The beneficiaries have to wait for 30 minutes in their cars after vaccination. The health staff engaged in vaccination will monitor them for 30 minutes after jab and then let them go,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 management for GB Nagar. The camps were organised a day after instructions came from UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath who had visited the Noida on Sunday. At the Greater Noida stadium, a total of 83 people got vaccinated on Monday, the officials said, adding that the camp will continue in coming days.“People should bring their mobile phones used for registration and also an identity card for completing the vaccination process. They can approach the medical staff if they face any issue after getting jabs,” said Bhooshan, who also conducted an inspection of the Greater Noida camp.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY launched the drive-through vaccination camp at DLF Mall of India at 9am. At this centre, 93 people got vaccinated, said the officials.“People can comfortably sit in their cars and get vaccination done under supervision of medical staff. People can book their slot on Cowin app and reach these camps,” said Suhas.The administration is providing Covishield jabs at these two drive-through centres, the officials said.Beneficiaries have welcomed the ‘drive-through’ initiative. “It’s a great initiative as I did not have to wait much longer. Moreover, it is saving us from the crowd at a hospital. It was a hassle-free experience overall,” said a beneficiary at the Greater Noida camp, requesting anonymity.Park+, a smart parking solutions firm, helped the administration organise the camp at DLF Mall of India. “With this drive-through initiative, we hope to expedite the vaccination process across the country. The malls and parking lots for the drive-through vaccination are our existing partners. We are honoured that they are cooperating with us on such a short notice to help the state government. We are planning a seamless vaccination drive for Noida,” said Amit Lakhotia, founder of Park+.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/drivethrough-vaccination-begins-in-noida-101621275610742.html

District administration officials said that they have plans to hold a vaccination camp for the transgenders.Urooz Rizvi, a transgender who is a social activist, said that she has written to the district administration asking for a separate vaccination camp for the community. “Most of the transgenders are not educated enough to understand the importance of vaccination. I have urged the administration to hold a vaccination drive for the transgender community in GB Nagar,” said the Sector 74 resident who is recovering from Covid-19. Rizvi also runs a restaurant in Sector 119. Activists said that most of the transgenders are unaware of the registration process on Cowin portal to get vaccinated. Kaushal, a transgender, said that she has no clue about it. “Our community is usually cut off from the society. Others in my colony who work as domestic helps have been able to get registered and their employers are helping them get vaccinated. However, I have no clue about this,” said Kaushal, a resident of Chhalera village in Sector 44.Basera Samajik Sansthan, an NGO that works with over 2,000 transgenders in GB Nagar, is getting them vaccinated since the vaccination for the 18-44 age group opened up.“Most of the transgenders have fallen prey to the rumour that vaccination may harm the body. We have been sensitising them and encouraging them to get vaccinated against Covid-19,” said Ram Kali, a transgender who works at the NGO.The NGO has so far got 20 transgenders vaccinated at the Sector 30 district hospital. “In the last two weeks, we could only get 20 people vaccinated. We urge the district administration to hold a vaccination camp for transgenders so that they are not left out of the process,” added Ram Kali.When asked, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the administration is planning to hold a vaccination camp for transgenders soon. “We do not want any section of the society to be left out from vaccination against Covid-19. We will plan a vaccination camp for transgenders soon,” he said.As per the 2011 census, Uttar Pradesh has 137,465 transgenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/transgenders-in-gb-nagar-demand-separate-vaccination-camp-101621275611316.html
17-05-2021||Noida||People in 45+ category find it difficult to get second dose of Covaxin in GB Nagar||Noida: Residents of Gautam Budh Nagar who are due for their second shot of Covaxin say they are finding it difficult to get the jab. The gap between two doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin coronavirus vaccine is a minimum of 28 days. Those in the 45+ category who got their first dose in April, are now looking to get the second dose.Vaccinations for this category were opened on April 1As per the Cowin portal, two government healthcare centres and one private hospital are administering Covaxin for the 45+ category in the district. However, beyond May 18, the slots at these centres show no availability.“I was administered the first dose of Covaxin at a private hospital in Sector 63 on April 13. However, when I was due for the second dose, I found that the hospital did not have it. I searched on the CoWin portal but all slots are booked or show ‘not available’. Many of my neighbours are also facing the same problem and people are running from hospital to hospital for a second dose of Covaxin but are unable to find it,” said Anusuya Singh, 50, a resident of Sector 61, Noida.When asked, the district’ Covid-19 nodal officer, Narendra Bhooshan, said, “Due to a change in government directives, private hospitals now have to procure vaccines on their own. If people are finding trouble in getting the second dose, I will study this issue and ensure that it gets resolved soon”.Earlier this month, an Uttar Pradesh government order directed that those people, whose second coronavirus disease vaccine dose is due, need not book a slot again and can simply walk-in at healthcare centres where they got the jab earlier, for their subsequent one.“For those who got their first dose at a private hospital and are not able to get the subsequent one at the same hospital, can walk in to any government centre that is providing the vaccine for it,” added Bhooshan.Sector 30 resident Diwakar Mahajan (55) said that a private hospital in Sector 29, where he got the first dose of Covaxin, has put up a notice asking people to go to the government centre where it is available.“The notice said that the second dose of Covaxin will be given at the Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) Raipur in Sector 127 on Saturday. However, by the time I reached there, the doses were over and I was asked to come again later,” said Mahajan.As per the district immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi, only two healthcare centres in the district—UPHC Surajpur, Greater Noida and UPHC Raipur, Sec 126 are administering Covaxin doses for the 45+ category.“Each of the centres has a capacity of 200 vaccines per day with a 30:70 ratio for the first dose and the second dose for walk-ins, respectively,” said Dr Tyagi. However, he did not divulge how many Covaxin doses are left in the slot as the CoWin portal on Monday evening showed vaccines are ‘not available’ at the two centres from Tuesday.Rohit Verma, a resident of Sector 137, said he got the second dose of Covaxin via the walk-in mode at UPHC Raipur on Saturday.“Though the centre was booked on CoWin, I walked-in and got my mother (73) vaccinated for her second dose of Covaxin without any waiting time or hassle,” he said.For the 18-44 category, Covaxin is being administered at Father Agnel School in Sector 62 and at Harola UPHC. According to the district’s chief medical officer, Dr Deepak Ohri, the total vaccine stock available in the district, including Covishield, is 20,000 as of Monday evening.Meanwhile, an official from Fortis Hospital Noida, which is also administering Covaxin, said that while they are allowing walk-ins for the second dose of Covaxin, there is only a limited stock left.As per official data, 7,901 people got vaccinated in the district on Monday, of which 5,238 from the 18-44 category got the first dose. In 60+ category, 612 got the first dose and 75 got the second dose. In the 45-59 category, 1,657 got the first dose and 228 people got the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/people-in-45-category-find-it-difficult-to-get-second-dose-of-covaxin-in-gb-nagar-101621275551411.html
17-05-2021||Noida||Covid-19 vaccination: Senior citizens turned away from Sanjay Nagar hospital in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital on Monday witnessed a chaotic scene after most of the senior citizens who arrived to get their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine were turned away from the city’s prominent vaccination centre. The senior citizens, who waited in long queues at the Sanjay Nagar hospital for their second dose, said that the hospital staff had earlier asked them to come on Monday. “But even on Monday, they did not entertain us and asked us to return. I took my first dose on April 7. I came to the centre with my wife after spending ₹200 on auto fare. We waited in a queue since morning, but there was no announcement, or any notice put up. The hospital staff turned us away without vaccination and asked us to come three months after the first dose,” said 67-year-old Shivraj Singh, a resident of Kalka Garhi. Praveen Jain, another 67-year-old who arrived at the centre, said that on the vaccination card, the hospital had given May 10 as the date for second dose. “On May 10, they said that vaccine was out of stock. I, along with my wife, came on Saturday, and they asked us to come on Monday. Today we stood in a queue since 8.30am and a guard told us that vaccine will be given. At 10am, the hospital staff put up a notice that vaccine will be given only to beneficiaries who have registered for their first dose,” said Jain, a resident of Raj Nagar Extension. Notably, the Sanjay Nagar hospital predominantly offers Covishield vaccine to beneficiaries. On May 13, the Centre extended the gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine from six-eight weeks to 12-16 weeks. The Centre approved a new set of recommendations from a technical expert group that will help give the first dose to more people and is consistent with studies that suggest a longer interval may offer better efficacy.  Sixty-four-year-old Sunita Gupta, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, was also furious at the scenario which prevailed on Monday. “On May 15 (the date of her second dose), they said that vaccine was out of stock. They called us on May 17. After waiting for three hours in a queue, they asked me to come three months from the first dose,” she added. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the hospital, said that there was a huge rush for vaccination on Monday.“Earlier, the gap between two doses was four weeks, and now it has been extended to about three months. Also, we received another brand of vaccine stock on Saturday, and it could not be administered to beneficiaries who were given Covishield as first dose. So, they were asked to come after a gap of three months from their first dose,” Teotia said.Despite repeated attempts, Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-vaccination-senior-citizens-turned-away-from-sanjay-nagar-hospital-in-ghaziabad-101621275550797.html
17-05-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad admin offers support to poor Covid-19 patients||Ghaziabad: As patients continue to battle Covid-19 in healthcare facilities, the Ghaziabad district administration said it has decided to help patients from impoverished backgrounds who are unable to afford hospital bills.The administration has also asked private hospitals to install CCTVs in Covid wards which will be linked and monitored by the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) at the district headquarters.According to records of the health department, the Ghaziabad district has 3,111 Covid beds, which include 2820 oxygen beds. Of these, the daily average occupancy in the past one week (May 9 to 15) has been 2,717. Out of the 815 ICU beds, 782 were occupied in the past one week on an average, while 185 out of 201 ventilator beds were occupied. “It has been seen during the second Covid wave that patients are taking longer to recover and this has put a huge financial burden on their families. We have directed that hospitals should continue treating patients without any compromise on quality and such bills should be forwarded to the district administration. We have a responsibility towards these patients, and we will get such bills settled through means such as corporate social responsibility funds, among others,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey. According to the state control room figures of May 17, the total Covid case tally in Ghaziabad stood at 51,759 so far, with 47,757 discharges, 386 deaths and 3,616 active cases.“The ICCC will take daily information of vacant beds, availability of medicines and availability of ICU beds. Status of patients will be noted through CCTVs. It has also seen that patients’ kin have to run around town looking to fill prescriptions issued by hospitals, and end up falling into the trap of black-marketers and face problems. We have clearly directed hospitals that they are to make all arrangements themselves, as part of treatment. In case the hospitals face issues or are short of supply, they should immediately refer it to the district administration,” Pandey added.Meanwhile, a team of officers has started on a “bill audit” of as many as five hospitals upon complaints of alleged over-charging received by families of patients. “We have started the process and some of the bills have been settled. In cases of over-charging, the hospitals will be asked to refund, else their registrations may be cancelled. We have also directed for audit of the entire supply chain, from the manufacture to the retailer level, for life-saving medicines related to black fungus. This is a new emergence with some Covid patients, and we need to curb black-marketing of such drugs,” the DM said.Private hospitals who attended a meeting in this regard on Monday said they are following the directions of the district administration as well as the state government.“Some directions were issued last year and this year too. All directions are being followed and complied with. We are providing the best available treatment to our patients and are also following guidelines,” said a spokesperson from Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi.Officials of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad) said they have no issues with the directions of the district administration, provided that there is better coordination about the directions.“Regarding installation of CCTVs, we are of the opinion that doctors need freedom when it comes to treatment, and they should be allowed to do it. In case the admin wishes to monitor, they can, but it should not be an obstruction. Further, if the admin ensures that supply of medicines is regular, the hospitals will not feel the need to issue a prescription for medicines to be obtained outside. This is only if there is a short supply of the same,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the association’s Ghaziabad chapter. “We also feel that a lot of families are facing financial burden due to prolonged treatment during the current wave. This is due to the severity of the infection. If the admin has stepped in to help such families, we would also appreciate it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-admin-offers-support-to-poor-covid-19-patients-101621274710749.html

Police used force to stop farmers from marching towards and disrupting the inauguration of Covid hospital in Hisar by CM Khattar.In the lathi-charge, farmers received injuries and as per police, at least 20 police personnel were injured when farmers pelted stones.On Sunday, referring to the protesting farmers as “miscreants”, police had said that their intention was to “commit violence on a large scale”, a charge farmers have denied.After emerging from the meeting that took place at the residence of Shah, Khattar said that he briefed Shah about the Hisar incident and steps taken by the Haryana government to deal with the second wave of Covid-19 spreading in rural areas.He discussed with Shah the present Covid situation in Haryana and the arrangements being made to combat the virus spread. Khattar said he apprised Shah about the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Khattar said the state government will act with the agitating farmers as per directions given by the Centre.Responding to a query regarding the Hisar incident, the CM said the incident was discussed in detail with Shah, who agreed that it was inappropriate to oppose the hospital inauguration.“The central leadership was apprised of the talks held between both parties and police on Sunday. The protesters have assured that they will not hold such kind of protests in future,” Khattar said.Regarding black fungus cases, he said the state government is importing the required medicine to treat the disease and after this, distribution of the medicine will be planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-meets-amit-shah-to-update-him-on-hisar-clash-101621272312394.html

Most industries export their products to other states or countries.Plywood industrialists highlighted the labour problem as most of their skilled manpower belongs to UP, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal or Jharkhand and have returned to their native place.Jugal Kishor, president of the state plywood industries association, said that just 15% of such industries are operating as per government guidelines.“But where will we sell our products?” he wondered, adding, “Because of lockdown in most states, there is no demand. So, we are just adding to our existing stock.”Bharat Garg, of a utensil-makers’ body, said that their labour has shifted to industries in the rural belts and might not return even if the lockdown ends.“Existential crisis for the units under municipal limits is looming large. Most labour has migrated back home or started working in units outside the MC limits,” Garg, owner of JK Metal Industries, said.Meanwhile, as per the Master Plan 2041 approved last week, the industrial zone in district will increase from the existing 16% to 28% by 2041.Ram Niwas Garg, chairman of Haryana Vyapari Kalyan Board, said, “The increase in industrial zone will open doors for more start-ups by local youth and overall development of the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-lockdown-labour-shortage-worries-yamunanagar-industrialists-101621272251380.html

Lalit Kumar Pandey, officer in-charge of Lalmatiya police station in Godda district, said both accused and the alleged victim, who was held captive, had been brought to Godda.Godda’s superintendent of police YS Rames told media persons that Mahagama subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Shiv Shankar Tiwary had been sent Lalmatiya to conduct the probe.As per a written complaint by Rupali Devi, a resident of Dacoita village under Lalamatiya police station, her husband Shankar Pandit’s (45) was forced to convert and offer prayers in a mosque on the day of Eid by his employer Md Khurishid Mansuri (35), a resident of Jalaha village under Sanokhar police station in the neighbouring Bhagalpur district, which falls in Bihar.Khurshid also changed Shankar Pandit’s name to Salim Mansuri and confined him in his house, the woman has alleged in her complaint.On Sunday, Shankar Pandit called up his wife and son Jitu Pandit and sought help, after which they informed village head Nimani Murmu.

17-05-2021||Ranchi||Only J’khand residents to get jab under 18-44 group||Amid prevalent uncertainty over availability of enough doses of Covid-19 vaccine to be administered to people under the 18-44 category, officials concerned have directed to ensure that only permanent residents under this category get the jab in the state. State nodal officer (vaccination), Ajit Prasad, has written to civil surgeons of all districts to this effect. “...Vaccination for 18-44 age group was started on May 14. Slots are being booked through the CoWin portal even by those who are neither residents of the state nor do they work here. Henceforth, vaccine will not be administered to anyone who is not a resident of the state nor to those who are not working here,” the order reads. While the Centre provided vaccine doses to all states for inoculation of health workers, frontline workers and those above the age of 45, it asked the respective state governments to bear the cost of vaccinating those under the 18-44 category.Against its purchase orders, Jharkhand has so far received 2.34 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin from the two approved manufacturers--Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, respectively.According to sources, the state received 134,400 doses of Covaxin and 100,000 doses of Covishield. It was likely to get another consignment of 287,000 doses of Covishield by end of the current week.However, the number of doses received by the state so far was quite less, and if supply chain was not maintained, the inoculation drive was likely come to a halt, experts have opined.According to an estimate by the state health department, the state has nearly 16 million people aged between 18-44 years, for which it requires 32 million doses.Meanwhile, the state government’s recent move triggered political reactions. Former minister and BJP legislator CP Singh said the state government should not discriminate on the basis of residential address in times of a crisis such as this. “This issue is not related to giving jobs. This is a public health crisis and the government should not discriminate on this basis,” he said.On the other hand, JMM legislator Sudivya Kumar defended the move, asking why will the Jharkhand government provide vaccine to people from other states at its cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/only-j-khand-residents-to-get-jab-under-18-44-group-101621268291092.html

He added that the disease should not be compared to Covid-19 or believed to transmit in the same fashion as Covid-19.The Karnataka government has formed a specialised task force on black fungus to contain the growing number of cases reported from across the state. The new infection comes amid a raging Covid-19 pandemic that has thrown life out gear for the state and country for over a year now.The disease is said to appear in those who have immunocompromised conditions like cancer, HIV and others, the minister said. Sudhakar said that even Covid-19 infected patients with uncontrolled diabetes and those who are fed a high dose of steroids can get the disease.Black fungus enters the nose first, then the eyes and finally travels to the brain when it becomes more deadly and potentially life threatening.“This is a notified disease and all private hospitals, ENT specialists should inform the government if such cases are discovered. This information cannot be kept private and must be informed to the government. Keeping it from the government is against the law,” Sudhakar said.Drugs like Amphotericin B are used to treat the disease. The supply of the drug, however, is controlled by the Centre which has so far allocated 1,050 vials to Karnataka, the minister said, of which the state had received 450 so far.Several states in India have reported a high number of black fungus cases that has added to panic amid the Covid-19 pandemic of the spread of another potentially deadly disease.Sudhakar said that the government has placed orders for around 20,000 vials of the medicine along with two other drugs, which are also effective against black fungus.The minister said that at least five centres across Karnataka - Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubbali, Kalaburagi and Shivamogga - will start operating by Thursday to treat people with this condition.Sudhakar said that the new task force will also try to determine the source of the infection. He said that private hospitals must use only sterilized water for their dehumidifiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-govt-forms-task-force-on-black-fungus-identifies-97-cases-101621267872748.html

She said that she recommends it because it has “scientific backing”. A video capturing her comments has gone viral on social media, even getting the attention of the international press.Addressing party workers in Bhopal on Sunday, Thakur said, “I consumed cow urine daily and it is a kind of acid which purifies my body. It also purifies the lungs and saves me from Covid-19 infection. I don’t take any medicine against corona but I am safe.”Thakur didn’t stop here but also explained how to consume this. Thakur said, “The urine should come from cows of the indigenous breed that are fed only forest grass. It should be filtered with a piece of cotton clothes at least 16 times before consumption.”Speaking to Hindustan Times on Monday, the BJP MP said she has not been infected with Covid-19 but she would add that the role of cow urine against the Covid-19 cannot be downplayed.“Covid is an infection and the cow urine is a proven medicine for infections. I have not been infected till now because I consume cow urine,” Pragya told Hindustan Times.She added that drugs like Remdesivir and others that are being prescribed by the doctors do not have an established scientific backing yet. “They are not proven medications and are still under research... However, I have been taking cow urine and Panchgavya ( a mix of cow urine, dung, milk, ghee and curd) which has protected me till now. I have recommended these because they have scientific backing. Research has already established it,” she told Hindustan Times.Asked about the research which established cow urine’s anti-infectious properties, she said that it was a German finding.On a question, why was she endangering lives when her own government was suggesting against any unprescribed scientific treatment for Covid-19, Thakur denied any such endangerment. She said that despite so much research and trials, no established cure has been found yet.“However, I have been using the cow urine despite suffering from cancer and being on chemo and radiotherapy and all this while I have been fine and free from Covid”.Reacting to a question on the sensitive health parameters of critical Covid-19 patients and cow urine consumption, she said its consumption will not impact their blood toxicity. “No Covid patient’s health will worsen because of drinking cow urine. It has a specific dosage that is to be given to the patient and while I have just named the medicine yet, if someone wants to take it they can come to me and I shall prescribe the required dose of urine that is needed,” she said.Thakur said that she needs to be safe because she is serving the nation and for that purpose, she consumes cow urine. “I wish health to everyone and this is why I recommend it. I want all to be safe like me and I have not prescribed anything unresearched like pig or bull’s urine. The prescription of cow urine is an outcome of hundreds of years of research by Rishis and Munis (saints and seers). It has a legacy behind it in the ancient shastras of Patanjali. Tell me which science in the world can challenge these shastras of Patanjali today,” she said.“I have conducted experiments on myself and have cured myself of cancer because of cow urine. What can be a bigger science than this?” she questioned.Earlier, Thakur, who had gone through bilateral mastectomy, claimed that her breast cancer was cured due to cow urine and other by-products.Meanwhile, Dr Ranjan Sharma, president Indian Medical Association reacted to the development and said that it was very unfortunate when the country was faced with such a catastrophe, many leaders were giving unfounded suggestions and risking more lives.Hinting at the recent unscientific remark, Sharma said that even the RSS has asked people to only adhere to scientific medicines. “At least, now these leaders should stop recommending unscientific treatments,” he said.Malegaon blast co-accused Pragya Thakur was missing from public life for the past four months due to ongoing health issues. Many locals and activists had also run a campaign against her for not extending any help to the people of Bhopal who were facing a shortage of oxygen beds and Remdesivir injections. She has started attending public programmes recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-recommend-it-because-despite-trolls-pragya-thakur-justifies-cow-urine-comment-101621265831014.html
17-05-2021||Pune||PMC sets up flood control cell to monitor water level in dams||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to set up a 24x7 flood control cell to monitor the Khadakwasla, Mulshi and Katraj lake water levels. On Monday, PMC took the decision to provide adequate manpower to operate the flood control cell 24x7, from June 1 till December 31, 2021. The cell will help alert the respective officers to plan rescue and rehabilitation operations where needed. Against the background of the Ambil odha flood situation in the past, the cell will also monitor the Katraj lakes (upper and lower). When the upper Katraj lake is overflowing, excess water flows into the lower lake located at the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park. From there it flows into the Ambil odha (stream), before it meets the Mutha river. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal issued the order to set up the cell. Staff will be deputed from different departments, including property tax, health, vehicle, road, construction, water supply, solid waste management, building permission, gardens, and the public relations department. Ganesh Sonune, head of the disaster management cell, said, “After the Ambil odha flood incident, we have decided to include Katraj lakes to monitor water levels and rainfall.” Pune was hit twice by floods in 2019. First, in early August, and then, in September, heavy rain (87.3 mm) caused the Ambil odha and other smaller canals to overflow. At least 17 people were killed. The water flooded residential areas of Katraj-Kondhwa road, Sahakarnagar, Satara road, and Sinhagad road. It caused mass destruction of properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-sets-up-flood-control-cell-to-monitor-water-level-in-dams-101621265050343.html
17-05-2021||Pune||Rainfall likely to reduce Tuesday onwards: IMD forecast||Pune city which was placed under a yellow alert due to the passing cyclone Tauktae on Monday reported a rainfall of 3 millimetres while Lohegaon reported 0.8 mm of rainfall, however, from May 18th the rainfall is likely to reduce, according to IMD officials. For May 18, the IMD has not issued any warnings for Pune, however, partly cloudy skies with light rains are forecasted for the city. Across Maharashtra, north of Konkan and Goa and some parts of Vidarbha may recieve rainfall on May 18. On Monday, along with Pune, Mahabaleshwar, Nashik, Satara, Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nagpur reported rainfall. As per IMD, due to the ongoing rains, the highest maximum temperature was reported at Jalgaon on Monday at 39.8 degrees Celsius whereas the lowest minimum temperature reported across Maharashtra was at Mahabaleshwar at 17.4 degrees Celsius. Cyclone Tauktae is now the strongest pre-monsoon Arabian Sea cyclone after 2010 and third strongest pre-monsoon Arabian Sea cyclone since 1982 onwards, according to data revealed by India Meteorological Department (IMD). Researchers at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said that cyclone Tauktae intensified from category 1 to category 4 cyclone in just 24 hrs. The IMD has also termed Tauktae as Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS). Dr Mruntunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD said that there is a trend of rapid intensification of cyclones in the Arabian Sea since 1990. “There is a trend of rapid intensification of cyclones in the Arabian Sea. It may not be termed a phenomenon but there is a trend,” said Mohapatra. He further added that in the Bay of Bengal, it is likely that a low-pressure area will form. “However, how severe it will be is unclear as of now. We are monitoring the conditions closely,” said Mohapatra. Vineet Kumar Singh, researcher at IITM noted that this intensification is due to the warmer sea surface and subsurface temperature. “In our research, we have previously observed that warmer sea surface and subsurface have rapid intensification of cyclones. In the case of Tauktae as well, you can see that the cyclone intensified from category 1 to category 4 in just 24 hours,” said Singh. He attributed the warmer temperatures to global warming and climate change. “All across the globe, we can see a trend of warming temperatures. The warmer sea surface and subsurface temperature is seen to provide more energy to the cyclones” said Singh. According to IMD data, this is the first time since 1976 and second time since 1900 that a cyclone in May is going to hit Gujarat coast with wind speed greater than 35 knots. “As an impact of the cyclone Tauktae, Ratnagiri reported 364 millimetre rainfall in just 24 hours,” said Singh. As per recent updates by IMD, ESCS Tauktae is moving at a speed of 15 kilometres per hour as of Monday. It is likely to move north-northwestwards and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva, east of Diu on late night of Monday. The wind speed forecast by IMD is 155-165 kilometres per hour and gusting to 185 kmph. In the recent years, India has seen super cyclones like Maha, Amphan and Nisarga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rainfall-likely-to-reduce-tuesday-onwards-imd-forecast-101621264990426.html

The relatives complained that the hospital held back the body of the deceased for over three days and kept it in the morgue. Following the complaints raised by the relatives and the local MP, the district administration has launched an inquiry. The district administration has formed an eight-member committee chaired by civic surgeon Dr Ashok Nandapurkar. The committee would visit the hospital on Tuesday. Dr Nandapurkar said, “The hospital is a private medical college and we got the complaint that the patient died due to Covid-19 on May 1. The body was discharged three days later. We will visit the hospital on Tuesday and investigate.” Member of Parliament, Shrirang Barne, said, “I got a call that the hospital, Maharashtra Institute of Medical Education and Research or MIMER, refused to release the body for three days due to pending bill. The deceased was a vegetable vendor and bills were to be cleared through MPJAY (Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana) which was not done because the hospital had not informed the authorities about the death. I reached the hospital and the authorities later handed over the body.” Dr Suchitra Nagre, trustee and executive director of MIMER, said, “The allegations are wrong. The body was not held back because of pending bills, but the relatives could not claim the body as it was weekend. May 1 was holiday and May 2 was Sunday so they did not take it and we had only 2-3 staff present at the hospital. On Monday, the MP visited the hospital along with the relatives who claimed that we had not handed over the body, however we tried to convey our side. The body was handed over immediately. In our 25 years of working as a medical college, we have never held back a body or even a patient because of pending bills. However, during this unprecedented Covid situation, we feel that our work is not appreciated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/private-hospital-refuses-to-release-covid-victim-s-body-for-three-days-pune-admin-launches-inquiry-101621264630360.html

17-05-2021||Pune||Ganesh idol makers stare at losses due to lockdown in Pune||Pune: Ganesh idol makers in the city are facing a livelihood crisis as the Covid lockdown has caused shortage of raw material and sharp drop in demand for their product. The traditional idol makers in Peth areas said that the demand for Ganesh idols has come down to mere 30 per cent as compared to 2018. According to them, the 2019 floods hit their business and they had to sustain huge losses. And the Covid outbreak in 2020 followed by continuous lockdowns extending to 2021 has made their survival difficult. Naresh Mhatre, a Navi Peth-based idol maker, said, “Our family used to make 3,000 to 4,000 idols during the season, but it now come down to 500-600 and that too with materials shortage it would be difficult to reach half the mark. We usually start receiving orders in March and April, but this year we are waiting for enquiries even as late as May as many of our customers are down with Covid or have lost their near and dear ones to the virus. The pandemic situation has ruined the business and the hope of revival till the festival draws near is dim,” he said. Abhijit Dhondphale, another artisan, said, “The Centre and state governments must take a firm decision on allowing POP for idol making. The livelihood of many idol makers and their families is at stake due to the Covid lockdown and restrictions. We are facing raw material shortage due to restrictions on transport and other factors.” Environment minister Prakash Javadekar had deferred ban on use of Plaster of Paris (PoP) for making Ganesh idols in 2020, by one year with the aim to help artisans. However, the decision was criticised by environmentalists as PoP is harmful to the environment. Meanwhile, on May 13, 2020, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had published guidelines banning the use of PoP, thermocol, and single-use plastic for making idols across India. Dyes and toxic chemicals used to colour idols, too, were proposed to be banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ganesh-idol-makers-stare-at-losses-due-to-lockdown-in-pune-101621263970350.html

The cub was found last week stranded in a sugarcane field in Vadgaon Anand village, located in the Junnar division of Pune district. The farmers in Vadgaon Anand village were out harvesting their sugarcane crops, when they heard mewling sounds coming from the field. On taking a closer look, they were stunned to find a baby leopard. As they are trained in preliminary rescue protocols, as human-leopard interaction is very high in this area, the farmers immediately alerted members of the village rescue team, trained by the Maharashtra Forest Department and Wildlife SOS.Soon after, two rescue units from Wildlife SOS and the forest department rushed to the location with the necessary equipment and medical kit to examine the cub. The on-site examination of leopard cubs is conducted to ascertain age and whether or not they are wounded or suffering from any infection or showing signs of dehydration.The cub was identified as a female, estimated to be about 25-days-old. On being deemed healthy and fit for release by Wildlife SOS wildlife veterinary officer, Dr Nikhil Bangar, the cub was placed in a safe-box .“We installed camera traps to document the happy reunion. The mother leopard slowly approached the field around midnight, after being drawn by her cub’s distinct scent and vocalisation. She was quick to tip the safe-box over and carefully picked up the cub to relocate to a safer location,” said Dr Bangar. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “Leopard cubs stay with their mothers until they are two-years old, learning the necessary skills of survival, all the while exploring their natural habitat and honing their senses. For this young cub, the separation from its mother could have easily meant death or a life in captivity. To avoid situations like that, we undertake every effort to make such rescue and reunion operations possible and successful.”Yogesh Ghodake, range forest officer, Otur, said, “Such incidents are quite common for villagers residing near the scrub forests of Maharashtra, which is the natural habitat of a large population of leopards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forest-dept-reunites-25-day-old-leopard-cub-with-mother-after-rescue-op-101621263670331.html

All Undri projects assessed from 2017 onwards have received a tax bill that is double the current rate.As per PMC norms, the first tax bill is received after a property completes three years from date of completion. The societies which have received the double tax rate are Ganga Glitz, Silver Hill 2BHK and 38 Park Majestique. Residents of Silver Hill society have been issued a first tax bill of ₹72,000 for four yrs (2017 to 2021), approx. ₹18,000 per year for 750 sqft of carpet area (960 sqft built-up).When compared to standard PMC rates applied to other residential societies in the area, the bill should not be more than ₹8,000 to ₹10,000 per year. (see box)Milind Chaturbhuj, divisional inspector, Undri Tax office, said, “The societies which have received more taxes come under PMC jurisdiction. All are new constructions, while the others were registered under the gram panchayat. We had informed builders about the increase in tax rate, but many of these residents are still not aware of it.”A resident of Silver Hill society on the request on anonymity said, “As responsible citizens, we will pay the property tax. The taxation is double that of neighbourhood buildings, as well as more than that paid by more developed locations in PMC. There cannot be this disparity in rates without transparency. We hope the authorities take note, correct the bills in the future and discount the overcharged amounts in future bills.” Residents in Undri have also complained about no PMC water connection available.“No water line has been received by our society and we purchase water from vendors: Yet charges applied by PMC is ₹3,010 per resident, per year. We have only received a garbage collection service and access to the sewage drain. No other services are provided in the past four years. Still we have been told to pay double the tax,” said a resident of Ganga Glitz society.Sanket Nichat, a resident of 38 Park Majestique said, “I have received a tax bill of ₹65,000 for four years, which is more than what our nearby societies have received. Due to lockdown we are not able to go to the PMC office and complain.”One resident who did visit the Undri PMC tax office, claims that the officer said that the bill is “system generated and correct.”Property tax rates in Undri Sai Ganga 1BHK - ₹6,500Atur Nagar 2 BHK - ₹6,000Ganga Estoria 2BHK - ₹8,800WaterRidge 3BHK – ₹10,000Hills and Dales Ph3, 3BHK - ₹12,000Societies that received an increased tax billGanga Glitz 2BHK - ₹19,000Silver Hill 2BHK – ₹18,000||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/undri-projects-assessed-from-2017-onwards-to-pay-double-current-property-tax-rate-101621262770378.html

The bench deserves better treatment from the government. We don’t appreciate this,” a bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar said on Monday after reviewing two affidavits filed by chief secretary and Patna divisional commissioner on deaths in Buxar district. The bench had earlier sought a detailed affidavit from the Patna divisional commission in course of a hearing on a public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid management after the “disturbing” issue of corpses floating in the Ganga river was reported.The bench was upset that while the chief secretary’s affidavit said only six deaths had taken place in Buxar since March 1, 2021, there were 789 cremations mentioned in the commissioner’s affidavit at just one cremation ghat, Muktidham Charitarban, Buxar, under the Nagar Parishad between May 5 and May 14.“The CS (chief secretary) does not say that six deaths are only due to Covid. The commissioner also does not say that 789 deaths are non-Covid ones. The total population of Buxar is 17 lakh, but the figures are only for Nagar Parishad. There is no mention of the religion or age groups of the dead. Hindus may be a majority in Buxar, but that does not mean there is none from other religions. Last rites may also have been performed at burial grounds,” the bench said.Advocate general Lali Kishore conceded that certain clarifications were required to reconcile the data and promised to come back to the court after getting the details.The judges told Lali Kishore, the state’s top officer, to vet the affidavits before they are filed with the court.“At this point in time, we do not comment anything further on these affidavits, but all facts first must be verified from all sources and then only placed before us, else it will amount to filing of false/incomplete affidavit.,” the bench observed, ordering the state to depute at least two technically qualified persons to update the data.The bench said they also wanted to know the age group of the people who had died, irrespective of whether the deaths were attributed to Covid-19 or not. “If the young people are dying, it is serious,” it said.The bench also noted that the state hadn’t been updating the websites with the correct figures“We notice that the official website maintained by the State of Bihar for recording births and deaths has not yet been updated. We see no reason as to why the deaths, be it 6 or 789, would not have been updated on the official website. Equally, this would apply to all the districts of Bihar,” the bench observed.Oxygen supplyThe bench also wanted to know if the state had been provided with enough tankers for transportation of 400 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) it had demanded. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K N Singh said the Centre had allocated the demanded quantity and the issue of transportation had been resolved.“Let an affidavit of the principal secretary, health, verifying such fact, be filed within next two days. He shall also inform the sufficiency or lack thereof, of the infrastructure for transporting the entire allocated quota of oxygen (LMO). He shall apprise the Court of the infrastructure for storage and transportation up to the point of end user,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/we-are-aghast-says-patna-high-court-at-discrepancy-in-govt-statistics-of-deaths-101621262711315.html

We have adopted as many as 24 different initiatives to provide quality education to the students in these 3.5 years. It will help cut educational loss across the state through offering lessons for 24x7,” chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb told the media after launching Vande Tripura channel from the civil secretariat. Vande Tripura, the 24x7 channel, would telecast different academic discussions, news related to education and education department and is scheduled to start live classes from June 1. Earlier, the education department launched video lectures on local TV channels, online platforms, SMS-based classes, neighbourhood classes, students helpline, among other initiatives for school students. State education minister Ratan Lal Nath said that though they achieved success by adopting various educational schemes after coming to power in 2018, the progress was stalled due to the pandemic. “We have experienced 36 per cent loss in education since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country. The decision of opening the educational channel has been taken to cover the loss,” said Nath. All educational institutions, including schools, colleges and universities, were shut since April 9 for an indefinite period amid the second wave of Covid-19. The state has nearly 4,400 government and aided schools with 22 government degree colleges and two universities. Earlier, the educational institutions were shut for almost nine months since mid-March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During the period, the education department continued classes via online mode. At least 29 per cent of students were found unable to access both mobile phones and cable televisions, according to a survey conducted in last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tripura-launches-education-channel-to-combat-academic-loss-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101621262410873.html

We even put up an RTI and it has resulted in no further progress. With this network, I aim to help them get their registrations and certificates at the earliest,” Khire addedOther issues Khire pointed out included rations for Ttansgenders and legal support for gays.“While the provision of services and support to individuals from the LGBTQIA community is very important, the lack of a local-level network has stagnated the movement in terms of advocacy and expansion of rights. Some of the areas on which these lacunae have been repeatedly noticed are legal, but also inclusive education for police personnel, medical personnel and political leaders; and empowering local social structures shelter homes.” he added.The office for administration of the network will be Bindu Queer Rights Foundation office in Pune.

Kalra was arrested on Sunday night after evading police for eight days. Delhi police has sought custody of the restaurateur for five days for questioning.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastav told the court that eight complaints have already been filed against Kalra, who has been evading arrest, and that the society was counting on the judiciary and the police. Shrivastav also told the court that Kalra had to be questioned to find out the details of his operation as among the 748 oxygen concentrators reportedly imported by Kalra only 524 could be traced.Kalra through his counsel Vineet Malhotra told the court that he has been made a “poster boy” in the case when online platforms like Amazon have been allegedly selling similar equipment for ₹1.5 lakh. Urging the state to act like a prosecuting agency and not a persecuting one, his counsel also informed the court that details of manufacturers and machines have been handed over to the police, even as his accountant has been picked up by the cops for questioning.Delhi police had seized 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants owned by Kalra -- Khan Chacha, Nega Ju, Town Hall -- and from a storage in Chattarpur owned by a company called Matrix Cellular. Investigators have told the court previously that they are in possession of evidence to show Kalra was selling concentrators bought for ₹14,000-15,000 at an inflated price of ₹75,000 and above.The Delhi high court had refused interim bail protection to Kalra on Friday even as his high-profile legal team comprising senior lawyers Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikas Pahwa called the case a “harassment of their client”, adding that punishment cannot be meted out to Kalra since the price of oxygen concentrators, an essential commodity, has not been fixed by the governmentKalra’s counsel also informed the court that he suffered a fall and had to be given stitches on his jaw while asking for permission for him to be allowed access to liquid food and a visit to Medanta hospital for a check-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/khan-chacha-owner-navneet-kalra-remanded-to-three-day-custody-in-oxygen-concentrator-case-101621258461844.html

On Sunday, the Delhi Police said their probe revealed that Aam Aadmi Party workers printed and pasted the posters in south, west and east Delhi. Durgesh Pathak of the Aam Aadmi Party dared the Centre to arrest him, saying that he and his party had posted the posters across the city. Leaders of the rival Congress also challenged the government to arrest them. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi shared a digital copy of the poster on his Twitter account and said: “Arrest me too”. Rahul Gandhi’s party called the police action an attempt by the Modi government to muzzle criticism. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said the Congress will ask the question on behalf of the lakhs of people who died before their time or were living in “worry, tensions and sorrow”.The petition filed in the Supreme Court said the police action was contrary to the Supreme Court’s recent direction restraining the police from registering criminal cases against people for seeking medical help over social media. Police said most of the people arrested in cases related to the posters had been released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cancel-firs-for-posters-against-vaccine-export-says-delhi-lawyer-in-sc-plea-101621258150580.html

If we speak too much, treason and sedition charges will be slapped on us as well,” Rakesh Rathore told reporters last week, according to a video clip which surfaced Monday.The MLA was replying to a question about ICU facilities in Sitapur.Pressed further, he said, "Do you think any MLA can put forward his point of view?"“Everything is going fine. I will only say that things couldn’t be better,” he said in a sarcastic vein, while replying to another question.“I am not the government. But I can definitely say that whatever the government is telling you, it should be considered as correct," he said.Asked why the district administration is lacking in efforts to control the crisis, the MLA said the government and administration are two sides of the same coin.Other members of the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh too have questioned Yogi Adityanath’s handling of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.On May 9, Union Labour minister Santosh Gangwar complained to the chief minister about the situation in his Bareilly constituency, saying officials don't take calls and government health centres send back patients for 'referrals' from the district hospital.In a letter to Adityanath, he also complained about the “big shortage” of empty oxygen cylinders and the high prices of medical equipment in Bareilly.A day later, BJP MLA from Jasrana in Firozabad Ramgopal Lodhi claimed that his coronavirus positive wife was not admitted to an Agra hospital for over three hours, with officials saying that beds were not available.The upset MLA posted a video clip with his complaint on social media, causing embarrassment to the government.Lodhi claimed that his wife was not given medicines and water on time."What will happen to a common man when an MLA's wife cannot be given proper care," he said in the video, alleging that his wife had to lie on the hospital floor.In April, a "confidential" letter written by UP Law Minister Brajesh Pathak surfaced on social media. Pathak had lashed out at his state's health authorities, complaining that beds for coronavirus patients were falling short and ambulances took hours to arrive in the state capital.The minister did not reject the authenticity of the letter, which appeared to challenge the UP government's claim that it is on top of the situation."I had written a confidential letter to the government," he had told PTI, declining to share its contents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-mlas-speak-up-on-up-government-s-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic-101621257022257.html

The dosages were supplied to 107 hospitals across Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune rural. Instead of the regular 400 mg dose in each vial of the immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of Covid-19, the administration on Monday supplied 80 mg vials. According to doctors, a severe Covid-19 patient needs 400 mg of each dose which could be two doses if the health situation does not improve. With the present supply, hospitals will have to give five vials to such Covid cases. The district administration has asked hospitals and doctors to exercise caution while administering the drugs. On Monday, in a letter to district hospitals that had requested tocilizumab 400 mg vials, the admin supplied 40mg vials. Just like remdesivir, the distribution of tocilizumab is also restricted by the Pune district administration. Hospitals are unable to procure the drug directly. The letter signed by Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh states: “the demand for tocilizumab has risen steadily and the drug is not made in India but imported and distributed by Cipla across the country. The earlier stock distributed on May 4 was tocilizumab 400 mg. However, the stock provided on May 17 is 80 mg. So, it is advised that the prescription must be in accordance with the Covid patient’s severity.” As per an annexure by the central government, tocilizumab 400 mg must be administered slowly over NS IV over 60 minutes and the patient can be given an additional dose if the condition worsens. As a patient may need up to 800 mg of the drug, now 10 injections of the current dose have to be administered.

It also purifies the lungs and saves me from Covid-19 infection. I don’t take any medicine against corona but I am safe.”Thakur then went on to explain how to consume it too. She said, “The urine should belong to a cow of indigenous breed...one who only grass from a forest. It should then be filtered at least 16 times using a cotton cloth before consumption.” Thakur stuck to her stand a day later and said on Monday, “I said what I practise. It is my belief and I didn’t force anybody to follow this.”Also Read | Despite second wave, Bhagwat’s comments indicate Sangh-BJP ties on trackEarlier, Thakur, who had gone through bilateral mastectomy, claimed that her breast cancer was cured due to cow urine and other by-products of cow. The Malegaon blast co-accused was missing from public life for the past four months due to ongoing health issues. Many locals and activists had also run a campaign against her for not extending any help to the people of Bhopal amid shortage of oxygen beds and Remdevisir injections. She has started attending public programmes recently.Meanwhile, the MP’s comments allowed the Congress to open a line of attack against her party. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill tweeted on Monday, “No wonder top virologist Shahid Jameel has quit Govt Covid Panel because BJP Brigade believes in quack formulas rather than scientific facts.” Many doctors have warned against using cow urine to ward off Covid-19 by confirming that its properties do not give any protection against the viral infection, and could cause other infections like black fungus or mucormycosis, which can be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-says-cow-urine-saves-people-from-covid19-101621254370646.html

17-05-2021||Pune||Congress leader, Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Satav dies due to post-Covid complications||PUNE Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Satav died on Sunday due to post-Covid complications, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said. Satav was 46. A member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), Satav breathed his last at 5am, four days after he was diagnosed with a fresh infection of the Cytomegalovirus, Tope said. The last rites will be conducted on Monday morning, his family members said. Satav had earlier contracted SARS-CoV-2 for which he was undergoing treatment at Jehangir Hospital. “Satav became RT-PCR negative on May 9. However, he succumbed to secondary pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome,” the hospital stated in a statement. “He had recovered from Covid-19 and was taking some immunosuppressant drugs. He later developed a fresh infection due to which he had fibrosis in the lungs. Despite the best efforts of the doctors, he succumbed to the infection,” Tope said. Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that can cause complications for people with a weakened immune system. Satav was admitted to Jehangir hospital on April 23, a day after he tested positive for Covid-19. Due to some complications, he had to be shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was on ventilator support. Last week, Satav recovered and tested negative for Covid-19. However, the fresh infection led to deterioration in his health, resulting in him being put on ventilator support again. “It’s very sad news. He was very close to me. I was in Pune to visit [him at the] hospital and enquire about his health. However, I lost my friend at around 5am,” said Tope. According to another Maharashtra minister, Vishwajeet Kadam, Satav’s lungs were heavily infected due to infection, which made it difficult for doctors. Senior leaders, including those from his party, paid their condolences. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his condolence message tweeted: “Anguished by the passing away of my friend from Parliament, Shri Rajeev Satav Ji. He was an upcoming leader with much potential. Condolences to his family, friends and supporters.” Hailing from Hingoli, which he represented in the Lok Sabha between 2014 and 2019, Satav was considered a close associate of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “I’’m very sad at the loss of my friend Rajeev Satav. He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of Congress. It’s a big loss for us all. My condolences and love to his family,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.Maharashtra Congress leaders said Satav’’s death is an irreparable loss. The NCP and Shiv Sena also expressed shock at his demise. NCP president Sharad Pawar said Satav’s death was shocking. Pawar described him as a studious and aggressive leader. Born on September 21, 1974, Satav studied at Pune’s Fergusson College and then, at the ILS Law college. Before becoming Lok Sabha MP, Satav was a legislator in the Maharashtra assembly.In the Congress, Satav, considered a close associate of Rahul Gandhi, was in charge of party’s affairs in Gujarat, where the Congress put up a spirited fight in the last assembly elections. Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu (chairperson of the Rajya Sabha) in his condolence message tweeted: “I’m deeply shocked by the untimely demise of Rajya Sabha member, Shri Rajiv Satav due to Covid-related complications. He was a dynamic parliamentarian and deeply committed to serving the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/congress-leader-rajya-sabha-member-rajeev-satav-dies-due-to-post-covid-complications-101621251730491.html

Each of the injured police personnel will be given ₹5,000 for their diet and medical needs,” the DGP tweeted. Also read: Bleeding, clotting from AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine minuscule in India: ReportA spokesman for the Hisar police said that only two of the 20 injured police personnel are hospitalised as the rest have been discharged after treatment. “All of them are stable,” he said. A committee of 11 farm leaders met Hisar district officials at the IG’s office on Sunday evening and assured the administration that the farmers will not break the law in future. A total of 85 farmers were released after the meeting and no FIR was registered against them, the spokesman said. However, soon after their released, the farmers gathered at Ramayana toll plaza to protest against the Centre’s farm laws. Women and children also joined them despite the ban on gatherings during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ministers back police action, Oppn condemn lathicharge Many ministers in the BJP-JJP government condemned the violence and backed the police action. Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said on Twitter, “Thank God, four new hospitals have been inaugurated to defeat Covid. Our brave police personnel received injuries while protecting the hospitals. Their efforts will not go in vain.” State education minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar said, “I thank chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for inaugurating the 500-bed hospital at Hisar and appreciate the cops ,who despite getting injured protected the hospital.” Opposition leaders of the Congress and the INLD criticised the police action with former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda saying, “The farmers are fighting the virus and the government’s apathy. The government should accept the farmers’ demands after holding talks with them instead of resorting to lathicharge and provoking them.” INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala said the Haryana chief minister acted like a coward in Hisar. “It’s time to impose President’s rule in the state by taking charge from the BJP-JJP government. Our party stands in solidarity with farmers,” he said. Farmers warned of miscreants joining stir BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni thanked the farmers for blocking all national and state highways in protest against the Hisar incident. “I appeal to farmers to continue the protest peacefully and be aware of miscreants who have been trying to defame the agitation. We have identified two people who used aggressive language in Hisar on Sunday to provoke farmers for a confrontation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/injured-haryana-cops-get-aid-farmers-back-at-protest-site-101621249390495.html

Two days later, he was discharged and brought home, where he eventually died a few hours later. Earlier in the day before his discharge from the hospital, Manoj Kumar’s sample was collected to check for Covid-19 infection. The test results had not arrived by the time of his passing.Given the possibility that the deceased could be Covid infected, an ambulance was called to take him to the burial ground but it didn’t turn up even after 18 hours of his death, said Prasad.Later, the victim’s kin contacted local ward councillor Sushil Kumar alias Mitthu, who allegedly demanded ₹22,000 for cremating the body. The family said they agreed to pay him ₹16,500, following which, two men wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits arrived with a garbage pushcart and carried the body to the burial ground. A video of the body being carried in the municipality garbage cart went viral on social media.Following the incident, a committee of local residents requested Nalanda district magistrate (DM) Yogendra Prasad for a probe alleging misconduct by the ward councillor. They wanted to know why a municipal vehicle was not provided for carrying the body and why a municipal committee, formed to conduct the last rites of unclaimed bodies, did not intervene in the situation.Biharsharif municipal commissioner Anshul Agarwal said, “We are investigating why a push cart was used to carry the body.”Some healthcare workers claimed a shortage of ambulances was the reason for the emergency vehicle’s non-availability, while the civil hospital authorities said ambulances were used only either to bring patients to hospital or send bodies to crematoriums from hospitals.However, Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar seemed to disagree with the shortage of ambulance theory. “We have more than 200 vehicles to take bodies to the crematorium. A proper investigation will be done into the matter and action will be taken against those who are involved in the incident,” said Kumar.Several incidents of bodies being carried on bicycles or pushcarts have been reported from rural areas of the state recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/suspected-covid-19-victim-s-body-carried-on-garbage-cart-in-bihar-probe-ordered-101621248310370.html
17-05-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Ajit Pawar’s social media conundrum is all about the timing||Last week when Maharashtra government decided to appoint a private agency to handle the social media accounts of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, it drew sharp criticism from all the quarters. One reason for criticism was the government was willing to pay ₹6 crores amid raging Covid crisis when state is grappling with paucity of funds. The ₹6 crores was for a year -2021-22. Pawar later ordered he does not need a separate agency though debate continued to rage on. Was it for the first time government was appointing outside agency to operate social media accounts? Various institutions within the government - be it Police or municipal corporations or ministers - have hired services of private agencies to handle their social media accounts. The success recipe for social media these days is more important than the actual work done by respective entities. It helps politicians, police and other government agencies to create an image that is appreciated by an outside world. At the same time, a lot of it is also useful to common citizens. In one of his interviews in January 2020, K Vekatesham, former police commissioner, Pune, said, “After the city police became active on social media, people’s engagement with police had increased, while at the same time their faith in the law enforcement agency also improved.” This was after the city police roped in a private agency to operate its Twitter, and other social media accounts, in 2019. The digitally-savvy Pune police started using pop culture and millennial slang to speak to youngsters. From several witty responses, to polite yet firm messages, netizens began enjoying the quick and smart replies on the Pune police Twitter handle that had shut out some “extra smart” accounts, asking about drugs or the cell numbers of women. The active social media account helped Pune police carve out a better image for its Pune unit. To handle the accounts, Sunchika Pandey, a Mumbai- based journalist-turned-social media consultant helped the Pune police. Pandey had previously helped the Mumbai police stay ahead in the social media game. “My agency’s job is to only guide them on strengths and weaknesses of social media, which can make or mar anyone’s image,” Pandey had said in her interview to Hindustan Times in 2020, (Meet the Meme Queen who radicalised Pune police’s social media game... for the better). For many agencies, Pandey and her media firm have been game changers. While Pandey did not share specific details, agencies in Pune and Mumbai hiring her services were paying crores of rupees. So why did Ajit Pawar invite criticism that forced him to immediately ask the government not to go ahead with his proposal to hire a specialist agency to handle his social media account? There are many ministers and politicians who have roped in private agencies to do the same. In Pawar’s case, it was more due to timing and the payment, which in previous instances did was not made public. The proposal was to spend ₹6 crore on the deputy chief minister’s social media accounts, even though the government has a Directorate General of Information and Public Relations (DGIPR) department.The department has a staff strength of 1,200 across Maharashtra with an annual budget of ₹150 crore. If the DGIPR, as claimed in the same order issued to hire a private agency for Pawar’s account, lacks professional and technical competence to handle social media, the government could spend the same money that it was to allocate for Pawar to train the staff. That will be of use to all the ministers, including the chief minister, and to various departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-ajit-pawar-s-social-media-conundrum-is-all-about-the-timing-101621248130686.html

17-05-2021||Delhi||Covid second wave: Sex workers get help from Good Samaritans||Even before they could recover from the impact of last year’s lockdown, the second wave of Covid and the subsequent lockdown have dealt another blow to most of the sex workers in the Capital; who were already struggling to make ends meet. In the narrow bylanes of Garston Bastion (GB) Road, a team of volunteers comprising students and young professionals can be found, distributing food and dry ration to families of over 800 sex workers! “Since we are aware of the problems faced by the women in the area, we collected funds and even conducted a food drive to distribute the packets that contain ration (for 15 days), including dal, rice, flour, basic spices as well as soaps and sanitisers,” says Shankar Singh, founder of the NGO, Vrikshit Foundation. He adds that the group will soon return with reusable sanitary napkins for the women in the area. “For sex workers, getting help from authorities is a challenge since they do not have ration cards... Around 2,000 plus sex workers reside in the 100 brothels who have lost their only means of livelihood because of the lockdown,” explains Awadhesh Yadav, founder of Society Participatory Integrated Development (SPID), an NGO working in the Capital for women and child development. Along with food, the society is focussing on pregnant and lactating mothers, who are provided with milk for their kids.“Our goal is to prevent the second generation from prostitution. At our 24-hour shelter in GB road area, we take care of kids of sex workers, which includes their boarding, food and education. We are also distributing ration to the hundreds of families here, and families of the Perna tribe, residing in Najafgarh,” says Yadav, adding, “Many women came to us asking for help during the second wave, and we are trying our best to help everyone, and raise awareness about their plight.” Efforts are being made by some, who are providing emotional support, literacy and life skills to women engaged in prostitution. “During the pandemic, under our HeARTshala initiative, we have taught women how to stitch cotton masks and bags, to provide them an alternate source of livelihood. In the second wave, these women have been given machines so that they can work at home, since we do not want to risk calling them to the centres,” says Aarzoo Jolly, program lead at Kat-Katha, adding, “We are also teaching them about finance and entrepreneurship through online classes, to allow them to have an alternate source of livelihood.” Jolly says that the organisation is also taking care of around 30 children of the sex workers, who are being taught via online classes at the moment.

Nearly five months later on May 13, the mother was traced to Udawala village in Jaipur district, where she was living with her 45-years old partner Prahlad Sahay.Kota rural circle officer, Vijay Shankar Sharma said Teena initially tried to throw the police off the track by claiming Nandini was with her grandparents but later confessed to have killed her with Sahay’s help.Sharma said Teena told police that she had fled from her village in Kota district on November 11 last year, and since then, she was living with Prahlad at his house in Udawala village, where Nandini was injured a month later on December 9, while playing with Prahlad.Teena said they took her to a doctor in Shahpura but he referred her to Jaipur for treatment. Since Prahlad was not interested in spending money on Nandini’s treatment, they choked her to death using a shawl, the police officer said. Later, the duo dumped her body in Sariska forests in Alwar.After arresting Teena and Prahlad for murder, a Kota police team has left for Alwar to recover Nandini’s body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-woman-kills-daughter-with-lover-s-help-both-arrested-101621242970152.html

We mean business. The pandemic is now. This is completely unacceptable. Political parties cannot make this pandemic a selling point. How could they purchase it without prescription?Also Read | Clean chit to BV Srinivas, 8 others in hoarding case“You have to act with responsibility. They have no business to buy medicines and hoarding them to earn some goodwill. Now it seems that you are not interested in getting out the truth,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.“Just because some political figures are involved, this is no reason to not investigate. Your force should stand up, you have a duty towards the people. You have to understand this. People all over are suffering,” Justice Vipin Sanghi said, pulling up the Delhi Police, asking if the force realises just how many people have died due to lack of medicines, which, allegedly, were being hoarded by some people.Justice Sanghi further said, “Medicines were being hoarded by a certain doctor. Since it is being projected that the medicines are held for public charity, we expect that as responsible citizens, people will not procure these medicines for political gains.”Also Read | PIL on hoarding: Delhi Police question Youth Cong chief BV SrinivasThe court further said that it expects the medicines to be surrendered to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) for poor and needy public. It further directed the Delhi Police to conduct a “proper investigation” in the matter and do the needful if a case is made out to register an First information Report (FIR).“We want a complete status report. We would expect that whatever stocks are being held by the political parties is surrendered to the Directorate of Health Services (DGHS) as good samaritans. In case they want to do public good that would be the best way it can be done. We find it difficult prima facie to believe…..We are appealing in good sense that this should not go and they should go and surrender it with the DGHS,” the bench said.The observations and directions come while perusing the Delhi police’s status report in the high court where nine politicians including Srinivas, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Gautam Gambhir and party leader Harish Khurana, as well Dilip Pandey of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders, as well as other essential medicines, were given clean chit by the probe agency.The police in their report had said that they were actually helping people without charging money and no one was defrauded.The case pertains to questioning by the police of nine people for alleged hoarding of oxygen cylinders, as well as other essential medicines, at a time when several hospitals in the Capital reported a shortage of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) resulting in several cases in which people infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lost their lives. While the oxygen cylinders were provided to those in need, it was alleged that this was done for “political gains.”However, it was the questioning of Srinivas which triggered a major political storm as he has been at the forefront of helping people with oxygen cylinders.The Delhi Police was investigating the case on the directions of the high court which directed it to do so after a petition was filed in the court seeking a probe into the matter.The high court will next hear the case on May 24, by when it has directed the Delhi Police to file a status report showing how medicines were procured in “such large numbers by a few persons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hoarding-case-delhi-hc-dissatisfied-with-police-clean-chit-to-bv-srinivas-others-101621238651478.html

Dozens of bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients have washed up on the banks of river Ganga in Ghazipur over the past few days, triggering concerns over possible river water contamination leading to further spread of the contagion.Rai, who runs a business in Gujarat, was in his village in Ghazipur when incidents of villagers dumping bodies in Ganga surfaced with disturbing videos and images getting flashed across media platforms.“People from various parts of the country called me to know the facts. The dumping of bodies as well as floating corpses in the river seemed disgraceful,” Rai said.He discussed the issue with his associates and family members and decided to launch a firewood bank on the nine cremation ‘ghats’ located near the river. “We informed the district administration about the plan and... transported firewood procured from the timber merchants from various parts of the districts. On May 14, the firewood banks were launched near the nine cremation grounds,” Rai said.The poor people are being given wood for the last rites from the bank for free and volunteers are busy maintaining the stock at all the nine depots. “Along with assisting the needy, we are also working to protect the Ganga from pollution,” Rai said.On an average, ₹5,000 is spent on firewood for a single pyre. Rai has so far spent close to ₹3 lakh to cremate 60 bodies. He has been helped by family and friends in generating resources for the noble cause.The district administration says it has started an awareness campaign while the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) is conducting patrols to dissuade villagers from dumping the bodies in the river. The newly-elected gram pradhans have been asked to reach out to district administration for assistance for the last rites if needed. They say Rai’s initiative has also made a difference.Ghazipur district magistrate Mangala Prasad Singh acknowledged Rai’s contribution in solving the problem. “His organization is also creating awareness among the villagers urging them not to dump the dead bodies in the river,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-man-hands-out-free-firewood-to-prevent-dumping-of-bodies-in-ganga-101621230610134.html

A BMC official had earlier said that the civic body has shifted 580 patients from Covid-19 care centres in the city as a precautionary measure in view of the warning that Cyclone Tauktae is likely to pass close to the city.According to the IMD, Cyclone Tauktae has intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm and is very likely to reach the Gujarat coast at around 2:30 am of May 18 and cross it between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district around the early morning hours.The weather department has issued an orange alert for Mumbai warning of very heavy rains at isolated places with strong winds on Monday as Cyclone Tauktae is likely to pass close from the Mumbai coast towards Gujarat.Three teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) stationed in the western suburbs of Mumbai have been put on alert. Teams of the Indian Navy have also been kept on standby.The Met department had earlier said that the cyclone could cause heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in north Konkan, Mumbai, Thane and Palghar on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-covid-19-vaccination-drive-in-mumbai-on-monday-due-to-cyclone-tauktae-101621212558257.html
17-05-2021||Delhi||Demand for cancelling exams grows as students process grief||A 17-year-old who lost both his parents to Covid-19, another boy whose hospitalised mother does not know her husband has passed away; an 18-year-old who lost her mother two days ago, and a top performer who tested positive for the infection — these are just some of the students expected to write the CBSE Class 12 exams amid the fourth wave of the pandemic in the national capital.On April 14, the Centre cancelled the Class 10 exams and postponed the Class 12 tests, and said it will review the situation on June 1 before deciding on the fate of the exams. Students and teachers are concerned about the ramifications the exams may have, with just 15 days left for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to decide on the Class 12 exams. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ is due to chair a virtual meeting with all state education secretaries to discuss the impact of the pandemic on education.However, with the country continuing to record over 350,000 new Covid-19 infections and nearly 4,000 deaths every day, stakeholders have questioned the feasibility of conducting exams in-person. Students have started social media campaigns demanding the cancellation of Class 12 exams amid the pandemic. A plea has been also filed in the Supreme Court asking for directions to the Centre, CBSE and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) to cancel the Class 12 examinations.Officials at several schools in Delhi said many of their students had seen loss at close quarters, and that it will be challenging for them to take tests in such a situation. For instance, at Amity International School in Saket, a Class 12 student lost both his parents to Covid-19 during the ongoing surge, while another student’s father died, while the mother continues to fight the infection in hospital.Psychologist Manveen Kaur, the school counsellor, said asking students to appear for exams at this moment will “push them beyond breaking point.”“We are talking about teenagers here. They need time, focus, and energy to heal. They don’t need to stress about their academics right now. Authorities need to realise that children in the cycle of grief and despair need to get over this uncertainty because prolonged exposure to it will lead to stress and behavioural changes... Children who have lost their parents a week or a month or even five months ago, cannot be expected to write their papers,” said Kaur.The situation is identical at schools run by the government.At The Indian School, a Class 12 student of commerce lost his mother to the infection a couple of days ago, officials said. Two siblings enrolled in classes 10 and 12 at Springdales School on Pusa Road also lost their parents to Covid-19 recently. At least two students of Class 12 of MM Public School in Pitampura have lost their fathers to Covid-19.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School, said, “Two siblings studying in class 10 and 12 in our school lost their parents to Covid recently. When their relatives from outside Delhi wanted to take the children to a different city, the Class 12 student’s first concern was — what about my boards?... We have to come out with some kind of decision on this soon,” she said.Several Class 12 students have themselves tested positive for Covid-19. For instance, Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Surajmal Vihar had to stop all remedial and preparatory classes later last month when one of their top performers tested positive for the infection. School principal RP Singh said, “We held an online meeting with students and asked them not to worry about their exams and to focus on themselves and their families… The board can conduct exams by addressing the administrative aspects, but the way students and teachers have been hit emotionally in the last month cannot be addressed,” he said.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “Conducting exams is just a part of the process. It will be followed by rigorous evaluation, after which results will be prepared. It will be equally challenging to do that at a time when several teachers have died across schools in Delhi, so many have tested positive, while several have had deaths in their families.”Several students echoed these views. Aman Sharma (17), a student of Class 12 at Modern School in Vasant Vihar, said at least four of his classmates lost their parents between April and May and the pressure of board exams has left them feeling abandoned. “Exams cannot get preference over the lives and health of students. CBSE should not make us wait till June for clarity and leave us feeling anxious when we all know that there is a possibility of a third wave as well. This is not a conducive environment for us to sit and study when the world around us is collapsing,” he said.Education experts suggested alternative evaluation methods.Renu Malaviya, associate professor at the department of education at Lady Irwin College who has been working on alternative assessment methods for students with disabilities, said, “Online assessments could be an option for those with access to the internet and an alternate mode can be developed for those who don’t have digital access. The assessment pattern could be a combination of a variety of objective-type questions, including short answers. The assessments could be continuous and comprehensive. Most higher education institutes are already conducting entrance tests and with Central Universities Common Entrance Test, Class 12 grades will not be the only deciding factor for admission to colleges and universities.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said several universities across the world have dropped SATs and school marks as deciding factors for admissions amid the pandemic.“Colleges in India can also follow other options for admissions this year in case the exams don’t take place. For instance, they can carry out United States-style applications with a history of the last three or four years, marks, awards, special achievements, and a ‘statement of purpose’ (SoP). They can even ask for an essay or journal note instead of the SoP. These can be submitted by post,” she said.Despite several attempts, CBSE controller of exams Sanyam Bhardwaj did not respond to calls and texts requesting comment. The board in a statement on Saturday said “no decision has been taken regarding the Class 12 exams yet”.A senior official from the Union education ministry on Sunday said no decision has been taken so far even as the government is “closely monitoring” the situation. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” will conduct a virtual meeting with all state education secretaries on Monday to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on education. “The matter of CBSE class 12 exams is likely to be discussed there,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/demand-for-cancelling-exams-grows-as-students-process-grief-101621205908574.html
17-05-2021||Gurugram||60k doses wasted in Gurugram since jabs drive kicked off||Around 60,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been wasted in Gurugram district since the inoculation drive started, health department officials said on Sunday.Officials attributed the wastage in the initial days to vaccine hesitancy in people, higher dose capacity of the vials and glitches in the system.District immunisation officer Dr MP Singh said, “So far around 60,000 doses of vaccine have been wasted in the district, but there are different reasons for wastage. We have found that in the first phase, many healthcare and frontline workers got vaccinated but due to glitches in the system, the data could not be uploaded on the portal. Due to this, the wastage rate is high, but the on ground situation is different. Also, initially people were not so keen on taking the vaccine so if a vial was opened and not enough people were vaccinated within four hours, it led to wastage.”Officials said that initially (January-February), each vial of Covaxin had 20 doses, which led to wastage, as not many people could be vaccinated within the four hours’ time limit when the vaccine can be used. At present, the district has a wastage rate of over 5% (approximately), with 1.2% wastage rate for Covaxin and 1% for Covishield.While Covishield vials contained 10 doses each from the start, Covaxin vials too were brought down to this size later.For those who took the first dose of vaccine and whose records could not be uploaded on the portal, the district health department is now clearing the logs by cross-checking with the beneficiaries by checking pay slips (for those who availed private services) and records on government registers for others. “The wastage rate is reducing now as we have an idea of how many people would be coming for vaccination (18-44 age group) at each site, due to mandatory registration on the CoWIN portal. Also, because it is difficult to get the slots, people are not missing their vaccination dates. So now vials are getting over within an hour, thus reducing wastage,” added Dr Singh.As of now, 593,099 people have been vaccinated in Gurugram district. On Sunday, 4,212 were administered the first dose of vaccine, while 441 were given the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/60k-doses-wasted-in-gurugram-since-jabs-drive-kicked-off-101621205563979.html
17-05-2021||Delhi||Lockdown for 1 more week, says CM; Metro to stay shut||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that the ongoing lockdown in Delhi has been extended till May 24 morning. It was earlier supposed to end at 5 am on Monday, May 17.On April 19, a weekend curfew in Delhi was turned into a full lockdown from the next day in the light of an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the capital which left the city’s health infrastructure creaking. Since then, this is the fourth time the lockdown has been extended.“The lockdown has been extended till 5 am next Monday,” the chief minister said during his visit to a Covid-19 health facility set up outside the government’s GTB hospital.For the past few days, Delhi has been witnessing a steady decline in Covid-19 infections. However, the positivity rate still remains well above 5% -- a level considered relatively safe by the World Health Organization (WHO).“The recovery rate is going up, and the positivity rate is going down. In the last 24 hours, around 6,500 new cases have been recorded in Delhi and the positivity rate has dropped to 10% -- down from 11% the previous day. We cannot let our guards down now,” Kejriwal said and added that he hoped the situation will get better in another week.Delhi recorded 6,456 new infections, Sunday’s health bulletin showed, on the back of 62,059 tests.The test positivity rate also continued to fall, dropping to 10.40% on Sunday, from 11.32% a day earlierThe Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued the official order regarding the lockdown extension around 12.30 pm.“The situation of Covid-19 in Delhi has again been reviewed and [it has been] observed that Covid-19 positive cases and positivity rate is still high and [the] bed occupancy (oxygen beds/ICU beds) in the dedicated Covid-19 government and private hospitals and nursing homes is also on higher side,” said the order explaining the rationale for extending the lockdown.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Delhi is still facing a shortage of hospital beds, ICUs, ventilators. The government has to implement policies to ensure minimum interaction of people and make sure that there are no gatherings. So the lockdown is essential. We cannot let guards down at this point.”As on Sunday noon, 15,340 (66%) of 23,213 total oxygen beds in the city’s Covid-19 wards were occupied. Of the 6,415 total ICU beds, 5,728 (89%) were occupied, the government’s app on hospital beds showed.While no new restriction has been imposed this week, no existing restriction has been lifted too.General movement of people and economic activities are prohibited in the lockdown with exemptions for those engaged in essential services and the supply chain of essential goods. Metro services are suspended and public buses have been asked to cater only to essential service providers. When asked if Delhi metro service would resume, the chief minister said: “Restrictions will remain as it is this week.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The overall Covid-19 curve is declining in Delhi. There is no doubt in that. This is the time to boost the vaccination drive. The government has to resolve the shortage issue at the earliest either by increasing production of vaccines in India or buying from other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-for-1-more-week-says-cm-metro-to-stay-shut-101621204508092.html
17-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: 10.4% test positive as rate continues to dip||The Covid-19 test positivity rate continued to wind downwards in the national capital, falling to 10.40% on Sunday, from 11.32% a day earlier, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal signalling that the infection may be steadying in the city, even as he extended the ongoing lockdown by a week.Delhi recorded 6,456 new infections, Sunday’s health bulletin showed, on the back of 62,059 tests. The city has added an average of 10,043 new cases a day over the past seven days — the lowest in 33 days, since it added 9,299 cases in the seven days ending April 13.Sunday’s bulletin showed that 262 more people died of the infection in 24 hours. While this number is the lowest in 25 days, it must be noted that this number is still double the death count during the third wave of cases, when Delhi saw a one-day high of 131 deaths on November 18.All major parameters concerning the pandemic have seen a downward trend over the past week, indicating that the fourth wave of infections may be receding. The seven-day average test positivity rate for instance, has dropped from 25.27% as on May 9, to 14.61% on Sunday. Active cases too, have fallen from 86,232 a week ago to 62,783 on Sunday.To be sure, the test positivity rate in Delhi is still far higher than the 5% threshold recommended by health experts, including the World Health Organization, for an infection to be considered under control in a region.At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases in a day on April 20. And on April 22, the Capital recorded a positivity rate of more than 36%. Single-day deaths hit a high on May 3, when 448 people succumbed to the infection.Experts urged caution over the dip in the cases and stressed on boosting vaccination and starting preparations for any more potential waves in future.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The case trajectory and positivity rate are going down in Delhi, which is a good sign. This is the time the government should scale up genome sequencing and integrate that with epidemiological data for advanced study...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-10-4-test-positive-as-rate-continues-to-dip-101621204161042.html
17-05-2021||Delhi||Navneet Kalra held in O2 concentrator case||Businessman Navneet Kalra who has been charged with hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices was arrested late Sunday evening from a farmhouse in Gurugram, police officers aware of his arrest said.However, no senior police officer authorised to speak to the media confirmed Kalra’s arrest or disclosed where he was taken into custody from.Kalra was allegedly on the run since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular on May 7. A Delhi court on Thursday refused to grant protection from arrest to Kalra, following which he moved the Delhi high court. The high court on Friday also declined to grant any interim relief to him.“I am persuaded by the reasons given by the trial court which is a valid ground for me not to grant any interim protection now,” said the single-judge bench of justice Subramonium Prasad.He posted the matter for further hearing to Tuesday (May 18), after additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for the police, sought more time to file a reply and argue the case.Raju also opposed any interim relief to Kalra by arguing that the present case was not one where such a protection can be given.Investigators said they possess evidence to prove that the oxygen concentrators, which were bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, were being sold for prices upwards of ₹75,000.Demand for oxygen concentrators had swelled during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital with many hospitals running out of medical oxygen as the number of critically ill patients rose. Such concentrators, which can derive 80-90% pure oxygen from ambient air, was also a crucial part of the medical supplies and aids provided by many foreign countries to help India’s efforts against the pandemic.On Friday, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikas Pahwa, who appeared for Kalra, sought interim relief for their client till the matter was heard on Tuesday (May 18). Singhvi argued that this was a case of harassment and punishment cannot be given to a person before fixation of price of an essential commodity.On Thursday, Singhvi had said that his client bought the concentrators from Matrix Cellular after paying GST and the payment was made via credit card, therefore, there was nothing clandestine about the purchase of the equipment. He had said that Kalra sold the equipment within the labelled price that Matrix, which imported the concentrators, had fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navneet-kalra-held-in-o2-concentrator-case-101621201871448.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Expressing solidarity with Palestine is not a crime: Mehbooba||A day after police admitted to having arrested 20 persons in Kashmir, including a graffiti designer, for protesting against Israel and supporting Palestine, former J&K chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said that expressing solidarity with Palestine is not a crime.She also condemned the arrest of two sons of senior separatist leader Ashraf Sehrai who was arrested under PSA last year and had contracted Covid while in jail and died at a Jammu hospital earlier this month. “People all over the world are protesting against the atrocities committed by Israel on Palestine. But in Kashmir, it’s a punishable offence where an artist is booked under PSA & a preacher is arrested simply for expressing solidarity with Palestinians,” tweeted Mehbooba Mufti.“PSA is GOI’s go to method for every problem. Latest example being Ashraf Sehrai’s sons who lost their father in custody due to inadequate medical care & have been arrested under PSA. In rest of India dead are being ill treated but in Kashmir its the living who are made to suffer,” she said in another tweet.Meanwhile, Peoples’ Conference chairman Sajjad Lone, reacting on arrest of Sehrai’s two sons, said the government should bring this “Rambo Culture” to an end.” A police spokesperson wrote on their official handle that Sehrai’s two sons had been arrested for “raising anti-national slogans during Sehrai’s funeral”, but not booked under PSA. “J&K Police are keeping a close watch on elements attempting to leverage the unfortunate situation in Palestine to disturb the peace and order in Kashmir. We are a professional force and are sensitive to public anguish. But J&K police have a legal responsibility to ensure law and order. It, however, wouldn’t allow cynical encashment of the public anger to trigger violence, lawlessness and disorder on Kashmir streets,” said the police spokesperson.Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar said that they won’t allow protests in the Valley in the larger interest of general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/expressing-solidarity-with-palestine-is-not-a-crime-mehbooba-101621195988866.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination centres run out of doses in Kashmir||Two weeks after J&K’s Lt Governor Manoj Sinha announced that 1.2 crore doses of vaccine have been ordered, the vaccination centres in the Valley are running dry as government has failed to arrange vaccines.The numbers provided by the J&K government also reflect that very few doses are being administered in the UT since last one week. Even the people, who are due for the second jab, complain that they are unable to find vaccination centres where they can go for inoculation.On Saturday, just 607 people received vaccines in 10 districts of Kashmir, while in seven districts, including Srinagar, not a single person got vaccinated. In Jammu’s 10 districts, 15,268 people were vaccinated, data shows. Similarly on May 14, 208 were jabbed in 10 Kashmir districts, while in Srinagar and five other districts, not a single person got the shot. In Jammu, 15,790 had received jabs.A day earlier, on Thursday, not a single vaccine was administered in 10 districts of Kashmir, while in as many districts of Jammu, 4,893 were inoculated. So far, as per the official figures, 28,04,543 people have received the shots in the entire J&K and most of these were administered a month ago when everyday, around 50,000 people used to get vaccines. However, due to the non-availability of vaccines, most of the vaccination centres are closed or the officials ask people to wait till the vaccines are available. “It’s an irony that now, stock of vaccines has dried up. Most of the centres are shut and government is asking people to get vaccinated. They don’t tell us where to send the people,” said a senior doctor at Government Medical College in Srinagar.On April 29, L-G Sinha, while chairing a meeting with office-bearers and volunteers of Indian Red Cross Society, had said that people of J&K need not panic as the government is equipped to deal with the emerging situation and 1.2 crore doses have been ordered for vaccination of 18-45 age group. Meanwhile, People’s Conference led by Sajjad Lone on Sunday said that government of Jammu and Kashmir should float global tenders to end vaccine paucity in the UT and termed the scarcity of doses in the Valley “extremely worrying”.Former legislator and party’s general secretary Imran Reza Ansari in a statement issued here highlighted how health centres across the Valley were battling the shortage of vaccines and that many sites, as per the reports, have been closed due to the unavailability of vaccines. “There is a wave of mounting anger and frustration due to tardy vaccination roll-out in J&K with some high-risk groups crying out for protection. The vaccine is the only bulwark available against the current calamity and denying the public such a facility amid the present peak is deplorable and inexplicable,” Ansari said.He said if reports were to be believed, there were mere 208 jabs administered to the people in Kashmir in the last 24 hours while in Jammu, the number is 20,000 in the last 48 hours. “We care for the people of all regions as much as we care for ourselves, but prioritising one region and ignoring the other amid the deadly pandemic is regrettable. We demand an absolute uniformity in the supply of the vaccines in Jammu and Kashmir. Precious human lives are getting consumed and the shortage of vaccines is only making things worse,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-centres-run-out-of-doses-in-kashmir-101621195931008.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Five Kashmir oxygen generation units diverted to Jammu||As Jammu division has witnessed a surge in Covid-related deaths in the past three weeks, five oxygen plants meant for Kashmir hospitals have been diverted to Jammu.Though Kashmir division is witnessing more coronavirus cases, the death toll for the past two weeks is less than that of Jammu’s. However, experts warn that diverting medical assets from one place to another could be a riskier proposition. The Valley has recorded 63% of the UT’s overall cases in the first half of May. Of the 64,300 cases from May 1 to 15, 40,900 are reported in Kashmir and 23,400 in Jammu. However, of 808 deaths, 520 have taken place in Jammu division. Officials in the mechanical engineering department, the authority responsible to acquire these plants, said Kashmir and Jammu divisions were allotted ₹125 crore each to acquire 37 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen units for each division by March 31. Officials in Kashmir were able to acquire some of the units amid the surging coronavirus cases, while the supply order in Jammu got delayed till May 7 owing to failure of the commencement of the contract with their supplier, they added.They said that despite the need of oxygen plants in Kashmir, three of the Valley’s 1,000 litres-per-minute (LPM) units have already been shifted to Jammu, while two more will be given to the division after they arrive here from Germany. “Of the 37 oxygen plants required for Kashmir, we have so far acquired 20 units, but could only install 17 here as three were installed in Jammu,” said an official who didn’t wish to be named. Nine PSA oxygen units are arriving — eight from Kashmir quota and one from Jammu quota — within a day or two. While seven will be air lifted, two are following the normal transportation procedures. “Although Jammu people are in urgent need of these plants right now, we too desperately need all of these 37 plants to save lives here,” he added. Of the five units, which have been diverted, two were meant for Srinagar’s Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital and Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital, while one was for Anantnag and two for Baramulla. Sources said it was decided to now fill up the deficit in the Valley by internally diverting oxygen plants of those districts which are not burdened by caseload.“Oxygen plants meant for Shopian and Bandipora districts will be now installed at two of the above places,” he said.Mechanical engineering department’s chief engineer Abdul Rashid Dar admitted that they have shifted a few plants to Jammu. “Only two plants of 1000 LPM capacity have been diverted. Their contract had failed. We had secured our contract on time, so we are placing orders for six plants from here for Jammu for now,” he added. He said that of the 37 PSA oxygen generation units ordered for Kashmir, 34 were from Germany while three were to be acquired from an American company.“We have already acquired 20 and seven more are being airlifted,” he said.“When all these oxygen plants will be set up, we will be sufficient in gaseous oxygen as we can’t rely on liquid medical oxygen owing to our road blockades for months during winter,” he added.The chief engineer said they will be replacing the plants which were shifted to Jammu back to the Valley after 45 days. Bodh Raj, executive engineer of mechanical hospital and central heating at Jammu division, said they have already installed 14 oxygen plants in various hospitals of Jammu.“Kashmir managed to get them before us, so the authorities thought about distributing the oxygen plants. Lives have to be saved. Every hour matters,” Raj said.He said the orders for other plants in Jammu have also been placed and they will arrive soon. Two more plants from Kashmir will most probably go to other district hospitals,” he added.He said that the daily oxygen requirement at Jammu GMC was 21 tonnes and it was sufficiently being supplied there. He said that no patient had died of the oxygen shortage in Jammu division.Doctors Association Kashmir president and influenza expert Nisar ul Haasan said that Jammu and Kashmir are part of the same region, but “siphoning off” the infrastructure of one place for another was unacceptable.“Without going into regional factors, we need to see scientifically where the need is more. And obviously, areas with more cases take priority. Diverting our infrastructure is a cause of concern. We don’t know how the virus will behave. We need more oxygen, more ventilators and more ICU beds because we can’t get them at the time of emergency,” he added. He said that the hospitals in Kashmir are full to capacity and those needing oxygen at home are being aided by NGOs. “We need to keep things ready for any eventuality and shifting the life-saving gadgetry is unacceptable,” Haasan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-kashmir-oxygen-generation-units-diverted-to-jammu-101621195929969.html

17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Political misuse of vigilance bureau must stop, says Randhawa||A day after reports of a vigilance investigation into the alleged deals of close associates of former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur, Punjab jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Sunday questioned the political misuse of the vigilance bureau by successive governments in the state.The cabinet minister said the misuse of vigilance bureau by the state governments for targeting or intimidating opponents should stop. This has been happening since 1977 when then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal got a case registered against Congress leaders, including Zail Singh, but nothing came out of it and then Capt (Amarinder Singh) and Badal also registered cases against each other during their respective governments, he told a private television channel, disapproving of the practice.Randhawa, who had offered to quit the cabinet last month over the botched-up probe by the special investigation team (SIT) into the Kotkapura police firing, stated that Sidhu had met Amarinder twice after which the latter said he offered to take him back into the cabinet. “If there was any inquiry against him (Sidhu), the CM should have said he cannot make him (Sidhu) a minister,” he said.As Sidhu has been targeting the chief minister on social media daily over his handling of the sacrilege and police firing cases among other issues, the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau has fast-tracked its probe against the close associates of the Sidhu couple.Amid the Sidhu-Amarinder spat, Randhawa’s statement has come as much-needed support to the Amritsar (east) MLA at a time when seven other cabinet ministers have demanded his suspension from Congress for anti-party activities.Confirming his meeting with Sidhu and some other MLAs in Panchkula more than a week ago, Randhawa said the former minister told him that he would not quit Congress. “There have been meetings to save the Congress, which is on the back foot, since the high court order in the 2015 police firing case,” he said, denying any differences with the chief minister at the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-misuse-of-vigilance-bureau-must-stop-says-randhawa-101621195868982.html

But after the government’s direction, the health department started keeping tabs on such cases. The severity of infection was quite low in these people even as majority of them had received the first shot only,” he said. Dr Bhaskar added, “Punjab is administering vaccine on thousands of people daily and 300 people testing positive is not a big number. But we are still keeping a close watch on them.”So far, the state health department has inoculated 34 lakh eligible beneficiaries of which 6.7 lakh have received the second dose. HT talked to an 85-year-old Jalandhar-based woman who was found infected after getting both doses. She said, “Despite suffering from hypertension and age-related ailments, I did not develop any severe infection.”Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, medical superintendent Dr KD Singh, a microbiologist, said, “Since vaccines boost immunity, antibodies are develop in people after inoculation and help them to fight the deadly virus. Covid-19 is spreading through air and it attacks the lungs and other organs after entering the nose. People are not developing major lungs infection after testing positive for Covid-19 even if vaccinated with a single dose.”70 re-infection cases Seventy persons, who had tested positive for Covid-19 across the state last year but had recovered, have caught the infection again. “Low severity of the disease was found in them. Many did not develop antibodies even after recovery and can again catch the virus. The health department is monitoring their health conditions,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/300-test-positive-post-vaccination-in-punjab-in-a-fortnight-no-one-hospitalised-101621195571749.html

On Saturday, Joga village the district’s Bhikhi block was sealed for the next 10 days. The village with a population of about 11,000 has witnessed 10 Covid-19 deaths and 96 active cases since May 1. Nangal Kalan, Khiala Kalan, Akkanwali, Phapphre Bhai Ke villages of the district have also been declared containment zone since May 10. One urban pocket each in the towns of Mansa and Budladha have also been declared containment zones in the past week.Joga is among several villages from where the majority of adult rural population is participating in the ongoing farmers’ agitation at the Delhi borders. It is for the first time that villages in Mansa have been declared containment zone after the second wave of pandemic hit the state. An area is declared a containment zone after more than 15 cases of virus infections are detected there. “House-to-house screening has begun. Healthcare teams are trying to convince villagers to follow Covid guidelines. We were able to vaccinate nearly 500 residents and a section is hesitant to take jabs,” said Dr Hardeep Sharma, senior medical officer of Khiala Kalan public health centre.Khiala Kalan, which has 34 active cases, has reported two Covid-deaths in the last two weeks. On Sunday, two residents from the Khiala Kalan block, including a 27-year-old man, succumbed to the virus. As many 92 residents from the block were tested positive on Sunday.With four deaths and 298 cases reported on Sunday, the number of active cases in the district reached 3,299. Since May 1, the district reported 5,164 new cases of infection and witnessed 52 Covid deaths. Deputy commissioner Mohinder Pal said police are strictly enforcing the containment protocol and unwanted movement of people has been barred to contain infection spread. “Most villagers were visiting dharna sites at very regular intervals. As they are falling sick in considerable numbers, villagers are reluctant to reveal details of their travel and places they visited. Ideally, they should have isolated themselves for five days after visiting the venue of a large gathering,” said a district official.Mansa civil surgeon Dr Sukhwinder Singh said a section of people were falsely claiming that 5G radiation emitted from mobile phone towers is causing the second wave of Covid and people should refrain from such misinformation,” he said.On May 14, Haryana president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who has been mobilising farmers of Punjab and other states to join the dharna sites at the Delhi border, claimed in a Facebook video that deaths caused by 5G network were being attributed to the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-villages-in-punjab-s-mansa-district-sealed-in-a-week-amid-spurt-in-infections-deaths-101621195569491.html

Amarinder’s Eid (May 14) announcement had drawn a sharp reaction from UP CM Yogi Adityanath and BJP general secretary and Punjab leader Tarun Chugh, who described the decision divisive and communal. Reacting to the criticism, Amarinder had slammed Adityanath, terming it an attempt to incite “communal hatred”. “I congratulate the people of Malerkotla and thank chief minister @capt_amarinder ji for declaring #Malerkotla as a district. It is a rich tribute to the Nawab of Malerkotla Sher Mohammad Khan who protested the execution of the two Sahibzade (younger sons of 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh),” Parkash tweeted. In another tweet, the minister termed Malerkotla a symbol of communal harmony. People of Phagwara and all parties have been long demanding a district status for Phagwara, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/malerkotla-as-new-district-som-parkash-differs-with-yogi-punjab-bjp-leaders-hails-capt-101621195510447.html
17-05-2021||Other||Centre tells Punjab to release revised power tariff at earliest||The Union power ministry has told the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) and state additional chief secretary (power) to finalise the tariff for the current financial year at the earliest.PSERC held its last public hearing in the last week of April, but it is yet to announce the tariff for the current fiscal.Twenty states, including neighbouring Haryana and Himachal, have already declared their respective power tariffs for the current fiscal, while Punjab and some other states are yet to finalise the same. Reminding of its old directions, the Union ministry has sought completion of the process at the earliest.According to the norms, the new tariff should be declared before the end of the last fiscal.PSPCL’s flip-flop Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) filed its annual revenue requirement (ARR) petition in December 2020. However, it made a flip-flop as after asking for a tariff hike of 9%, it filed an amended ARR seeking rebate in the tariff — a move seen as an inference of the state government as assembly elections are due in the latter part of current fiscal.In its revised ARR, the PSPCL has proposed a 32% cut in domestic consumer tariff for those with less than 7KW connected load.Further, it proposed that cumulative revenue gap of ₹9,807 crore at the end of 2021-22 shall be treated as a regulatory asset that may be recovered over the next two to five years. A major chunk of revenue goes to fixed costs of the private thermal plants, but when the power demand dips after the paddy season, PSPCL is forced to pay the fixed cost even without drawing electricity.As per PSERC regulations, the regulatory asset shall have to be recovered within the next three financial years.Don’t create regulatory assets, states told In a letter issued on May 3 to the states, the Union ministry has also asked the latter not to create the regulatory assets.“The Punjab government charges 20% excise duty on the tariff which is more than ₹1.25 per unit. In case the state wants to give relief to a section of domestic consumers, it should reduce the excise duty for such category of consumers. It should not ask for regulatory assets which shall be passed on to the consumers at a later stage. It will give a major jolt to consumers after elections,” said VK Gupta, spokesperson of All India Power Engineers’ Federation. This implies that the burden on consumers has only been deferred to a future date.Moreover, PSPCL is to pay coal washing charges in two instalments to the private thermal plants at Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo.One instalment has already been paid and the second is to be given before month-end. This may be recovered by way of fuel charges.Pendency of arrears As per estimates, the power subsidy amount during 2021-22 is likely to be of the order of ₹17,000 crore, including pending arrears of ₹5,779 crore, whereas Punjab has earmarked only ₹10,621 crore for subsidy payment in its budget for 2021-22.The consistent pendency of arrears towards Punjab government is becoming the biggest threat to the survival of PSPCL.Meanwhile, a PSERC official said the new chairman has assumed the charge and has initiated the process of finalising the tariff, which likely to be announced by the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-tells-punjab-to-release-revised-power-tariff-at-earliest-101621195509496.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Stakeholders seek review of Centre-notified basmati seed varieties||Even as Punjab’s agriculture department has pegged a one-third increase in the area under aromatic basmati from 4.06 lakh hectares in the previous kharif season to 5.35 lakh hectares in the upcoming one, there is a lack of clarity over the number of varieties notified by the Union agriculture ministry.The sowing of aromatic variety grain begins in the first week of July, and currently, traders and farmers are arranging for the seeds.“Thirty-four varieties of the aromatic paddy have been notified by the union agriculture ministry which is creating lot confusion among farmers and millers. We need to discard such varieties which are not grown and have no commercial value,” suggested Ashok Sethi, director, Punjab Rice Exporters’ Association.According to Sethi, presently most popular and accepted variety in the international market is basmati 1121, both for parboiled and steamed rice. “It is recommended that genuine seeds authorised by the Basmati Export Development Foundation (BEDF) be made available to the rice growers,” he suggested.Concerns over falling quality Seeking a review of the list of basmati seed varieties after discussion with exporters, agricultural scientists and experts at Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Sethi raised the issue that certain seed producers outside the state have geographical indication tags for growing basmati.Giving example of the 90-day 1509 variety, introduced by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 2016, Sethi said the original seeds bore good results, but later due to cultivation at commercial levels, the grain quality turned out poor and during shelling, 50% was broken.Seed variety 1718 is also facing similar issues, said Sethi, suggesting scientists share characteristics of new seeds for quality and nutritional value analysis.Harpreet Singh, a basmati grower from Batala, said that farmers are reluctant to grow 1509-variety owing to the poor quality of seeds available.“Though it is a short duration variety, the grain quality has deteriorated over the years. The 1708 variety of ICAR, an improved version of PUSA-1121, has not been fully accepted by the farmers,” he said.Last season, this variety sold for ₹2,700 to ₹2,800 a quintal, and fetched higher rates in the previous years.Agri dept recommends PAU varieties State agriculture director SS Sidhu recommends basmati growers to adopt the varieties developed by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. “The PR varieties are the best as they are grown locally and are suitable in view of the weather and soil conditions,” he added. He asked Punjab and Haryana farmers to grow PR121, 126, 127, and 128 varieties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stakeholders-seek-review-of-centre-notified-basmati-seed-varieties-101621195508312.html

However, people in these age groups can be seen thronging vaccination centres in huge numbers, making it difficult for health authorities to arrange vaccine for all. It has been seen that the health staffers could not ask the beneficiaries to show any comorbid condition card or any other documents related to their disease before registering them for the vaccination.“The problem is not only persisting in Patiala but across the state. This is the main reason that Punjab exhausted one lakh doses of Covid vaccines in three days,” said a senior doctor.He added that the health teams could not deny vaccine when people in this age group walked in directly to get the jab.Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said the health teams have been instructed to follow strict guidelines issued by the government to entertain certain categories in the 18-44 age group.“The categories defined by the government are administered vaccination on priority basis. We are monitoring the situation on daily basis and try to cover maximum people under this age group,” Dr Singh said.People come with some health certificate along with them to get vaccinated, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-govt-orders-health-workers-in-punjab-vaccinating-all-in-18-44-age-group-101621194368446.html

He stressed the need to avoid the kind of situation prevailing in the villages of Uttar Pradesh and directed the health and rural development departments to lead the campaign with mobilisation of the community in the villages. “The entire staff should be utilised to spread awareness among the villagers on the dangers of Covid,” he said, adding that the health and wellness clinics should become the fulcrum, and community health officers, panchayats, school teachers, anganwadi and ASHA workers, village police officers, youth volunteers must be mobilised to steer the programme. The Guardians of Governance and the police force should work closely to make this programme a success, he said, adding that the idea is to spread awareness and dispel myths and also ensure adequate sampling and vaccination. Terming the casual attitude of the people towards symptoms like cold and cough, which they do not report timely, as the biggest issue, Amarinder called for early identification of the infected people and ensuring early treatment. Symptomatic persons should be given basic medicines like paracetamol and cough syrup, and vitamin C, at their doorsteps, he directed, and said they should be encouraged to get tested and supported in home isolation if they test positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-launches-covid-fateh-drive-to-tackle-pandemic-in-rural-areas-101621194188311.html

Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust, on Saturday performed the ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ of the temple which will come up in the eastern part of the city. Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and several seers were also present on the occasion. After ‘Bhoomi Pujan’, a seven- day ‘Sapta Chandi Yajna’, a Vedic ritual, also began for the end of the pandemic and removal of all hurdles in the construction of Ram Mandir. According to the trust, the temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha is being constructed for the ending of the pandemic and timely construction of Ram Mandir. “The idol of Lord Ganesha in this temple will be facing Ram Mandir. As the lord (Ganesha) is considered to be Vighnaharta (one who removes obstacles), He will help the country fight the pandemic and will also ensure timely construction of Ram Mandir,” said Champat Rai. Last month, the Ram Mandir construction committee started filling work of Ram Mandir’s foundation with the target of completing 1.25 lakh cubic metre dug-up ground at Ram Janmabhoomi by September end. During this filling process, around 44 layers of 300 mm each will be laid. Thereafter, each layer will be compressed with simple and vibrating rollers. “The vibrating roller will generate vibrations to make the temple’s foundation strong and will ensure maximum compression. After each rolling process, the 300 mm layer is likely to be a compressed to around 250 mm,” said Rai. Larsen & Toubro is carrying out construction work of Ram Mandir. The Tata Consulting Engineers is working as project management consultant and is assisting Larsen & Toubro in constructions work of the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ram-mandir-trust-to-also-construct-a-ganesha-temple-in-ayodhya-101621194068769.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Restrictions extended till May 31 as Punjab continues to record high CFR||Chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday ordered extension of all restrictions imposed to contain Covid-19 spread till May 31, with directions for strict enforcement of the curbs. The decision comes as the state continues to record a high positivity rate of 13.1% for the last week and a case fatality rate at 2.4%.The CM said deputy commissioners will continue to determine the opening of shops in a staggered manner and enforce other restrictions to check the spread of Covid, particularly in the rural belt. Depending on the local conditions, the DCs can make suitable amendments, added the CM. He asked the district administrations to ensure food kits for those in quarantine. Reviewing the state’s Covid-19 situation at a meeting, he said while the restrictions so far had shown results, with some decline in day-to-day positivity and cases coming down from around 9,000 to 6,000, there was a need to extend the same due to the high positivity rate of 13.1% as of the May 9 to May 15 period, with case fatality rate (CFR) standing at 2.4.Raising concerns over the spread of the new fungal disorder associated with Covid, the CM said that there’s need to increase surveillance. Dr KK Talwar, who heads the government’s expert group on Covid, termed the fungal infection as a serious issue, which could be attributed to either high use of steroids or use of un-distilled water in oxygen. The CM also directed the district administrations to investigate complaints of patients being fleeced by some private hospitals, warning that these would be shut down if they continue to indulge in malpractices. On the availability of oxygen, the CM asked the health department to monitor the situation, adding that his government had arranged PSA plants and was expecting over 2,500 oxygen concentrators this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/restrictions-extended-till-may-31-as-punjab-continues-to-record-high-cfr-101621194068314.html

This situation is especially true in the case of Agra in western Uttar Pradesh and in Prayagraj in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Dataram Kushwaha, 62, resident of Holipura village in Agra, says, “We have to travel to Bhadroli about seven kilometres from our village for the medicines. And if it is not available at Bhadroli, we travel another 11 kilometres to the town to buy them.” Ramu Sharma, a shopowner in Anwal Kheda, a suburban town 14 kilometres from Agra city, agrees that villagers come to his shop from about 10 to 15 kilometres away to purchase medicines that the doctors prescribe. “There are other shops, too, in the town. Villagers come by cycles or other means to get them,” adds Sharma.Non-availability of medicines often paves the way for quacks to step in. “Primary health centres don’t have all the medicines that are required and thus villagers have to rely on medical shops in Bah, Jarar, Bateshwar and Jaitpur,” says Bharat Sharma, a resident of Bah town in Agra. In Prayagraj, people in villages like Sujani, Kotar Harbari, Bisaura, Renga and Kauhat and others in the trans-Yamuna area, too, need to cover vast distances to reach medical stores in search of medicines.“Many medicines like Azithromycin, Doxycycline, Vitamin C tablets etc are unavailable in medical stores located at Jari, Naribari, Laltara and Khiri, which is a major problem. We often have to get the medicines from Prayagraj city located almost 50 km from here,” says Vishnu Tiwari, resident of Kotar village in Prayagraj. At Mauaima, a town area around 35 km from Prayagraj city, one can get some medicines at the printed rate but not of one’s own choice or the one recommended by the doctor. Most medical stores here are offering alternatives, claiming the drug salts to be the same as the one sought by the consumer, locals say. Away from Mauaima town area, there is a high demand for medicines at nearby medical stores such as Ivermectin, Azithromycin, Vitamin C, Paracetamol, Doxycycline—the usual medicines being prescribed by doctors to treat Covid-19 infected patients. When asked, almost all medical stores’ proprietors and chemists say the wholesale suppliers are not giving medicines according to their demand and so they are finding it tough to make the medicines available to the people. Paracetamol, Vitamin C, Azithromycin are not available in some places while in others the chemists are agreeing to give only four tablets of paracetamol when 10 are sought, says Mohd Akhtar, a resident of Mauaima gram panchayat area. A chemist Indresh, who runs a shop in Mauaima town area, says stocks of that medicines like Fabiflu and Zincovit are also very low.Though medicines are available at bigger chemist shops in Phulpur tehsil, also 35 km from Sangam city in the trans-Ganga area of the Prayagraj district, one has to stand in long queues, especially during the morning and evening when most consumers come in a bid to avoid the afternoon heat. “One has to visit multiple medical stores to get all the medicines he/she needs,” says Indu Verma, a local. Some locals like Radhey Lal of Akdala village allege that some of the medical store owners are overcharging for medicines in great demand to treat Covid-19 infection. The locals echo a similar complaint in Bara tehsil, around 40 km from Prayagaj city. Prayagraj district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami says that supply of all essential items, including medicines, is being ensured in both urban and rural areas despite the partial corona curfew restrictions. “No shortage will be allowed to occur. Efforts are also on to crack down on anyone who indulges in black-marketing, stock-piling or selling medicines over the fixed price,” he adds. In the underdeveloped Sonbhadra district of eastern UP, social worker Jagat Vishwakarma, a resident of Faripan area, says ailing people who visit the community health centre (CHC) in Myorpur block of Sonbhadra are given medicines by the doctor. Dr Ashish Srivastava, medical superintendent of Myorpur CHC, says, “The patients, who come to the CHC for treatment, are attended and medicines are given to them as per need. We have a sufficient stock of medicines for common diseases and those which are given to the people having symptoms of Covid.” Pradhans, ANMs should be engaged for rural medicine stock: ExpertDr Ved Prakash, head of the department of pulmonary critical care medicine at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), said gram pradhans, ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives) and ASHA workers (accredited social health activists) should be engaged to keep a stock of medicines in rural areas so that patients in need are not deprived.“In rural areas, there is no need to test all. If a few cases have come in a village, then all fever cases should be given attention as Covid patients. Any person with symptoms should be made to walk 500 metres or 700 steps in 6 minutes (walk test). If they are unable to do, they should be treated as patients of chest infection with adequate dose of steroids,” said Dr Ved Prakash.He said, “Treatment in village should be aggressive and not gradual as such a treatment methodology can allow the infection to grow and bring complexities. Each fever case should start the protocol medicine as soon as fever comes while those unable to do the walk test should be provided with steroids.”He said that doctors in the rural areas were being told to make this the treatment protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/getting-much-needed-medicines-an-uphill-task-in-rural-pockets-101621193768852.html

17-05-2021||Chandigarh||IG Naunihal to head new SIT on Behbal Kalan firing case||A month after IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh proceeded on voluntary retirement, the state government constituted a new three-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing case in which two Sikh protestors were killed. The new SIT will be headed by inspector general IG) of police, Ludhiana range, Naunihal Singh, who will be assisted by Mohali senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh and Faridkot SSP Swarandeep Singh. The new SIT will probe two cases connected with the Behbal Kalan firing incident. One case was registered against protestors on October 14, 2015, while the second against the cops on October 21, 2015.Two youths were killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12. Police had also opened fire on protesters at Kotkapura, leaving many injured, the same day. In its order dated May 15, a copy of which is with HT, the bureau of investigation (BOI) said that the two cases registered in connection with Behbal Kalan firing incident at Bajakhana police station were entrusted to sub-team of SIT headed by IG (retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. “In view of voluntary retirement of Kunwar Vijay, the investigation of these two FIRs will now be completed by SIT comprising IG Naunihal Singh, SSP Satinder Singh and SSP Swarandeep Singh. The new SIT may seek assistance of other persons and experts to complete the investigation expeditiously and submit the final report,” it reads.Kunwar Vijay was reportedly upset after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the probe reports submitted by the SIT probing the Kotkapura firing case, and ordered the government to form a new probe team. Kunwar Vijay’s voluntary retirement request was accepted with effect from April 15.In 2018, the state government constituted an SIT led by then bureau of investigation director Prabodh Kumar to investigate Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing cases on the recommendations of Justice Ranjit Singh Commission. Two IG- rank officers, Arun Pal Singh and Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, SSP Satinder Singh and then commandant police recruits training centre (PRTC) Bhupinder Singh were the other members of the SIT. Initially, IG Kunwar Vijay was appointed to probe the Kotkapura firing case, while Behbal Kalan firing case was entrusted to IG Arun Pal Singh and SSP Satinder Singh. In March 2019, SIT filed its first chargesheet naming former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma as accused in the case. This chargesheet was filed by the SIT team led by Satinder Singh (who is now member of new SIT), which was working separately from Kunwar Vijay’s team. After SIT probe remained standstill in Behbal Kalan firing case for a year, the investigation of this case was also entrusted to Kunwar Vijay in June 2020 after which SIT made several arrests and named police officers, including former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal, as accused in this case. Apart from Saini and Umranangal, the SIT had named former Moga SSP Sharma, SP Bikramjit Singh, former Bajakhana SHO Amarjit Singh Kular, Faridkot-based lawyer Sohail Singh Brar and Moga-based car dealer Pankal Bansal as accused. While one accused, inspector Pardeep Singh, has turned approver in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ig-naunihal-to-head-new-sit-on-behbal-kalan-firing-case-101621193648215.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Six dera followers arrested for 2015 Bargari sacrilege||The Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT), led by inspector general of police (IGP), border range, Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, on Sunday arrested six Dera Sacha Sauda followers in connection with sacrilege incident at Bargari village in Faridkot district that had sparked statewide protests in 2015.Confirming the arrests, an SIT official, not wanting to be named, said the accused were identified as Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, Nishan Singh, Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, and Pardeep Kumar, all resident of Kotkapura, Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village and Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village.Sukhjinder, Shakti, Ranjit and Baljeet were also arrested in another sacrilege case in which two derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24-25, 2015. Both cases were registered at the Bajakhana police station.The SIT probe has found that the accused had scattered the torn pages of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib), which was stolen from the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara on October 12, 2015, at Bargari. The derogatory posters were also pasted by them near the Bargari gurdwara, claimed the SIT.The accused will be produced in the Faridkot court on Monday for securing their police remand, said the SIT official. In 2018, the Khatra-led SIT had arrested more than 20 followers of the Sirsa-based dera, including Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019, in connection with two other sacrilege incidents and rioting in Punjab in 2015. The SIT claims the dera followers had confessed to the crime.The Akali-BJP government, led by Parkash Singh Badal, had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The first case pertained to the theft of the bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village near Kotkapura in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. The second was the putting up of derogatory posters at Bargari village on September 25, 2015; and the third was the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the bir were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari on October 12, 2015. In July 2019, the CBI had filed a closure report in three sacrilege cases.The Congress government, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, however, took back the cases from the CBI and handed over the probe to the SIT led by Khatra. In July last year, the SIT named jailed Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, national committee members of dera --- Sandeep Bretta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri --- as accused and filed a chargesheet against seven dera followers in a case relating to the theft of the “bir”.In January this year, Punjab and Haryana high court asked the state government to replace the head of the SIT probing 2015 sacrilege cases, after which IG Parmar was appointed as the new chief. The HC had also directed CBI to handover all the case files and asked SIT to file a supplementary chargesheet after taking into account of the evidence filed by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-dera-followers-arrested-for-2015-bargari-sacrilege-101621193468363.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Anaemia primary cause of 3-year-old Covid patient’s death in Ludhiana: Civil surgeon||A day after a three-year-old Covid patient died, health authorities confirmed acute anaemia as the cause of death.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwallia Gill said a team of doctors conducted a review and established that the girl, Mansi, died of acute anaemia. However, as she was also Covid positive, she was buried following safety protocols on Saturday evening.She added that the child’s parents had been tested and found negative for the virus.Unable to come to terms with the loss of his youngest child, Ram Kumar, 27, who hails from Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh and lives in Harbanspura, also has his depleted bank balance riding heavy on his mind.The tragedy-struck family spent all their savings in just a week since the child was found positive on May 8. “I used to earn ₹9,000 a month at a shop, but lost my job two months ago amid the pandemic. My savings were not enough for my daughter’s treatment, so donations from philanthropists helped raise ₹1.67 lakh, but still she could not be saved,” said an inconsolable Kumar. “Her health deteriorated on May 8 and through some tests we learnt that her haemoglobin had dropped, which had resulted in water retention and swelling. I took her to Krishna Charitable Hospital, where she tested positive for Covid, which rose the treatment cost,” he added.“On Saturday morning, she was arm wrestling with me and asked me and my wife for toffees. We were hoping that she will be discharged soon, but suddenly her condition worsened and she passed away in front of our eyes,” the distraught father rued.Heart-rending scenes were witnessed at the crematorium in Civil Lines where the three-year-old was buried in the presence of her parents and her five-year-old brother, who kept trying to rush towards his younger sister’s body wrapped in a protective suit.Burying a three-year-old was possibly the most difficult task he had ever performed, said Mandeep Kumar Guddu, a worker at the crematorium, who has performed over 1,000 last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anaemia-primary-cause-of-3-year-old-covid-patient-s-death-in-ludhiana-civil-surgeon-101621193289394.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing case: Enough evidence against Badals, but they are being protected, says Sidhu||Congress leader and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday claimed that there was enough evidence against the Badals in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case, but they were being protected. Responding to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s statement asking him and others to share evidence they claim to have on sacrilege cases, Sidhu said he had shared a video footage in public domain about three years ago, which showed the role of police acting at the behest of the Badals. “Enough Cognizable Evidence available against Badals, says Justice (Retd.) Ranjit Singh Inquiry Commission Report. In Sept 2018, I shared in Public Domain, statements by Doctors, Ex-DGP & Civil Administration that prove actions at Kotkapura Chowk were consentual with then CM (sic),” he posted on Twitter with a nine-minute video of his statement made at that time. He further said that this CCTV footage was hidden from Justice (Retd) Zora Singh Inquiry Commission during the Badal regime, but was later dug up by Justice Ranjit Singh. “I brought this footage to public domain, which shows role of police, acting on behest of the Badals You are guilty but being protected! (sic),” he said in another tweet. On Saturday, Sukhbir had asked the Congress leaders, including Sidhu, and their “open and secret allies” claiming to have concrete proof on who planned, sponsored and executed the unforgivable sacrilege against Guru Granth Sahib to publicly place that evidence before the Khalsa panth, court, SIT and the people in general. Sidhu has been targeting his own government ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the SIT report in the police firing case last month. He has also accused chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of shielding the Badal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-case-enough-evidence-against-badals-but-they-are-being-protected-says-sidhu-101621193288126.html

Manoj Dass, a social worker based in Zirakpur, said: “For the past three days, no camp has been organised for any age group here. We are approaching the authorities, but to no avail.

17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Protest over Khattar’s visit: Farmers block major highways after clashing with cops in Hisar||Rohtak/Karnal/Ambala/Chandigarh: Hours after Haryana Police resorted to lathicharge and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse a group of farmers who tried to march towards the venue where Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was scheduled to inaugurate a Covid hospital in Hisar on Sunday, farmers blocked major state and national highways across the state. While farmers claimed that over 50 of them sustained injuries in the lathicharge, a government spokesperson said over 20 policemen, including a DSP and five women cops, were also injured. Protesters blocked the Delhi-Chandigarh National Highway 44 at Bastara in Karnal, the Hisar-Chandigarh highway in Kaithal, Kurukshetra-Pehowa-Paitala, Kurukshetra-Kaithal highway, NH-44 on Ambala-Patiala border , NH-73 on Ambala-Yamunanagar highway and toll plazas in Karnal, Panipat and Shahbad, for two hours from 5pm to 7pm, forcing the authorities to divert traffic to link roads. In Hisar, police claimed some farmers hurled stones at them when they tried to stop them. Five police vehicles were also damaged by the protesters, they said. Miscreants broke the barricades: Cops “The miscreants broke the barricade installed on the canal bridge and threw it into the water. They also attacked DSP Abhimanyu Lohan under the Jindal overbridge. The injured cops are being treated at the civil hospital,” a police spokesperson said. “Upon entering Chaudhary Devi Lal Sanjivani Hospital complex, the miscreants tried to run a tractor over policemen, thereby injuring them,” the spokesperson said, adding that five police vehicles were also damaged. “The miscreants tried to enter the Covid hospital even after the inauguration was over,” he added. Protesters also blocked the movement of police vehicles and said they will continue to protest until the farmer leaders asked them to disperse. “Why did the CM have to visit Hisar to inaugurate the hospital, he could have done it virtually,” asked Haryana BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni. “The police resorted to lathi-charge and used tear gas shells, besides using plastic bullets to disperse the farmers in Hisar. Many farmers received injuries,” Charuni said, alleging that despite the state restricting gatherings hundreds of people were allowed to gather for the hospital inauguration. Next course of action Hisar meet: Charuni Charuni said the farm leaders had called a meeting in Hisar to decide further course of action. “ We will clear the road for ambulances, military convoys, fire brigade and tankers carrying oxygen. Farmers from Ramayana toll plaza will start marching towards the office of the Hisar IG and if our grievances are not accepted, we will start a dharna outside police stations across the state,” Charuni added. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said they had asked the Hisar IG to release 85 farmers detained by the police. Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said that traffic had been diverted from the NH 44 via link roads. He said that there were no reports of violence, but the police have been deployed to deal with any law-and-order situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protest-over-khattar-s-visit-farmers-block-major-highways-after-clashing-with-cops-in-hisar-101621192509499.html
17-05-2021||Chandigarh||Meet Panchkula MC staffer who has overseen cremation of over 700 Covid-19 victims||By 1 in the afternoon, 14 bodies are halfway through cremation, five have just been set ablaze, three more pyres are being prepared, while two bodies covered in white lay at some distance.At the gate of the cremation ground in Sector 28, Panchkula, one more body of a Covid-19 victim lies in an ambulance as the driver asks directions to the graveyard.The flow of bodies does not end here. And the supervisor, Surinder Singh, walks among the corpses and pyres without fear…. or even a PPE kit.Singh, and his team members, say working with a PPE kit on, amid the heat and flames rising from the pyres, gets too difficult.“In March 2020, I cremated the first body of a woman who died of Covid-19. Since then, I have been assigned the task of cremating all Covid-19 bodies,” says the 28-year-old staffer of the Panchkula municipal corporation (MC).Since March last year, Singh has helped cremate over 700 bodies, which belonged not only to Panchkula residents but also to those who came from other states to get treatment here but lost the battle to Covid-19. Of these 700, as many as 200 were created in the month of May alone, Singh adds.A day in the life of a crematorAt 8am, Singh leaves from his house in Mohali and reaches the mortuary of the Sector-6 civil hospital in Panchkula. After taking the details of the corpses, he calls their families and coordinates for cremation or burial. He then visits other hospitals in Panchkula, gathering details of others who have died of the virus.While commuting from one hospital to another, Singh arranges for ambulances to ferry the dead to the cremation ground, meanwhile instructing his team to prepare the pyres.“Last year, there were only one or two cremations a day, or weeks would pass without one. But now we are cremating at least 20 bodies a day,” says Singh, whose phone doesn’t stop ringing.Singh earns only ₹14,000 a month, but has been working 24x7 without an off for a year. “I do get stressed at times so I pray. Initially, I was unable to sleep, but now I feel numb. I have small kids, elderly parents and a wife, but it’s a service and I cannot say no to it,” he says.“I don’t even feel like eating here. People are dying, how can one eat?” asks Singh, who reaches home by 9pm every day.A man in white, who introduces himself as an army officer and one of the family members of a victim, is full of praises for Singh: “I have never seen such a dedicated man. He is on duty 24x7.”‘Hasn’t taken off in a year’The assistant sanitary inspector, Ajay Kumar Sood, who is also the in-charge, says: “Surinder has not taken a single off in the last one year. He is a very dedicated and hardworking employee.”Former MC commissioner RK Singh says: “The team is very dedicated. During these tough times, we have been holding meetings to boost their morale and how they should work without getting emotionally impacted.”Last year, four helpers were assigned to Singh; the number was reduced to two, but it has again been increased to six. One of them is Rahul, a 27-year-old resident of Gandhi Colony, Panchkula, who has also been working here since the pandemic began. A daily wager and father to three daughters, Rahul says that it is work, which has to be done: “If we won’t, then who will?”Wearing only N-95 masks, Surinder and Rahul get up to burn the two bodies in white, that have been awaiting their turn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/meet-panchkula-mc-staffer-who-has-overseen-cremation-of-over-700-covid-19-victims-101621192389818.html

Subsequently between May 9-15, with 4,496 cases, the tests dipped to 20,326.The central government has advised states and UTs with over 10% positivity rate to continue with “stringent containment” even if they are witnessing a declining trend in the pandemic.Chandigarh’s weekly positivity rate has been above 20% for the last five weeks suggesting that every fifth person being tested has contracted the infection.Former director of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and health adviser to the Punjab government, Dr KK Talwar, said, “Fewer tests mean the real number of positive cases will not come to the fore. In Punjab, the positivity rate has declined without any decline in the number of tests. The indicator of positivity rate suitably suggests the manner in which the number of tests should be conducted.”Former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER, Dr Rajesh Kumar, said, “Testing levels should remain high so that cases are detected and isolated at the earliest. This will stop the infection from spreading and bring the pandemic in control. Even though it appears that the infection spread is being controlled, more contacts should be brought under the ambit of testing. Testing levels should not drop at this crucial juncture.”Dip in testing due to lockdown restrictions: AdmnAuthorities, however, say that the dip in testing levels can be linked to the restrictions owing to the lockdown, which should have resulted in a decreased demand for testing.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “The lockdown measures have resulted in control of the infection transmission, which has resulted in lesser testing. However, the testing levels should not drop and we will improve them further.”UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that the dip, of around 500 tests daily, was from non-targeted testing: “There is no compromise on testing of contacts and those with symptoms. The decrease in tests is from the proportion that is randomly done and no case in which there is a minute suspicion is being denied the facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/testing-levels-drop-by-20-amid-raging-pandemic-in-chandigarh-101621192388731.html

A doctor’s prescription and a refundable security of ₹25,000, either by draft or cheque made out to the Red Cross Society, are mandatory. The applicant will be informed through phone within 12 hours if the application is accepted. The concentrator can be procured from the Red Cross Bhawan between 9am and 5pm, and patients can also contact the helplines 94173-76655, 98784-50219 and 81465-55493.The deputy commissioner said the concentrators will prove useful in the treatment of patients with mild symptoms and help reduce the caseload on hospitals.Further, on the advice of a seven-member committee of doctors, hospitals have been allowed to give oxygen cylinders to cured patients for post-infection concerns. The DC said the administration will supply the oxygen to the hospitals as per demand, adding that Ludhiana had ample supply of the life-saving gas currently.He was accompanied by additional deputy commissioner (D) Sandeep Kumar and civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oxygen-concentrator-bank-started-in-ludhiana-for-covid-patients-at-home-101621192268769.html

First detected in India last October and described in late March by the misnomer “double mutant”, it was classified as a “variant of concern” globally by WHO last Monday.“Reports of sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from 23 nasopharyngeal swab samples of Covid-19 patients sent from PGIMER were received on May 13 from NCDC, New Delhi. The presence of the double mutant B.1.617 variant having the signature mutations L452R and E484Q has been confirmed in 22% (5/23) of the samples after sequencing,” said Dr Jagat Ram.Vaccine-induced antibodies are less potent in neutralising this variant, and the surge in cases during the second wave of the pandemic has somewhat been attributed to it, he said, adding that it has been found in more than 40 countries.Of the other samples, the UK variant B.1.1.7, which is also a “variant of concern” and is associated with high transmissibility was found in 39% (9/23) samples. Earlier in April, too, as many as 70% of the 60 samples sent by the PGIMER for genome sequencing turned positive for this variant. “Considering the high transmission rates of the new variants, citizens should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and frequently using sanitiser or washing hands,” said Dr Jagat Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/double-mutant-covid-variant-found-in-22-pgimer-samples-101621192100334.html
17-05-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad administration plans paediatric ICU ward for children||Ghaziabad: Anticipating another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ghaziabad administration has planned to set up small paediatric intensive care units(PICU) wards, having five beds each, in both private and government hospitals for treatment of children. According to official records obtained from the district health department, about 677 children upto the age of 10 were infected with Covid-19 between April 1 to May 13 this year. While reviewing the situation, the Uttar Pradesh government appointed IAS Senthil Pandian C as the nodal officer and gave directions to the hospitals to come up with such wards. “The paediatric ICU wards will come up in major private and government hospitals, with five beds each, that will be reserved for the treatment of children who require admission, in case they get infected,” said Pandian. The two government hospitals on the list also include Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital and government- acquired Santosh Medical College. In this context, the UP chief minister also gave directions on Saturday to all district hospital and medical colleges in the state to come up with PICU on priority basis . “The CM directed that creation of PICU and training of staff, like paediatricians, technicians and medical staff, should go on simultaneously. He also directed that two community health centres in each district should also come up with PICU and separate staff should be made available for their operation. All the women hospitals in each district should be roped in for treatment of women and children,” read a statement issued by the chief minister’s office on Saturday. According to state control room figures, the number of active cases stood at 309 on March 31, which spiked to 6,645 on April 30. As on Saturday (May 15) , there were 4,320 active cases. “One of the major factors that has helped bring cases under control is starting early treatment and distributing a medical kit, containing essential medicines required in Covid-19 treatment, free of cost. About 60,000 medical kits have been distributed so far. We are also taking other initiatives to control the infection in the rural areas,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey. The kit distribution, which started on April 27, sees around 5,000 disbursal per day on an average. It contains prescription, along with medicines for patients having symptoms and also for those staying in home-isolation. To help Covid-19 patients in rural areas, the administration has also decided to open up oxygen cylinder refilling facilities at Dasna, Loni, Modinagar, Muradnagar and Khoda. The Ghaziabad municipal corporation is already providing the refilling facility to patients with as many as 1,543 cylinders refilled and handed over to patients between May 5 and May 14. “Similar facilities, each equipped to refill 25-30 cylinders, will also come up at the local body offices at Dasna, Loni, Muradnagar and Khoda. We have also decided to open referral facilities at Muradnagar, Loni, Dasna and Modinagar with 25-30 beds in the first batch. The facilities will be made operational in the next two to three days,” said Krishna Karunesh, officiating district magistrate. Karunesh added efforts are also on to identify panchayat clusters in bigger villages where isolation centres with 5-10 beds can come up and oxygen cylinders can be placed for patients. In rural areas, April has seen the maximum cases with 644 in Loni, 451 in Modinagar, 445 in Muradnagar, 110 in Khoda and 57 in Bhojpur,besides 406 in Dasna.The Covid-19 cases have increased further in the rural area so far in May. The data compiled for the first 11 days of May by the health department indicates that there were 262 cases in Loni, 557 in Modinagar, 480 in Muradnagar, 71 in Khoda and 80 in Bhojpur besides 356 in Dasna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-administration-plans-paediatric-icu-ward-for-children-101621191127548.html
17-05-2021||Other||Readying paediatric ICU beds to tackle possible third wave of Covid-19: Adityanath||Noida: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday announced that all districts in the state will be equipped with adequate paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds to provide exclusive care and treatment to children needing treatment for the coronavirus disease. The CM’s statement comes in the wake of predictions that a third wave of Covid-19 is possible which will likely affect children. Addressing the media at the NTPC Power Management Institute in Noida’s Sector 16A, Adityanath said his government is all set to tackle the new wave, like the state handled encephalitis cases in the state. “From 1977 to 2017, the average annual fatalities due to encephalitis were nearly 1,500. But, it was due to proper coordination between all departments concerned that the same have been reduced now to double digits. The training of health officials for working in PICUs has already begun and very soon, all government hospitals, community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCs) will have an adequate number of PICU beds,” he said. Replying to a query about “inaccessibility” of Co-WIN portal, especially in rural areas, the CM said that the government has decided to inoculate people in rural areas through common service centres (CSCs). “The staff of these CHCs will go door-to-door and compile their details with the district vaccination department, so as to set up a vaccination centre in their vicinity. It can be CHCs, PHCs, schools, panchayat buildings or any public place – which have waiting, vaccination and observation rooms,” the CM said. He also said that pre-bids have already been floated to ensure 100% vaccine coverage in the state. “As many as six companies have turned up with some queries, which are being replied to by officials concerned. We’ve so far given over 1.5 crore doses of vaccines in the first and second jabs to beneficiaries. Compliance of the central government’s directions in inoculating people over 45 years of age has also yielded positive results, as wastage of vaccines has now reduced to two-three per cent, as compared to 22% wastage during the drive of healthcare workers. From Monday, a massive vaccination drive for people of 18 to 44 years will begin in 22 districts,” he said. He added that taking serious note of post-Covid diseases such as black fungus that damage the eyes, the health department has been asked to provide all essential drugs to every hospital in the state. Laying stress on the need to create awareness about testing, sanitisation and social distancing among people in rural areas, Adityanath said that during his visits to remote villages since May 7 in many districts, it was found that people are hesitant to go to CHCs and PHCs for Covid-19 testing. “The job of rapid response teams (RRT) begins here and they have adroitly handled the situation there. The state has 58,055 village panchayats and over 1,200 wards for over one lakh revenue villages. The vigilance committee of the respective area screens the patients with ILI symptoms, besides asymptomatic ones. They make their list and provide it to the integrated Covid command centre (ICCC) in their respective district headquarters, as well as to the people’s representative. On the basis of this list, the RRT conducts testing in those areas. The ICCC sends the updated details of testing, home isolation, hospitalisation to the CM helpline thrice a day,” he said. He said that apart from conducting door-to-door rapid antigen testing, they have also distributed over three lakh medical kits, comprising all essential medicines, in these areas. “As a result of this, while the case positivity rate (CPR) of the state has come down to five per cent from 22%, the case fatality rate (CFR) is around one per cent. In terms of testing, UP leads with 4.5 crore testing – which is much ahead of three crore testing in Maharashtra. It is the effort of our officials that despite having a huge population – about whom the experts had predicted that there would be nearly one lakh fresh caseload every day mid-April to mid-May, UP recorded only 10,600 cases on May 16. Till date, we have 1.63 lakh active cases, out of which only 42,000 are in hospitals. The remaining are under home isolation and are being monitored by the doctors,” he said. Giving the details of beds in the state, the chief minister said that at present the state has 80,000 beds, including 72,000 in government hospitals. “Besides, we have 2,200 ambulances and 350 life-saving ambulances for coronavirus disease patients,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/readying-paediatric-icu-beds-to-tackle-possible-third-wave-of-covid-19-adityanath-101621191067540.html

The CM also focussed on increasing the role of “nigrani samitis” in both rural and urban areas.The nigrani samitis are groups of officials, local councillors and other public representatives who operate in respective areas to deal with Covid-related issues. Speaking at the district headquarters in Ghaziabad, the CM said that during the first wave of Covid last year, there were apprehensions that would be one lakh active cases in the state in August and September.“However, with collective efforts, we were able to control the upper limit of active cases to a maximum of about 67,000, while the most cases seen in a day were 7,200. In the first wave, there was more need of L1 category Covid beds, which we created to the tune of 1.16 lakh, while 23,000 beds of L2/L3 category were also created,” the CM said. The L1, L2 and L3 hospitals were created last year as part of the UP government’s three-tier structure to deal with Covid cases. The L1 hospitals are generally for asymptomatic cases while L2 hospitals deal with patients having mild to moderate symptoms. The L3 hospitals deal with severe Covid cases. The CM said that experts had opined that after April 25, UP will see one lakh new cases per day. “But again we have been able to control the second wave and the peak is also under control. Now, we have the capacity to conduct two-and-a-half to three lakh tests per day and demand for L1 category beds is low. So, during this wave, we created another 80,000 L2/L3 category beds as needed,” the CM added. He said that on April 24, there were 38,055 cases per day in UP, which was the highest in this wave, and now the state has about 10,682 daily cases (as of May 16, as per state control room records). He added that the state launched an aggressive strategy of tracing, testing and treating which has reduced the number of active cases. “We conducted 1.25 lakh tests per day in March and at present this capacity has been doubled. We are also working on a plan for creation of separate wards for post-Covid complications for recovered patients and their treatment will be done free-of-cost. To increase the supply of oxygen, nine oxygen plants are being constructed in Ghaziabad and overall, 35 oxygen plants are being constructed in Meerut division (including Ghaziabad and GB Nagar),” the CM added. He said that he visited Bhowapur village in Ghaziabad during his visit and said the focus is now on rural areas where people from low-income groups, Divyangs and others will be able to get their vaccination registration done through common service centres. The district officials said that the CM directed that the works done by nigrani samitis – about 447 in Ghaziabad including 161 in rural areas – should continue. “The CM has given directions that the works should continue. We have also decided that the nigrani samitis will now speak daily to the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre and will also hold daily meetings and the decisions will be documented on a daily basis. We are also roping in our booth level officers to filter out suspected cases and these efforts will continue,” Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, said.The officials of the health department said that the CM also stressed that the free-of-cost medical kit distribution should also be done through the nigrani samitis who are in direct touch with local residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/second-wave-of-covid-19-under-control-says-up-cm-101621191007509.html

The committee comprises of leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar, Ashish Shelar and Narendra Patil, among others. Patil said that BJP was also appointing a committee of legal experts to “expose” MVA government over its faulty handling of the reservation case. The party has also announced to support protests by the community and has warned the state government that the stir would be intensified once the second wave of Covid-19 subsides. Patil, after the first meeting of the expert committee on Sunday, said that the party would back Marathas with full strength. “After the reservation was scrapped by the top court, the community has been feeling helpless. But our party will stand by them in full support. MVA government is expecting protests by the community to die down because of the pandemic and lockdown. BJP will support and participate in the protest without our banner or political agenda,” he said. Blaming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) for the “poor handling” of the reservation case in the Apex court, BJP leaders said that the 569-page SC judgment has pointed out to many loopholes left behind by the state government during the hearing. “The Congress and NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) never intended to give the reservation to Marathas. Their government has systematically murdered the reservation given by the previous [BJP-led] Devendra Fadnavis government. Our government could safeguard it in the Bombay high court and even for a long period, in SC too. It was because of the inept handling by MVA government that the reservation has been struck down,” Patil said. He also demanded that the state government file a review petition in SC, requesting the Apex court a reconsideration of its verdict on the Gaikwad Commission report and 50% cap on reservation. He said that if the state government failed to do so, it will have to again attend the exercise of proving the backwardness of the community by constituting a new commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-bjp-panel-to-review-verdict-warns-maharashtra-govt-of-stir-101621190407540.html

According to the police officers, the woman in her complaint stated that in 2018, she had met the accused on social media and began chatting with him online. The two became friends and the accused later invited her to his Kandivli (East) house on the pretext of discussing a family problem, the woman further told the police. On reaching his house, the man told the complainant that his wife had left him after they had a fight earlier that day. “The accused then prepared tea for the survivor which was spiked,” said a police officer. After she lost her consciousness, the accused raped her and shot a video of the act. The police said, when the woman regained consciousness, she realised that she was naked. When she confronted the accused, the man showed her the video and threatened to release it online if she filed a complaint. For the past three years, the accused had allegedly been raping the woman at various places by threatening to post her video. On Saturday, when the woman could not take it anymore, she approached Samata Nagar police and registered a complaint against the accused. Based on the woman’s statement, the police booked the man for rape and blackmail under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and are verifying the case. “We have registered the case and are investigating to find out the sequence of events. We have seized two phones from the accused and have given it to the forensic team to extract the video and other details, such as the couple’s chats, etc,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/35yearold-mumbai-man-held-for-raping-online-friend-for-three-years-101621190347577.html

On Sunday, the survivors gathered at the building premises, as they lost their shelter and have no place to go. They were joined by the families of the victims. Among them was the family of Milind Parche who, along with his 60-year-old grandmother died in the incident. “Milind and his grandmother were sleeping when the incident took place. He loved to cook and was very attached to his family, especially to me. The family is shattered due to his demise,” said the 12-year-old’s aunt Reshma Parche, 28.The roof of the fourth floor flat of the ground-plus-five-storey building – which was 27 years old – had collapsed on Saturday around 1.30pm. Milind’s parents, elder brother and three other family members were rescued from the balcony of their first floor flat by the Ulhasnagar fire brigade team. Rohit Lokhande, 15, who was on the fourth floor of the building with his 5-year-old sibling and two cousins, managed to somehow open the door of his house that was stuck after the incident, and find way to the staircase. “It was only us children in the flat at the time of the incident. We were sleeping when the slab collapsed and could not understand what had happened. I rushed to the door and tried opening it but it was stuck. I pushed it hard and managed to open the door and rushed out with my cousins and sibling,” said Rohit. “The building was not dangerous and residents were not given notice to vacate the building. We are also shocked due to the incident,” said Reshma Parche. UMC assistant commissioner Ganesh Shimpi said, “Only one family approached us and we have accommodated them at a local gurdwara.”The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) confirmed that the building is not in the dangerous buildings’ list. Meanwhile, residents say the incident has left them homeless. “We have no place to go now. We are living on the streets at present with no belongings,” said Lata Metkar, 45, a resident of Mohini Palace, who lived in the building with her children. On Sunday morning, the police deployed at the collapse site claimed that the remaining portion of the building tilted a bit, which led to panic among the nearby residents. “We are trying to keep people away from the spot so that there is no other tragedy,” said an officer, who did not wish to be named. “We will start demolishing the structure from Monday and the procedure for it has been initiated,” said Ganesh Shimpi, assistant commissioner, UMC. Sashikant Dayma, a social activist from Ulhasnagar, said, “A total of 30 people have died in 36 incidents of building or slab collapses within UMC limits in past 11 years. Every year, there is one such incident in the city and the civic body has failed to bring about a permanent solution.” As per UMC records, there are 23 ‘extremely dangerous buildings’ which need to be demolished and 116 ‘dangerous buildings’, which need to be vacated and repaired, while eight buildings can be repaired without vacating residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ulhasnagar-slab-collapse-survivors-left-without-shelter-bldg-to-be-razed-101621190227509.html

The incident came to light after some residents informed forest department officials about a few dead deer in the area, located among a large swathe of farmlands at the southern edges of the Satpura range — a preferred habitat of blackbuck that extends all the way to Buldhana, Akola and Amravati districts. A survey by officials then revealed that the fatalities included six female and four male blackbuck. In a statement late on Saturday, the forest department said that it was in the process of conducting autopsies and that the animals were suspected to have been poisoned. “This is not a new situation. We have seen it before but such a large group of blackbuck deaths is quite unusual. Local farmers could have poisoned the animals as they are a major threat to crops,” said a forest department official who did not wish to be identified. The official added that two of the dead blackbuck were pregnant.“The deers have been necropsied at this time. After the post-mortem of the animals, the body parts will be collected and the samples will be sealed and sent to the forensic laboratory for examination,” the forest department’s statement said. Experts and environmentalists, too, described the event as unusual, given the number of animals that seemingly died in a single instance. “This incident certainly warrants further investigation by the forest department. The Satpura range is an important corridor route from Umbardev to Kuvardev in the taluka, and is currently suffering from a range of anthropogenic stress by way of deforestation, illegal grazing, quarrying and so on. Habitat fragmentation and loss of open grasslands have inevitably pushed blackbuck into farms in conflict with farmers,” said environmentalist Ashwin Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10-blackbucks-found-dead-in-maharashtra-s-buldhana-district-poisoning-suspected-101621190107514.html
17-05-2021||Mumbai||Parents skip pre-primary school, enrol kids to Class 1||On a hot summer afternoon, Ranjana Sharma, a pre-primary teacher from a budget private school in the city’s northern suburb — Kandivli — was busy doing the rounds of homes in the school’s vicinity, trying to convince parents to enrol their children in her school. She said that parents are now enrolling their children directly in Class 1 with the wrong belief that their child will not miss out on anything during the pandemic.“With schools going online, many parents are skipping pre-primary classes altogether and are enrolling children directly in Class 1. Many parents feel that they can save some money and have a wrong notion that the children will not miss out on anything as these are early years. But that is wrong,” said Sharma.In 2020, Sharma’s school had barely five students in each grade, a number that usually goes up to 20 every year. In the absence of sufficient student strength, her school had to let go of some of her colleagues. “It was a bad situation. We charge minimum fees but parents were not in a position to spare even that. Even the ones who took admission did not pay immediately,” she said. This year, a month before schools reopen for the new academic year, Sharma and her colleagues have only managed to get a handful of students.A year after schools in the state closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, early years and preschool education, which caters to students between the ages of two and six years, is the worst hit. Many preschools, especially the standalone private ones, had to shut down as they could not afford to bear the costs of teachers and the infrastructure due to very low enrolments.Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association and Podar Education Network, said that a large number of parents decided to take a zero year in 2020. “They did not realise that there is no such thing as a zero year in an early childhood education as 95% of brain development occurs in the first five years and these years are important for brain stimulation through language, socio-emotional development and cognitive nurturing,” she added.Early educators said that while 2020 was a terrible year for preschools, 2021 has only shown a marginal improvement. “Parents are slowly realising that online learning is the only option in the current situation but there are still many parents who are not willing to bear the expenses of a proper early-years programme even though almost all preschools have slashed their fees,” said Neeti Nagarkar, education consultant and founder, Kids World Education.Preschool chains said that while enrolments are slowly picking up, they are still creating awareness among more parents regarding the significance of early learning. “We are clocking rising admissions numbers as more and more parents are adopting online learning options to start the academic year and then plan to move to classrooms, whenever pre-schools are allowed to resume physical classes,” said KVS Seshasai, chief executive officer, pre-K division, EuroKids International.Since a large number of parents are still not enrolling children in a proper preschool of pre-primary programme, many companies have started offering short term bridge courses which are becoming popular among parents. Vats, however, warned against such courses and said, “These are courses that try to cover a years’ education in two to three months. Sadly, this is detrimental for children because it would only lead to piling on of education and stress for the children as they have to cram so much in so little time,” she added.For many parents from low-income backgrounds, however, budgeting for the child’s early education is becoming a challenge. “My husband works in a garment company in Andheri and was laid off a few months ago when the second wave began. We wanted to enrol our son in a nearby preschool but don’t know if we can afford it anymore,” said Sarika Mane, a parent from Mankhurd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parents-skip-pre-primary-school-enrol-kids-to-class-1-101621190047496.html

As of May 16, COEP has 700 operational beds which the civic body plans to increase it to 740. That would be still 60 beds short of its planned capacity. The agency which runs the facility said that the facility could not meet its capacity because of the shortage of oxygen, and is still dependent on external oxygen supply. The COEP jumbo facility was inaugurated online by CM Uddhav Thackeray on August 24, almost six months after the first Covid case was detected in Pune on March 9, 2020. In September 2020, the city saw the peak of the first wave, and in April the second wave hit harder. During both periods, citizens faced a shortage of oxygenated and ICU beds. Incidents where people lost their lives to the infection as they could not get the right treatment and admission into any hospital, are rife. Dr Shreyansh Kapale, director of Medbros, which is running the facility, said, “The facility could not operate at full capacity because of the oxygen shortage. Currently, we have 700 beds and during the last peak we could not admit more patients as the existing oxygen capacity was just enough for the existing patients. Currently, the number of new cases is going down and we have enough oxygen.” Dr Kapale said there is no shortage of staff or financial aid restricting the facility. The PMC now plans to add 40 more beds to the facility which will bring the total number to 740. Of the 700 beds, 520 are oxygenated beds, 119 are ICU beds without a ventilator, and 61 have ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/coep-jumbo-facility-blames-oxygen-shortage-for-not-running-at-full-bed-capacity-101621178527100.html
