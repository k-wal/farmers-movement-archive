The union government also flagged certain states where cases were high, including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the two states where polls were conducted recently.Follow all the updates here:Jharkhand records nearly 1,900 new Covid-19 cases, 53 deathsJharkhand reports 1894 new #COVID19 cases, 4528 recoveries and 53 deaths in the last 24 hoursTotal cases 3,20,934Active cases 28,841 pic.twitter.com/qEWixI16vvJharkhand's caseload of the Covid-19 disease climbed to 320,934 on Wednesday after 1,894 new cases, 53 more deaths and 4,528 recoveries, according to the state health department's bulletin.
