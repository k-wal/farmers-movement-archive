What UPI did for payments in India, account aggregators (AAs) will do for credit. This radical mechanism was launched quietly last week, and it has not received as much attention as it deserves, partly because of a lack of comprehension of what it can do.

The choice of location had an obvious political subtext. West UP is a stronghold of Jats — who have been at the forefront of the protests along with predominantly Sikh farmers from Punjab. West UP is also the home of Rakesh Tikait, who after a range of short-term political dalliances with a range of political formations, has found strength by returning to issues concerning agriculture that catapulted his father, Mahendra Singh Tikait, to prominence.
