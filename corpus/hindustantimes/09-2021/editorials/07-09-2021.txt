The survey, supervised by economists Jean Dreze, Reetika Khera, and researcher Vipul Paikra, was conducted in August and covered 1,400 students, from classes 1 to 8, across 15 states and Union Territories. About 60% of the sample households reside in rural areas, and close to 60% belong to Dalit or tribal communities. Only 8% of students in rural areas and 24% are studying online regularly, and 19% of children in urban areas and 37% in rural areas are not studying at all. Ninety per cent of parents in urban areas and 97% in rural areas want schools to reopen. This is understandable: Only 23% of urban parents and 8% of rural parents feel that their children have adequate online access. Both sets (76% in urban and 75% in rural areas) said that their children’s reading abilities have declined during the lockdown. The results of a simple reading test conducted during the survey confirm the assessment. Nearly half of all children in the sample could not read more than a few words.

Like Sars-Cov-2, it is zoonotic, having jumped from animals. The virus is carried by fruit bats and infection spreads typically when a person eats or drinks something contaminated by bat droppings. Nipah infections have a high fatality rate; 17 of the 19 confirmed cases in Kerala in 2018 died. The World Health Organization estimates 40-75% of the infections are likely to be fatal. Experts have warned of a high pandemic potential with a virus such as Nipah. Till now, cases of human-to-human transmission are few compared to infections via contact with animals or contaminated products. But a 2019 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine raised the possibility of the virus mutating to become more able to jump from person to person, making any outbreak a cause for significant concern.
