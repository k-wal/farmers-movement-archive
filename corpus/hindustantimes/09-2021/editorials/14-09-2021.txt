Then, it begins creating, funding, arming and legitimising groups which are committed to the politics of violence and terror. This State, once again as a matter of conscious policy, exports this terror to both the east and west of its borders. When international pressure builds up to crack down on such groups, the State pretends to do so — while covertly, and not so covertly, continuing to back its proxies. Eventually, to its west, the proxy wins. The world is exasperated, but then this State projects itself as the only player with the leverage to tame the violent impulses of its own proxies, which it helped put in power in the first place.

US special envoy on climate, John Kerry, lauded India’s leadership for setting a target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, while nudging New Delhi to commit to net-zero carbon emission goals. Mr Kerry’s visit, the second this year, comes on the heels of a string of high-profile visits to New Delhi, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which begins on November 1. The recently released Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change report said the world will miss its target of keeping global warming to under 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels. This threshold will be exceeded in the next two decades, resulting in a higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. India is seen as the world’s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US, though with far lower emissions per capita than the other two countries.
