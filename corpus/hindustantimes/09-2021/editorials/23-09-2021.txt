Among the states going to polls early next year — Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa and Punjab — it is only in the north Indian state that the party is in power. While it has picked a new Dalit chief minister (CM), the party’s mismanagement of the transition — Captain Amari-nder Singh is upset, and there are factions jostling for leadership — will add to its electoral challenge.
23-09-2021||Editorials||The battle against air pollution||The World Health Organization (WHO), on Wednesday, released its revised Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), its first update since 2005. The new AQGs provide an assessment of the health effects of air pollution, set new thresholds for key air pollutants, and provide recommendations to improve air quality. The revision was necessary because, since 2005, there has been fresh evidence that shows harm from air pollution begins at much lower levels than previously thought. According to the new metric, the average 24-hour exposure to PM2.5 must remain below 15µg/m³, down from 25µg/m³. In the case of PM10 particles, the safe threshold has been lowered from 50 to 45µg/m³. The AQGs report adds that air pollution causes seven million premature deaths annually. Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide; low- and middle-income countries have growing levels of air pollution because of urbanisation and economic development that relies on the burning of fossil fuels.
