There were also calls for National Health Service (NHS) staff and other emergency workers to be given priority.Pumps across British cities were either closed or had signs saying fuel was unavailable on Monday, Reuters reporters said, with some limiting the amount of fuel each customer could buy.The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent fuel retailers accounting for 65% of all the 8,380 UK forecourts, said members had reported that 50% to 90% of pumps were dry in some areas.Fuel suppliers said they expected the situation to get back to normal soon."There is plenty of fuel at UK refineries and terminals, and as an industry we are working closely with the government to help ensure fuel is available to be delivered to stations across the country," said a joint statement from the fuel industry, which included the BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil's Esso."As many cars are now holding more fuel than usual, we expect that demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, easing pressures on fuel station forecourts. We would encourage everyone to buy fuel as they usually would."The industry's message echoed the plea from the government for people not to panic buy. Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was no shortage of fuel and that there were no plans to get the army to drive trucks, though the Ministry of Defence would help with trucker testing.Hauliers, gas stations and retailers said there were no quick fixes, however, as the shortfall of truck drivers - estimated to be around 100,000 - was so acute, and because transporting fuel demands additional training and licensing.Cabbies stay home"We need some calm," Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA, told Reuters. "Please don't panic buy: if people drain the network then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."London taxi driver Paul Kirby said he had visited nine filling stations before finding one that had fuel."I'm okay for the next day or so but then it's going to be completely out of my hands. If I can't get anything, then the cab is going to be parked up," he told Reuters."Probably 50% of my colleagues that I regularly keep in touch with are sitting at home today because they couldn't get fuel at the weekend."For months, supermarkets, processors and farmers have warned that a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers was straining supply chains.The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.But Andrzej Dobrowolski, a 44-year-old Pole who owns a construction and transportation firm in Britain, said many drivers would scoff at such a proposal."Boris Johnson is inviting the drivers back and they are laughing," Dobrowolski said. "They are saying: why should they quit their companies in Poland or Bulgaria or Romania or anywhere in the EU for four months?"What the British don't understand is that it's not just the money that's important," he said. "Their offer is at least three years out of date."Amid warnings of a dire winter ahead, some politicians in the European Union linked the supply chain stress to the 2016 Brexit referendum and Britain's subsequent decision to seek a distant relationship with the bloc."The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we tried very hard to convince the British not to leave the Union," said Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor."They decided differently. I hope they will manage the problems coming from that," Scholz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-how-fuel-shortage-crisis-is-impacting-the-citizens-of-the-uk-101632851866345.html
28-09-2021||World||Why are 30,000 posts for minorities lying vacant?: Pak SC slams Imran Khan||The Pakistan Supreme court questioned the Imran Khan government regarding vacancies in posts allotted for minorities. Pakistan chief justice Gulzar Ahmed on Tuesday while hearing a case on the attack on Rahim Yar Khan's Bhong temple enquired about the job quota for the minorities, news agency ANI reported citing news agency Samaa TV.“Nearly 30,000 jobs allocated for minorities are vacant. Why?,” chief justice Ahmed questioned the government. Shoaib Suddle, the chairman of the Minority Commission, told the court that Pakistan has a 5% job quota for minorities. He said that the government did not specify which minority group should be hired.“It doesn't specify whether Hindus, Sikhs, or Christians should be hired,” Suddle told the court. The chief justice then summoned a report from the government on jobs for minorities. He also told the federal government and chief secretaries to cooperate with the commission.The court also said that the Bhong temple has been renovated. The Ganesh temple in Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan district was vandalised by several hundred miscreants who were carrying sticks, stones and bricks.Pakistan chief justice Gulzar Ahmed criticised the police and said that their inaction brought shame to the nation while listening to the case earlier this month. The miscreants claimed that they were protesting against the release of an eight-year-old child belonging to the Hindu community who was arrested for allegedly urinating in a local seminary.At least 85 suspects are on trial and were booked by the Pakistan police under anti-terrorism charges and other sections of the Pakistan Penal Code for vandalising the temple.The recent years saw a surge of attacks on minorities and minority places of worship in Pakistan. In December 2020, over a hundred miscreants led by local Muslim clerics had destroyed and set on fire a temple in the Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-30-000-posts-for-minorities-lying-vacant-pak-sc-slams-imran-khan-101632850413653.html

He died at 5-15 p.m. (15-15 GMT—20.45 IST).The announcement was made by Cairo Radio.After Cairo Radio had carried a reading from the Koran for 30 minutes, Vice-President Anwar Sadat announced the news of the death.President Nasser, who was 52, had been treated in the Soviet Union for diabetes and a circulatory ailment.He was the most powerful and controversial Arab leader in modern history.There had been no indication of any serious illness which Nasser might have suffered from. He went to Moscow in July this year for treatment of diabetes.” But doctors there said he returned to Cairo in good health.Mr. Sadat said in the death announcement that he could not “find the right words to express the deep sorrow which befell the United Arab Republic and the Arab nations.”Cairo television and radio abruptly halted its regular programmes at 12 a.m. and began broadcasting verses from Koran before the announcement was made.The British telephone service reported from London that all telephone communications with Cairo had been interrupted. The BBC also reported its inability to get through to Cairo. The BBC monitoring services heard the official announcement saying that the first symptoms of President Nasser’s heart attack became noticeable soon after the last session of the meeting of Arab Heads of State in Cairo last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-sep-29-1970-naseer-dies-of-heart-attack-101632849259326.html
28-09-2021||World||Chinese govt faces public outcry over move to restrict abortions||The Chinese government’s move to reduce the rate of abortions needed for "non-medical reasons" has resulted in public backlash, with many seeing this as an intrusive measure meant to raise the country’s sagging birthrate as part of its three-child policy, according to a media report.China’s central Cabinet, called the State Council, on Monday said it will “reduce the rate of abortions needed for non-medical reasons”, as part of its efforts to improve women’s health, according to a series of new guidelines addressing issues related to women and children in the world's most populous nation.Though lowering the high abortion rate, -- largely driven by a preference for boys over girls -- has been the government policy for decades, the Council's statement drew public attention immediately and was seen by many as restricting women’s rights amid an official drive to boost population growth to address the country’s ageing population.The policy was criticised by the public as a new form of government interference in people’s private family life, after the notorious forced abortions during the implementation of the decades-old one-child policy, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.“It’s so funny that when they didn’t want so many people, they said fewer kids make you happy for the entire life, and when they wanted it, they said women should consider their health and avoid abortions. In the past, there were women who carried a second child being forced to get abortions, and now are they forcing people to get pregnant?” a user of Weibo (akin to Chinese Twitter) commented.Last month, China’s national legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC) formally endorsed the three-child policy mooted by the ruling Communist Party, in a major policy shift to prevent a steep decline in birth rates in the country, which has a population of over 1.4 billion.The revised Population and Family Planning Law, which allows Chinese couples to have three children, was passed by the NPC in an apparent attempt to address the reluctance of the Chinese couples to have more children due to mounting costs.The amended law has also passed more social and economic supportive measures to address the concerns.In May this year, the Communist Party approved a relaxation of its strict two-child policy to allow all couples to have up to three children.China permitted all couples to have two children in 2016, scrapping the decades-old one-child policy which policymakers blame for the demographic crisis in the country.Chinese officials claim the one-child policy implemented for over three decades has prevented over 400 million births.Li Ying, a Beijing-based women’s rights lawyer, said amid the authorities’ diametric shift in family planning, it’s natural for women to worry that the authorities may now be imposing restrictions on access to abortions.“The public backlash shows female citizens today have a better awareness of their rights. They want to make their own choices in terms of having babies, not be restricted by a law or regulation,” Li told the South China Morning Post, adding that “they have the freedom to raise children, and the freedom not to as well.”The decision to permit the third child came after a new census this year showed that China's population grew at the slowest pace to 1.412 billion amid official projections that the decline may begin as early as next year.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population above 60 years grew to 264 million, up by 18.7 per cent last year.As the calls for the government to do away with the family planning restrictions grew louder due to concerns that the declining population in the country could result in serious labour shortage, negatively impacting the world's second-largest economy, the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) has decided to permit a third child while declining to completely scrap the family planning policy."Data shows the ageing of the Chinese population has further deepened, and we will continue to face the pressure to achieve a long-term balanced population development," Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said in May this year.The two-child policy failed to enthuse couples to have a second child as fewer opted for the second child, citing heavy expenditure in raising the children.The poor response made Liang Jianzhang, professor at Peking University's School of Economics, suggest to the government to offer parents 1 million yuan (USD 156,000) for each newborn child to shore up the country's declining birth rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-govt-faces-public-outcry-over-move-to-restrict-abortions-101632844873118.html

The shots were given 21 days apart.The FDA has previously said that once the formal submission is completed, the agency will complete its review "likely in a matter of weeks rather than months."The Pfizer vaccine received full, formal approval in the US in August and is therefore technically available to younger children if prescribed by a doctor, but US authorities have cautioned against doing this until the safety data was in.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.Initial data for these groups may come as soon as the "fourth quarter" of the year.In total, 4,500 children aged six months to 11 years were enrolled in the United States, Finland, Poland, and Spain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-submits-data-to-authorise-covid-vaccine-in-children-aged-511-101632837443283.html
28-09-2021||World||Pakistan is home to these 12 foreign terror outfits. 5 of them are India-centric||Pakistan is home to at least 12 US-designated ‘foreign terrorist organisations’ of which five of them are India-centric, according to a new bipartisan Congressional report. These terror groups have broadly, but not exclusively, classified as globally-oriented, Afghanistan oriented, India- and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented, and Sectarian (anti-Shia). The report, 'Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan, suggests Pakistan is a base of operations or target for numerous armed and non-state militant groups, some of which have existed since the 1980s.Financial Action Task Force (FATF) returned Pakistan to the “grey list” in 2018 after the country was found to have “strategic deficiencies” in countering money laundering and terror financing. Pakistan completed 26 out of 27 assigned “action plan items” but the terror financing watchdog left the status unchanged.Pakistan has been accused of proving assistance to the Taliban that retook the power in Afghanistan last month. Afghan Taliban were named by the US as Special Designated Global Terrorists in 2002. During the two decades of US occupation in Afghanistan, the leadership of the Afghan Taliban was believed to operate mainly from the Balochistan provincial capital of Quetta, as well as in Karachi and Peshawar.Pakistan is home to these 12 terrorist groups:Al Qaeda (AQ) - After US-led forces expelled the terrorist group from Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks, the group has operated primarily from Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi. Since 2011, Al Qaeda has been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and reportedly maintains supportive ties with many other terrorist groups.Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) - According to the Congressional report, AQIS operates with an estimated several hundred members and has been implicated in terrorist attacks in Pakistan.Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP or IS-K) - The regional affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS, ISIL, or Da’esh) is estimated to have around 1,500-2,200 fighters. Most of the recruits are former members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). ISIS-K was responsible for the recent suicide bombing outside Kabul airport that claimed dozens of lives.The Haqqani Network - Founded in the late 1980s, the group was designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012. Group founder Jalaluddin Haqqani’s son Sirajuddin has now become Afghanistan’s acting interior minister. With several hundred core members and an estimated 3,000-5,000 armed militants, the Haqqani Network is said to have links with Pakistan’s main intelligence service, a charge Pakistan denies.Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) - Formed in the late 1980s in Pakistan, the terrorist group has been responsible for various high-profile attacks including the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. Lashkar-e-Taiba was designated as an FTO in 2001. It is based in both Pakistan’s Punjab province and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Jaish-e-Mohammed - The terror organisation was founded by Masood Azhar in 2000 and was designated as an FTO in 2001. Along with LeT, JeM was responsible for the attack on the Indian Parliament. Based in both Pakistan’s Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, JeM’s several hundred armed supporters operate in India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan while seeking annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan. JeM also has openly declared war on the United States.Hizb-ul Mujahideen - Founded in 1989, the militant wing of Pakistan’s largest Islamist political party was designated as an FTO in 2017. It is one of the largest and oldest terrorist groups operating in Kashmir. Although Kashmir-based, Hizb-ul Mujahideen reportedly has key funding sources in Pakistan.Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - Pakistan has banned the terror organisation which was formed in 2007. Composed largely of ethnic Pashtun militants, TTP leadership reportedly fled into the border areas of eastern Afghanistan in response to Pakistani military operations in 2014. With suspected links to Al Qaeda, the TTP members seek to defeat Pakistan’s government and establish Sharia law in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) - The ethnic-based separatist group of up to 1,000 armed militants operating mainly in ethnic Baloch areas of Pakistan. It has been responsible for a spate of violence in Balochistan for years.Harakat-ul Jihad Islami - Formed in 1980, the group fought against the Soviet army in Afghanistan in the 1980s and later redirected its efforts toward India. At present, HUJI operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, and seeks annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan.Harakat ul-Mujahadeen - Another FTO which was designated and operates mainly from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and from some Pakistani cities. It was responsible for the 1999 hijacking of an Indian airliner, which led to the release of JeM’s future founder from an Indian prison.Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan - This anti-Shia group was established in Pakistan's Punjab in the mid-1980s. It mainly operates in the erstwhile FATA, Punjab, Balochistan, and Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-home-to-these-12-foreign-terror-outfits-5-of-them-are-indiacentric-101632832315784.html
28-09-2021||World||China scrambles to tackle ‘unexpected, unprecedented’ electricity shortage||China is scrambling to counter a widening power shortage in the northeast of the country as electricity outages have led to rationing of power at homes, shut down factories and malls, and hit manufacturing. The outages, which began in factories, are worrying authorities ahead of winter when demand peaks as provinces switch on central heating.Shortage of coal supply coupled with rising prices and tougher emission standards are said to be the primary reasons behind the power crunch.Chinese state media reported that rationing of power in households in northeast China has sparked public anger and debates on social media about the country’s power supply and whether authorities are ready to face the sharp increase in demand during the long and harsh winter.The worst-hit provinces are Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning in northeast China, which have experienced “unexpected and unprecedented” power cuts, state media reported.Temperatures in the north and northeast of China have already begun to register sharp drops, reports said.The power crisis in the three provinces in northeast China made it to Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform, drawing around 500 million viewers and over 230,000 comments, the tabloid Global Times reported on Tuesday.Power rationing during peak hours was ordered in many parts of northeast China since late last week, including in cities such as Shenyang and Changchun after the region’s entire power grid was in danger of collapse.“The power-supply shock in the world’s second biggest economy and biggest manufacturer will ripple through and impact global markets,” Reuters quoted analysts from the global financial services group, Nomura, as saying in a September 24 note, warning that global supplies of textiles, toys and machine parts could be affected.State Grid Corporation of China, a major operator of electricity networks, has pledged to ensure that basic electricity demand for daily consumption is met and power cuts are avoided, the Global Times report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-scrambles-to-tackle-unexpected-unprecedented-electricity-shortage-101632828178491.html

Police said there was reason to "believe something has exploded that is not of natural causes."An explosion in an apartment building in Gothenburg, Sweden, injured up to 20 people early on Tuesday morning, according to Swedish media outlets.The explosion occurred in the early hours, and rescue services are still working to put out fires that spread to several apartments, the Swedish news agency TT and public service radio SR reported.What we know so farTT reported the explosion occurred just before 5 a.m. local time (0300 GMT) in the Annedal district in the center of Sweden's second-largest city.Authorities said they had opened an investigation and that though the cause of the blast was not immediately clear, there was reason to "believe something has exploded that is not of natural causes," police spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg told a news conference.A spokesperson for the Sahlgrenska University Hospital said three women and one man were seriously wounded among those hospitalized.Emergency services said they were still working to evacuate people and extinguish fires."Several apartments and stairwells are affected. It is at present unclear what has caused the explosion," said a spokesperson for the emergency services in the wider Gothenburg area, before adding that several hundred people had been evacuated from the vicinity of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-apartment-building-explosion-leaves-several-injured-101632826192945.html

The rule, said Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat, will be in place "until an Islamic environment is created"."As long as real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first," Ghairat said in a tweet on Monday, reported CNN.Around 70 members of the university's teaching staff have resigned after the Taliban sacked PhD holder Vice-Chancellor Muhammad Osman Baburi and replaced him with Muhammad Ashraf Ghairat, a BA degree holder.The appointment of Ghairat as VC in the biggest university based in Kabul even led to protests on social media. Critics have highlighted a tweet by Ghairat last year in which he justified the killing of journalists.The university was named after former Afghanistan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was killed in a suicide attack in 2009, but the Taliban changed it to Kabul Education University. Local media reported that Afghanistan's ministry of higher education said in a directive that universities are intellectual assets and should not be named after political or ethnic leaders.Since taking over the reins in Afghanistan, Taliban have issued a number of diktats, most of them about confining the movements of women. Earlier this month, news agency Sputnik reported that the Taliban barred female employees from entering the ministry of women affairs in Kabul, allowing only males into the building.The decisions taken by the insurgent group are making true the fears of the international community which said that Afghan women are most likely to face an uncertain future under the Taliban regime.During the previous rule of the Taliban in the 1990s, women were largely confined to their homes. This time, they announced a new government sans any women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibanappointed-chancellor-bars-women-from-teaching-or-attending-university-101632826269969.html
28-09-2021||World||AUKUS can undermine world peace: Labour Party passes motion||The UK’s Opposition Labour Party members have passed an emergency motion declaring the new AUKUS military pact between Australia, UK and the US as a “dangerous move” threatening world peace.The party’s annual conference is underway in the seaside town of Brighton, where members had pushed through the emergency motion on Monday despite the party leadership backing the agreement earlier this month.However, the wider membership passed the motion, 70 per cent to 30 per cent, attacking the Conservative Party Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“Conference believes that in contradiction to Tory PM Johnson’s statement that ‘this will promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region’, in fact, this is a dangerous move which will undermine world peace,” the motion reads.Under the AUKUS alliance, the three nations have agreed to enhance the development of joint capabilities and technology sharing, including a collaboration on future nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer had backed the alliance when it was announced, saying: “Britain must look after our most important relationships.”The passing of the motion is seen as a reflection of a divide within the Opposition party, with former leader Jeremy Corbyn backed leftist faction pushing through their agenda.It came as Andy McDonald, who was shadow secretary for employment rights in Starmer’s frontline team, stepped down from the post claiming that the party was “more divided than ever”.The conference vote was condemned by one of its affiliate workers' unions, the GMB union, which warned that opposition to the new military agreement would undermine industries and jobs.“This deal could be a real opportunity for UK manufacturing. To dismiss it out of hand is nonsense,” said GMB regional secretary Hazel Nolan.“If it ever wants to be in power, Labour needs to get back to its roots and speak up for jobs and the concerns of working people,” she said.The Labour Party conference, which opened over the weekend, has been seen as the first major test for Starmer’s leadership.He won his first big win when his planned internal party election reforms were passed by the party membership and has insisted that his focus remains on setting the agenda for winning the next general election.His senior shadow minister, foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, made references to her Indian roots and her father who migrated from India to the UK in the 1950s and worked on creating the country’s Race Relations Act.“Almost a century ago the seams of my family were threaded together when the Indian independence campaign, supported by my grandparents, had devastating consequences for Lancashire textile workers,” she recalled.“When the cotton stopped coming, the mills stopped running and the workers went hungry. But members of my family, who worked in those mills, were among those who welcomed Gandhi to Lancashire. Because they knew, as I know, as the first mixed race woman to ever hold this office, that solidarity has power and our struggle is one and the same,” she said.Labour's annual conference will be followed by the Conservative Party conference in Manchester between October 3 and 5. The political parties have resumed their annual tradition of in-person gatherings after a cancellation due to the coronavirus lockdown last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aukus-can-undermine-world-peace-labour-party-passes-motion-101632819005141.html

28-09-2021||World||Almost! How Iceland missed out on having Europe's first female-majority parliament||Iceland seemed to have made history for a brief moment on Sunday when an initial election count appeared to have made the country the first in Europe to win a female-majority parliament. The early projections based on the final results showed that women had won 33 of the 63 seats in the Althing parliament, a remarkable 52 per cent. A later recount, however, soon cleared up the situation and credited the women with 30 seats, or 47.6 per cent. It was announced that Iceland was going to have a male-majority parliament after all.Iceland has long been a pioneer in gender equality and women's rights, so the initial election results were hailed as a landmark moment for progressive politics. According to data compiled by the World Bank, no other European country has had more than 50 per cent of women lawmakers in parliament, but Sweden has now come the closest at 47 per cent.To what extent did the numbers change after the recount?According to public broadcaster RUV, it was understood that a handful of votes had been miscounted in the initial projection of the Saturday ballot for Althing, Iceland's parliament. This affected the distribution of the so-called “compensatory” seats, according to the broadcaster which communicates elections results in an official role. As far as representation in the parliament was concerned, the recount showed that there will be 33 men and 30 women.However, the recount did not affect the overall election results and the distribution of seats. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir's coalition bloc, which includes the conservative Independence Party and the centre-right Progressive Party along with her Left-Green Movement, won the majority with a total of 37 of the 63 seats in the parliament, boosting its representation from the 33 it held before the vote.But the Left-Green Movement itself won only eight seats, three fewer than in 2017, raising questions about Jakobsdottir's future as prime minister. The largest party remained the Independence Party, whose leader Bjarni Benediktsson – the current finance minister and a former prime minister – has long been eyeing Jakobsdottir's job.Pioneer in gender equalityIceland, unlike some other countries, does not have an actual legal quota on female representation in the parliament, although some parties do require a minimum number of candidates to be women.However, the latest election results are still being called a milestone in gender equality and women's rights, considering the effort put forth by activists in recent years to increase female representation in parliamentary politics. Speaking to the AFP news agency, Icelandic president Gudni Johannesson said, “This is yet another example of how far we have advanced on the road to full gender equality.”Only five other countries around the globe currently have parliaments where women hold at least half the seats, although none of them is in Europe. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, these are – Rwanda (61 per cent), Cuba (53 per cent), Nicaragua (51 per cent), Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates (50 per cent).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-how-iceland-missed-out-on-having-europe-s-first-female-majority-parliament-101632812263957.html

It quoted experts who suggested another way - by attempting a daring and life-threatening journey to escape by land.The experts said that those trying to escape by land could encounter as many as 20 Taliban checkpoint, Fox News report further said. The experts also called for putting pressure on the Taliban or negotiate with the new rulers for a faster escape of the people from there, according to Fox News.John Sifton, the Asia Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch, told the news outlet that it will be a "perilous journey", but the people have "no choice".Fox News report estimated that over 100,000 Afghan partners remain in Afghanistan. There are also about 1,000 green card holders in the war-torn country, the report further claimed.US Representative for Michigan's third congressional district told Fox News that many are hiding in safe houses or are constantly changing locations.Meanwhile, New York Post quoted 28-year-old Mir as saying that Taliban fighters carry out night raids now and take people out. "It has been my third time changing locations in the last couple of months," he told the Post. "I am safe because they haven't located me so far," he added.The United States forces completed the process of leaving Afghanistan on August 31, marking the end of a chaotic and messy exit from America's longest war.Over 120,000 people were evacuated by the United States and its partner nations in the final frantic weeks of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.Afghanistan plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-can-wait-for-airlift-or-experts-on-escaping-taliban-rule-101632814330164.html
28-09-2021||World||Murders rose 30% in United States in 2020, shows FBI report||The United States recorded the highest one-year jump in homicides since the record-keeping of such data started in 1960s. The statistics came to the fore by data released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday.The number of murders registered in the year 2020 was 21,500, according to the FBI's uniform crime report. This is 4,901 more than the 2019 data, said the FBI. Out of these, 77 per cent of the murders were committed with a firearm, up from 74 per cent in 2019, the report further showed.However, the total number of such killings still remained below that of the 1980s when homicides stayed above 23,000 a year as drug wars played out in many places in the US, the FBI data further showed.The FBI said that 16,000 federal, state, county, city, university, college and tribal agencies have submitted data to the crime report.Though there is no single explanation in the report for the rise in such heinous crimes, experts point to the destabilising impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and a rise in gun sales.“This jump in murders is just the latest proof that we are experiencing a gun violence epidemic within the Covid-19 pandemic,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement. “This death spiral will continue until we stem the flow of illegal guns and invest in proven intervention programs.”According to World Bank figures, there were 6.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in the United States in 2018, compared with 35 in Mexico, 27 in Brazil, eight in Russia and one per 100,000 in France and Germany.The FBI report further showed that violent crimes in 2020 went up by 5.6 per cent over the previous year while property crimes continued a nearly two-decade decline, falling 7.8 per cent. Robbery and rape dropped 9.3 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murders-rose-30-in-united-states-in-2020-shows-fbi-report-101632812182863.html
28-09-2021||World||After Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, terror attacks in Pakistan highest in 4 years||Terror attacks in Pakistan have increased manifold ever since the Taliban won back control of the state apparatus in Afghanistan in a lightning-fast offensive more than a month ago, according to data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal. The report showed that after the United States military withdrew from war-torn Afghanistan and the Taliban seized Kabul, deadly terrorist attacks in Pakistan increased to their highest level in more than four years, signalling growing instability in the region that experts say could come back to bite Islamabad.Also Read | Factional fighting hits Taliban govt, differences are over PakistanAs per its latest review, seen by the Bloomberg news agency – Pakistan saw at least 35 terror attacks that killed 52 civilians in August alone, the highest since February 2017. Most of these attacks have been attributed to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot terror outfit of the Taliban, which is believed to have been ‘encouraged’ by the developments next door. The South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) is the largest website on terrorism and low-intensity warfare in South Asia; it creates the database and analytic context for research and analysis of all extremist movements in the region.The TTP, alternatively referred to as the ‘Pakistani Taliban’ has a stated aim to overthrow the government in Islamabad by waging a violent military campaign against the state. It maintains ties with several other terror outfits, including but not limited to al-Qaeda. According to experts, this fringe militant group was “emboldened further by what happened in Afghanistan”.“The terrorist group had already been growing stronger much before the situation in Afghanistan with splinter groups merging over the past year or so,” Umar Karim, a visiting fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told the Bloomberg agency over the phone.Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said that although Pakistan is not talking about it openly, Islamabad is concerned about the re-emergence of the Pakistani Taliban threat, which had earlier been suppressed by a combination of domestic military operations and US drone strikes.Also Read | Pakistan involved in harbouring Taliban, must 'line up’: BlinkenThe development comes amid a precarious situation for Pakistan, which was criticised heavily across global quarters for encouraging the Taliban offensive against the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan, in the hopes of gaining favour among the ranks of the new rulers in Kabul and keep its neighbours uncomfortable in the process. But so far, the newfound Taliban regime has only led to more discomfort for Islamabad. The militants, after sweeping to power, freed several terrorists wanted by the Pakistan government from jails in Afghanistan.Terrorists firing from Afghanistan killed two Pakistani soldiers and left many injured in a clash last month. Seven other soldiers died earlier in September when the Pakistani army attacked terrorists in South Waziristan, according to a statement sent by the army’s media wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-taliban-takeover-of-afghanistan-terror-attacks-in-pakistan-highest-in-4-years-101632806928271.html

28-09-2021||World||In Pakistan, 1.5 million people apply for a peon’s position||Despite Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's claim that the rate of unemployment in the country stands at 6.5 per cent, data shows otherwise. According to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), the unemployment rate is much higher at 16 per cent. Highlighting the rising rate of unemployment in the county, PIDE said that at least 24 per cent of educated people are jobless at the moment in the country, reported Dawn.The desperate situation is more reflective in the fact that at least 1.5 million people recently applied for a peon's position in a high court advertised recently, reported the Pakistan-based newspaper. Among those who applied for the job were MPhil degree holders.The institute, in its briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, highlighted that 40 per cent of educated—both undergraduate and graduate—were unemployed in the country. The public policy think tank also pointed out that many educated people got themselves enrolled in MPhil studies even as they struggled to bag a better job, suggesting this may be skewing the unemployment rate as the aforesaid people weren't being included in the figures.It also pointed out that no research was being conducted by the government, adding that all such studies were done from abroad. It said several research institutes were operating in the country, but the research purposes were not being fulfilled.Meanwhile, a survey published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed that joblessness in Pakistan has jumped from 5.8 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent in 2018-19. The first year of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in power saw an increase in unemployment in the case of both men and women, with the male unemployment rate rising from 5.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent and female unemployment rate jumping from 8.3 per cent to 10 per cent, reported Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pakistan-1-5-million-people-apply-for-a-peon-s-position-101632807258905.html
28-09-2021||World||From drones to jets, China shows off its new arsenal in biggest airshow yet||China on Tuesday showed off its increasingly sophisticated airpower including surveillance drones and jets able to jam hostile electronic equipment, with an eye on disputed territories from Taiwan to the South China Sea and rivalry with the United States. The country's biggest airshow, in the southern coastal city of Zhuhai, comes as Beijing pushes to meet a 2035 deadline to retool its military for modern warfare.China still lags the United States in terms of tech and investment in its war machine, but experts say it is narrowing the gap. A US intelligence report this year flagged China's growing influence as one of America's biggest threats.On Tuesday, a prototype of a new surveillance drone able to carry out attacks – the CH-6 – was among domestic tech unveiled in Zhuhai.With a wingspan of 20.5 metres (67 feet) and 15.8 metres long, the drone can carry missiles and is designed for surveillance and strike operations, according to open-source intelligence agency Janes.Other debutants include the WZ-7 high-altitude drone for border reconnaissance and maritime patrol, as well as the J-16D fighter jet which can jam electronic equipment.Both have already entered service with the air force, state media reported."They will play a major role in both the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea," military commentator Song Zhongping told AFP.China claims virtually all of the South China Sea – disputed with several other nations – while Beijing says the self-ruled island of Taiwan is an inviolable part of its territory.China is also "clearly positioning itself to be an alternative supplier" of advanced drones, with relative affordability, said Janes analyst Kelvin Wong.The United States and European countries have been hesitant to supply such equipment outside a select group of partners, he added.Already, Chinese drones have seen combat action in the Middle East, with sales to other regions as well.Similarly, the J-16D shows "overall improvement" in the combat capabilities of the People's Liberation Army, said James Char, a Chinese military expert at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. “This is indeed a significant development since it gives the Chinese military an advantage in terms of conducting aerial electronic warfare over targets that possess significant air defence capabilities,” he said.Under former US president Donald Trump, Washington authorised around $18 billion worth of arms sales to Taiwan, including advanced missile platforms -- sales that have angered Beijing.The J-16D has wingtip pods to disrupt enemy electronic equipment and has drawn comparisons with the US Navy's EA-18G Growler.The airshow, which is usually held every two years, was postponed from last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and is being held before a largely domestic audience due to quarantine and travel restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-drones-to-jets-china-shows-off-its-new-arsenal-in-biggest-airshow-yet-101632805054390.html
28-09-2021||World||US successfully flight tests Raytheon hypersonic weapon||The United States has tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said on Monday.The test took place as the United States and its global rivals quicken their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.In July, Russia said it had successfully tested a Tsirkon(Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world.The free flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) occurred last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, said in a statement."This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S. military," said Andrew Knoedler, HAWC program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office. There is no target date for that transition, but Knoedler told Reuters, "we are readying our next vehicles and working toward additional flight tests later in the year."Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour."The missile, built by Raytheon Technologies, was released from an aircraft seconds before its Northrop Grumman scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine kicked on," DARPA said."The DoD (Department of Defense) has identified hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities as the highest technical priorities for our nation's security," said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business unit."The United States, and our allies, must have the ability to deter the use of these weapons and the capabilities to defeat them," he said."Investments in hypersonic strike have begun to pay dividends, answering the progress already made by the likes of Russia and China," Tom Karako, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters.In 2019 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airshow-raytheon-hypersonic/northrop-engine-teams-with-raytheon-hypersonic-program-idUSKCN1TJ0UJ, Raytheon teamed up with Northrop Grumman to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons. Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds."The HAWC vehicle operates best in oxygen-rich atmosphere, where speed and maneuverability make it difficult to detect in a timely way. It could strike targets much more quickly than subsonic missiles and has significant kinetic energy even without high explosives," DARPA said in a statement.Dan Olson, vice president of Northrop Grumman's Weapon Systems Division, said "decades of learning advanced manufacturing techniques and industry partnerships helped us define what is now possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-successfully-flight-tests-raytheon-hypersonic-weapon-101632801211811.html
28-09-2021||World||These countries, including North Korea, reported ‘zero’ Covid-19 cases. How true are their claims?||At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has the entire world in a chokehold, there are certain countries where reports say not a single case of infection has been reported in nearly two years. According to a review of data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five countries – three of them isolated islands in the Pacific, Turkmenistan, and North Korea – where not even a single Covid-19 case has been reported so far. Further fuelling this idea, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also claimed that the frontiers of his country are safe from the coronavirus pandemic. However, given that it is notoriously difficult to get proper facts out of the East Asian country without bypassing its state control, several experts have doubted this claim, pointing out that Pyongyang simply chose not to disclose reports regarding its actual Covid-19 tally.Also Read | Covid-19 slashed life expectancy by most since World War II: Oxford studyHere's examining the reports which claim the coronavirus pandemic has not touched a single human soul in certain countries:TurkmenistanTurkmenistan insists that none of its residents have contracted the coronavirus disease so far, in the nearly two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began. The country's president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who has ruled since 2006, told the United Nations in an address earlier this week that any reports of Covid-19 in his country are “fake” and that the response to this pandemic should not be “politicised”.However, independent activists cited by the CNN news network said that the Turkmenistan government, “secretive” and “authoritarian”, is suppressing data to hide the fact that hospitals and medical health professionals in the central Asian country are actually being overwhelmed with the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Ruslan Myatiev, an exile from Turkmenistan and editor of the Netherlands-based independent news organisation Turkmen News, said that the “repressive” president of the former Soviet nation was downplaying the Covid-19 threat in order to protect his image.Myatiev has personally assembled the names of more than 60 people – including doctors, artists, and teachers – whose families have corroborated the reports of their deaths from the deadly virus.North KoreaNorth Korea told the World Health Organization in June that it tested more than 30,000 people for Covid-19 till that month but found not a single case of the virus. The isolated and secretive state has banned tourists and severely restricted cross-border traffic and trade to stop the virus.Also Read | Kim Jong Un orders stricter Covid-19 steps after North Korea shuns vaccinesBut many experts doubt the North Korean dictatorship's claim that it has not found a single case of the virus. They say the country's poor health infrastructure and porous border with China — its major ally and economic lifeline — mean that some people would have caught the infection.Recent footage of North Korean soldiers goose-stepping in hazmat suits through capital Pyongyang on its founding anniversary sent an ominous indicator. North Korea's population is estimated at about 25 million, and although no one knows the exact extent of the infection rate, experts say that the spread of Covid-19 in the country will prove “disastrous”, with its healthcare system not equipped with the proper means to cope with the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-countries-including-north-korea-reported-zero-covid-19-cases-how-true-are-their-claims-101632792470396.html

"Child executed in Takhar province by Taliban fighters after his father is suspected of being in the Resistance. #WarCrimes #Afghanistan," Panjshir Observer said in a tweet.The brutal killing of the child is the latest incident of the Taliban's crackdown on Afghans who raised voices against the outfit. The Taliban, who took over the war-torn country on August 15, promised there would be no revenge attacks but in Panjshir—the last province to fall to the Taliban—there have been reports of civilians getting shot as they attempt to escape. ABC, the US broadcast television network, reported last week that members of the resistance force and former government are being targeted in revenge killings across the country. "Five times they attacked my family," a young man from Panjshir told the ABC.Also read | Ghani says Facebook page hacked after post calls for Taliban recognitionAnother Panjshir local resident told the ABC that the Taliban were stopping people to ask them about their associations with the resistance movement or Afghanistan's previous government.

28-09-2021||World||China’s electricity crunch is latest supply chain threat to world||China’s energy crisis is shaping up as the latest shock to global supply chains as factories in the world’s biggest exporter are forced to conserve energy by curbing production.The disruption comes as producers and shippers race to meet demand for everything from clothing to toys for the year-end holiday shopping season, grappling with supply lines that have been upended by soaring raw material costs, long delays at ports and shortages of shipping containers. Chinese manufacturers warn that strict measures to cut electricity use will slash output in economic powerhouses like Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces -- which together account for almost a third of the nation’s gross domestic product -- and possibly drive up prices. Local governments are ordering the power cuts as they try to avoid missing targets for reducing energy and emissions intensity, while some are facing an actual lack of electricity. Clark Feng, whose Vita Leisure Co. buys tents and furniture from Chinese manufacturers to sell overseas, said electricity curbs in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where the company is based, have dealt another blow to businesses. Fabric makers in the province that are suffering production halts have started to hike prices and postpone taking new overseas orders, he said.“We were already struggling to ship goods overseas, and now with the production capacity restriction, it’s definitely going to be a huge mess,” said Feng. “We already had to deal with so many uncertain factors, and now there’s one more. It will be harder to deliver orders, especially for the holiday season.”Yiwu Huading Nylon Co. Ltd., a maker of synthetic fabric nylon in Zhejiang, suspended half of its production capacity since Sept. 25 in response to the local government’s order to cut electricity consumption, according to a stock exchange filing Monday. The company expects output to resume from Oct. 1 and said it will look to minimize the impact of the closure.Port DisruptionsThe power problems come after recent port disruptions in China rippled across global supply chains. Part of Ningbo port, one of the world’s busiest, was idled for weeks last month following a Covid outbreak, while Yantian port in Shenzhen was shut in May.The energy crunch will weigh on China’s economy at a time when it’s already slowing because of factors such as stringent virus control measures and tighter restrictions to rein in the property market. Nomura Holdings Ltd., China International Capital Corp. and Morgan Stanley have either downgraded GDP growth forecasts or have warned of lower growth because of the power disruptions.“Global markets will feel the pinch of a shortage of supply from textiles, toys to machine parts,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc in Hong Kong. “The hottest topic about China will very soon shift from “Evergrande” to “Power Crunch.”To be sure, the full impact on production remains to be seen. iPhone assembly operations in China are beginning to reduce their energy consumption, Pegatron Corp., a key partner for Apple Inc. and one of the assemblers of its iPhone, said on Monday. The company said it’s taking energy-saving measures to comply with local government policies. Yet the firms responsible for producing the Apple handset have avoided drastic cutbacks in production so far and appear to be getting preferential access to energy in order to keep operations going, according to people familiar with the situation.Authorities are watching for disruption, with the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, saying in an Sunday editorial that the shortages would force companies to raise the prices of goods for Chinese consumers. The government of northeast Liaoning province urged local regulators to prevent power curbs from impacting production and residential use, state broadcaster CCTV reported.With the power crisis moving from the factory floor to people’s homes, electricity utility State Grid Corporation of China said Monday it will try its best to avoid power cuts to meet basic residential demand.Analysts say the power shortages will inevitably impact both heavy industries such as aluminum and steel right through to downstream sectors. In the industrial hub of Guangdong, the provincial energy administration issued a notice Sunday that said large-scale cuts to factories have already been implemented.“No one knows when the supply chain bottleneck will be overcome,” said Hao Hong, head of research and chief strategist at Bocom International. “But it is looking ominous for this winter.”Chen Yubing, manager at Suzhou Berya Textile Technology Co. Ltd., an exporter of polyester and nylon fabric based in Zhejiang, said his company has suffered “huge losses” due to the suspension. The company’s production lines were only allowed to operate three days a week starting from early September and the latest order on Monday means it will be allowed to operate every other day. Half of the company’s sales come from overseas clients.“We have problems delivering some orders already,” Chen said. “All we can do now is wait and negotiate with customers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-electricity-crunch-is-latest-supply-chain-threat-to-world-101632789474866.html
28-09-2021||World||North Korea demands Biden admin to end military exercise with South Korea||North Korea on Monday accused the United States of hostility and demanded the Biden administration permanently end joint military exercises with South Korea even as it continued its recent streak of weapons tests apparently aimed at pressuring Washington and Seoul over slow nuclear diplomacy.North Korean Ambassador Kim Song’s comments on the last day of the U.N. General Assembly came shortly after South Korea’s military said the North fired an unidentified projectile into its eastern waters.The North’s latest test, which followed two previous rounds of missile tests this month, indicated the country is returning to its tried-and-true technique of mixing weapons demonstrations and peace offers to wrest concessions amid long-stalled negotiations over its nuclear weapons program.Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t immediately say what the North launched in its latest test, which took place early Tuesday on the Korean Peninsula, or how far the weapon flew.Speaking through a translator, Kim justified North Korea’s development of a “war deterrent” as a necessity to defend against U.S. threats, and also accused of South Korea of betraying inter-Korean peace agreements by prioritizing its Western ally over “national harmony.”He demanded that the United States “permanently” stop its military exercises with South Korea, which the North has traditionally described as invasion rehearsals, and end the deployment of U.S. strategic weapons to the Korean Peninsula.“The possible outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula is contained not because of the U.S.’s mercy on the DPRK, it is because our state is growing s reliable deterrent that can control the hostile forces in an attempted military invasion,” Kim said, referring to North Korea by the abbreviation of its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.He called for the United States to contribute to the peace and stability of the peninsula and the world by withdrawing an "anachronistic, hostile policy towards the DPRK in a bold and complete manner.”North Korea mainly uses the term "hostile policy” to refer to U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and the joint U.S.-South Korea military drills.“If (the United States) is really desirous of peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula, they should take the first step towards giving up its hostile policy against the DPRK by stopping permanently the joint military exercises and the deployment of all kinds of strategic weapons which are leveled at the DPRK in and around the Korean Peninsula," Kim said.The United States keeps about 28,000 troops in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea. The allies say their drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in pandemic response.North Korea's nuclear program has seemed to recede in attention at this year's General Assembly in the face of new and broader challenges like COVID-19 and rising U.S.-China tensions, and the meeting ended without meaningful new proposals to break the diplomatic stalemate.But North Korea usually hates being ignored. After months of relative quiet, the country this month tested new cruise missiles it eventually plans to arm with nuclear warheads and launched ballistic missiles from a train. It then offered to improve relations with South Korea if certain conditions are met.Analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is using the South’s desire for inter-Korean engagement to pressure Seoul to extract concessions from the Biden administration on his behalf as he renews an attempt to leverage his nuclear weapons for badly needed economic and security benefits.In their speeches at the General Assembly last week, both President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressed hopes to diplomatically resolve the standoff with North Korea while sidestepping the fresh tensions created by the North’s latest tests.Biden, whose pullout from Afghanistan underscored a broader shift in U.S. focus from counterterrorism and so-called rogue states like North Korea and Iran to confronting a rising authoritarian superpower in China, said his administration would seek “serious and sustained diplomacy” to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Moon, who wants North Korea to remain a priority in Washington, made a more ambitious push to break the diplomatic deadlock, calling for the leaders of the Koreas, the United States and China to declare an end to the Korean War. The 1950-53 conflict, in which North Korea and ally China faced off against South Korea and U.S.-led U.N. forces, ended with an armistice, but there was never a peace treaty.North Korea rebuffed Moon’s offer last week, saying such a declaration would end up being a “smokescreen” to cover up U.S. hostility. But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, said her country will take steps to repair ties with the South, and may even discuss another summit between their leaders — if Seoul drops its hostility and public criticism about North Korean military developments.Nuclear negotiations have stalled since the collapse of a meeting between Kim Jong Un and former President Donald Trump in February 2019, when the Americans rejected the North’s demands for a major removal of U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility.Kim in recent political speeches has vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of U.S. pressure. His government has so far rejected the Biden administration’s offer to resume talks without preconditions, saying that Washington must abandon its hostile policy first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-accuses-us-of-hostility-continues-weapons-tests-101632788905889.html
28-09-2021||World||World Rabies Day 2021: Know its history, significance and theme||World Rabies Day is observed on September 28 every year to raise awareness about the impact of the viral disease and how to prevent it. This day is also observed globally to mark the death anniversary of French biologist, microbiologist and chemist, Louis Pasteur, who developed the first rabies vaccine. This is the only global day of action and awareness for rabies prevention.History of World Rabies DayWorld Rabies Day was observed for the first time on September 28, 2007. The event was a collaboration between the Alliance for Rabies Control and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, along with the World Health Organization (WHO). The organisations started observing this day after the world suffered from the adverse effects of rabies.Significance of World Rabies DayWorld Rabies Day is observed every year to raise awareness about the impact of rabies on humans and animals, provide information and advice on how to prevent the disease in at-risk communities and support advocacy for increased efforts in rabies control. It is an important day for the world to acknowledge the terror in people of the disease. The day focuses on better care for animals and spreading knowledge on tackling an adverse situation like rabies.Theme of World Rabies DayThis year, the theme for World Rabies day is ‘Rabies: Facts, not Fear’, based on ending the fear from the people and empowering them with the facts. The theme is aimed at sharing facts about rabies and not spreading fear about the disease by relying on misinformation and myths. Last year, the theme of World Rabies Day was ‘End Rabies: Collaborate, Vaccinate’ and the theme in 2019 was ‘Rabies: Vaccinate to eliminate,’ followed by 2018's theme which was ‘Rabies: Share the message, save a life’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-rabies-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101632785868467.html
28-09-2021||World||R Kelly convicted in sex trafficking trial||R Kelly was convicted by a federal jury on Monday in his sex trafficking trial, where prosecutors accused the R&B singer of exploiting his stardom over a quarter-century to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex.Jurors in Brooklyn federal court deliberated for a little more than a day before voting to convict the 54-year-old Kelly on all nine counts he faced, after a 5-1/2 week trial.Kelly kept his head down as the verdict was read, with his face shielded by a white mask.A woman watching from an overflow courtroom cried as the verdict was read, as did others who had waited to learn Kelly's fate in a park adjacent to the courthouse. One supporter played the singer's music there, including the song "Shut Up."Deveraux Cannick, a lawyer for Kelly, told reporters that the defense was disappointed. "I'm sure we'll be appealing," he said.Kelly faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars, and could face up to life in prison at his May 4, 2022, sentencing.The singer, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is one of the most prominent people tried on sex charges during the #MeToo movement, which amplified accusations that had dogged him since the early 2000s.Like Kelly, many of his accusers were Black, differentiating the case from recent #MeToo convictions of comedian Bill Cosby and movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Cosby's conviction was overturned in June.Kelly also had Black supporters.One, Sylvia Tumusiime, said in an interview that the verdict left her "angry, upset and seeing that this is white American. White America," after she had attended the entire trial."I'm going to try to raise some money for him to try to get this appeal process started," said Tumusiime, from the state of Georgia. "I'm going hard and I'm not giving up. I'm not."Kelly had been charged with one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for prostitution.The racketeering charge gave prosecutors leeway to offer evidence that might otherwise be too old to prosecute."We hope that today's verdict brings some measure of comfort and closure to the victims," Acting US Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told reporters.SHARING THEIR STORIESProsecutors said Kelly took advantage of his fame and charisma to recruit victims, including some plucked from crowds at his concerts, with the aid of people in his entourage.Witnesses said some victims had hoped Kelly could jumpstart their careers, only to find he demanded their strict obedience and would punish them if they failed.Trial testimony from the 45 government witnesses portrayed, often in graphic detail, an unseemly side to Kelly's 30-year music career, whose highlights include the 1996 Grammy-winning smash "I Believe I Can Fly."Kelly has repeatedly denied sexual abuse accusations.His alleged victims included the late singer Aaliyah, who Kelly briefly and illegally married in 1994 when she was 15. Aaliyah died in a 2001 plane crash.Many accusations against Kelly were included in the January 2019 Lifetime documentary "Surviving R. Kelly.""We commend the survivors for their bravery in speaking out and sharing their stories," Lifetime and the documentary's producers said in a joint statement. "They have opened up important conversations on sexual abuse that needed to happen."Several witnesses testified that Kelly instilled fear if his victims did not fulfill his every need, sexual and otherwise.Jurors heard how Kelly would compel victims to follow "Rob's rules," including that they call him "Daddy" and get permission to eat or go to the bathroom.Witnesses said Kelly pressed accusers to write "apology letters" to potentially absolve him of wrongdoing, and concealed before intercourse that he had contracted herpes.'NO MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'One witness, who identified herself as Sonja, testified she had hoped to interview Kelly for a radio station where she was interning, when he locked her up for at least two days without food or water and then assaulted her."I've been hiding from Robert Kelly in fear," Sonja said in a statement read by her lawyer Gloria Allred. "I'm ready to start living my life free from fear and to start the healing process."Allred alluded after the verdict to Cannick's closing argument where he invoked the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in urging jurors to show courage and acquit Kelly."Despite the fact that he thought he could control all of his victims, he was wrong," Allred told reporters, referring to Kelly. "Based on the evidence, the jury must have concluded that R. Kelly is no Martin Luther King Jr."Kelly did not testify in his defense.His lawyers had sought to portray Kelly's accusers as former fans who felt jilted when they fell from his favor, and that their sex with Kelly was consensual.They also tried to show how some accusers stayed with Kelly long after the alleged abuses began, and questioned why they failed to go to the police or waited years to come forward.On top of the conviction, Kelly still faces federal charges in Chicago on child pornography and obstruction, and state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/r-kelly-convicted-in-sex-trafficking-trial-101632785635887.html

28-09-2021||World||Joe Biden gets Covid-19 booster shot after authorisation||President Joe Biden joked about his age Monday as he rolled up his sleeve for a Covid-19 booster shot, encouraging Americans to get vaccinated against the virus that has killed 688,000 in the US and for those authorized to get their booster doses for more enduring protection.Days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration recommended a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Americans 65 and older and approved them for others with preexisting medical conditions and high-risk work environments, Biden said vaccination was essential to ending the pandemic.“Let me be clear: Boosters are important, but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,” Biden said before getting the booster. He added that he did not have side effects after his first or second shots, and hoped for the same experience with his third.Biden, 78, got his first shot on Dec. 21 and his second dose three weeks later, on Jan. 11, along with his wife, Jill Biden. Biden said the first lady, who is 70, would also receive the booster dose, but she was teaching Monday at Northern Virginia Community College, where she is a professor of English.“Now, I know it doesn’t look like it, but I am over 65 — I wish I — way over,” Biden joked. “And that’s why I’m getting my booster shot today."Biden emerged as a champion of booster doses in the summer, as the U.S. experienced a sharp rise in coronavirus cases from the more transmissible delta variant. While the vast majority of cases continue to occur among unvaccinated people, regulators pointed to evidence from Israel and early studies in the U.S. showing that protection against so-called breakthrough cases was vastly improved by a third dose of the Pfizer shot.But the aggressive American push for boosters, before many poorer nations have been able to provide even a modicum of protection for their most vulnerable populations, has drawn the ire of the World Health Organization and some aid groups, which have called on the U.S. to pause third shots to free up supply for the global vaccination effort.Biden said last week that the U.S. was purchasing another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine — for a total of 1 billion over the coming year — to donate to less well-off nations.“So, we have plenty, plenty of opportunities to make sure we get everyone in the world — to play our part — the largest part in the world of getting everyone vaccinated,” Biden told reporters.Biden continued to take questions from reporters about his vaccination experience, as well as ongoing congressional negotiations about government funding and his efforts to pass both an infrastructure bill and an expansion of the social safety net through the House this week, as a military nurse injected the dose into his arm.On Capitol Hill, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, 79, a polio survivor, encouraged Americans to get vaccinated and revealed he had also received a booster dose Monday.“Like I’ve been saying for months, these safe and effective vaccines are the way to defend ourselves and our families from this terrible virus," he said.Vice President Kamala Harris, 56, received the Moderna vaccine, for which federal regulators have not yet authorized boosters — but they are expected to in the coming weeks. Regulators are also expecting data about the safety and efficacy of a booster for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot soon.At least 2.66 million Americans have received booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine since mid-August, according to the CDC. About 100 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 through the Pfizer shot. U.S. regulators recommend getting the boosters at least six months after the second shot of the initial two-dose series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-gets-covid-19-booster-shot-after-authorisation-101632778808484.html
28-09-2021||World||UK puts army on standby as fuel pumps run dry||Britain on Monday put the army on standby to help with the ongoing fuel crisis as fears over tanker driver shortages led to panic buying, leaving many of the country's pumps dry."Limited number of military tanker drivers to be put on a state of readiness and deployed if necessary to further stabilise fuel supply chain," the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said in a statement issued late on Monday.Desperate motorists queued up at fuel pumps across Britain, draining tanks, fraying tempers and prompting calls for the government to use emergency powers to give priority access to healthcare and other essential workers.The government says a lack of tanker drivers to deliver fuel and unprecedented demand is behind the crisis.The military drivers will receive specialised training before deploying if the crisis does not ease in the coming days."While the fuel industry expects demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, it's right that we take this sensible, precautionary step," said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng."If required, the deployment of military personnel will provide the supply chain with additional capacity as a temporary measure to help ease pressures caused by spikes in localised demand for fuel," he added.The government has already made a drastic U-turn on tighter post-Brexit immigration policy, offering short-term visa waivers to foreign truckers to help plug the shortfall.Fuel operators, including Shell, BP and Esso, said there was "plenty of fuel at UK refineries" and expected demand to return to normal levels in days, easing pressure."We would encourage everyone to buy fuel as they usually would," they added in a joint statement.But long queues were seen outside filling stations, even overnight, frustrating drivers and stoking concern about the effects on the wider economy."People are desperate. If I don't get petrol now, I can't get work anymore," one driver, David Hart, told AFP as he queued at a garage in London after a fruitless search at the weekend.Britain's biggest public sector union, Unison, said key workers, including doctors, nurses, teachers and police staff, should be given priority access rather than having to wait in line."The government could solve this problem now by using emergency powers to designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers," said general secretary Christina McAnea.Medical bodies have already said some healthcare staff have struggled to get to work, while schools have warned that online teaching could resume if teachers are unable to reach their classrooms.The Petrol Retailers Association said almost half of the UK's 8,000 fuel pumps had run out of petrol on Sunday, blaming "panic-buying, pure and simple" for the issue. Brexit linkCritics blame government inaction on tackling shortages of lorry drivers after Britain's departure from the European Union in January and the pandemic, which saw many foreign truckers leave the country.As well as fuel deliveries, the shortage has led to empty supermarket shelves and raised fears about deliveries of food and toys for Christmas.Germany's weekend election winner Olaf Scholz linked the problems directly to Brexit and said low wages in the sector could make the job less appealing."We worked hard to convince the British not to leave the union," Scholz said.The situation has evoked the dark days of the 1970s, when energy supply problems led to a three-day working week and fuel rationing in Britain.It is reminiscent also of late 2000, when people protesting over high fuel prices blockaded oil refineries, bringing the country to a virtual standstill for weeks.The government called for calm and urged people to buy petrol as normal.Too little, too late?The government, which campaigned during Brexit for an end to European free movement, is banking on a short-term visa waiver to plug the gap in drivers, which it says is a Europe-wide problem.It said on Saturday it will issue up to 10,500 temporary work visas from next month to December 24 to lorry drivers and poultry workers to ease chronic staff shortages.The head of the British Poultry Council, Richard Griffiths, welcomed the move but warned it could be too little, too late to avert food shortages."Supply chains are not something that can be simply switched on and off, so plans for production are already well under way and the necessary cutbacks due to ongoing labour shortages have already been made," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-puts-army-on-standby-as-fuel-pumps-run-dry-101632778344679.html
28-09-2021||World||UK govt considers calling in army to ease shortages at fuel stations||Long lines of cars formed at British gas stations for a fourth day on Monday, as the government mulled sending in the army to help ease the supply disruptions, triggered by a shortage of truck drivers.As unions called for emergency workers to be given priority for fuel supplies, Petrol Retailers’ Association (PRA) chairman Brian Madderson said training had been taking place “in the background” for military personnel to drive tankers.The British government said it had “no plans at the moment” to deploy troops, but was making preparations, just in case the move is necessary. Ministers were meeting on Monday to discuss the fuel squeeze.The PRA, which represents almost 5,500 independent outlets, said on Sunday that about two-thirds of its members had run out of fuel, as the truck driver shortage set off rounds of gas panic-buying.Long lines of vehicles have formed at many gas stations across Britain since Friday, causing spillover traffic jams on busy roads. Tempers have frayed as some drivers have been waiting in queues for hours.Olaf Scholz, leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, the party that came first in the country’s election on Sunday, linked Britain’s worker shortages to Brexit.“The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we worked very hard to convince the British to not leave the union,” he said.“Now they decided different, and I hope they will manage the problems coming from that.”French European Affairs minister Clement Beaune said on Monday that the petrol station problem currently faced by Britain reflected the “intellectual fraud” that was Brexit.“Every day, we see the intellectual fraud that was Brexit,” Beaune told France 2 television on Monday in sharp remarks on the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-considers-calling-in-army-to-ease-shortages-at-fuel-stations-101632773799254.html
28-09-2021||World||Pfizer begins testing of Covid pill as preventive medicine to ward off virus from an infected person||Pfizer has started testing its potential Covid-19 treatment as a preventive medicine aimed at warding off the virus if a close contact gets it.The drug maker said Monday that it will study the pill it is developing in combination with a low dose of the HIV drug ritonavir in people who are at least 18 years old and live in the same household with someone who is infected.Pfizer plans to enroll 2,660 people in the late-stage study. Those participating will get either the treatment combination or a fake drug orally twice a day for five to 10 days.Researchers expect that the use of ritonavir will help slow the breakdown of the potential treatment so it remains active longer to help fight the virus.“If successful, we believe this therapy could help stop the virus early – before it has had a chance to replicate extensively,” Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said in a statement from the drug maker.Pfizer Inc. also is studying its potential treatment in people who are already infected with the virus. It’s designed to be prescribed at the first sign of infection without requiring patients to be hospitalized. The drug maker expects to see results from those studies by the end of the year.The pill aims to block a key enzyme that the virus needs to replicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-begins-testing-of-covid-pill-as-preventive-medicine-to-ward-off-virus-101632767095082.html
