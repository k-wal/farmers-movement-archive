26-09-2021||World||US, Pakistan face off again on Afghanistan threats||The Taliban's takeover of Kabul has deepened the mutual distrust between the US and Pakistan, putative allies who have tangled over Afghanistan. But both sides still need each other.As the Biden administration looks for new ways to stop terrorist threats in Afghanistan, it probably will look again to Pakistan, which remains critical to US intelligence and national security because of its proximity to Afghanistan and connections to the Taliban leaders now in charge.Over two decades of war, American officials accused Pakistan of playing a double game by promising to fight terrorism and cooperate with Washington while cultivating the Taliban and other extremist groups that attacked US forces in Afghanistan.Islamabad pointed to what it saw as failed promises of a supportive government in Kabul after the US drove the Taliban from power after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as extremist groups took refuge in eastern Afghanistan and launched deadly attacks throughout Pakistan.But the US wants Pakistani cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and could seek permission to fly surveillance flights into Afghanistan or other intelligence cooperation. Pakistan wants US military aid and good relations with Washington, even as its leaders openly celebrate the Taliban's rise to power.“Over the last 20 years, Pakistan has been vital for various logistics purposes for the US military. What’s really been troubling is that, unfortunately, there hasn’t been a lot of trust,” said US Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who is on the House Intelligence Committee. “I think the question is whether we can get over that history to arrive at a new understanding.”Pakistan's prime minister, in remarks Friday to the U.N. General Assembly, made clear there is a long way to go. Imran Khan tried to portray his country as the victim of American ungratefulness for its assistance in Afghanistan over the years. Instead of a mere “word of appreciation,” Pakistan has received blame, Khan said.Former diplomats and intelligence officers from both countries say the possibilities for cooperation are severely limited by the events of the past two decades and Pakistan's enduring competition with India.The previous Afghan government, which was strongly backed by India, routinely accused Pakistan of harboring the Taliban. The new Taliban government includes officials that American officials have long believed are linked to Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said he understood “the temptation of officials in both countries to try and take advantage of the situation” and find common ground. But Haqqani said he expected Pakistan to give “all possible cooperation to the Taliban.”“This has been a moment Pakistan has been waiting for 20 years,” said Haqqani, now at the Hudson Institute think tank. “They now feel that they have a satellite state."US officials are trying to quickly build what President Joe Biden calls an “over the horizon” capacity to monitor and stop terrorist threats.Without a partner country bordering Afghanistan, the US has to fly surveillance drones long distances, limiting the time they can be used to watch over targets. The US also lost most of its network of informants and intelligence partners in the now-deposed Afghan government, making it critical to find common ground with other governments that have more resources in the country.Pakistan could be helpful in that effort by allowing “overflight” rights for American spy planes from the Persian Gulf or permitting the US to base surveillance or counterterrorism teams along its border with Afghanistan. There are few other options among Afghanistan’s neighbors. Iran is a US adversary and Central Asian countries north of Afghanistan all face varying degrees of Russian influence.There are no known agreements so far.CIA Director William Burns visited Islamabad this month to meet with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s army chief, and Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed, who leads the ISI, according to a Pakistani government statement. Burns and Hameed have separately visited Kabul in recent weeks to meet with Taliban leaders. The CIA declined to comment on the visits.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi noted this past week that Islamabad had cooperated with US requests to facilitate peace talks before the Taliban takeover and that it had agreed to US military requests throughout the war.“We have often been criticized for not doing enough,” Qureshi told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “But we’ve not been appreciated enough for having done what was done.”Qureshi would not directly answer whether Pakistan would allow the basing of surveillance equipment or overflight of drones.“They don’t have to be physically there to share intelligence,” he said of the US. “There are smarter ways of doing it."The CIA and ISI have a long history in Afghanistan, dating to their shared goal of arming bands of mujahedeen — “freedom fighters” — against the Soviet Union’s occupation in the 1980s. The CIA sent weapons and money into Afghanistan through Pakistan.Those fighters included Osama bin Laden. Others would become leaders of the Taliban, which emerged victorious from a civil war in 1996 and gained control of most of the country. The Taliban gave refuge to bin Laden and other leaders of al-Qaida, which launched deadly attacks on Americans abroad in 1998 and then struck the US on Sept. 11, 2001.After 9/11, the US immediately sought Pakistan’s cooperation in its fight against al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. Declassified cables published by George Washington University’s National Security Archive show officials in President George W. Bush’s administration made several demands of Pakistan, from intercepting arms shipments heading to al-Qaida to providing the US with intelligence and permission to fly military and intelligence planes over its territory.The CIA would carry out hundreds of drone strikes launched from Pakistan targeting al-Qaida leaders and others alleged to have ties to terrorist groups. Hundreds of civilians died in the strikes, according to figures kept by outside observers, leading to widespread protests and public anger in Pakistan.Pakistan continued to be accused of harboring the Taliban after the US-backed coalition drove the group from power in Kabul. And bin Laden was killed in 2011 by US special forces in a secret raid on a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, home to the country’s military academy. The bin Laden operation led many in the US to question whether Pakistan had harbored bin Laden and angered Pakistanis who felt the raid violated their sovereignty.For years, CIA officials tried to confront their Pakistani counterparts after collecting more proof of Pakistani intelligence officers helping the Taliban move money and fighters into a then-growing insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan, said Douglas London, who oversaw the CIA’s counterterrorism operations in South Asia until 2018.“They would say, ‘You just come to my office, tell me where the location is,’” he said. “They would just usually pay lip service to us and say they couldn’t confirm the intel.”London, author of the forthcoming book “The Recruiter,” said he expected American intelligence would consider limited partnerships with Pakistan on mutual enemies such as al-Qaeda or Islamic State-Khorasan, which took responsibility for the deadly suicide attack outside the Kabul airport last month during the final days of the US evacuation.The risk, London said, is at times “your partner is as much of a threat to you as the enemy who you’re pursuing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pakistan-face-off-again-on-afghanistan-threats-101632680056893.html

26-09-2021||World||Israeli troops kill five Palestinians in West Bank gun battles||Israeli troops conducted a series of arrest raids against suspected Hamas militants across the occupied West Bank early Sunday, sparking a pair of gun battles in which five Palestinians were killed and two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded.It was the deadliest violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the West Bank in several weeks. The region has seen an increase in fighting in recent months, with tensions fueled by Israeli settlement construction, heightened militant activity in the northern West Bank and the aftermath of a bloody war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip last May.The Israeli military said it had been tracking the Hamas militants for several weeks and that the raids were launched in response to immediate threats.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the militants were about to carry out attacks “in real time.” He praised the Israeli forces, saying they acted “as expected. They engaged the enemy and we back them completely.”In a statement, the military said it launched five simultaneous raids and soldiers opened fire after being shot at in two locations. It said five militants were killed and several others were arrested.It also said an officer and a soldier were seriously injured, possibly inadvertently by Israeli fire.The Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were shot dead near the northern West Bank city of Jenin and three others were killed in Biddu, north of Jerusalem.Hamas confirmed that four of the dead, including all three killed in Biddu, were members of the Islamic militant group. Palestinian officials said a 16-year-old boy was also among the dead, though it was not immediately known if he was a militant.The Palestinian Authority, which administers semi-autonomous areas in the West Bank, condemned the killings and said the Israeli government was “fully and directly responsible for this bloody morning and the crimes committed by the occupation forces.”But Hamas also criticized the Palestinian Authority, which maintains security coordination with Israel in a shared struggle against the Islamic group.Hamas spokesman Abdulatif al-Qanou said that recent meetings between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli officials “encouraged the occupation again to pursue the resistance.”Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip after seizing it from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, praised those killed as “heroic martyrs.” It called on its supporters to “devise tactics and means that harm the enemy and drain it with all possible forms of resistance.”Also Sunday, Israel released Khalida Jarrar, a prominent Palestinian lawmaker, after nearly two years in prison. Jarrar, a senior figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, has been in and out of Israeli prisons for years — often without being charged.The PFLP has an armed wing and is considered a terrorist group by Israel and Western countries, but Jarrar has not been implicated in attacks. She was sentenced to two years in prison in March for membership in a banned group but given credit for time already served. She was freed several weeks before her sentence was to end.Recent months have seen a rise in violence in the West Bank, with more than two dozen Palestinians killed in sporadic clashes with Israeli troops and during protests.Many of the clashes have occurred near Beita, a Palestinian village where residents regularly demonstrate against an unauthorized settlement outpost, and near Jenin, which is known as a militant stronghold.Last month, Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen during a late night raid in Jenin, killing four Palestinians. Sunday's clashes came a week after Israel recaptured the last of six Palestinian fugitives who tunneled out of a maximum-security Israeli prison earlier this month. The escapees were from Jenin, and two were caught there after an extensive search.Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has established dozens of settlements where nearly 500,000 settlers reside. The Palestinians seek the West Bank as part of their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to resolving the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-troops-kill-five-palestinians-in-west-bank-gun-battles-101632677781744.html
26-09-2021||World||German elections: Projections show polls are too close to call||The center-left Social Democrats lead the conservative CDU/CSU bloc by 0.2%, according to initial projected results. In such a tight race, the possibilities for a coalition are still unclear.The first projected results are in for Germany's 2021 federal election, with the the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on 24.9%, narrowly ahead of the center-right Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party (CDU/CSU) on 24.7%. However, the conservatives are projected to win one more seat than the SPD.The environmentalist Greens were in third position on 14.8%. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) were on 11.3%, just ahead of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) on 11.2%. The socialist Left party is on 5%.The projections suggest the center-left parties were the biggest winners of the election. The SPD gained 4.5% compared to their result in the last federal election in 2017, while the Greens were up over 6%.The conservative bloc suffered heavy losses as the Angela Merkel era comes to an end. They were down by almost 8% on the previous election and are heading towards their worst result since 1949.What this meansIn such a tight race, coalition possibilities remain unclear.According to these projections, one option is a continuation of the "grand coalition" of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the SPD that has ruled Germany since 2013.Other options could see a three-way coalition between the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP.Alternatively, the SPD could also seek to partner up with the Greens and the FDP.The election of Germany's new chancellor by the Bundestag won't take place until a governing coalition has been formed. This could take months.In the meantime, Angela Merkel will remain in office in a caretaker role.What the parties are sayingThe general secretary of the Social Democrats, Lars Klingbeil, says his party "is back again" following the release of exit polls that put the SPD in a dead heat with Merkel's conservatives."The SPD has the mandate to govern," he told public broadcaster ZDF. "We want [SPD chancellor candidate] Olaf Scholz to be chancellor."CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet said the conservative bloc would do "everything we can" to form a new government, despite the election setback.Greens federal political director Michael Kellner, meanwhile, expressed disappointment for his party's performance."We have clearly made gains," he told ZDF. "But it is difficult for me to be really happy about this increase."He congratulated the SPD "on a great electoral success" and called the CDU's performance "historically bad."How does the election work?The German electoral system produces coalition governments. It seeks to unite the principles of majority rule and proportional representation. Each voter casts two ballots. The first is for what is called a "direct" candidate from their constituency and the second is for a political party.Any party that gets more than 5% of the votes is guaranteed a place in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag. This ensures that both big and small parties are represented, but has led to the legislature becoming the second-biggest in the world with a possible 900 seats this time around.The reason is Germany's complicated electoral law, and the mandates for the "overhang" seats (Überhangmandate) and compensation "leveling" seats (Ausgleichsmandate) that assure the composition of the Bundestag will be proportionate to the actual votes for the parties.How long will it take to form a coalition?The process of forming could take weeks, or even months.Coalition negotiations in 2017 were the longest in German history, leaving the country without a government for almost six months. This is because the FDP walked out of talks between the CDU and the Green party after a month of negotiations. For the last eight years, the two biggest parties, the CDU and the SPD, have governed together with Angela Merkel as chancellor.It remains to be seen if the process will go quicker this time — especially if the political priorities of the partners are more closely aligned.How is the chancellor chosen?The parties put forward their candidate ahead of the election campaign. Once a new government is in place, the German president nominates a chancellor to be elected by the Bundestag. This is typically the main candidate from the senior coalition partner in the newly-formed government.To be elected, the chancellor candidate needs an absolute majority from lawmakers. So far, all chancellors, including Merkel, have been elected in the first round.Can an election be contested?In Germany, any eligible voter can contest elections. They must send a written formal objection to the election review commission with the Bundestag in Berlin within two months of election day.This commission processes all submissions. A decision is made on each individual challenge, and each objector receives feedback from the Bundestag. The entire procedure can take up to one year.To invalidate the results of a Bundestag election, an objection must meet two requirements. Firstly, there must be an electoral error that violates the Federal Election Act, the Federal Election Code, or the Constitution. Secondly, the reported electoral error would have to have an impact on the distribution of seats in the Bundestag.Objectors can also contest the findings of the election review commission and go all the way to the Federal Constitutional Court.A German national vote has never been declared invalid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-elections-projections-show-polls-are-too-close-to-call-101632677576431.html
26-09-2021||World||Technical issues resolved: Taliban urge international airlines to resume flights||The Taliban urged international airlines Sunday to resume flights to Kabul, saying all technical issues at the country's main airport have been resolved.Facilities at Kabul airport were badly damaged in the chaotic evacuation of more than 120,000 people that ended August 30 with the withdrawal of the last US troops.Since then only charter flights have been operating, although Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Iran's Mahan Air and Afghanistan's Kam Air have run a limited number of special flights.The international community is keen to hold the Taliban to their word that they will allow anyone to leave the country once commercial flights resume.At present airlines such as PIA and Kam Air are charging more than $1,200 for a one-way, 40-minute flight from Kabul to Islamabad.Also Read | Kabul Airport returns to action, plane with civilians flies outEven at that price -- the result of war insurance, according to the airlines -- the irregular flights are heavily oversubscribed.Abdul Qahar Balkhi, newly appointed spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs, said the Taliban hoped proper commercial services would resume shortly."Many Afghan citizens were stuck outside and unable to return to their homeland," he said in a statement."Moreover, many Afghan citizens who have international employment or pursue education abroad are now facing difficulties in reaching their destinations."Services at Kabul airport were restored mostly with technical help from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/technical-issues-resolved-taliban-urge-international-airlines-to-resume-flights-101632675864313.html
26-09-2021||World||German elections: Merkel's center-right bloc sees worst result since 1949||Germany's center-left Social Democrats were locked in a very close race Sunday with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right bloc, which is heading toward its worst result since 1949 in the country's parliamentary election, exit polls showed.Officials from both parties said they hope to lead Germany's next government and have their candidates succeed Merkel, who has been in power since 2005.An exit poll for ARD public television put voters' support at 25% each for the Social Democrats — which is putting forth outgoing Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz for chancellor — and Merkel’s Union bloc under would-be successor state governor Armin Laschet.Another exit poll for ZDF public television put the Social Democrats ahead by 26% to 24%. Both put the environmentalist Greens in third place with about 15% support. Those results would be the worst for the Union bloc in post-World War II Germany.The electoral system typically produces coalition governments but post-war Germany has never previously seen a winning party take less than the 31% of the vote that the Union won in 1949. That was also the center-right bloc's worst result until now.Given the exit poll predictions, putting together the next coalition government for Europe’s biggest economy could be a lengthy and complicated process. Merkel will remain as a caretaker leader until a new government is in place.The exit polls also put support for the business-friendly Free Democrats at 11-12% and the Left Party at 5%. The far-right Alternative for Germany party — which no other party wants to work with — was seen winning up to 11% of the vote.The general secretary of Laschet's Christian Democratic Union, Paul Ziemiak, acknowledged that his bloc had suffered “bitter losses” compared with the last election four years ago, in which it scored 32.9% of the vote. But he said it would be a “long election evening” and pointed to the possibility of a coalition with the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats.His Social Democrat counterpart, Lars Klingbeil, declared that his party “is back” after languishing for years in the polls and scoring only 20.5% of the vote in 2017. He said "with this, we have the mission to form a coalition.” He wouldn't say which coalition partners would be approached.Scholz could also form a coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats, if the exit polls hold up. The Greens traditionally lean toward Scholz's party and the Free Democrats toward Laschet's. In German elections, the party that finishes first is best-placed, but not guaranteed, to provide the next chancellor.The Social Democrats have been boosted by Scholz's relative popularity after a long poll slump, and by his rivals' troubled campaigns. The Greens' first candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, suffered from early gaffes and Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, struggled to motivate his party's traditional base.The Greens' general secretary, Michael Kellner, said “we gained considerably, but it’s hard for me to really enjoy it.” He noted that his party has said it prefers to work with the Social Democrats, but said “we are ready to speak with all democratic parties to see what’s possible."Another possible governing combination would be a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition" of Germany's traditional big parties, the Union and Social Democrats, under whichever of Scholz or Laschet finishes ahead. But neither of the rivals is likely to have much appetite for that after forming an often-tense alliance for 12 of Merkel's 16 years in power.About 60.4 million people in the nation of 83 million were eligible to elect the new Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, which will elect the next head of government.Merkel won't be an easy leader to follow, for she has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises. Her successor will have to oversee the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.Laschet insists there should be no tax increases as Germany pulls out of the pandemic. Scholz and Baerbock favor tax hikes for the richest Germans, and also back an increase in the minimum wage.Germany's leading parties have significant differences in their proposals for tackling climate change. Laschet’s Union bloc is pinning its hopes on technological solutions and a market-driven approach, while the Greens want to ramp up carbon prices and end the use of coal earlier than planned. Scholz has emphasized the need to protect jobs as Germany transitions to greener energy.Foreign policy did not feature much in the campaign, although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-elections-merkel-s-center-right-bloc-sees-worst-result-since-1949-101632675696955.html

The speech went viral on social media as many termed this fake news. Imran Khan, in his speech, also mentioned that this is "according to some reports".Here is what Imran Khan said: "Pakistan and the United States trained mujahideen groups to fight for the liberation of Afghanistan. Amongst those mujahideen groups was al Qaeda, various groups from all over the world. There were mujahideen, Afghan mujahideen. These were considered heroes. President Ronald Reagan invited them to the White House in 1983. And according to a news item, he compared them to the founding fathers of the United States. They were heroes," Imran Khan said.PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif said that the video puts all doubts to rest that Imran Khan always trusted fake news over facts. "The embarrassing gaffe about President Reagan's remarks on Afghan Mujahideen has cemented his incompetence and shows his ignorance," Shehbaz Sharif wrote on Twitter. If there was any doubt left that PM has always trusted fake news over facts, it was laid to rest. The embarrassing gaffe about President Reagan's remarks on Afghan Mujahideen has cemented his incompetence & shows his ignorance.Maryam Nawaz Sharif commented that Imran Khan, instead of his speechwriter, should be fired.

There is anguish over the rising rate of unemployment and the hike in prices of day-to-day items in the three years since the PTI has been in power,” she further said.On Friday, speaking at the launch of the Digital Media Development Programme, Khan claimed that during his tenure, 70 per cent of media content was against his government. “We are not affected by the free judiciary and free media as our administration is not corrupt and not breaking any laws at all,” he was quoted as saying by Dawn.The Pakistan prime minister also said that the extent to which the media enjoyed freedom under him could be gauged by the number of channels that are “anti-government” and “pro-government” since 2018, when he was elected to the top post.Hence, the PTI’s founder-chairperson said that his government was the first to give “complete freedom” to the media.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/left-no-chance-to-control-ppp-slams-imran-khan-s-comment-on-media-freedom-101632651679133.html

It is difficult to find certain cereals, while many require pharmaceuticals,” a resident of the Afghan capital was quoted as saying.Fuel prices, too, have risen significantly, another Kabul resident, a driver, said. “Gasoline prices have increased by 20 to 40 per cent as against those during early August,” the driver said, referring to the time when the Ashraf Ghani-led government was still in power, though it was under tremendous pressure from Taliban forces advancing rapidly towards the city. “People who support their daily needs by driving taxis and small shuttle buses hardly earn anything because of the fuel price hike,” he further said.Restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from banks have led to further complications, the reported stated. Not more than 20,000 Afghanis (national currency) can be withdrawn from banks, the regime has ruled.“The issue of survival is now at the forefront, and the threat of misery is the primary cause of our despair,” yet another resident said.This is for the second time when the Taliban has come to power in the war-torn nation. Its' first rule, from 1996 to 2001, ended at the hands of the US-led forces which arrived here following the 9/11 attacks. The United States completed the pullout of all its troops in Afghanistan on August 30, a day before self-imposed August 31 deadline. (With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-residents-struggling-due-to-price-rise-medicine-shortage-under-taliban-report-101632647112663.html

26-09-2021||World||World Environmental Health Day 2021: History, significance of day dedicated to our surroundings||Since 2011, September 26 is observed annually as World Environmental Health Day across the globe. It was established that year by the International Federation of Environmental Health (IFEH), a body of 44 member states, with a goal to raise awareness regarding the health of our environment.Every year, the occasion is marked under a special theme, with that for the current edition being “Prioritising environmental health for healthier communities in the global recovery.” The “global recovery” here refers to that from the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The theme is based on the “Manifesto for a healthy recovery from Covid-19” which was released by the World Health Organization on May 26, 2020, and which, according to IFEH, is based on six key ideas.Speaking ahead of World Environmental Health Day, 2021, Susana Paixao, who heads the IFEH, said, “It is necessary for the world to understand that there is an integral connection between the environment, health and economy. Hence, it becomes important to invest in healthy and green recovery, close to all communities, with support from the environmental health workforce, and in collaboration with our organisation. This is how we selected the theme for this year.”Meanwhile, the tagline for September 26 last year was “Environmental health, a key public health intervention in disease pandemic prevention.”As always, various events will take place across the world in connection with the occasion, with the environmental body urging national governments to hold programmes to mark the day. The central theme behind the celebrations is to determine and minimise factors that contribute to the deterioration of environmental health.Headquartered in London, the IFEH was established in 1986. Its work is focused on scientific and technical research on environmental health, and exchange of ideas on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-environmental-health-day-2021-history-significance-of-day-dedicated-to-our-surroundings-101632626391388.html
26-09-2021||World||Russia in sync with US, China, Pakistan on Taliban issue; working to ensure promises are kept||Russia, China, Pakistan, and the United States are working together to ensure that Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers keep their promises, especially to form a genuinely representative government and prevent extremism from spreading, Russia's foreign minister said Saturday.Sergey Lavrov said the four countries are in ongoing contact. He said representatives from Russia, China, and Pakistan recently traveled to Qatar and then to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, to engage with both the Taliban and representatives of “secular authorities” — former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who headed the ousted government's negotiating council with the Taliban.Lavrov said the interim government announced by the Taliban does not reflect “the whole gamut of Afghan society — ethnoreligious and political forces — so we are engaging in contacts. They are ongoing.”The Taliban have promised an inclusive government, a more moderate form of Islamic rule than when they last ruled the country from 1996 to 2001 including respecting women's rights, providing stability after 20 years of war, fighting terrorism and extremism, and stopping militants from using their territory to launch attacks. But recent moves suggest they may be returning to more repressive policies, particularly toward women and girls.“What's most important ... is to ensure that the promises that they have proclaimed publicly to be kept,” Lavrov said. “And for us, that is the top priority.”At a wide-ranging news conference and in his speech afterward at the UN General Assembly, Lavrov criticized the Biden administration including for its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.He said the US and Nato pullout “was carried out without any consideration of the consequences ... that there are many weapons left in Afghanistan.”It remains critical, he said, that such weapons aren't used for “destructive purposes.”Later, in his assembly speech, Lavrov accused the United States and its Western allies of “persistent attempts to diminish the UN's role in resolving the key problems of today or to sideline it or to make it a malleable tool for promoting someone's selfish interests."As an example, Lavrov said Germany and France recently announced the creation of an Alliance For Multilateralism “even though what kind of structure could be more multilateral than the United Nations?”The United States is also sidestepping the UN, he said, pointing to the recent US announcement of a “Summit for Democracy" despite, Lavrov said, US President Joe Biden's pledge this week “that the US is not seeking a world divided into opposing blocs.”“It goes without saying that Washington is going to choose the participants by itself, thus hijacking the right to decide to what degree a country meets the standards of democracy,” Lavrov said.“Essentially, this initiative is quite in the spirit of a Cold War, as it declares a new ideological crusade against all dissenters.”Lavrov was asked for Russia's reaction to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning last week that the world could be plunged into a new Cold War potentially more dangerous than the lengthy one between the US and the former Soviet Union unless the United States and China repair their “totally dysfunctional” relationship.He replied: “Of course, we see the tension tightening in relations between China and the United States." He expressed “great concern" at the rising tensions, pointing to the Biden administration's recently proclaimed Indo-Pacific strategy — whose objectives, he said, include “deterring China's development,” disputes over the South China Sea, and the recent US-Britain deal to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.More broadly, Lavrov said, relations among the big powers must be “respectful." He emphasized that Russia was “keen to ensure that never will these relations morph into nuclear war.”The major powers have a “great responsibility,” he said, to negotiate and make compromises on the critical issues facing the world and that Russia is now “revitalizing” its proposal for a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — Russia, China, US, UK, and France. He said discussions are underway on specific questions for an agenda, and “we may perhaps begin with an online meeting.”On other global issues, the United States has been pressing for Iran to resume nuclear negotiations, but Lavrov said it was then-President Donald Trump who pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement, so to declare that “time is running out, anybody could say this — but not Washington.”In his first speech to the General Assembly earlier this week, new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi criticized the United States but appeared not to rule out a return to the negotiating table for the nuclear accord, saying Iran considers talks useful if their ultimate outcome is the lifting of all sanctions. Still, he stated: “We don't trust the promises made by the US government.”Lavrov said Russia would like to see the resumption of negotiations to restore the original agreement as soon as possible. “We have a very serious hope -- and I think this is well-founded optimism -- that we will achieve results," he said, because “this is something everybody wants."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-in-sync-with-us-china-pakistan-on-taliban-issue-working-to-ensure-promises-are-kept-101632621344619.html
26-09-2021||World||US: Seattle-Chicago Amtrak train derails in Montana; at least 3 dead, several injured||At least three people were killed on Saturday afternoon when an Amtrak train that runs between Seattle and Chicago derailed in north-central Montana, an official with the Liberty County Sheriff's Office said.Dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak said in a statement that there were multiple injuries.The Empire Builder train derailed at 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) north of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.The train had about 147 passengers and 13 crew members onboard, Abrams said.Megan Vandervest, a passenger on the train who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.“My first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,” said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis.“My second thought was that's crazy. We wouldn't be derailing. Like, that doesn't happen.”She told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted over, the one behind that was entirely tipped over, and the three cars behind that “had completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.”Speaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like “extreme turbulence on a plane.”Amtrak was working with the local authorities to transport injured passengers and safely evacuate all other passengers, Abrams added.Photos posted to social media showed several cars on their sides. Passengers were standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage.The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-seattle-chicago-amtrak-train-derails-in-montana-several-injured-101632621000487.html

The two kidnapping victims were released unharmed, he said.Herat resident Mohammad Nazir said he had been shopping for food near the city’s Mostofiat Square when he heard a loudspeaker announcement calling for people’s attention. “When I stepped forward, I saw they had brought a body in a pickup truck, then they hung it up on a crane.”Footage of the bloodstained corpse, swinging on the crane was widely shared on social media, showing a note pinned to the man’s chest saying, “This is the punishment for kidnapping”.No other bodies were visible but social media posts said others were hung up in other parts of the city. According to the official Bakhtar news agency, eight kidnappers were also arrested in a separate incident in Uruzgan province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hang-up-kidnappers-bodies-in-public-in-herat-101632598861753.html
26-09-2021||World||Pakistan hits out at America at UN over fallout of its ‘war on terror’||Prime Minister Imran Khan sought to cast Pakistan as the victim of American ungratefulness and international double standards in his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday.In a pre-recorded speech aired during the evening, the Pakistani prime minister touched upon a range of topics that included the climate crisis, global Islamophobia and “the plunder of the developing world by their corrupt elites” - the latter of which he likened to what the East India Company did to India.The cricketer-turned-politician was indignant and plaintive as he painted the United States as a country that abandoned both Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan.“For the current situation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe,” Khan said. “From this platform, I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan when we joined the US war on terror after 9/11 (the 2001 terror attacks in the US).”He launched into a narrative that began with the US and Pakistan training “mujahideen” - regarded as heroes by the likes of then US president Ronald Reagan, he said - during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But Pakistan was left to pick up the pieces - millions of refugees and new sectarian militant groups - when the Soviets and the Americans left in 1989.Khan said the US sanctioned its former partner a year later, but then came calling again after the 9/11 attacks. Khan said Pakistan’s help to the US cost 80,000 Pakistani lives and caused internal strife and dissent directed at the state, all while the US conducted drone attacks.“So, when we hear this at the end. There is a lot of worry in the US about taking care of the interpreters and everyone who helped the US,” he said, referring to Afghanistan. “What about us?” Instead of a “word of appreciation”, Pakistan has only received blame, Khan rued.Myanmar won’t address, but Afghanistan willNo representative from Myanmar is scheduled to address the General Assembly, a UN spokesman said on Friday, amid rival claims for the country’s UN seat in New York after a military coup ousted the elected government.Competing claims have also been made on Afghanistan’s UN seat after the Taliban seized power last month. The ambassador for the ousted Afghan government is set to give his speech on Monday.“At this point, Myanmar is not speaking,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Myanmar’s current UN ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun - appointed by Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted government - had initially been expected to address the General Assembly on Monday.But diplomats said China, Russia and the US had reached an understanding, where Moscow and Beijing will not object to Kyaw Moe Tun remaining in Myanmar’s UN seat for the moment as long as he does not speak during the meeting.Dujarric said that “for now, the Afghanistan representative inscribed on the list for Monday is Mr. Ghulam M. Isaczai”. Isaczai is the current United Nations ambassador, who represents Afghanistan’s government that was recently ousted by the Taliban group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hits-out-at-america-at-un-over-fallout-of-its-war-on-terror-101632598538820.html
26-09-2021||World||Nations backing terror must know it’ll hurt them too: PM||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday cautioned the UN General Assembly (UNGA) about countries with “regressive thinking” that are using terrorism as a “political tool” and called for efforts to ensure no country takes advantage of the “delicate situation” in Afghanistan for “its own selfish interests”. He did not name any county, but he was clearly pointing to Pakistan.Addressing the UNGA in Hindi, Narendra Modi called for the protection of oceans and ocean resources from the “race for expansion and exclusion” saying they must be used and not abused and they are a lifeline of international trade. Once again, he did not name any country, but this was a clear to China’s increasing aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.
