Reports said the men had kidnapped a local businessman and his son. In its earlier regime too, the Taliban were notorious for their extreme punishments and their public display, the aim of which is to deter similar crime.Here are the punishments that the Taliban are known for> Execution was for convicted murderers. Reports said that the victim's family were asked to kill the convicted murderers usually by a single shot to the head. The victims could also accept 'blood money' and allow the culprit to live.> As evident from the bodies hanging, the punishment for kidnapping will also be death. In recent weeks, men have been packed into a truck with their hands tied and were paraded around subjecting them to humiliation. > Faces have been painted and stale bread have been hung from the necks of some criminals, though their crime was not known, reports said. This is the practice of public-shaming culprits. > In the earlier regime, for convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of one hand.> For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.Apart from these, the Taliban inflicted some exceptional punishment during its earlier regime. A women's thumb was reportedly chopped off because she was wearing nail polish. Public execution was also held.So, what changes?Taliban leader, in charge of the prisons, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi said these punishments are 'essential' for security. Other countries stand to interfere in these issues and the Taliban are not commenting on their law and order system. The one-eyed and the one-legged Taliban leader said this time judges will adjudicate cases though the principle will be Sharia law. All punishments will remain the same.Turabi was notorious for his punishments and the band of men who used to ensure that those punishments are delivered immediately. Reports said when the Taliban took power in 1996, he screamed at a woman journalist, ordering her to leave the room full of men. One man objected and was slapped by Turabi.At that time, he used to rip music tapes from cars, forced men to wear turbans in all government offices and his enforcers routinely beat men whose beards had been trimmed.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kidnappers-body-hung-in-public-view-punishment-that-taliban-are-bringing-back-in-afghanistan-101632588226185.html

The Taliban, which rules the country as Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, have launched an investigation.Reports claim that the person killed was a member of Taliban. The incident took place when a Taliban convoy hit a roadside mine.Though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, an affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) is believed to be behind it. The terror group has claimed the attacks on Taliban earlier too.The ISKP is headquartered in eastern Afghanistan.On Thursday, unidentified gunmen, believed to be from ISKP, shot and killed four Taliban members inside a car. Locals in the Farmi Hada area discovered the dead bodies with their hands tied.On Wednesday, several explosions and an armed attack occurred in Jalalabad again, resulting in the death of five people, two of whom were Taliban.Earlier this month, three people were killed and 19 others injured in an explosion in Jalalabad. The next day, a bomb went off in the same city in the area of the bus station.Two civilians died, and one Taliban supporter was wounded in that blast. The ISKP took responsibility for the explosions for those blasts too.Taliban members continue to maintain enhanced security measures on the major roads within the city limits of Jalalabad.The Taliban have battled with the Islamic State since its emergence in Afghanistan in 2014. The burgeoning ISKP has claimed responsibility for most recent attacks, including the horrific bombing outside the Kabul airport that killed 13 US service personnel and 169 Afghans during last month's chaotic evacuations.The ISKP has adopted many of the Taliban's tactics of urban warfare that marked their own successful guerrilla campaign in the 1990s.While Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has downplayed the threat, saying that Islamic State had no effective presence in Afghanistan, commanders on the ground do not dismiss the threat so lightly.ISKP is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-vs-iskp-in-nangarhar-s-jalalabad-one-killed-in-blast-101632581023513.html
25-09-2021||World||UK expected to relax visa rules, here's why||Britain is expected to announce plans to issue temporary work visas to truck drivers to ease an acute labour shortage that has led to fuel rationing at hundreds of gas stations and long queues to fill up - with pumps running dry in some places.As retailers warned of significant disruption in the run-up to Christmas, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said it was looking at temporary measures to address the shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.Newspapers reported that the government would allow up to 5,000 foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out.The UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says Britain needs 100,000 more drivers if it is to meet demand.Shortages of truckers have been caused partly by Brexit and COVID-19, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year."We're looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited," a spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.Downing Street declined to give further details.Ministers have cautioned against panic buying, and oil companies say there is no shortage of supplies, merely problems delivering the fuel to gas stations.However, there were long lines of vehicles at filling stations as motorists rushed out to fill up, and some forecourts closed as their supplies ran out.The issue came to the fore after BP said it had to close some of its outlets due to the driver shortages, with Shell and ExxonMobil's Esso also reporting problems with supplies.EG Group, which runs 341 forecourts across Britain, said on Friday it would impose a purchase limit of 30 pounds ($41) per customer for fuel due to the "unprecedented customer demand"."I regret what we're seeing at the forecourt," Huw Merriman, chairman of parliament's transport committee, told BBC TV."I was out on my bike ... and came past my BP garage and it was chaos. As soon as the message gets out there might be a fuel shortage, people understandably react."One police force said long queues were a potential hazard, blocking roads for emergency vehicles.Downing Street said the country had "ample fuel stocks"."The public should be reassured there are no shortages," the spokeswoman said. "But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary COVID-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."The fuel issue comes as Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy, also grapples with a spike in European natural gas costs causing soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch.Other countries across Europe as well as the United States are also dealing with truck driver shortages, and industry figures have warned there was no guarantee that a change to the visa process would see foreign drivers coming to Britain."We'll have to see if we can attract people for a short period of time," Merriman said.Britain says the long-term solution is for more British drivers to be hired, with the RHA saying better pay and conditions are needed to attract people into the industry.But retailers have warned that unless the government acts to address the shortage in the next 10 days, then significant disruption is inevitable in the run-up to Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expected-to-relax-visa-rules-here-s-why-101632571362188.html

We have a lot to do here’: Bill Gates explains why he is not ‘trying to escape planet earth in a spaceship’||Bill Gates, during his recent appearance in an American late night talk show, was asked about his thoughts on billionaires investing in space travel and in response, he said that he has become obsessed with eradicating diseases here on earth rather than with space.James Corden, the host of the Late Late Show with James Corden, hosted Gates in his show earlier on September 23 to talk about the climate crisis. However, what started as a casual joke, ended with a response from Gates, which the host called the “classiest burn.”Corden opened the talk by thanking Gates for being the “one billionaire who is not trying to escape planet earth on a spaceship at the moment.” When asked about why billionaires were “obsessed with” space travel at the moment, Gates’ reply was “I don’t know. I have become obsessed with things like Malaria and HIV and getting rid of those diseases and I would probably bore people at cocktail parties talking about diseases. Space? You know, we have a lot to do here on earth.” During the remainder of the interview, Gates called upon being optimistic and the combined efforts of all people to tackle the climate crisis.The reference by Corden in his question to Gates is apparently to the recent space flights by billionaires Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and Richard Branson, Virgin group’s founder back in July. Also another billionaire Jared Issacman led the Inspiration4 mission, which has been described as “world’s first all-civilian orbital mission to space.” The flight was on a Dragon capsule and a SpaceX rocket built by another billionaire Elon Musk. While the contributions of these missions to space exploration has been largely appreciated, it has also received some criticism.Earlier in the week, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres during his opening speech at the UN general assembly called out the gap between the rich and the poor with “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth.”However, Bezos and Musk have both defended their decisions and acknowledged the criticism at them. Bezos said that his critics were “largely right” and said “We have to do both. We have lots of problems here and now on Earth and we need to work on those and we also need to look to the future, we’ve always done that as a species and as a civilization. We have to do both,” the Guardian quoted him as saying earlier in July.Meanwhile, Musk, who is yet to go into space, has said, “I think we should spend the vast majority of our resources solving problems on Earth. Like, 99% plus of our economy should be dedicated to solving problems on earth,” in a Netflix documentary about Inspiration4. “But I think maybe something like 1%, or less than 1%, could be applied to extending life beyond earth,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/space-we-have-a-lot-to-do-here-bill-gates-explains-why-he-is-not-trying-to-escape-planet-earth-in-a-spaceship-101632572036222.html
25-09-2021||World||Taliban hang dead body from crane in main square of Afghanistan’s Herat city: Report||Despite repeated assurances of respecting human rights, the Taliban hanged a dead body from a crane in the main square of Afghanistan’s Herat city, The Associated Press reported on Saturday citing a witness. The report suggests that the Sunni Pashtun fighters brought four bodies to the main square of Afghanistan’s third-largest city and moved three of them to other squares for displaying in public.After bringing the body to the main square, the Taliban announced that the four were caught in a kidnapping attempt and killed by police, according to the witness named Wazir Ahmad Seddiqi. The Taliban are yet to make any official announcement related to the public display of killings. However, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, who was responsible for the enforcing of Taliban’s harsh interpretation of Sharia law during their previous rule, said that they will carry out executions and amputations again, reported AP.The Islamists fundamentalists have reestablished the dreaded 'Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice' which ordered some of the most brutal killings from 1996-2001. It was notorious for enforcing the stricter interpretation of Sharia law and punishing the violators in a manner contradictory to international laws on human rights.A Taliban official recently told the New York Post that the new regime will punish the violators as per the “Islamic rules”. Explaining the provision for punishment, Mohammad Yusuf, who claims to be responsible for the “central zone” of Afghanistan, said that a person intentionally committing murder will be killed but there might be other kinds of punishment if the murder is not intentional.Yusuf said that the hands of thieves would be cut off, while those involved in “illegal intercourse” will be stoned, reported New York Post. Flogging, stoning, amputating even publicly executing people were common in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s rule from 1996-2001. While the Islamist hardliners are attempting to project a different face, the international community is closely monitoring the reports of killings and abuses since the Taliban.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hang-dead-body-from-crane-in-main-square-of-afghanistan-s-herat-city-report-101632569732801.html

Amongst those Mujahideen groups were al Qaeda, were various groups from all over the world..these were considered heroes," Imran Khan said."Come 1989, the Soviets leave. So do the Americans.. Pakistan was left with 5 million Afghan refugees. We were left with sectarian militant groups which never existed before. And a year later, Pakistan was sanctioned by the US. We felt used," Imran Khan said.Imran Khan says world should give Taliban more time, US misunderstood Haqqanis"Fast forward 9/11. Pakistan is needed again by the US because now they are invading Afghanistan and that can't happen with the logistical support of Pakistan. What happens after that? The same Mujahideen that we have trained that fighting for occupation was a sacred duty, they turned against us. We were called collaborators," the Pakistan PM said.
25-09-2021||World||Iceland goes to polls as its government fights to retain majority||Iceland votes on Saturday in an election that could see its unprecedented left-right coalition lose its majority, despite bringing four years of stability after a decade of crises.With the political landscape more splintered than ever, the process of forming a new coalition could be more complicated than in the past.Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, whose Left-Green Movement had never led a government before, is seeking a second mandate but a large number of parties could get in her way.Opinion polls suggest a record nine parties out of 10 are expected to win seats in the Althing, Iceland's almost 1,100-year-old parliament.That makes it particularly tricky to predict which parties could end up forming a coalition."It is challenging for the politicians but I think for democracy it is better to have everyone at the table," Thorsteinn Thorvaldsson, a 54-year-old voter, told AFP on the eve of the election."When I was younger it was simpler, there were four parties, now we have 10. But it is interesting," he said.With 33 of 63 seats, the outgoing coalition is a mix of the conservative Independence Party, the center-right Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement.'Different opportunities'Some opinion polls suggest the current coalition will manage to secure a very narrow majority but others say it will fail."Because there are so many parties, I think there will be a lot of different opportunities to form a government," Prime Minister Jakobsdottir told AFP in an interview this week.While she is broadly popular, her party is hovering around 10-12 percent in the polls and risks losing several seats.During her four-year term, Jakobsdottir has introduced a progressive income tax system, increased the social housing budget, and extended parental leave for both parents.She has also been hailed for her handling of the Covid crisis, with just 33 deaths in the country of 370,000.But she has also had to make concessions to keep the peace in her coalition, including a promise to create a national park in central Iceland which is home to 32 active volcano systems and 400 glaciers.This is only the second time since 2008 that a government has made it to the end of its four-year mandate on the sprawling island.Deep public distrust of politicians amid repeated scandals sent Icelanders to the polls five times from 2007 to 2017.'Free-for-all'The Independence Party, which polls credit with around 20-24 percent of votes, also risks losing seats but is expected to remain the largest political party.Its leader, Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, is a former prime minister who comes from a family that has long held power on the right.He is eyeing the post of prime minister.Benediktsson has survived several political scandals, including being implicated in the 2016 Panama Papers leak that revealed offshore tax havens, and is standing in his fifth election."I'm optimistic, I feel supported," he told a campaign rally this week, insisting his party would continue to be "the backbone of the next government".But there are five other parties all hot on his heels, credited with 10 to 15 percent of votes.They are the Left-Green Movement, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Alliance, the libertarian Pirate Party, and the center-right Reform Party. A new Socialist Party is also expected to put in a strong showing."There is not a clear alternative to this government. If it falls and they can't continue, then it's just a free-for-all to create a new coalition," political scientist Eirikur Bergmann said.First early results are expected on Saturday shortly after voting stations close at 10:00 pm (2200 GMT), but a clear picture is not expected to emerge until the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iceland-goes-to-polls-as-its-government-fights-to-retain-majority-101632557164989.html
25-09-2021||World||China welcomes release of Meng Wanzhou, quiet on release of two Canadian ‘spies’||China on Saturday welcomed the release of Huawei chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou from home detention in Canada but remained all but silent on the release of two Canadians from Chinese jails in what appeared to be a surprise quid pro quo settlement between the two countries.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian wrote “welcome back” on his Twitter-like Weibo page while quoting a line from the official news agency, Xinhua, on Meng Wanzhou’s release. “Through unremitting efforts of the Chinese government, Meng Wanzhou has already left Canada on a charter flight organised by the Chinese government,” the Xinhua news agency reported.“Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese business executive who had been arbitrarily detained for more than 1,000 days in Canada, shared her thoughts and expressed her appreciation on a Chinese-government charter flight bringing her home,” Xinhua said.Another senior Chinese diplomat Liu Xiaoming tweeted, “Welcome home. Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.”Chinese state media turned Meng Wanzhou’s release into a victory for China and the ruling Communist Party of China, publishing quotes from Meng during her return flight in which she repeatedly thanked the party.“It is pitch dark outside. I am in the sky over the Arctic, heading home,” Meng Wanzhou said in comments widely circulating in Chinese social media on Saturday. “I will soon return to the embrace of the motherland.”“Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, my home country is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day. Without a strong motherland, I won’t have my freedom today,” she said.Meng Wanzhou described the motherland, the party and the government as the shining light that has lit up “the darkest moments” of her life and led her on the long journey home.Meng Wanzhou also expressed gratitude to her family, colleagues and every well-wisher. “Despite all twists and turns, this returning journey is the sweetest journey home,” she said, according to Xinhua.In a commentary on the release, national broadcaster CGTN said: “The detention of Meng Wanzhou should never have happened - and a similar situation should never happen again. International arrest warrants should be used for criminals, not for pawns in the political game of thrones. Business or even international ties of any sort between nations cannot function if business executives are targets for bogus charges to help pursue political goals.”A report in the Global Times said the cases of Meng Wanzhou and the two arrested Canadians were different - and hence the simultaneous release should not be interpreted as “hostage diplomacy”.The tabloid wrote the story quoting Canadian media. “On the same day Meng flew back home, Canadian media outlets reported that two Canadians - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - left China on a plane back to Canada,” the Global Times report said.“Kovrig was accused of using an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig,” state media had reported in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-welcomes-release-of-meng-wanzhou-quiet-on-release-of-two-canadian-spies-101632559515837.html
25-09-2021||World||EU proposes universal charger for mobiles: The reason and why Apple is unhappy?||The European Union is pushing for the adoption of a universal charging cord for mobile devices that could end the hoarding of different cables to just find the right one. The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, proposed a legislation on Thursday that would mandate USB-C cables for chargingThe move is not just to bring cheer to the people who have to search through a heap of cables to find that one cord that would fit their phone, but to reduce the carbon footprint too. The EU wants to cut down on the 11,000 metric tons of electronic waste thrown out every year by Europeans.The move, however, has been criticised by tech giant Apple, which used its own lightning port for iPhones and some other devices.What the EU is proposing?The draft rules call for having a 'universal' charger for devices. It also advocates standardising fast charging technology and giving consumers the right to choose whether to buy new devices with or without a charger. The EU estimates that the move will save consumers 250 million euros (USD 293 million) a year.The European Commission cited a study which said that the typical EU resident owns at least three chargers, and use two regularly. The study also said that still, 38% of people report were not being able to charge their phones at least once because they couldn’t find a compatible charger.Is this a sudden move?No. The EU has been trying to cajole the industry into adopting a common standard for more than a decade, but there has been no success so far. So this time, the bloc is pushing the issue with a proposed legislation.“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said on Thursday.What do the new rules entail?Companies will get two years to adapt to the new rules once they take effect. The rules would apply only to electronics sold in the European single market's 30 countries, but, like the EU's strict privacy regulations, they could end up becoming a de facto standard for the rest of the world.Apple speaks out against the proposed moveApple said it shared the European Commission's commitment to protecting the environment but questioned whether the proposals would help consumers.“We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” the company said in a statement.What are the different charging standards prevalent today?Charging of devices was revolutionised by Universal Serial Bus (USB), which simplified computer connectivity. Initially, the USB-A took the world by storm. But in recent years, users have to choose from micro USB, mini USB, USB type-C and the lightning port used by Apple.While USB-A, which is found on virtually every desktop PC and older laptops, have more internal pins. Type-B, mini and micro reduced the pins but the speed of transferring data increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-proposes-universal-charger-for-mobiles-the-reason-and-why-apple-is-unhappy-101632559116819.html
25-09-2021||World||Will Taliban get a chance to speak at UNGA? Global body says rules apply||The Taliban are unlikely to get a go at Saturday’s United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting of world leaders as the global body has said that Afghanistan's currently recognised UN ambassador, Ghulam Isaczai, is listed as a speaker for the country. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Associated Press that as of Friday Isaczai, who represents former president Ashraf Ghani's now-ousted government, is the final speaker.Reuters reported earlier this week that the Taliban have asked to address world leaders at the UNGA in New York and nominated their Doha-based spokesperson Suhail Shaheen as Afghanistan's UN ambassador. Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi wrote to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres on Monday, asking to speak during the annual high-level meeting of the UNGA, the agency reported citing the letter. The Taliban have challenged Isaczai’s credentials, saying that they are now in charge and have the right to appoint ambassadors. Muttaqi said in his letter to Guterres that Ghani was “ousted” as of August 15 and that countries across the world “no longer recognise him as president.” Muttaqi said Isaczai therefore no longer represents Afghanistan.Also read | Taliban govt remains non-inclusive and all-male after Sept 21 expansionAP reported that the UNGA committee, which decides on credentials challenges, has not met. It added that the nine-member committee’s meeting is highly unlikely over the weekend. UNGA spokesperson Monica Grayley said on Wednesday that the committee generally meets in November and will issue a ruling “in due course.” So, Isaczai will remain the Afghan envoy until the credentials committee takes a decision. He is currently scheduled to address the final day of the meeting on September 27. However, it was not immediately clear if any country might object in the wake of the Taliban letter.“We have all the requirements needed for recognition of a government. So we hope the UN, as a neutral world body, recognise the current government of Afghanistan,” Shaheen told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Also read | Taliban cabinet has no 'actual' power and that's why they are fighting: ReportThe Taliban have said they want to be recognised internationally and also financial help to rebuild the war-torn country, but their new interim government poses a dilemma for the United Nations as well as other countries. Several of the Taliban ministers, including Muttaqi, are on the UN's so-called blacklist of international terrorists.Also read | Taliban defence minister miffed with fighters taking selfies in govt officesReports said that the UNGA credentials committee could also use Taliban recognition as leverage to press for a more inclusive government that guarantees human rights, especially for girls who were barred from going to school during their previous rule, and women who weren't able to work. The United States, Russia, China, Bahama, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Sweden are the members of the committee.The UN refused to recognise their government when the Taliban last ruled from 1996 to 2001 and instead gave Afghanistan's seat to the previous, warlord-dominated government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2011.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-taliban-get-a-chance-to-speak-at-unga-global-body-says-rules-apply-101632557784971.html

The American and Japanese leaders ended the day with their own separate bilateral meet.At the India-US bilateral summit, the two sides agreed that the issue of terrorism remains very important. “Counterterrorism efforts in cooperation between the two countries will be given a lot of emphasis,” foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said briefing reporters on India’s participation in the two meetings. “Both sides denounced any use of terrorist proxies and emphasise the importance of denying logistical financial or military support to terrorist groups, which could be used to plan, or launch terror attacks.”The India-US joint statement said “the two leaders reaffirmed that both countries stand together in a shared fight against global terrorism, and will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the UNSCR 1267 Sanctions Committee, condemned cross-border terrorism, and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to be brought to justice”.Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism came up in the context of Afghanistan, and its continued support for a “certain approach” that was not seen seem to be conducive to the international community’s expectations of what Afghanistan should be like.Pakistan’s support of terrorism was brought up by US Vice-President Kamala Harris, unprompted, during her discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.As a long-time victim of terrorism, most of it emanating from across its western border, India has made counterterrorism key foreign policy objective. It has been a part of the India-US dialogue for years now. And, it became on Friday a key element of the Quad agenda at India’s insistence.“I think we are looking at fairly strong language with regard to the Quad’s commitment on terrorism and the need to counter terrorism, anywhere in the world,” the foreign secretary said, speaking to India’s role in making counterterrorism an issue for the Quad as well. “It reinforces the Quad’s thinking on this issue, and the need to combine efforts to, to deal with this common scourge,” he added.The Quad joint statement said: “We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasised the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks.”At the Narendra Modi-Joe Biden bilateral meeting, the two sides also discussed the need to reinvigorate trade talks, enhance cooperation on defence production, intensify joint efforts on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccines, climate change, people to ties, which included H-1B visas for specially skilled workers and other issues that the two sides are engaged in at the same time.The India-US agenda is so exhaustive that President Biden said the summit meeting should have been allocated two days, Shringla said. It went on for 30 minutes overtime.At the historic first in-person summit, the Quad announced the launch of several new initiatives such as a fellowship for 100 students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields annually, a working group to enhance cooperation between the four countries on space, a new infrastructure partnership, formation of a Green-Shipping network, establish a clean-hydrogen partnership; publish a Quad statement of principles on the use of technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/counterterrorism-key-issue-in-narendra-modi-s-meetings-with-us-quad-partners-101632548894588.html
25-09-2021||World||Chinese media hails release of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from detention in Canada||Chinese state media on Saturday described Huawei heiress Meng Wanzhou’s surprise release from detention in Canada as “exciting news” and a “landmark deal” in first reactions from Beijing after she reached an agreement with the US justice department that allows her to return to China.Chinese state-run media said that Meng Wanzhou’s release from her home detention in Vancouver could ease “frozen” China-Canada ties. Meng Wanzhou is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei who in 1987 founded Huawei, the largest telecom equipment maker in the world.The US had alleged that Meng Wanzhou, who is Huawei’s chief financial officer (CFO), had misled HSBC bank over the nature of Huawei;s ties with a company called Skycom. It had put HSBC at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran, Washington had alleged.Following the deal on Friday, Meng Wanzhou was expected to be back in China as early as Saturday night, the Global Times said. “In a video footage seen by the Global Times, a GPS tracker ankle bracelet that Meng has worn for over two years has been removed, and she addressed the public after the hearing, showing gratitude for the Canadian judge and court upholding the rule of law,” it said.Meng Wanzhou, according to the Global Times report, appeared virtually in an American federal courtroom in Brooklyn on Friday, and reached a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in a case of federal charges against her for bank and wire fraud.“Under the terms of this agreement, Meng will not be prosecuted further in the US and the extradition proceedings in Canada will be terminated,” according to a statement of William Taylor, one of the lawyers who represent Meng Wanzhou. “Over the past three years my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, as a wife,” Meng Wanzhou told reporters and supporters on the steps outside the Vancouver courtroom after the hearing, according to a Reuters report.China had accused Canada of arbitrarily detaining Meng Wanzhou, and acting as an accomplice of the US, despite violating no Canadian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-media-hails-release-of-huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-from-detention-in-canada-101632546794208.html
25-09-2021||World||Prisoner swap: Canada releases Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, China frees 2 Canadians||Huawei’s chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou, who had been in detention in Canada since December 2018, left the country for China on Friday after a judge discharged her in a case for extradition to the United States following the American department of justice agreeing to a deal with her.In a day of fast-changing developments, hours later there was a quid pro quo settlement as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who were detained in China and charged with espionage following Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Canada, had been released and were on their way back to Canada.The day started with Meng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, making a virtual appearance before a Federal district court in Brooklyn, New York. The US justice department in a statement said she had “entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud”.Acting US assistant attorney general Mark Lesko for the justice department’s National Security Division said the DPA would be “end of the ongoing extradition proceedings in Canada, which otherwise could have continued for many months, if not years”. Under the plea deal, Meng Wanzhou agreed to a statement that constituted an admission of deceiving a financial institution in an effort to bypass sanctions imposed by the US on the regime in Iran. “In entering into the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution,” said acting US attorney Nicole Boeckmann for the eastern district of New York.By the afternoon, British Columbia Supreme Court associate chief justice Heather Holmes discharged the extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, CFO of the Chinese telecommunications company. “Sorry for the inconvenience caused,” Meng Wanzhou told reporters outside the Vancouver court after the case was dropped. While she said the long-running case had been “disruptive” for her personally, Meng Wanzhou expressed her appreciation of the court “for their professionalism and the Canadian government for upholding the rule of law.” Canada’s department of justice thereafter stated she was “free to leave” the country.Within hours, she was aboard a special Air China flight that left Canada for the Chinese city of Shenzhen.Late on Friday evening, Justin Trudeau announced that the two Canadians imprisoned in China, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were on board a flight from China and returning to Canada. Addressing the media in Ottawa, he said, “These two men have gone through an unbelievably difficult ordeal. For the past 1,000 days, they have shown strength, perseverance, resilience and grace.”On August 11, businessman Spavor was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Chinese court on charges related to spying.The case involving Meng Wanzhou and the two Michaels had led to a rapid schism in relations between Ottawa and China with Trudeau describing China’s actions in arresting the two Michaels as “hostage diplomacy”.Interestingly, after becoming PM for a third term following national elections on Monday, Trudeau had a telephonic conversation with US President Joe Biden where the fate of the two Michaels was among the subjects discussed.In what appeared to be an exchange of prisoners, the flight carrying the two Michaels left China at almost exactly the same time as the one with Meng Wanzhou aboard departed Vancouver.“It’s good news for all of us that they are on their way home to their families,” Trudeau said. He made the announcement after their flight had left Chinese airspace.China has denied Canadian charges that they were “arbitrarily detained” as an act of “coercive diplomacy”, but the sequence of events on Friday evening will buttress Ottawa’s argument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoner-exchange-canada-releases-huawei-executive-china-frees-2-canadians-101632545414133.html
25-09-2021||World||Quad to pledge 1.2 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses globally||The Quad countries—the United States, Japan, India and Australia—said on Friday that they will pledge more than 1.2 billion doses of the vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) globally. The Quad vaccine initiative was announced in March and comprises the manufacturing of a billion doses with partners chipping in with funding and logistics, as reported earlier by the Hindustan Times.“In line with our March announcement, and recognizing the continuing global supply gap, we will ensure this expanded manufacturing is exported for the Indo-Pacific and the world, and we will coordinate with key multilateral initiatives, such as the COVAX Facility, to procure proven safe, effective and quality-assured Covid-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries,” a joint statement read.To date, the Quad said it has delivered nearly 79 million doses in the Indo-Pacific region.The leaders welcomed Biological E Ltd production, including through Quad investments, of at least one billion safe and effective vaccines by the end of next year. “The Quad also welcomes India’s announcement to resume exports of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines, including to COVAX, beginning in October 2021,” the joint statement added.Pointing out that the coronavirus pandemic, which struck last year, continues to cause global suffering, the Quad leaders committed to better preparations for the next pandemic. They also promised to build coordination for health-security efforts in the Indo-Pacific, and jointly carry out at least one pandemic preparedness tabletop or exercise next year.On the vaccination front, Japan will continue providing assistance to its regional partners to purchase doses through $3.3 billion of the Covid-19 crisis response emergency support loan. The Australian government, on the other hand, will deliver $212 million in grant aid to purchase vaccine doses for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the joint statement said. It will provide $219 million to support last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead in coordinating Quad’s last-mile delivery efforts in these regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-to-pledge-1-2-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-globally-101632539010214.html
25-09-2021||World||At UNGA, Imran Khan tries to paint Pakistan as a victim of US ungratefulness||Prime Minister Imran Khan sought to cast Pakistan as the victim of American ungratefulness and an international double standard in his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.In a prerecorded speech aired during the evening, the Pakistani prime minister touched on a range of topics that included climate change, global Islamophobia, and “the plunder of the developing world by their corrupt elites” — the latter of which he likened to what the East India Company did to India.It was for India's government that Khan reserved his harshest words, once again labeling Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as “fascist.” But the cricketer turned posh international celebrity turned politician was, in turn, indignant and plaintive as he painted the United States as an abandoner of both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.“For the current situation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe,” Khan said. “From this platform, I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan when we joined the US war on terror after 9/11.”He launched into a narrative that began with the United States and Pakistan training mujahedeen — regarded as heroes by the likes of then-President Ronald Reagan, he said — during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But Pakistan was left to pick up the pieces — millions of refugees and new sectarian militant groups — when the Soviets and the Americans left in 1989.Khan said the US sanctioned its former partner a year later, but then came calling again after the 9/11 attacks. Khan said Pakistan's aid to the U.S. cost 80,000 Pakistani lives and caused internal strife and dissent directed at the state, all while the U.S. conducted drone attacks.“So, when we hear this at the end. There is a lot of worry in the U.S. about taking care of the interpreters and everyone who helped the US,” he said, referring to Afghanistan. “What about us?”Instead of a mere "word of appreciation,” Pakistan has received the blame, Khan said.Despite Khan's rhetoric espousing a desire for peace, many Afghans have blamed Pakistan for the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan because of close links. The United Nations in August also rejected Pakistan's request to give its side at a special meeting on Afghanistan, indicating the international community's shared skepticism.In his speech, Khan echoed what his foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, told The Associated Press earlier this week on the sidelines at the UN: the international community should not isolate the Taliban, but instead strengthen the current Afghan government for the sake of the people.He struck an optimistic tone about Taliban rule, saying their leaders had committed to human rights, an inclusive government, and not allowing terrorists on Afghan soil. But messages from the Taliban have been mixed.A Taliban founder told the AP earlier this week that the hard-liners would once again carry out executions and amputated hands — though this time after adjudication by judges, including women, and potentially not in public.“If the world community incentivizes them, and encourages them to walk this talk, it will be a win-win situation for everyone,” he said.Khan also turned his ire on that same community for what he perceives as a free pass given to India.“It is unfortunate, very unfortunate, that the world’s approach to violations of human rights lacks even-handedness, and even is selective. Geopolitical considerations, or corporate interests, commercial interests often compel major powers to overlook the transgressions of their affiliated countries,” Khan said.He went through a litany of actions that have “unleashed a reign of fear and violence against India’s 200 million-strong Muslim community,” he said, including lynchings, pogroms, and discriminatory citizenship laws.As in years past, Khan — who favors delivering his speeches in his British-inflected English, in contrast to Modi's Hindi addresses — devoted substantial time to Kashmir.“New Delhi has also embarked on what it ominously calls the ‘final solution’ for the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” Khan said, rattling off a list of what he termed “gross and systematic violations of human rights” committed by Indian forces. He specifically decried the “forcible snatching of the mortal remains of the great Kashmiri leader, ” Syed Ali Geelani, who died earlier this month at 91.Geelani's family has said authorities took his body and buried him discreetly and without their consent, denying the separatist leader revered in Kashmir a proper Islamic burial. Khan called upon the General Assembly to demand Geelani's proper burial and rites.He said Pakistan desires peace, but it is India’s responsibility to meaningfully engage.Modi is set to address the UN General Assembly in person on Saturday, a day after a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unga-imran-khan-tries-to-paint-pakistan-as-a-victim-of-us-ungratefulness-101632543262728.html
25-09-2021||World||China was the elephant in White House, Quad up to the challenge||Although the Quad joint statement does not mention the word China, there was realism about Beijing’s actions and capabilities at the summit with US President Joe Biden keeping the focus on the challenges posed by a rising superpower. While it may not have been spelt out explicitly, the Quad summit is expected to become an annual event with all the partners deciding to deepen and expand the group agenda to other areas on the foundation of trust, resilience, and capability.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi being the senior member of Quad after being seven years at the helm of Indian affairs, the summit was not only seized of the challenges posed by China but also ready to meet them. The Quad meeting broke many a myth with President Biden totally Asia centric instead of the expected focus on Europe. The summit was no American cover-up for the perceived Afghanistan withdrawal fiasco, instead, Biden appeared very solid and in grip of the Indo-Pacific situation. According to key people, contrary to common belief, President Biden was hard-nosed and his administration a practitioner of realpolitik in protecting US interests against its adversaries.Even though the focus of Quad was directed at India’s northern neighbour, there were no illusions about India’s western neighbour Pakistan, but the Biden administration was still weighing the pros and cons of the relationship in the context of their use in Afghanistan.The Quad joint statement is quite categorical on both China and Pakistan (in the context of Afghanistan) without mentioning either by name as the group’s agenda goes far beyond these two countries. The statement recommits the Quad partners to promote free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion, to bolster security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. “We stand for the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity of states,” the Quad statement said.The Quad statement on South Asia is guided by the UNSC resolution 2593, passed under the Presidentship of India on August 30, 2021. “We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasized the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross border attacks,” the statement said while the Quad leaders stood up for Afghan people.By making ASEAN countries and European Union central to the Quad’s Indo-Pacific initiative, the group unlike China has no desire to alienate any future partner with the core group remaining the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-was-the-elephant-in-white-house-quad-up-to-the-challenge-101632542743515.html
25-09-2021||World||US, UK see rise in Covid-19 deaths; experts say vaccine push must||The US and the UK have been seeing a rise in the number of people dying of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Covid-19 deaths in the US have climbed to an average of more than 1,900 a day for the first time since early March, while the United Kingdom has seen 160,000 fatalities so far.The increasing number of infections have filled hospitals, complicated the start of the school year and delayed return to offices in the United States, reports AP. Experts in the US have said that the coronavirus disease is preying largely on a distinct group—the unvaccinated Americans.The seven-day average of US hospital deaths with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 is down 8.9 per cent from the recent peak on September 16, according to the data from the US department of health and human Services. As many as 24 people died in one week alone at CoxHealth hospitals in the US' Springfield Branson area. West Virginia has had more deaths in the first three weeks of September than in the previous three months combined. Georgia is averaging 125 dead per day, reports AP.According to data from Johns Hopkins University, now, nearly 64 per cent of the US population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and yet, average deaths per day have climbed 40 per cent over the past two weeks, from1,387 to 1,947.Meanwhile, Britain reported 35,623 new Covid-19 cases and 180 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, official data showed on Friday. The UK’s Office for National Statistics has said that there have now been 160,000 deaths registered in the country where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. However, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues to be an incredible success in the UK. As many as 93,350,658 Covid-19 jabs have been given out across the nation—48,705,771 were first doses and 44,644,887 were second doses—according to data.The latest data came as the UK's coronavirus reproduction number, also known as the R number, has fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1, the latest government figures show. Last week, the R-value was between 0.9 and 1.1. The growth rate in England is now between minus 3 per cent and minus 1 per cent a day, meaning that the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1 per cent and 3 per cent each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-see-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-experts-say-vaccine-push-must-101632535113380.html
25-09-2021||World||World Pharmacists Day 2021: Global community pays tribute to pharmacists today. Here's theme, history, significance||World Pharmacists Day is observed on September 25 each year to pay tributes to pharmacists for the role they play in improving global health. The purpose of the annual Pharmacists Day is to encourage activities that promote and advocate for the role of the pharmacist in improving health in every corner of the world. This year's theme, developed by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), is “Pharmacy: Always trusted for your health”. The theme was chosen to highlight the importance of trust in healthcare and the practice of pharmacy across diverse clinical settings.World Pharmacists Day: ThemeWorld Pharmacists Day this year is being celebrated with the theme – “Pharmacy: Always trusted for your health”. According to the International Pharmaceutical Federation, “Trust is a central part of all human relationships and a fundamental element of social capital. Trust is also essential to health care: there is a significant association between trust in healthcare professionals and health outcomes for patients.”Pharmacists say that when patients have higher trust in healthcare professionals, they respond better to treatment and show more beneficial medical behaviour with fewer symptoms, leading to an overall better quality of life.World Pharmacists Day: HistoryWorld Pharmacists Day was introduced in 2009 by the International Pharmaceutical Federation council in Istanbul. This is the 11th year of observing the annual Pharmacists Day across the world.September 25 was chosen as the date for World Pharmacists Day because it was on this very day in 1912 that the International Pharmaceutical Federation was originally established; thus it was only natural that the Turkish members of the council suggested in 2009 that September 25 be observed as World Pharmacists Day.World Pharmacists Day: SignificancePharmacy is the practice that links medicinal science with chemistry and as such plays a hugely important role in modern society. Pharmacists are tasked with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs. Without pharmacists having an efficient knowledge of drugs, their side effects, mobility, and toxicity, the world would not have safe medicines and drugs to rely on.World Pharmacists Day urges the global community to recognise the importance that pharmacists play in society and spread awareness with activities that promote and advocate their role in improving world health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-pharmacists-day-2021-globe-pays-tribute-to-pharmacists-today-here-s-theme-history-significance-101632531322659.html

25-09-2021||World||Canadians, arrested in China, released after Huawei CFO, US reach deal||Two Canadians detained in China on spying charges have been released from prison and flown out of the country, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday, hours after a top executive of Chinese communications giant Huawei Technologies resolved criminal charges against her in a deal with the US Justice Department.Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December 2018, shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, on a US extradition request. Many countries labeled China's action “hostage politics.”The deal with Meng calls for the Justice Department to dismiss fraud charges late next year in exchange for Meng accepting responsibility for misrepresenting her company’s business dealings in Iran. Trudeau called a news conference Friday night about an hour after Meng’s plane left Canada for China.The arrangement with Meng, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, resolves a yearslong legal and geopolitical tussle that involved not only the US and China but also Canada, where Meng has remained since she was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.The deal was reached as President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have sought to tamp down signs of public tension — even as the world’s two dominant economies are at odds on issues as diverse as cybersecurity, climate change, human rights and trade and tariffs. Biden said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week that he had no intention of starting a “new Cold War,” while Xi told world leaders that disputes among countries “need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation.”As part of the deal, disclosed in federal court in Brooklyn, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss the fraud charges against Meng in December 2022 — exactly four years after her arrest — provided that she complies with certain conditions, including not contesting any of the government's factual allegations. The Justice Department also agreed to drop its request that Meng be extradited to the US, which she had vigorously challenged, ending a process that prosecutors said could have persisted for months.Meng's attorneys said they fully expect the charges to be dismissed in 14 months. “We’re very pleased that in the meantime she can go home to her family,” said defense lawyer Michelle Levin.After appearing via videoconference for her New York hearing, Meng made a brief court appearance in Vancouver, where she has been out on bail and living in her mansion since her arrest. The court released her from all her bail conditions and she is now free to leave the country.Outside the courtroom, Meng thanked the Canadian government for upholding the rule of law, expressed gratitude to the Canadian people and apologized "for the inconvenience I caused.”“Over the last three years my life has been turned upside down,” she said. “It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, a wife and as a company executive. But I believe every cloud has a silver lining. It really was an invaluable experience in my life. I will never forget all the good wishes I received.”Shortly afterward, Meng left on an Air China flight for Shenzhen, China, the location of Huawei's headquarters.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has been a symbol of China’s progress in becoming a technological world power — and a subject of US security and law enforcement concerns. Some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms and stolen technology.The case against Meng stems from a January 2019 indictment from the Trump administration Justice Department that accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions. The indictment also charged Meng herself with committing fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.The indictment came amid a broader Trump administration crackdown against Huawei over US government concerns that the company's products could facilitate Chinese spying. The administration cut off Huawei’s access to US components and technology, including Google’s music and other smartphone services, and later barred vendors worldwide from using US technology to produce components for Huawei.The Biden White House, meanwhile, has kept up a hard line on Huawei and other Chinese corporations whose technology is thought to pose national security risks.Huawei has repeatedly denied the US government’s allegations and security concerns about its products.Meng had long fought the Justice Department's extradition request, with her lawyers calling the case against her flawed and alleging that she was being used as a “bargaining chip” in political gamesmanship. They cited a 2018 interview in which then-President Donald Trump said he'd be willing to intervene in the case if it would help secure a trade deal with China or aid U.S. security interests.Last month, a Canadian judge held off on ruling whether Meng should be extradited to the U.S. after a Canadian Justice Department lawyer wrapped up his case saying there was enough evidence to show she was dishonest and deserved to stand trial in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-arrested-in-china-released-after-huawei-cfo-us-reach-deal-101632532789892.html
25-09-2021||World||Merkel era to end as voters gear up to pick new government on Sunday||Candidates to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany’s weekend election were hitting the hustings on Friday in a last-ditch bid for votes in a tight race, even as tens of thousands of activists including Greta Thunberg rallied to demand climate action.As Germany’s top parties were set to hold final rallies ahead of Sunday’s vote, the Fridays for Future youth marches made the case that the political class has let down the younger generation. “The political parties haven’t taken the climate catastrophe seriously enough,” Luisa Neubauer, who runs the group’s German chapter, said.She said Germany, as one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases, had an outsize responsibility to set an example, with time running out to reverse destructive trends. “That is why we are calling this the election of a century,” she said.The race has boiled down to a two-way contest between Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, the centrist finance minister, and Armin Laschet from Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats.

Despite the urgency of the climate issue for a majority of Germans, particularly in the aftermath of deadly floods in western Germany in July, this has failed to translate into strong support for the relatively inexperienced Baerbock.Baerbock, who joined one of the Fridays for Future rallies in Cologne, told Die Welt newspaper that she hoped the protests would give her party “tailwinds” heading into the vote. “The next government has to be a climate government - that will only work with a strong Green party.”Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, plans to stand down as leader of Europe’s biggest economy after Sunday’s election, although she will remain chancellor during coalition talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-era-to-end-as-voters-gear-up-to-pick-new-government-on-sunday-101632529809584.html

25-09-2021||World||US and France meet, patch-up to take time||The top diplomats of France and the United States said on Thursday that repairing ties will take time as Paris demanded action to assuage its anger over the cancellation of a submarine contract.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, after days of giving the cold shoulder, met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) with US secretary of state Antony Blinken on the allies’ worst crisis in ties since the Iraq war.France’s top diplomat told Blinken that US President Joe Biden’s conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron was the start of a process of repairing trust. “He recalled that a first step had been taken with the call between the two presidents, but underlined that resolving the crisis between our two countries would take time and require actions,” a French foreign ministry statement said.France was infuriated when Australia last week cancelled a multibillion-dollar contract for French submarines, deciding instead that it needed US nuclear versions amid rising tensions with China.Le Drian accused Australia of back-stabbing and the United States of betrayal, calling the move reminiscent of the unilateralist attitude of Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump.Blinken vowed to work to rebuild trust with France, America’s oldest ally, and pointed to shared interests including in the French campaign against the Islamic State extremist group.“I am convinced that our interests together are so strong, the values that we share so unshakable, that we will carry forward and get some good work done, but it will take some time; it will take some hard work,” Blinken told reporters. Blinken said he would keep up talks with Le Drian.Israeli actions could lead to ‘one state’, rues AbbasPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has accused Israel of jeopardising the two-state solution with actions he said could lead Palestinians to demand equal rights within one binational state comprising Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza.Addressing the UN General Assembly via video link from the West Bank, Abbas said, “If the Israeli occupation authorities continue to entrench the reality of one apartheid state as is happening today, our Palestinian people and the entire world will not tolerate such a situation.”The Israeli government has consistently rejected accusations of apartheid.Iran says nuclear talks soon, gives no date yetIran will return to talks on resuming compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal “very soon”, foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters on Friday, but gave no specific date.“The Islamic Republic of Iran will return to the table of negotiations. We are reviewing the Vienna negotiations files currently and, very soon, Iran’s negotiations with the ‘four plus one’ countries will recommence,” Amirabdollahian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-and-france-meet-patch-up-to-take-time-101632529577464.html
25-09-2021||World||Harris calls upon Pak to act against terrorists on its soil||US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday called upon Pakistan to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil to ensure they do not threaten the security of both the United States and India and underscored the need to closely monitor Islamabad’s support for terrorism.Harris’s remarks came during her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that lasted over an hour and “reflected warmth and cordiality”. She accepted Modi’s invitation to visit India and said she had wanted to “go back”, reminiscing about her earlier visits and the time she spent there.The meeting with Harris was politically important for the Indian prime minister because Harris, a leading progressive in the Democratic party, had been severely critical of the Modi government’s controversial decision to abrogate Article 370 guaranteeing special status of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Act that speeds up Indian citizenship for Hindus seeking refuge in India from repressive regimes.Other progressives who had been critical of these measures were Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. Additionally, the vice-president’s niece Meena Harris brought the Modi government further grief by endorsing celebrities who came out in support of farmers protesting a legislation that they feared would strip them of government protection.Harris did not bring up any of these issues at the talks, according to all available indications. However, she did note that democracies all over the world are under threat and that it is imperative that India and the US defend democratic principles and institutions within their respective countries and around the world.Harris and Modi made initial remarks before their bilateral meeting, in which they had reiterated the importance of the relationship between the two countries and had stressed shared concerns and priorities such as climate change and Covid-19 and the need to ensue a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two leaders had a short one-on-one interaction without aides and officials, before starting the bilateral, during which Harris, whose late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was born and raised in India, reminisced about her visits to India and the time she spent with her grandfather, said people familiar with the conversation. She expressed the desire to “go back”, it was said. She has accepted Prime Minister Modi’s invitation to her and first gentleman Douglas Emhoff to visit India, but there was no word on the timing.Pakistan came up at the bilateral meeting when the two sides were discussing terrorism. “The vice-president, suo moto (on her own) referred to Pakistan’s role in that regard,” foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters at a news briefing.The vice-president further said there were terror groups that were working there. “She asked Pakistan to take action so that these groups do not impact on us security and that of India,” Shringla said, adding, “She agreed with the prime minister’s briefing on the fact of cross border terrorism, and the fact that India had been a victim of terrorism for several decades now; and on the need to rein in and closely monitor Pakistan’s support for such terrorist groups.”Pakistan was entirely absent from the readout of the meeting issued by the Vice-President’s office that spoke of the “strategic partnership” between the two countries, “collaborative efforts” in dealing with Covid, the need for “ambitious action” against climate change, ways to “build on the robust bilateral collaboration on space”, and the need to “strengthen democracy at home and abroad”. The readout did mention that the two leaders “supported expanding bilateral security cooperation in the face of modern threats, including terrorism and cybercrime”.Harris’s rebuke of Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism came shortly after another senior member of the Biden administration, secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed US appreciation of Pakistan’s role in continuing diplomatic engagement over Afghanistan and help in evacuating people, to his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in New York.The US appreciates “the work that Pakistan has done to facilitate the departure of American citizens who wish to leave as well as others”, Blinken said ahead of their meeting on||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-calls-upon-pak-to-act-against-terrorists-on-its-soil-101632517083856.html
25-09-2021||World||Explained: How close is Iran to producing a bomb?||A 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is being eroded and efforts to revive the pact face a new challenge with the killing of Tehran's top nuclear scientist.The accord's restrictions on Iran's atomic work had one objective: to extend the "breakout time" for Tehran to produce enough fissile material for a bomb, if it decided to make one, to at least a year from about two to three months.Iran maintains that it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would. It says its nuclear work only has civilian aims.Tehran began breaching the deal's curbs last year in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions.This has shortened the breakout time but reports by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which polices the deal, indicate that Iran is not moving ahead with its nuclear work as fast as it could.European states have sought to save the nuclear deal, pressing Tehran to comply even as Washington has tightened sanctions, and holding out hopes of a change in U.S. policy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Biden was part of the U.S. administration under Barack Obama that negotiated the 2015 deal.WHAT HAS IRAN DONE TILL NOW?Iran has contravened many of the deal's restrictions but is still cooperating with the IAEA and granting inspectors access under one of the most intrusive nuclear verification regimes imposed on any nation.* Enriched uranium - The deal limits Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium to 202.8 kg, a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it possessed before the deal. The limit was breached last year. The IAEA report in November put the stockpile at 2,442.9 kg.* Enrichment level - The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium at 3.67%, far below the 20% achieved before the deal and below the weapons-grade level of 90%. Iran breached the 3.67% cap in July 2019 and the enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5% since then.* Centrifuges - The deal allows Iran to produce enriched uranium using about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at its underground Natanz plant, which was built to house more than 50,000. It can operate small numbers of more advanced models above ground without accumulating enriched uranium. Iran had roughly 19,000 installed centrifuges before the deal.In 2019, the IAEA said Iran had begun enrichment with advanced centrifuges at an above-ground pilot plant at Natanz. Since then, Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of advanced centrifuges to the underground plant. In November, the IAEA said Iran had fed uranium hexafluoride gas feedstock into the first of those underground cascades.* Fordow - The deal bans enrichment at Fordow, a site Iran secretly built inside a mountain and that was exposed by Western intelligence services in 2009. Centrifuges are allowed there for other purposes, like producing stable isotopes. Iran now has 1,044 IR-1 centrifuges enriching there.HOW CLOSE IS IRAN TO HAVING A BOMB?The breaches lengthened the breakout time but estimates still vary. Many diplomats and nuclear experts say the starting point of one year is conservative and Iran would need longer.David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who tends to have a hawkish position on Iran, estimated in November that Iran's breakout time could be "as short as 3.5 months", although this presumes Iran would use 1,000 advanced centrifuges that were removed under the deal.WHAT MORE WOULD IRAN NEED TO DO?If Iran accumulated sufficient fissile material, it would need to assemble a bomb and probably one small enough to be carried by its ballistic missiles. How long that would take exactly is unclear, but stockpiling enough fissile material is widely seen as the biggest hurdle in producing a weapon.U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted. There is evidence suggesting Iran obtained a design for a nuclear weapon and carried out various types of work relevant to making one.Tehran continues to grant the IAEA access to its declared nuclear facilities and allow snap inspections elsewhere.Iran and the IAEA resolved a standoff this year that had lasted several months over access to two suspected former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-close-is-iran-to-producing-a-bomb-101632514862526.html
25-09-2021||World||'Highly objectionable': Taliban defence minister miffed with fighters taking selfies in govt offices||As the Taliban transition from insurgency to peacetime administration, the leaders have taken cognisance of reports of abuses in an attempt to present a conciliatory face to the world. The Taliban’s defence minister Mullah Mohammad Yakoob, son of Mullah Omar, issued a rebuke in an audio message over misconduct by some fighters after the US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, Reuters reported."We direct you keep them out of your ranks, otherwise strict action will be taken against you," Yakoob said in a message for Taliban commanders. "We don't want such people in our ranks."There have been reports of reprisal by the Sunni Pashtun fighters against former government officials and civil society activists despite the promises of general amnesty to project themselves as different from the hardline Islamist administration that ruled from 1996 to 2001. Often with no obvious chain of command, Taliban fighters are reported to have meted out abusive treatment to some Kabul residents.Yaqoob, who oversaw the military operations of the Taliban during the insurgency, warned that such actions would not be tolerated, according to Reuters."As you all are aware, under the general amnesty announced in Afghanistan, no mujahid has the right to take revenge on anyone," he said.The audio message was tweeted by several Taliban Twitter handles and was widely shared on social media. However, it remains unclear which exact incidents Yakoob was referring to. There have been reports of infighting among different factions of the Taliban as some of them want to opt for a moderate approach while others don’t want to compromise.Yakoob has also taken note of some Taliban fighters crashing into government offices and taking selfies."This is highly objectionable as everyone is taking out mobile phones and taking snaps in the important and sensitive ministries without any reason," he said. "Such hanging out and taking snaps and videos will not help you in this world, and also in the hereafter."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-objectionable-taliban-defence-minister-miffed-with-fighters-taking-selfies-in-govt-offices-101632513810510.html
25-09-2021||World||‘A force for global good’: PM Modi on Quad Leaders' Summit after China calls it 'closed clique'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said Quad will work as a 'force for global good' since the cooperation among the four countries will ensure peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific as well as the entire world. During the opening remarks ahead of the first in-person Quad Leaders' Summit, PM Modi said the four nations met for the time after the disastrous Tsunami of 2004 to help the Indo-Pacific region and now they are meeting when the world is fighting against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Today, when the world is fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, we have come here once again as Quad for the welfare of humanity,” he said.The prime minister further stated that the Quad vaccine initiative will help Indo-Pacific nations. Noting the shared democratic values of Quad nations, PM Modi said he would be happy to discuss issues like supply chain, global security, climate action, Covid response or tech cooperation with his Quad counterparts.“In a way, our Quad will work as a 'force for global good',” he added. PM Modi's comment on the objective of Quad comes in the backdrop of China's criticism of the grouping. Earlier today, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called Quad “a closed, exclusive clique targeting other countries.” US President Joe Biden said that the concrete commitments by Quad leaders on a shared and positive agenda for free and open Indo-Pacific are making excellent progress. Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Biden announced a new Quad fellowship for students from each of our Quad countries to pursue advanced degrees in leading stem programs in the United States.Calling for a free and open Indo-Pacific, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the Quad a “very important initiative” by the four nations that believe in fundamental rights. “Till date, Quad has given its absolute cooperation in big sectors, be it regional challenges or Covid-19,” Suga said.While none of the leaders named China in remarks to reporters, each one of them stressed the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific.“We stand here together, in the Indo-Pacific region, a region that we wish to be always free from coercion, where the sovereign rights of all nations are respected, and where disputes are settled peacefully and accordance with international law,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-force-for-global-good-pm-modi-on-quad-leaders-summit-during-covid19-101632506759149.html
25-09-2021||World||‘Stronger, closer, tighter’: US heralds new India paradigm||US President Joe Biden on Friday said at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the relationship between the two countries is “destined to be stronger, closer and tighter”, and the Indian leader rolled out a 10-year road map for growing ties based on Four Ts — talent, technology, trade, and trusteeship.The two were meeting for the first time since Biden took office, and it is one of the most crucial engagements for Prime Minister Modi who is on a three-day visit to the US.The President went on to express optimism about the relationship, saying that he has long believed — even back in 2006 — that by 2020, India and the United States will be “among the closest nations in the world”.The two leaders have spoken on the phone several times, and have participated in virtual meetings.They displayed an easy level of comfort with each other, which was visible immediately when President Biden began recounting a story he has told many times before -- of people in India with the same surname “Biden”. Modi took it forward this time and said that since Biden last told him about it, he got some research done into it and he now brought along some genealogy documents for the president.“Your leadership will certainly play an important role in how this decade is shaped. The seeds have been sown for an even stronger friendship between India and the US,” the PM told Biden.“Today we’re launching a new chapter in the history of US-Indian ties, and taking on some of the toughest challenges we face together, starting with a shared commitment to end the Covid pandemic,” Biden added.Biden said he and Modi will discuss what more can be done to end the pandemic and take on climate challenges that the world faces, and ensure stability Indo-Pacific, including with partners of the Quad, which was scheduled to hold its first in-person summit meeting later in the day.Afghanistan, economic cooperation and trade will also figure in their talks, officials said.Biden also said the relationship was more than a partnership between the two countries and included “family ties”, alluding to the four million Indian-Americans.Pointing to Mahatma Gandhi’s upcoming birth anniversary next week, the US president said people should be reminded that his “message of non-violence, respect, tolerance, matters today maybe more than ever”.In the morning, the US President tweeted about the upcoming bilateral and said: “I look forward to strengthening the deep ties between our two nations, working to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific, and tackling everything from Covid-19 to climate change.”Prime Minister Modi spoke of the decade starting 2021 as a transformative period for ties between the two countries.Modi then went on to unveil his four-Ts road map: He spoke first of the talent of Indian-Americans that Biden had referred to in his remarks.“When I look at the importance of this decade, and the role that is going to be played by this talent of the Indian Americans, I find that the people to people talent will play a greater role and Indian talent will be a full partner in this relationship,” he said.Technology, the second T, he said, will be the “most important driving force” and technology that is going to be for the service and for the use of humanity.Trade, the third T, will continue to assume importance in the relationship, the Prime Minister said, adding: “We find that the trade between our two countries are actually complementary”.“There are things that you have and there are things that we have, and then we in fact complement each other. I find that the area of trade during this decade, that is also going to be tremendously important,” he stressed.The fourth T: trusteeship, a concept advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, who, Modi said, “used to talk about the principle of trusteeship, trusteeship of the planet”.He added that the sentiment of trusteeship would assume increased importance globally and also in relations between India and the US.”Richard Rossow, head of India studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said though the public remarks had “less flash than President Trump’s public engagements with Prime Minister Modi, it reflects a return to normal diplomacy. Not simply for its sober, friendly tone, but also the fact that the leaders are focused on the global partnership. This appeared less transactional than recent summits. Of course, the public session has less importance than what might be announced after the formal bilateral later today.”He also noted that Biden did not use the remarks to “directly raise growing concerns in Washington about human rights interest in India. He reiterated our shared interest but did not turn this into a potential point of friction”.Atman Trivedi, a former Obama administration official who is now a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center, said, “The two leaders meeting in person, separately and with the Quad, presents a rare opportunity to take advantage of the growing strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific, while working on the most consequential challenges of our times, from Covid-19 to climate change to cybersecurity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-meets-narendra-modi-says-ties-between-two-countries-destined-to-be-stronger-closer-and-tighter-101632507249311.html
25-09-2021||World||'Cutting hands off necessary punishment': Taliban say executions will return||One of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan said the hard-line movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public.In an interview with The Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers.“Everyone criticized us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,” Turabi told The Associated Press, speaking in Kabul. “No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Quran.”Since the Taliban overran Kabul on Aug. 15 and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will re-create their harsh rule of the late 1990s. Turabi’s comments pointed to how the group’s leaders remain entrenched in a deeply conservative, hard-line worldview, even if they are embracing technological changes, like video and mobile phones.Turabi, now in his early 60s, was justice minister and head of the so-called Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice — effectively, the religious police — during the Taliban’s previous rule.At that time, the world denounced the Taliban’s punishments, which took place in Kabul’s sports stadium or on the grounds of the sprawling Eid Gah mosque, often attended by hundreds of Afghan men.Executions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head, carried out by the victim’s family, who had the option of accepting “blood money” and allowing the culprit to live. For convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of a hand. For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.Trials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favor of Islamic clerics, whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions.Turabi said that this time, judges — including women — would adjudicate cases, but the foundation of Afghanistan’s laws will be the Quran. He said the same punishments would be revived.“Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,” he said, saying it had a deterrent effect. He said the Cabinet was studying whether to do punishments in public and will “develop a policy.”In recent days in Kabul, Taliban fighters have revived a punishment they commonly used in the past — public shaming of men accused of small-time theft.On at least two occasions in the last week, Kabul men have been packed into the back of a pickup truck, their hands tied, and were paraded around to humiliate them. In one case, their faces were painted to identify them as thieves. In the other, stale bread was hung from their necks or stuffed in their mouth. It wasn’t immediately clear what their crimes were.Wearing a white turban and a bushy, unkempt white beard, the stocky Turabi limped slightly on his artificial leg. He lost a leg and one eye during fighting with Soviet troops in the 1980s.Under the new Taliban government, he is in charge of prisons. He is among a number of Taliban leaders, including members of the all-male interim Cabinet, who are on a United Nations sanctions list.During the previous Taliban rule, he was one of the group’s most ferocious and uncompromising enforcers. When the Taliban took power in 1996, one of his first acts was to scream at a woman journalist, demanding she leave a room of men, and to then deal a powerful slap in the face of a man who objected.Turabi was notorious for ripping music tapes from cars, stringing up hundreds of meters of destroyed cassettes in trees and signposts. He demanded men wear turbans in all government offices and his minions routinely beat men whose beards had been trimmed. Sports were banned, and Turabi’s legion of enforcers forced men to the mosque for prayers five times daily.In this week’s interview with the AP, Turabi spoke to a woman journalist.“We are changed from the past,” he said.He said now the Taliban would allow television, mobile phones, photos and video “because this is the necessity of the people, and we are serious about it.” He suggested that the Taliban saw the media as a way to spread their message. “Now we know instead of reaching just hundreds, we can reach millions,” he said. He added that if punishments are made public, then people may be allowed to video or take photos to spread the deterrent effect.The U.S. and its allies have been trying to use the threat of isolation — and the economic damage that would result from it — to pressure the Taliban to moderate their rule and give other factions, minorities and women a place in power.But Turabi dismissed criticism over the previous Taliban rule, arguing that it had succeeded in bringing stability. “We had complete safety in every part of the country,” he said of the late 1990s.Even as Kabul residents express fear over their new Taliban rulers, some acknowledge grudgingly that the capital has already become safer in just the past month. Before the Taliban takeover, bands of thieves roamed the streets, and relentless crime had driven most people off the streets after dark.“It’s not a good thing to see these people being shamed in public, but it stops the criminals because when people see it, they think ‘I don’t want that to be me,’” said Amaan, a storeowner in the centre of Kabul. He asked to be identified by just one name.Another shopkeeper said it was a violation of human rights but that he was also happy he can open his store after dark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-official-strict-punishment-executions-will-return-101632417470285.html
