Now, European Commissioner Margaritis Schinas has said the situation in Afghanistan and the events associated with it could pave the way for the formation of a common migration policy.Speaking to an Austrian daily Wiener Zeitung, Schinas said, “It is true that we are now in a major crisis, but the European Union (EU) did not cause the situation, yet we are once again called upon to be part of a solution.”He further said that he wanted to “avoid a reflex” that takes Europe back to the crisis year 2015 “before it is even clear how the situation will develop.”Following the re-emergence of Taliban, several thousands of Afghans have been flown out of their homeland either to neighbouring Asian countries or to the US and Europe. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) has said that up to 500,000 Afghans could escape by the year-end. Meanwhile, many countries, including Russia, Austria and Greece, among others, have directly or indirectly, dismissed the idea of welcoming Afghan migrants, even as Europe is still recovering from the enormous refugee influx after the 2015 Syrian war.Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz reiterated his decision to not take migrants, saying that a potential Afghan wave in Europe must not take place. This comes after his stand against welcoming Afghans because the European nation has taken in a “disproportionately high” number since 2015, when one million people entered Europe from Asia, Africa and the Middle East.In the interview, Schinas said that the EU was better prepared this time, with stronger external border protection and financial resources to help Afghanistan’s neighbours, while the EU states’ policies were “increasingly converging.”Also Read | Don't want Afghan militants arriving under cover of refugees: Putin“Therefore, I see now as the moment to agree on a common European migration and asylum policy, as we proposed in the EU Commission in September,” he told Zeitung, according to Reuters.The European Commissioner further said that migration has long foiled the unity among the 27 members of the EU, with strong resistance to a deal among the “populists on the right and left fringes.” However, he added that he did see a window for a solution after the French presidential polls in May 2022 – by when Germany would also have a new ruling dispensation.The EU, on the other hand, has floated a plan to spend 300 million euros ($355 million) to resettle nearly 30,000 Afghans refugees inside the bloc in an attempt to avoid a migration crisis. According to a diplomatic note – seen by Bloomberg, the European Commission made the proposal to EU ambassadors at an August 26 meeting. Additional funds for the resettling purpose can also be made available, the Commission added according to Bloomberg.The EU had another meeting on August 31 – regarding the resettlement of Afghans and the situation in Afghanistan. Following the meeting, EU commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, informed on Twitter that she will “convene a high-level Resettlement Forum” in September to “discuss concrete priorities with member states and provide sustainable solutions” to those Afghans who are most vulnerable, such as women and children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worry-over-migration-crisis-can-pave-way-for-common-migration-policy-eu-101630777911731.html

He would sell the rights to a real estate developer, who subsequently would negotiate with hotel companies that would manage and rebrand it, the website reported, citing people familiar with the transaction. The lease is likely to fetch less than the $500 million the Wall Street Journal said Trump was seeking in 2019, Axios said. Trump signed the lease for the building in 2013, and the General Services Administration oversees the contract. The hotel opened in September 2017, about eight months after he took office. The Trump International Hotel became one of the former president’s most successful property projects, generating revenues from foreign governments that rented space for events and favor-seekers eager to be seen there.Trump owns the hotel through his trust, which holds all of his business interests, and ultimately profits from it. The hotel has become a magnet for high-powered Republicans in Washington, from lobbyists to lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-in-talks-to-sell-leasing-rights-to-his-washington-dc-hotel-report-101630775590257.html

"The Mujahideen (Taliban fighters) are advancing toward the centre (of the province)," he said on Twitter.Also Read| Kabul airport reopens to received aid, civilian flights to start soon: QatarBut the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, grouping forces loyal to local leader Ahmad Massoud, said it surrounded "thousands of terrorists" in Khawak pass and the Taliban had abandoned vehicles and equipment in the Dashte Rewak area.Front spokesman Fahim Dashti added "heavy clashes" were going on.In a Facebook post, Massoud insisted Panjshir "continues to stand strongly". Praising "our honourable sisters", he said demonstrations by women in the western city of Herat calling for their rights showed Afghans had not given up demands for justice and "they fear no threats".Earlier a Taliban source said the Taliban's advance was slowed by landmines placed on the road to the provincial capital, Bazarak.It was not immediately possible to get independent confirmation of events in Panjshir, which is walled off by mountains except for a narrow entrance.Celebratory gunfire resounded in Kabul on Friday as reports spread of the Taliban's takeover of Panjshir, and news agencies said at least 17 people were killed and 41 hurt in the firing.Pakistan's spy chiefPakistan's spy chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed flew into Kabul on Saturday. It was not clear what his agenda was, but a senior official in Pakistan said earlier in the week that Hameed, who heads the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, could help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military.Washington has accused Pakistan and the ISI of backing the Taliban in the group's two-decade fight against the US-backed government in Kabul, although Islamabad has denied the charges.In Kabul, Taliban fighters broke up a demonstration by about a dozen women urging the group to respect women's rights to education and jobs, according private broadcaster Tolo news.Also Read| Celebratory gunfire, tear gas on women's protest: What is happening in Kabul?Footage showed women confronted by armed militants covering their mouths and coughing, and one demonstrator said the fighters had used tear gas and tasers against the participants, who had been carrying banners and a bouquet of flowers."They also hit women on the head with a gun magazine, and the women became bloody," said a demonstrator who gave her name as Soraya.The Taliban imposed violent punishments and barred women and older girls from school and work when they were previously in power, but have sought to present a more moderate face this time.Government next weekThe Taliban source also said the announcement of a new government would be pushed back to the next week.Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, reported by some Taliban sources to be in line to lead the new government, said in remarks on Qatar's Al Jazeera channel that the new administration "will include all factions of the Afghan people"."We are doing our utmost efforts to improve their living conditions. The government will provide security, because it is necessary for economic development," he said.Meanwhile, some signs of normality returned to Kabul.Qatar's ambassador to Afghanistan said a technical team was able to reopen Kabul airport to receive aid, according to Al Jazeera, which also cited its correspondent as saying domestic flights had restarted.The airport has been closed since the United States on Aug. 30 completed the evacuations of more than 120,000 US citizens, other foreigners and Afghans deemed at risk from the Taliban, and withdrew the last of its troops.Also Read| China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban ruled AfghanistanThe Taliban's main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, also said one of the main foreign exchange dealers in Kabul had reopened.Afghanistan's economy has been thrown into disarray by the Taliban's takeover.

Not above Modi, Merkel||Several polls have shown that the approval rating of US President Joe Biden has significantly dropped after the troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to a humanitarian crisis. The latest survey by global data intelligence Morning Consult suggests that at least half of the respondents disapprove of how Biden’s foreign policy and handling of national security in the aftermath of chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.Biden, whose approval rating remained over 50% since he took the office in January, is now looking at an approval rating of 48%, an all-time low in few months of his presidency. With 26% of respondents citing terrorism and foreign policy as major issues influencing their vote for federal office, the survey suggests that the last time these issues gained such prominence was when the US-Iran tensions escalated following the killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.“While it’s far too early to tell whether concerns about security will prove decisive at the ballot box next year, the numbers suggest that the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan has given Republicans an opening to move the midterm conversation to a more [favourable] playing field in the near term,” the report says.Also Read | PM Modi's approval rating is 70%, highest among 13 global leadersThe fall in Biden’s approval rating has pushed him below German chancellor Angela Merkel on the list of global leaders’ approval.

The fall of Afghanistan is not only shameful for US President Joe Biden, but also the whole of Western civilisation because everybody knows that Pakistan is running the show, Amrullah Saleh wrote. As he has earlier said, he reiterated that he will not surrender to the Taliban and his security guard has been sworn to shoot him twice in the head in case he gets injured, as he will never surrender to the Taliban, he wrote.The account comes at a time when the Taliban have claimed that they have captured Panjshir province, the only Taliban-free province of the country. Panjshir residents are fleeing their homes and choosing other Taliban-ruled provinces to avoid death in the massive clash that is still going on in the valley. “The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy. It is the Pakistanis who are in control as a colonial power”@AmrullahSaleh2 spoke to me about his patriotic fight to save Afghanistan. In @DailyMailUKhttps://t.co/eE9Z7jcEQY‘Pakistan is running the show’Reiterating his theory of strong Pakistan support to the Taliban rise, a factor which former president Ashraf Ghani reportedly mentioned during his last phone call, Saleh wrote the Talian were receiving instruction from the Pakistan embassy. "The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy...The betrayal of Afghanistan by the West is colossal...Your politicians know that Pakistan is running the show. They know al Qaeda is back in the streets of Kabul. And they know the Taliban have not reformed. They have been displaying their suicide vests in Kabul," Saleh wrote.Night before Kabul fellThe night before Kabul fell, there was a revolt inside the prison and Taliban inmates were attempting to escape, the then vice president was informed. He tried to contact the non-Taliban prisoners and faced counter-revolt. The next day, Amrullah Saleh woke up at 8am to numerous calls from family, friends. He said he tried to contact the minister of defence and the interior minister and their deputies. But they were not reachable. The police chief of Kabul informed him that he could hold the front for an hour. " But in that one desperate hour, I was unable to find deployable Afghan troops anywhere in the city," Saleh wrote."I messaged our National Security Adviser to say we have to do something. I got no response from anyone. And by 9am that morning of August 15, Kabul was panicking," Saleh wrote.As the Taliban firmed their hold on Kabul, Saleh messaged Ahmad Massoud who was also in Kabul. "I then went through my home and destroyed pictures of my wife and my daughters. I collected my computer and some belongings," Saleh wrote adding that he made his chief guard Rahim swear by Koran that he will have to shoot Amrullah Saleh if he gets injured. "I don't want to surrender to the Taliban. Ever," he wrote.Why Amrullah Saleh did not flee AfghanistanAs Saleh recounted, he was offered an escape even before the fall of Kabul. But he refused to be one of those politicians who 'betray people' and then drop a Twitter or Facebook post from posh hotels abroad, he wrote. "They stay in these hotels and villas abroad. And then they call on the poorest Afghans to revolt. That's craven. If we want a revolt, the revolt has to be led," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/destroyed-photos-of-my-wife-daughters-amrullah-saleh-recounts-how-he-left-kabul-101630766122137.html

04-09-2021||World||These armyworms are marching across US. Experts say it’s a ‘perfect storm’||Large swaths of armyworms—specifically the fall armyworm—have been invading lawns, eating up grass and plants in an infestation, which experts say they have not seen in decades, reported across the US. Rick Brandenburg, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, said the insects are laying siege to areas such as North Carolina, Texas, Michigan and northeastern states, which rarely see such significant armyworm populations. "This year is like a perfect storm. In my 40 years, I have never seen the problem as widespread as it is this year,” Brandenburg told USA Today.Entomologist Thomas Kuhar said this was the largest infestation he has seen in 30 years, and “perhaps the most unique”. Kuhar, a professor at Virginia Tech, said armyworms are often found in crops such as corn, rice and sorghum, but this year’s outbreak is selectively targeting lawns and some hayfields. “That’s not a normal fall armyworm behaviour. They should just be devouring things in their path,” he told Bloomberg.Eric Rebek, an Oklahoma State University entomology professor, said these pests return to Oklahoma every year in late summer and early fall as they travel in large swaths from one food source to another until the winter frost kills them. "They can easily munch their way through whatever, whether it's a lawn or a park or a golf course. They just lay waste to everything in their path, moving through just like an army on the move," Rebek told USA Today.What are fall armyworms?According to Rebek, there are two kinds of armyworms: the true armyworm and the fall armyworm. The fall armyworms, which are indigenous to the US, are the larval stage of the fall armyworm moth. The caterpillars grow up to two inches long and can be green, brown or black in colour. Rebek said they can be identified by an inverted white "y" on their head capsules. A single female can lay as many as 1,500 eggs.What damage do armyworms inflict?Rebek said fall armyworms eat up grass of all kinds, adding the extent of the damage depends on the type of grass. "For warm-season grass, is mostly an aesthetic issue. But if you have cool-season grass, you probably want to treat your lawn,” he said.What’s the reason behind the widespread outbreak?According to experts, it could be a number of factors, including a warming climate, wetter weather or changes in natural enemies such as predators, parasites and pathogens."It's hard to point your finger at any one thing… It's likely a very complex interaction that is occurring this year that leads to this outbreak," Rebek said.Brandenburg said while climate change has the potential to increase the likelihood of tropical pests like fall armyworms infesting lawns, it's difficult to make a direct link between the two because so many factors are at play.How can armyworm attacks be prevented?People can’t do much to protect their lawns from armyworms and Rebek warned homeowners to be watchful. “It's hard to deter them. And it's hard to predict where they'll land and prevent that from happening,” he said adding that people must check the label on their insecticide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-armyworms-are-marching-across-us-experts-say-it-s-a-perfect-storm-101630762944280.html
04-09-2021||World||India-US 2+2 meeting to be held in November||The next round of India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue is expected to take place in November and “there is some talk” of a summit meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the first in-person summit-level meeting of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad).Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters on Friday, at the end of two days of meetings with US officials and business leaders, that the dates for the 2+2 are still being discussed. He also spoke of the tentative bilateral summit as he qualified it as something under discussion.It’s US’s turn to host the annual meeting of the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries and it will be the first meeting of this format with the Biden administration. The last meeting was held in New Delhi October 2020 with MikePompeo and Mark Esper, secretaries of state and defence in the Trump administration.The upcoming meeting will be between India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin. All four of them have had in-person meetings before; and several times with Jaishankar and Blinken.An in-person summit of the Quad - with leaders of Japan and Australia - is also being discussed following up the virtual meeting in March. Modi and Biden could meet for their first bilateral at the time according to discussions currently under way.Also, President Biden’s special envoy on climate John Kerry is headed for India, for his second visit in this capacity.Shringla met almost the entire leadership of the state department including secretary of state Blinken and deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman, and top leaders at the department of defence and the national security council at the White House.The situation in Afghanistan figured in all his conversations predictably and the foreign secretary said the US position of “wait and watch” tracked closely with India’s own approach.Shringla said the US has adopted a “wait and watch policy” and that they will calibrate their actions depending on how the situation evolves. “That’s also similar to what we ourselves conveyed in the parliamentary briefing that was held a few days ago. We said we will have a wait-and-watch policy, which does not mean you don’t do anything,” Shringla said, adding, “It simply means … the situation is very fluid on the ground, you have to allow it to see how it evolves. You have to see whether the assurances that were made publicly are maintained on the ground.”India’s ask list, the foreign secretary said, was as “we have told them that we want them to be cognisant of the fact that there should be no terrorism that emanates from their territory against us or other countries. We want them to be mindful of the status of women, minorities and so on so forth.”The foreign secretary was referring to repeated assurances the Taliban gave Indian diplomats in their first official contact some days ago after the insurgent group took control of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiaus-2-2-meeting-to-be-held-in-november-101630760004386.html

Here's why||New Zealand officials on Saturday confirmed the name of the attacker who stabbed seven people at an Auckland supermarket before he was shot dead by police. The officials said that Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, was the Islamic State-inspired extremist killed by police on Friday, reported Associated Press.Samsudeen was 22 when he arrived in New Zealand in 2011 on a student visa. Police took notice of him in 2016 when Samsudeen expressed sympathy for terrorist attacks and advocated violent extremism on Facebook. His online activity related to extremist stuff continued even after the police spoke to him twice.Samsudeen was finally arrested in May 2017 at Auckland International Airport as police believed he was heading to Syria. He was charged for possession of restricted publications, to which he pleaded guilty. While on bail, he bought a knife and was arrested again. The attacker spent months in prison but the police couldn't keep him there any longer as they failed to lay an additional charge under the existing Terrorism Suppression Act for the knife and online posts. They had to release Samsudeen in mid-July this year but kept tracking his every move.Watch | ISIS-inspired terrorist goes on stabbing spree in New Zealand mallUndercover officers sprang into action as the attacker went on a stabbing spree at an Auckland supermarket. They shot Samsudeen dead within a couple of minutes of him beginning the attack.“As you can see, agencies used every tool available to them to protect innocent people from this individual,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a press conference Saturday. “But we owe it to everyone to have other people look at the facts of this case too, to analyse them, to see what was done, and what more could have been done.”Ardern had earlier confirmed that five of the stabbing victims were in a hospital, of whom three were in critical condition. While Ardern said she can provide the details about the attacker's criminal history, she didn't reveal his name.“I am also unable to share his name, but I would note, this is not something I had any intention of sharing regardless of the court ruling.

Within a month, the Afghan government fell and as the Taliban proceeded to rule the country, it said China is the most important partner of the Taliban. China has also promised to keep its embassy in Afghanistan open as a time when other countries are mulling relocating their embassies to the UAE. The Taliban claimed that China will also increase its humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. China, meanwhile, said it expects the new establishment to dissociate from terror groups.Here is what the recent statements from China and Taliban about each other indicate'Pass to markets all over the world'Taliban want to maintain diplomatic relations with all countries, they have already clarified. But they consider China as the most important partner as China represents an opportunity to rebuild Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.There are "rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world," the spokesperson said.Taliban hold the New Silk Road, the infrastructure initiative of China in high regard, the spokesperson said.'Open inclusive political structure'China has been reiterating the point of the Taliban taking a 'clean break' from terrorism and form an open and inclusive government that follows moderate policies to get international recognition. China is seeing the Taliban takeover as Afghanistan's break-free moment from foreign military intervention. "...facts show that in realising economic development we need an open inclusive political structure, implementation of moderate foreign and domestic policies and clean break from terrorist groups in all forms," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said earlier.In the July meeting, the Taliban committed to China that it will not allow the Uygur Muslim group -- the East Turkistan Islamic Movement -- to operate from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-most-important-partner-china-hopes-new-govt-will-stay-away-from-terrorism-101630755375292.html

The team flew into Afghanistan’s capital on Wednesday, making their aircraft the first to land since the evacuations ended earlier this week.According to Al-Jazeera, the ambassador said the runway at the airport has been repaired in cooperation with authorities in Afghanistan. Al-Jazeera also reported that two domestic flights operated from Kabul to the cities of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar. Qatar’s foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on Thursday that his government is talking to the Taliban and working with Turkey for potential technical support to restart operations at the airport.After the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, the Kabul airport witnessed chaotic evacuations by several countries and a devastating attack on August 26 which left 13 United States military personnel and more than 160 Afghans dead.Last week, the United States forces carried out a drone strike that blew up a vehicle carrying suicide bombers of the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan. The vehicle was aiming to attack the Kabul airport. And on Monday, five rockets were fired at the airport which was intercepted by a missile defence system, a US official said.The airport had been out of operations after the US withdrew all its troops from Afghanistan on August 31 (Tuesday). A person told AFP on condition of anonymity on Thursday that the objective of reopening the airport was to resume flights both for humanitarian aid and to provide freedom of movement, including the resumption of evacuation efforts.Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from Afghanistan till now even as more are trying to flee from the war-ravaged country, which is now under the Taliban’s rule. The Taliban had earlier promised safe passage for those who were willing to leave Afghanistan.Meanwhile, the Taliban have again postponed the formation of a new government in Afghanistan, with the group’s spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid saying on Saturday that the announcement about the new cabinet will be made next week.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-reopens-to-received-aid-civilian-flights-to-start-soon-qatar-101630754093901.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid on Saturday said that the announcement about the new government and Cabinet members will now be made next week, reported news agency PTI, without providing the reason behind the postponement.The Taliban were expected to announce the government formation today in Kabul, with the group’s co-founder Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar as its head. The reports, however, suggest that the insurgents have been struggling to shape an inclusive administration acceptable to the international community."The Taliban can form a government of their own but they are now focussing to have an administration in which all parties, groups and sections of the society have proper representation," PTI quoted Khalil Haqqani, a member of the committee tasked to negotiate talks with different groups over the government formation, as saying.Also Read | Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?Khalil Haqqani, who is in charge of the security of Kabul, revealed that former Afghanistan’s prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and brother of ousted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai, will be given representation in the government, reported PTI. Hashmat Ghani had recently indicated that he’ll support a Taliban-led government.“Taliban are well capable of bringing security but running a functional government requires the input and collaboration of younger, educated Afghans. The so called expired politicians should be sidelined completely so that the failed experience of coalition government is not repeated,” he wrote on Twitter.On Friday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken reiterated the expectations from a Taliban-led government, including the formation of an inclusive government, rejecting reprisals and upholding the basic rights of Afghans. The top US diplomat was responding to the reports of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar getting the charge of the new government.“There is an expectation that any government that emerges now will have some real inclusivity and that it will have non-Talibs in it who are representative of different communities and different interests in Afghanistan,” said Blinken, who is set to visit Doha on Sunday.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-taliban-had-to-postpone-government-formation-in-afghanistan-for-second-time-101630752777449.html

During the meeting, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres will also appeal for "full and unimpeded humanitarian access to make sure Afghans continue to the essential services they need,” spokesperson Stephane Dujarric announced on Friday."One in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. Nearly half of all children under the age of 5 are predicted to be acutely malnourished in the next 12 months," Dujarric said and added that the UN has appealed for $1.3 billion for 2021 to help more than 18 million people.She also expressed gratitude to Denmark, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the United States on the behalf of the UN chief for assisting in the temporary relocation of UN staff in Afghanistan.Afghanistan is under major turmoil after the US and Nato troops withdrew from the country, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban returning to power. The group was ousted by the US forces in 2001 in anti-terrorist operations. The war-ravaged nation is now facing a severe economic crisis as western nations pulled out the financial support and the looming political uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Taliban is set to announce their own government which will likely be led by its co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Baradar, who heads the Taliban's political office, will be joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, in senior positions in the government, news agency Reuters reported people familiar with the matter.Earlier this week, Guterres warned of a "humanitarian catastrophe" in Afghanistan and urged countries to provide emergency funding. Guterres also expressed his "grave concern at the deepening humanitarian and economic crisis in the country," adding that basic services threatened to collapse "completely" in the war-torn country.On August 18, the head of the UN food agency in Afghanistan said that a humanitarian crisis is unfolding with 14 million people facing severe hunger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-growing-humanitarian-crisis-in-afghanistan-un-chief-to-hold-ministerial-meeting-seeking-funding-101630751687423.html

However, the formation of the government has been postponed for the time being as the Taliban are buying some more time to finetune their future administration.The women-led protest in Kabul which was on its second day demanding representation in the government turned violent as the Taliban fighters sprayed tear gas on the protesters to stop them from marching towards the presidential palace. Videos of women being stopped have emerged on social media. A video of the protest was also live-streamed.

He recommended boosters eight months after the second shot.However, those agencies are awaiting critical data before signing off on the third doses, with Moderna's vaccine increasingly seen as unlikely to make the September 20 date.According to one official, Moderna produced inadequate data for the FDA and CDC to approve the third dose of its vaccine. The FDA has requested additional data that is likely to delay those boosters into October. Pfizer is further along in the review process, with an FDA panel review on boosters on September 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-biden-s-plans-to-start-delivery-of-covid-booster-shots-face-complications-101630749662507.html

Tolo, one of the first commercial television networks in Afghanistan, kept broadcasting even as Kabul fell to the Taliban on the evening of August 15. While the Taliban have asked the Afghan media to operate as usual, many are apprehensive given the history of the hardline Islamists who banned TV during their rule from 1996-2001."We're scared, I'll be honest with you, we are nervous," Saad Mohseni, CEO of Tolo's parent company Moby Group, told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). "Everyone is having sleepless nights, but what the viewer is experiencing is not that different."Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an international media watchdog, had remarked in a report before Kabul’s fall that women journalists “continue to be vulnerable in a country where they are among the leading targets of fundamentalist propaganda, which circulates widely in several regions.” The organisation had raised concern that basic freedoms, including the freedom of women journalists, could be sacrificed for the sake of a peace deal.Also Read | Taliban scouting porn sites to compile kill list of Afghan prostitutes: ReportWith frequent interviews, the Taliban have taken a different approach this time to reveal their stance on television and women’s rights while they continue to insist on a “genuine Islamic system.” One Taliban official recently gave an interview to a woman host on Tolo News, projecting a softer image than the one they had created two decades ago. But an RSF report exposed the Islamists replacing a female anchor at state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA), who was told to “stay at home for a few days.”Mohseni has pledged to keep women on-air even as the company lost many female employees after the Taliban’s return. But the director of Tolo News, Lotfullah Najafizada, acknowledged the difficulty of keeping the news operations alive under the Taliban rule. Najafizada told news agency AFP that the regime change has "put us in a very, very difficult situation... to continue our work or not.""As a 24/7 news operation, we didn't even have one hour to take a break and rethink," he added.Also Read | China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban-ruled AfghanistanBefore the Taliban’s takeover, Kabul had 108 media outlets and 1,080 female employees, of whom 700 were journalists, according to RSF. The media watchdog said in a report earlier this week that the number of female journalists formally working in privately-owned radio and TV stations in Afghanistan’s capital has shrunk to fewer than 100.“A fundamental red line will be the Taliban's treatment of women and girls, and respect for their rights to liberty, freedom of movement, education, self-expression and employment, guided by international human rights norms,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet had said last month.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-scared-what-s-going-on-inside-top-afghan-tv-network-under-taliban-rule-101630749721480.html

Pakistan is globally accused of aiding the Taliban. But now that the United States somewhat needs Pakistan's cooperation to fight ISIS, al Qaeda, Pakistan wants more public recognition, Politico reported.Here is what the leaked documents are and what they revealThese leaked documents are mostly discussions between Pakistan and US officials, sensitive but unclassified cables.On August 26, the day the Kabul blasts took place killing over 170 people including US officials and Afghans, US State Department official, Ervin Massinga and Pakistan's ambassador Asad Majeed Khan exchanged messages.“Acknowledging the tragedy, Mr Massinga underscored the mutual interest Pakistan and the United States have in targeting ISIS and al Qaeda," the description of what transpired in the meeting said. In response, the Pakistani ambassador “acknowledged ISIS-K was a common enemy for the Taliban as well.”"At one point in the talk, however, Ambassador Khan intimated the Pakistani government would also appreciate public acknowledgement for the country’s assistance on the evacuation front," the document revealed.In another discussion, Asad Majid Khan told US officials that the Taliban were not seeking retribution and they were going home to home to assure Afghans that there will be no reprisals.Has anything changed between Pakistan and the US?An August 20 statement of gratitude from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to several countries for their help in the evacuations did not mention Pakistan. In another statement released early this week, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland included Pakistan on a list of countries that provided "critical support" to the US efforts in evacuation.Other than this, there has not been much improvement as US President Joe Biden has not spoken with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

04-09-2021||World||China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban ruled Afghanistan||This week US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was asked whether Taliban was the enemy, the Joe Biden aide said that it was hard to put on a label on it, partly because we (US) are yet to see what they will be now that they are in complete control of Afghanistan.The democratic world is dealing with a peculiar situation in Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan where ruling Taliban is neither a UN nor US designated terrorist entity but more than 120 of its top leaders are listed as global terrorists under the 1267 UNSC committee including projected president of the Emirates, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The al Qaeda, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, all global terror entities under UN 1267 committee and US State Department, have sworn allegiance (bayat) to the Taliban and its supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akundzada. By this yardstick, the democratic world is playing with semantics when it is engaging Taliban without breaking its policy of not negotiating with terrorists and terror organizations. In fact, countries like China and United Kingdom have sought support of mentor Pakistan to engage the Taliban by throwing the moral principles book out of the window.With differences among the Taliban holding the announcement of the new Afghan government, the Pakistani super spy Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG, ISI, reached Kabul today. While the visit is hush-hush, Kabul watchers say that Gen Hameed will help the Taliban leadership to shed their differences and announce the government soon. It was Rawalpindi, which had facilitated the meeting of Mullah Baradar and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in China last July.In fact, the real gainer of the military revolutions this year is China, true practitioner of realpolitik, as it engages junta in Myanmar and Taliban in Afghanistan while democratic world is still hoping that the Sunni Islamist group will give them an inclusive government window to legitimize them.This poses real threat to India as it has pro-China regimes on the eastern and western borders. Besides the legitimate concerns of Taliban affiliate groups trying to create internal trouble in Kashmir and hinterland, India is faced with Chinese increasing its already large footprint to Afghanistan and Central Asia through its friends in Russia and Iran.The Taliban has actually thrown the western calculations in the trash bin by openly seeking economic ties with China rather than question them on treatment of Sunni Uighurs in Xinjiang. The Al Qaeda statement on August 31 talked about liberating so-called Islamic lands all over the world including Palestine, Maghreb, Syria, and Kashmir but did not utter a word about the Xinjiang Uighurs. So the theory that Taliban 2.0 would turn against China due to brutal repression in Xinjiang is still born.It is quite evident that China will extend its Belt Road Initiative to Afghanistan and exploit its Lithium and Copper resources in return for infrastructure development by liking it to CPEC. This will allow China to not only evacuate Afghan minerals from Gwadar port in Balochistan but also through the Karakoram Highway. It will also have a close look at the abandoned US military equipment including Black Hawk helicopters, IED proof all-terrain vehicles, tactical drones, area weapons and body armor for reverse engineering.China will use the Pakistani deep state as a trump card in its engagement with the Taliban as the entire leadership of the Sunni Pashtun Islamists including Mullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani has been nurtured and nourished by Rawalpindi. The same Pakistan card is being played by the British, who brokered a peace deal with US in favor of the Taliban boys, as described by UK Chief of Defence Staff Gen Nick Carter. The democratic world with feckless and tired US leadership surely has a weak hand in comparison to China and Taliban is no friend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-with-pak-support-has-advantage-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101630743525798.html

There are various elements that are supported by Pakistan -- so its role has to be seen in that context."Experts believe that Pakistan has been a key player in removing the elected Afghan government from power and establishing the Taliban as a decisive power in Afghanistan.Recently, a UN Monitoring report has said that a significant part of the leadership of Al-Qaida resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region.Almost all foreign members of ISIL-K and al-Qaida have entered Afghanistan via Pakistan and the leaders of these outfits along with those of the Taliban have been living in Pakistan, the UN report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-taliban-close-to-forming-govt-pak-intelligence-chief-reaches-kabul-101630743105230.html

Don't change our culture'||Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told an American news outlet on Friday that the United States should not impose upon Afghanistan its views on women's rights, insisting that it would be regarded as interfering with their “culture”. The idea that women can have “education without [a] hijab” is a ‘Western’ concept that is not compatible with the cultural values in Afghanistan, Shaheen said, adding that the Taliban stand opposed to it.Also Read | As Taliban sends conflicting signals, India maintains studied silenceThe Taliban spokesperson, however, maintained that “there will be no issue about women's rights” in Afghanistan as long as they (the women) receive education and work jobs wearing a hijab. In an interview with cable media network Fox News, Shaheen said, “There will be no issue about women's rights, no problem about their education or work; but we should not be changing each other's culture.”“That you women should have education without hijab, that is a change of culture,” Shaheen was heard saying in the interview. “Within our culture, women can receive education and work with [a] hijab. This is just one example. There may be more.”The statement by the Taliban spokesperson came amid reports that the group is close to forming a new interim government in Afghanistan, days after the last of the US troops left on a flight from the Kabul airport. With this withdrawal, the United States ended its longest war, an extended two-decade-long military campaign in the war-torn nation.Referring to US military withdrawal from Afghanistan as the end of one ‘chapter’ in the country's history, the Taliban spokesperson said, “For us, it was [an] occupation, we ended that. We were staging resistance, but now it is closed and it is in the past. We have to focus on the future – that is better for them (the US) and for us.”Also Read | Taliban expected to announce new government today: 10 points“We had this destructive relation, a hostile relation, and now we will turn this into a constructive relation,” said Taliban leader Suhail Shaheen, adding that the group is looking to work the Western nations in a ‘positive way’.Notably, Taliban leaders and their spokespersons have in recent days offered widely divergent views on a number of issues, which also includes one regarding the Kashmir valley in India.Most countries around the world, however, seem to be in no hurry to recognise a Taliban government anytime soon even if it is announced. Western powers say formal recognition of the Taliban government and a resulting flow of economic aid will depend on action to safeguard human rights, the rule of law, and the media.

Both will use the stage to gain momentum for the final stretch of the campaign.As the race remains tight, that debate will be a critical platform for the leaders of the major Federal parties to make an impression upon voters, just 11 days prior to the September 20 polls. A pair of official debates will be held next week and the only such event in English, the most crucial of the cycle, will be moderated by Indo-Canadian Shachi Kurl.Kurl, who is the president of the non-profit public opinion foundation, Angus Reid Institute (ARI), will moderate the event, the only English-language Leaders’ Debate, with the participation of four senior Canadian journalists. While an unofficial French-language debate took place on September 2, the official debate in French will be on September 8, but will mainly be focused upon the Francophone province of Quebec.Kurl, who was born in Vancouver in the province of British Columbia, has roots in Uttarakhand. She was lauded for her role as the moderator of the sole debate that preceded the 2020 provincial elections in British Columbia. That was factored into the decision by the Debate Broadcast Group (DBG) to select her for the high-profile assignment next Thursday.In an article at that time, the outlet City News 1130 commented, “Online, Kurl is being celebrated as the night’s true winner, managing to ask fair questions of all three leaders, all while maintaining order - a stark difference from moderating we’ve seen in past weeks just south of the border, where a presidential election campaign is under way”.A spokesperson for the DBG said it “was looking for someone with experience in politics, television, and debates, and found an excellent match in Ms Kurl”.The factors in her favour, he noted in an email, included her “leadership role as President of the Angus Reid Institute, working with public opinion data to further public knowledge and enhance the national understanding of issues that matter to Canada and the world; her analysis in both broadcast and print media”.The debates are conducted under the auspices of the public body, Leaders’ Debates Commission, and produced by DBG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-debate-trudeau-o-toole-face-off-over-public-policies-on-sept-9-101630734562749.html

The US has already evacuated tens of thousands of Afghans who were deemed at risk under the Taliban rule or people who aided America during the war.They are being moved to the US as part of an “enduring commitment" to help the people of Afghanistan, Alejandro Mayorkas said as per AP report. "Our commitment is an enduring one... this is not just a matter of the next several weeks. We will not rest until we have accomplished the ultimate goal," Mayorkas said in a briefing.After having a military base in Afghanistan for twenty years, the United States completed its withdrawal process earlier this week. The pullout led to a collapse of the Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani, and the Taliban seizing the power being ousted by the US forces in 2001.Former governor of Delaware, Jack Markell will reportedly be serving as coordinator of the resettlement work in what the White House is calling "Operation Allies Welcome." Markell will be working alongside the National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, DHS, and other federal agencies "to ensure vulnerable Afghans who pass screening and vetting reviews are safely and efficiently resettled here in the United States," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House principal deputy press secretary.The country has so far airlifted nearly 130,000 in one of the largest mass evacuations of US history. The authorities are airlifting from Afghanistan and carrying out the vetting and screening work in other countries like Germany, Spain, Kuwait and Qatar.However, the US government has not released information on what is happening to those who are not making it through the security vettings at the transit points.According to a report by AP, more than 40,000 have arrived in the US so far. About 20 per cent of these are either American citizens or permanent residents, it also reported. The rest are being moved under the Special Immigrant Visa. "Our mission is not accomplished until we have safely evacuated all US citizens who wish to leave Afghanistan or lawful permanent residents, all individuals who have assisted the United States in Afghanistan," Mayorkas also said. "This effort will not end until we achieve that goal," he also said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-welcome-at-least-50-000-evacuated-afghans-as-part-of-enduring-commitment-101630732600450.html

Between August 27 and September 2, the number of daily cases averaged 3,486, almost six times the figure for late July.The modelling was released during a briefing by Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam on Friday. This was the first briefing since Federal elections were called on August 15, and the absence of these interactions, which were frequent prior to that date, have been criticised by opposition parties.The new scenario also places increased pressure upon the ruling Liberal Party for precipitating elections while a fourth wave was under way, with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau facing constant criticism during a televised unofficial French-language debate on Thursday evening, during which he was accused of not maintaining Covid-appropriate norms at his campaign events. It also places attention on Canada’s decision to go ahead with opening discretionary travel to fully vaccinated international visitors from September 7, despite the ominous trajectory of coronavirus cases.In a statement, Tam said “the Delta-driven wave has continued to accelerate along the strong resurgence trajectory”.Vaccination rates are high in Canada with 84% of those above 12 having received at least one dose and 77% considered fully vaccinated. However, Tam urged a surge in vaccinations at this “crucial moment”. PHAC focused mainly on the 18 to 39 demographic where rates remain lowest, at 63% fully dosed.The modelling document issued by PHAC pointed out that new cases among the unvaccinated were increased at 12 times the rate for those fully vaccinated, while hospitalisations were correspondingly 36 times higher. It also noted that between December 14, 2020 and August 14, 2021, just 0.04% of those fully vaccinated were infected, with “the majority of recent cases and hospitalisations occurring in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-witness-surge-in-covid-cases-by-month-end-authorities-101630731562521.html

Facebook has apologised and disabled the tool, and has also launched an investigation.The issue surfaced when some users were watching the video from a British tabloid featuring Black men. These users soon received an automated prompt from Facebook asking if they would like to "keep seeing videos about Primates".The video date June 27, 2020, was from Daily Mail. It showed an altercation between the Black men and white police officers. While humans are among the many species in the primate family, the video had nothing to do with monkeys, chimpanzees or gorillas.A Facebook spokesperson called it a "clearly unacceptable error" and said the recommendation software involve was taken offline."We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations," Facebook said in response to a query sent by news agency AFP."We disabled the entire topic recommendation feature as soon as we realized this was happening so we could investigate the cause and prevent this from happening again," the spokesperson further said.The issue was brought to light by former Facebook content design manager Darci Groves who posted the screenshots of the recommendation on Twitter.

The state of Florida reported an additional 2,345 Covid-19 deaths in its latest weekly report on the fatality toll, which shows that the numbers have hit a new record, now clocking the highest deaths ever in a similar period than at any point in the past.The daily average rose 36% to 335, according to calculations based on data in the report. That would surpass the high for the entire pandemic shown in Johns Hopkins University data, which is based on when the death was reported, not when it occurred.People aged 65 and above accounted for 63% of the Covid-19 deaths in Florida. Cumulatively, over the entire period of the pandemic, Florida seniors have made up 79% of deaths.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released two studies on Friday which found that children are much more likely to be hospitalised as the Delta variant became widespread, but the kids do not, however, appear to contract a more serious illness. The studies show that kids, for example, do not require any more intensive care than in previous viral surges.Meanwhile, schools in Colorado have reported more than double the rate of Covid-19 outbreak this week than that of the previous. Covid-19 outbreaks in Colorado schools more than doubled in a week to 42, the Denver Post reported, quoting official state data. New clusters also popped up at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, the newspaper said.The White House, on the other hand, is expected to launch a campaign to administer more than 100 million booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine from the week starting on September 20, later this month. But health officials have advised the Biden administration to launch the campaign initially with Pfizer vaccines.Biden has unveiled a $65 billion plan to prepare for future pandemics threats, likening the ambitious proposal to the Apollo mission to the moon. The proposal announced Friday by the White House Office of Science, Technology, and Policy and National Security Council focuses on protecting the US against potentially catastrophic biological threats, including those that are naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberately set in motion by bad actors. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-widespread-in-us-florida-reports-record-number-of-deaths-101630725719776.html
04-09-2021||World||Google locks down Afghan govt email accounts as Taliban look for access: Report||Google has temporarily locked down some Afghan government email accounts as the Taliban is attempting to access the former officials' emails, Reuters reported.Google said Friday it was "taking temporary actions to secure relevant accounts," but did not admit to a complete lockdown of the accounts."In consultation with experts, we are continuously assessing the situation in Afghanistan. We are taking temporary actions to secure relevant accounts, as information continues to come in," a Google spokesperson said in a statement.The person familiar with the matter told the outlet the accounts were completely locked down as the information could be used to track down former government officials the group would harm.Around two dozen officials, with some in the ministries of finance, industry, higher education and mines, used Google for official communications, according to Reuters, along with local governments and the office of the presidential protocol.An employee of the former government told Reuters that the Taliban had asked him in late July to save data on the ministry in which he was formerly employed for on servers the group could access."If I do so, then they will get access to the data and official communications of the previous ministry leadership," the employee said, adding that he is now in hiding since he did not cooperate with the request.Former government officials, activists, and vulnerable groups fear reprisal as the Taliban has taken control of Kabul.This comes despite the Taliban have tried to portray a more moderate image this time than when they last seized power in 1996.They have announced amnesty to all, including those who worked for western militaries or the Afghan government or police.However, there have been reports that reality on the ground is quite different. Days after seizing control, the Taliban brutally executed a police chief who headed the police in Bagdhis province in Herat.In July, Taliban massacred nine ethnic Hazara men after taking control of Afghanistan's Ghazni province.According to Reuters, commandeering government databases and emails could provide information about employees of the former administration, ex-ministers, government contractors, tribal allies and foreign partners."It would give a real wealth of information," said Chad Anderson, a security researcher with internet intelligence firm DomainTools."Just even having an employee list on a Google Sheet is a big problem," he said, citing reports of reprisals against government workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-locks-down-afghan-govt-email-accounts-as-taliban-looks-for-access-report-101630725234336.html
04-09-2021||World||They'll kill us' - Afghan pilots held at Uzbek camp fear deadly homecoming||The US-trained Afghan pilots and others held at a camp in Uzbekistan already feared being sent back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. So it was little comfort when an Uzbek guard unsympathetically quipped the other day: "You can't stay here forever."The offhand warning added to an already grinding sense of unease at the camp just across Afghanistan's northern border, recounted one of the Afghan pilots who fled there with aircraft when ground forces fell to the Taliban in August as the United states and its allies withdrew their forces.What follows is the first, detailed inside account among Afghans who, for nearly three weeks, have been waiting in vain to be evacuated by the United States."If they send us back, I'm 100 percent sure they'll kill us," said the pilot, who declined to be named because of fear of reprisal.Speaking to Reuters on a cell phone that the Afghans there try to keep out of sight, the pilot described feeling like a prisoner, with highly restricted movement, long hours in the sun, and insufficient food and medicine. Some have lost weight."We are kind of like in jail," said the pilot, who estimates the Afghans held there number 465. "We have no freedom here."Late August satellite images provided to Reuters showed high walls surrounding the camp, whose housing units had been used previously to treat COVID-19 patients and is near the city of Termez. Images shared with Reuters from inside showed sparse white rooms with bunk beds and no clutter - since most Afghans arrived with just the clothes on their backs.Uzbek guards were armed, some with handguns and others with semi-automatic weapons, the pilot said.TALIBAN PRESSUREThe camp risks turning into another crisis for U.S. President Joe Biden, who was criticized left and right for the poor planning of evacuations that marked the end of America's longest war and the Islamist militant group's swift takeover.Current and former U.S. officials are critical of the failure of the U.S. government so far to evacuate the Afghan personnel and aircraft in Uzbekistan, as current and former U.S. officials warn of Taliban pressure on Uzbek authorities to hand them over.Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was "deeply concerned" about the Afghan pilots and other forces there."It is imperative that these personnel not fall into the hands of the Taliban both for their safety and the valuable technical knowledge and training they have," Reed told Reuters.John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Uzbekistan, said he believed Uzbekistan faced real and substantial pressure from the Taliban to hand them over."They want to have good relations with Taliban. They don't want to provoke them, but they also don't want to provoke us," said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank. He called for "competent statesmanship."Retired U.S. Brigadier General David Hicks, who commanded the training effort for the Afghan Air Force from 2016 to 2017, said the State Department had failed to act fast enough after being supplied details about the Afghans being held at the camp from a network of current and former U.S. servicemembers and lawmakers."I'm not sure what they're doing at this point, to be honest," said Hicks, who is among those working to help the pilots and their families.A State Department spokesperson said the United States was coordinating with Uzbekistan on the matter but stressed that Afghan personnel and aircraft were secure. It urged all of Afghanistan's neighbors to allow Afghans entry and to respect international law against returning refugees to countries where they are likely to face persecution.Uzbekistan's government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.DARING ESCAPEEven before the Taliban takeover, U.S.-trained, English-speaking pilots had become their prime targets. Taliban fighters tracked them down when they went off-base and assassinated some pilots. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-us-withdraws-2021-07-09In the final days and hours before losing the war to the Taliban, some Afghan pilots staged a stunning escape by flying 46 aircraft out the country before the Taliban could take them - more than a quarter of the available fleet of about 160 planes.Most flew from Kabul but some came from a base just across the border near the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, fleeing Taliban fighters who were storming the base after ground units collapsed. In a dramatic episode, one of the Afghan aircraft collided with an Uzbek jet, forcing the pilots to eject.The Afghan pilot who spoke to Reuters estimated there were about 15 pilots who flew A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, 11 pilots who flew UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, 12 pilots who flew MD-530 helicopters and many Mi-17 helicopter pilots.Besides dozens of pilots, there are Air Force maintenance personnel and other Afghan security forces at the camp. Some managed to cram family members onto aircraft but most are fearful for their loved ones across the border."There weren't any more ground forces. We fought until the last moment," the pilot said.One U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, commended the Afghans in Uzbekistan for taking the planes out of Afghanistan."The only thing they knew to do was to fly every aircraft out of Taliban hands," the official said, adding: "They believed in us."The Taliban did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Afghans in the Uzbek camp.However, a senior Taliban leader, speaking to Reuters after the fall of Kabul, said his forces had captured drones and helicopters. But he longed for the return of the Afghan aircraft in Uzbekistan."Inshallah we will receive our remaining aircrafts, they are not in Afghanistan," he said.The Taliban, which had no aircraft yet won the war, have also said they will be inviting former military personnel, including pilots, to join their new security forces. It says there will be no reprisal killings.BIOMETRIC READINGSOn Wednesday, officials from the U.S. government arrived at the camp to take biometric data from the Afghan personnel there, the pilot said."Fingerprints and also checking the IDs," he said.The State Department did not respond to a question from Reuters about the visit.The appearance of the U.S. personnel lifted the mood somewhat, the pilot said, but there was still no clear indication of whether help was on its way.The further the Taliban gets in establishing its government and relations with neighbors, the more risky their situation could become, the pilot said.Experts on the region like Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador, say Uzbekistan has every reason to seek a working relationship with the Taliban. That fear is shared among the Afghans at the camp."Most of the Air Force personnel, especially the pilots, they are educated in the U.S.," the pilot said."They cannot (go to) Afghanistan and also those countries which probably ... in the future will have good relations with the Taliban."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/theyll-kill-us-afghan-pilots-held-at-uzbek-camp-fear-deadly-homecoming-101630724598684.html

One memo warns that London could be stretched to breaking point as hundreds of thousands of people make their way to the UK capital.There will be a supposedly “spontaneous” service at St Paul’s Cathedral, according to Politico, and the new King Charles will tour the four nations of the United Kingdom in the days after her death.The British prime minister and the monarch are said to be in agreement that the day of her state funeral will be a day of national mourning. It will effectively be a holiday, although not described as such.Buckingham Palace officials have declined to comment, either on the leak or the plans.In 2017, ‘The Guardian’ published a long article revealing details about Operation London Bridge, which covered how the new King - Charles – will be proclaimed at St James’s Palace amid visiting royalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secret-funeral-plans-for-britain-s-queen-elizabeth-ii-leaked-101630723760642.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban expected to announce new government today: 10 points||The Taliban are likely to announce their ‘new government’ in Afghanistan on Saturday, news agencies reported, even as the last flame of resistance burns on in Panjshir Valley, with rebel fighters hitting back at the hardline Islamist militants. According to reports, Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is set to lead the new Afghan regime, joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban co-founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, in senior positions. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban's supreme religious leader, will focus on religious matters and governance within the framework of Islam, reported the Reuters news agency.Also Read | Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?The Taliban face the enormous challenge of shifting gears from being an insurgent group to governing power, days after the United States fully withdrew its troops and ended two decades of war. Here's what we know of the situation so far:1. The Taliban ‘government’ would comprise 25 ministries, with a consultative council, or Shura, of 12 Muslim scholars, a person close to the Islamist militant group said on Friday. They added that while the Taliban have often spoken of their desire to form a consensus government with other Afghan leaders, the interim government which is now being formed would consist solely of Taliban members.2. A Loya Jirga, or ‘grand assembly’ is also in the works, to be formed within six to eight months. This assembly is aimed at bringing together elders and representatives across Afghan society to discuss a constitution and the structure of the future government.3. While there is no definite timeframe on when the interim government cabinet would be finalised, those privy to the matter have said that it would be settled by Saturday, while others feel it could take until the middle of next week.4. Meanwhile, the Taliban are still battling the extinguish the last flame of resistance in the Panjshir Valley, which held out for a decade against the Soviet Union's occupation and also the Taliban's first rule from 1996-2001.5. Even though rumours spread on Friday in Kabul suggesting Panjshir had fallen and celebratory gunfire rang across the Afghan capital soon after, the Taliban made no official claims in this regard. Moreover, a resident told the AFP news agency, on the condition of anonymity, that the reports were false.6. It is understood that anti-Taliban militia and former Afghan security forces, who now make up the National Resistance Front based in Kabul, have significant weapon stockpiles in the Panjshir valley, which lies around 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Kabul.7. Meanwhile, much of the world seems to have adopted a wait-and-watch strategy with regards to the Taliban and their new regime in Afghanistan. The new government's legitimacy in the eyes of international donors and investors will be crucial. Humanitarian groups have warned of impending catastrophe, and the economy, reliant for years on millions of dollars in foreign aid, is near collapse.8. Denmark's foreign minister Jeppe Kofod has told a broadcaster that the country will not recognise any Taliban government, essentially becoming the first country to take such a position. British foreign minister Dominic Raab also said that it is necessary to engage with the Taliban to ensure safe corridors for those hoping to leave war-torn Afghanistan, but it doesn't mean Britain is ready to recognise a Taliban government.9. United States, too, is in no hurry to recognise the Taliban regime. The White House said that the Biden administration has no current plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments, and foreign currency reserves, which it froze after the Taliban takeover. Western powers say formal recognition of the Taliban government and a resulting flow of economic aid will depend on action to safeguard human rights, the rule of law, and the media.10. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has decided to convene a high-level meeting on Afghanistan in Geneva on September 13 to focus on humanitarian assistance for the country. The UN has already restarted humanitarian flights to parts of the country, while the country's flag carrier Ariana Afghan Airlines resumed domestic flights on Friday and the United Arab Emirates sent a plane carrying "urgent medical and food aid".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-announce-new-government-today-as-panjshir-puts-up-last-stand-10-points-101630718842214.html
04-09-2021||World||Biden directs declassification of documents about 9/11 attacks||President Joe Biden on Friday directed the declassification of certain documents related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a supportive gesture to victims' families who have long sought the records in hopes of implicating the Saudi government.The order, coming little more than a week before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, is a significant moment in a yearslong tussle between the government and the families over what classified information about the run-up to the attacks could be made public. That conflict was on display last month when many relatives, survivors, and first responders came out against Biden's participation in 9/11 memorial events if the documents remained classified.Biden said Friday that he was making good on a campaign commitment by ordering the declassification review and pledged that his administration “will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community.”“The significant events in question occurred two decades ago or longer, and they concern a tragic moment that continues to resonate in American history and in the lives of so many Americans,” the executive order states. “It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, relying on classification only when narrowly tailored and necessary."The order directs the Justice Department and other executive branch agencies to begin a declassification review and requires that declassified documents be released over the next six months.Brett Eagleson, whose father, Bruce, was among the World Trade Center victims and who is an advocate for other victims' relatives, commended the action as a “critical first step.” He said the families would be closely watching the process to make sure that the Justice Department follows through and acts "in good faith.”“The first test will be on 9/11, and the world will be watching. We look forward to thanking President Biden in person next week as he joins us at Ground Zero to honor those who died or were injured 20 years ago,” Eagleson said.Still, the practical impact of the executive order and any new documents it might yield was not immediately clear. Public documents released in the last two decades, including by the 9/11 Commission, have detailed numerous Saudi entanglements but have not proved government complicity.A long-running lawsuit in federal court in New York aims to hold the Saudi government accountable and alleges that Saudi officials provided significant support to some of the hijackers before the attacks. The lawsuit took a major step forward this year with the questioning under oath of former Saudi officials, and family members have long regarded the disclosure of declassified documents as an important step in making their case.The Saudi government has denied any connection to the attacks.Fifteen of the hijackers were Saudi, as was Osama bin Laden, whose al-Qaida network was behind the attacks. Particular scrutiny has centered on the support offered to the first two hijackers to arrive in the U.S., Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, including from a Saudi national with ties to the Saudi government who helped the men find and lease an apartment in San Diego and who had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.Though many documents examining potential Saudi ties have been released, U.S. officials have long regarded other records as too sensitive for disclosure. On Thursday, victims' families and survivors urged the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the FBI's apparent inability to locate key pieces of evidence they've been seeking.The Justice Department revealed last month that the FBI had recently completed an investigation examining certain 9/11 hijackers and potential co-conspirators, and that it was working toward providing more information.Under the terms of the executive order, the FBI must complete by Sept. 11 its declassification review of documents from that probe, which it has referred to as the "Subfile Investigation.” Additional documents, including any phone and bank records and reports with investigative findings, are to be reviewed with an eye for disclosure over the course of the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-directs-declassification-of-documents-about-9-11-attacks-101630722205819.html

It is the first coronavirus-related death in the country since mid-February."Every death is a reminder of the damage Covid-19 can cause when it gets into our community," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in the statement."Our older New Zealanders and those with underlying health issues are by far the most at risk from the virus and one of the reasons lockdowns are such an important tool to stop its spread."New Zealand appears to be breaking the chain of transmission of the highly infectious Delta variant, with Saturday's numbers backing a lowering trend seen in recent days.About 1.7 million people in Auckland, the nation's largest city, have been in strict level 4 lockdown since mid-August. Curbs have been eased in the rest of the countries but schools and offices as well as cafe, restaurants and all public venues remain shut. Most New Zealanders have been asked to stay indoors.Active cases of the current outbreak stand at 782, with 765 in Auckland and 17 in Wellington, the capital.New Zealand, a nation of five million, has reported 3,392 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 27 related deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-reports-first-death-from-delta-variant-of-covid19-101630721461750.html
04-09-2021||World||Expect to have real, inclusive government in Afghanistan: Antony Blinken||The United States and the international community expects the Taliban to form an inclusive government with representations from different communities and interests, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday.“As we've said and as countries around the world have said, there is an expectation that any government that emerges now will have some real inclusivity, and that it will have non-Talibs in it who are representative of different communities and different interests in Afghanistan,” Blinken told reporters at a news conference.The Taliban is expected to soon announce the formation of a new government after the takeover of the country last month.“We will see what, in fact, emerges, but I have to tell you that as important as what the government looks like is, more important still is what any government does. And that's what we're really looking at. We're looking at what actions, what policies any new Afghan government pursues. That's what matters the most,” he said.The expectation is to see inclusivity in government, but ultimately the expectation is to see a government that makes good on commitments that the Taliban have made, particularly in freedom of travel, not allowing Afghanistan to be used as a launching ground for terrorism directed at the US or any of the allies and partners, upholding the basic rights of the Afghan people, including women and minorities, and not engaging in reprisals, Blinken said.“These are the things that that we're looking at. And, again, not just us, many countries around the world,” he said.The United States, Blinken said, is committed to looking at everything done from day one through the present and draw lessons from it. “I think that there also needs to be, including across the State Department, a look back at the entire 20 years to understand the entire course of this war and engagement with Afghanistan and to ask the right questions and to learn the right lessons from that,” he said.Blinken said American diplomacy with allies and partners continues to intensify.“That diplomacy has already produced a statement signed by more than 100 countries and the UN Security Council resolution that makes clear the international community's expectations of a Taliban-led government, including freedom of travel; making good on its commitments on counterterrorism; upholding the basic rights of Afghans, including women and minorities; and forming an inclusive government and rejecting reprisals,” he said.The Secretary of State will be travelling to Qatar and Germany to hold meetings to intensify diplomacy with its friends and allies on the current evolving situation in Afghanistan.“On Sunday, I'll be heading to Doha where I'll meet with Qatari leaders to express our deep gratitude for all that they're doing to support the evacuation effort. I'll also have a chance to meet with Afghans, including our locally employed staff from the Embassy in Kabul, who are now safely in Doha preparing for their journey to the United States,” he said.From there, Blinken will be heading to Ramstein Air Base in Germany where, he will have a chance to meet Afghans awaiting processing to head to the US and the Americans who are staffing that effort.“I'll also meet with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, and we'll hold a ministerial meeting on Afghanistan with him live and then virtually with other partners that'll include more than 20 countries that all have a stake in helping to relocate and resettle Afghans and in holding the Taliban to their commitments,” he said.Later, Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Dean Thompson told reporters that Blinken has no plans to meet the Taliban leadership in Doha.“There's currently no plans to do any meetings with the Taliban in Doha. This is very much focused on our relationship with Qatar, thanking them for the incredible support that they've given, as well as on the German side. That'll be a fundamental message throughout the trip,” he said.The US, he said, is watching very carefully and closely the evolving developments in Afghanistan.“I think it’s too early to make a firm judgment. Reports that we receive of violations of basic human rights and particularly reports about restrictions on women, girls, anything of that nature is of great concern and something we would definitely continue to raise,” he said.“At the same time, I would note that there was cooperation with the Taliban in order to affect the huge operation of the last few weeks, and so I think as we’ve said, the Taliban has made some good statements – or some positive statements is a better way to say it – but their actions are what is going to matter,” he said.“We are going to continue to really assess that. And I think even more broadly than that is they’re not just the actions of any one individual but their ability to ensure that across the country they live up to their commitments that they’ve made,” Thompson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expect-to-have-real-inclusive-government-in-afghanistan-antony-blinken-101630721129848.html
04-09-2021||World||US Covid-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer: Report||A White House plan to offer Covid-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech , a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on September 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose.Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission.A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot.Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout."It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know," Fauci said.Johnson & Johnson has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject.Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month.As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that Covid infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity."We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said."When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House Covid coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said.U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier.The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers.FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-booster-shot-campaign-to-start-with-only-pfizer-report-101630719440570.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban indicated they'd be reasonable in addressing Indian concerns: Shringla||India and the United States are closely watching Pakistan’s actions in Afghanistan, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday.In the limited engagement that India has had with the Taliban, the new Afghan rulers have indicated that they would be reasonable in addressing New Delhi’s concerns, the foreign secretary added.“Obviously, like us, they're also watching carefully and we have to watch Pakistan’s actions with a fine tooth comb,” he told a group of Indian reporters at the end of his three-day official visit to Washington DC adding that the US will have a wait-and-watch policy with regard to how the situation evolves in Afghanistan.India also has a similar policy. “That doesn't mean you don't do anything. It simply means that you have to... the situation is very fluid on the ground, you have to allow it to see how it evolves. You have to see whether the assurances that have been made publicly are actually maintained on the ground, and how things work out,” he said.“Our engagement with them (the Taliban) has been limited. It's not that we have (had) a robust conversation. But for whatever conversation we've had so far, they've been sort of. At least, the Taliban seem to indicate that they will be reasonable in the way they handle this,” Shringla said.He was responding to a question about the recent meeting that India’s Ambassador in Qatar had with a senior Taliban leader in Doha.“In our statement, we have said that we have told them that we want them to be cognisant of the fact that there should be no terrorism that emanates from their territory directed against us, or other countries; that we want them to be mindful of the status of women, minorities and so on so forth. And, and I think they have, also, you know, made reassuring... from their side,” he said.The top Indian diplomat was in Washington DC for a series of meetings with his American counterpart and top officials of the Biden administration in addition to interaction with representations from the industry and think-tanks.On Thursday, he had called on the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Observing that the situation in Afghanistan is very fluid and moving fast, Shringla said that both India and the US are keeping a close watch on it. “Look on 15th of August, you had a situation where (Afghan) President (Ashraf) Ghani suddenly left. You had the Taliban come in. The situation is moving so fast it's so fluid that is difficult to comment at this point of time on anything,” he said.Shringla said the US is watching the situation in Afghanistan very closely. “They will obviously see how different players get engaged in the situation in Afghanistan. Pakistan is a neighbour of Afghanistan. They have supported and nurtured the Taliban. There are various elements there that Pakistan supported,” he said.At the same time, he noted that the UNSC resolution on Afghanistan adopted during India’s presidency makes mention of the proscribed entities in the UN sanctions list, including the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. “We do have concerns about the free ingress that these two terrorist groups have had in Afghanistan, their role and we will watch that carefully. The role of Pakistan has to be seen in that context,” Shringla said.Responding to a question, the foreign secretary said the Americans have always said the Taliban has committed to them that they will not allow Afghan territory to be used again in any manner that is detrimental to any country outside Afghanistan.The US has made it clear to the Taliban that they would hold them accountable if any terrorist activities are emanating from Afghanistan. The international community is on the same page, he said.“We are obviously very much engaged with US on Afghanistan on the situation there, the role of Pakistan there, and of course looking at how the situation would evolve in that country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-indicated-they-d-be-reasonable-in-addressing-indian-concerns-shringla-101630715867101.html
04-09-2021||World||Militants may use chaos to infiltrate US, EU, says Nato||The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) has warned that militants could join migrants fleeing Afghanistan, potentially adding to security threats for Europe and the US after the American withdrawal from Kabul earlier this week.“We have put in place measures to avoid that, but in big numbers, it’s a risk,” Stefano Pontecorvo, the Nato’s senior civilian representative to Afghanistan, said in a Friday interview, referring to militants trying to use refugee flows to infiltrate Western countries. “I am sure it’s the case.”The European Union is eager to stem migration from Afghanistan and has cited the potential security threat. So far, about 500,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan this year, but there hasn’t been evidence of people entering neighbouring countries, nor has there been significant movement towards the bloc, according to an EU diplomatic note seen by Bloomberg.Pontecorvo, who took part in the effort to evacuate Afghan civilians from Kabul in August, said the end of the US presence is expected to free up Islamic State-Khorasan’s territorial claims in the country. “That is a risk that the Taliban will have to deal with,” he said.2nd evacuee boy dies of mushroom poisoningA second child of an Afghan family evacuated from Kabul to Poland died on Friday after eating soup containing death cap mushrooms, which the family had unknowingly gathered in a Polish forest outside their quarantine centre.The six-year-old boy had received an emergency liver transplant but doctors were unable to save him. His five-year-old brother was pronounced dead on Thursday at Poland’s main children’s hospital, where both were treated. The boys’ 17-year-old sister was treated at the hospital and released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militants-may-use-chaos-to-infiltrate-us-eu-says-nato-101630707015676.html
04-09-2021||World||Last pocket of resistance captured, claim Taliban||The Taliban forces have taken complete control of Afghanistan including the Panjshir valley where opposition forces had been holding out, three Taliban sources told Reuters on Friday as heavy celebratory gunfire was heard in the Afghan capital of Kabul.“We are in control of the entire Afghanistan. The troublemakers have [been] defeated and Panjshir is now under our command,” one Taliban commander reportedly said.It was not immediately possible to confirm the claims of the Taliban sources. The country’s former vice-president Amrullah Saleh, one of the leaders of the opposition forces, told Tolo News television station that reports he had fled the country were untrue.The BBC, however, reported that National Resistance Front (NRF) spokesman Ali Nazari said that anti-Taliban forces had actually pushed the insurgents back earlier in the day.“The Taliban’s propaganda machine keeps publishing the same claims that Panjshir has fallen - we have seen it for the past week that it is false, and it’s the opposite - that it’s the National Resistance Front that has caused them to retreat,” Nazari told the BBC.Other possible reasons for the gunfire in Kabul include a top Taliban leader entering Kabul or co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar being appointed head of state, the BBC report speculated.In a separate development, Afghanistan’s 250 female judges are particularly afraid of men they jailed who have now been freed by the Taliban. “Four or five Taliban members came and asked people in my house: ‘Where is this woman judge?’ These were people who I had put in jail,” a judge who had escaped to Europe said from an undisclosed location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-pocket-of-resistance-captured-claim-taliban-101630706801152.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban make it loud and clear: China is our top ally||Describing China as its “most important partner”, the Taliban group has said that it looks up to Beijing for support as war-ravaged Afghanistan faces widespread hunger and the possibility of a major economic collapse.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the group supports Beijing’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative that aims to link China with Africa, Asia and Europe through a network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks.“China is our most important partner and represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us because it is ready to invest and rebuild our country,” Geo News quoted Mujahid as saying in an interview to an Italian newspaper on Thursday.There are “rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world,” said Mujahid.China, too, has been making positive statements on the Taliban ever since it came to power in Kabul, and has expressed hope that the insurgents will follow moderate domestic and foreign policies, combat terrorist forces, live in harmony with other countries, and live up to the aspiration of its people and the international community.Afghan situation likely on BRICS summit agendaThe aftermath of the Taliban toppling the US-backed government in Kabul is likely to be discussed during a BRICS summit scheduled for later this month, Beijing indicated on Friday. The 13th BRICS summit will be held virtually under the chairmanship of India.“BRICS is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries. It is a positive stabilising constructive force in international affairs,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters when asked whether the summit will discuss the situation in Afghanistan.EU sets conditions for building ties with TalibanEU countries on Friday laid out their conditions for stepping up engagement with the Taliban, agreeing to establish a joint Kabul civilian presence to help departures if security allows.“We have to engage with the new government in Afghanistan, which doesn’t mean recognition. It’s an operational engagement,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said, following a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Slovenia. “This operational engagement will increase depending on the behaviour of this government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-make-it-loud-and-clear-china-is-our-top-ally-101630706488406.html
04-09-2021||World||Hurricane Ida’s record rain leaves 49 dead in U.S. northeast||Flash flooding killed at least 49 people in four Northeastern states as remnants of Hurricane Ida unleashed torrential rains that swept away cars, submerged New York City subway lines and grounded airline flights, officials said on Thursday.Across large swaths of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, residents spent the day coping with water-logged basements, power outages, damaged roofs and calls for help from friends and family members stranded by flooding.At least 13 people lost their lives in New York City, along with three in suburban Westchester County. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said in a tweet at least 23 people from that state had perished in the storm. Among the fatalities, three people were found dead in a basement in the New York City borough of Queens, while four residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, died at a public housing complex flooded by 8 feet of water.US President Joe Biden declared that an emergency exists in the states of New Jersey and New York and ordered federal assistance to supplement local response efforts due to conditions resulting from the remnants of Hurricane Ida, the White House said on Thursday.Roadways were transformed into river-like torrents in minutes as the downpours struck on Wednesday night, trapping drivers in quickly rising floodwaters. Scores of vehicles were found abandoned on area roadways on Thursday.Subway services in New York City remained “extremely limited,” transit officials said, and commuter rail services to the suburbs were largely suspended. About 370 flights were canceled at New Jersey’s Newark Liberty Airport.The damage came three days after Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the US Gulf Coast, made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana, destroying entire communities. But the loss of life in the Northeast dwarfed the confirmed storm-related death toll of nine in Louisiana.Climate change is here, say officialsThe storm and its death toll served as grim reminders that as the climate changes, weather once considered freakish strikes with regularity, threatening the viability of all coastal economic centres.Ida’s remnants brought 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20cm) of rain to a swath of the Northeast from Philadelphia to Connecticut and set an hourly rainfall record of 3.15 inches for Manhattan, breaking one set by Tropical Storm Henri less than two weeks ago, the National Weather Service said.“Climate change is happening right now,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said via Twitter. “It is not a future threat. It is a current threat.”The number of disasters, such as floods and heat waves, driven by climate change has increased fivefold over the past 50 years, according to a report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-s-record-rain-leaves-49-dead-in-u-s-northeast-101630700443956.html
04-09-2021||World||Global meeting aims to protect species on the brink||The world's leading global conservation congress opened on Friday, with warnings that humanity must tackle the grave risks of biodiversity loss and climate change together.The key message from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is that disappearing species and the destruction of ecosystems are no less existential threats than global warming."The battle for the climate -- against climate change -- is twinned with the battle to preserve and restore biodiversity," said French President Emmanuel Macron in a speech at the opening ceremony in the French port city of Marseille.But efforts to stem the losses of the world's wildlife had fallen behind, he warned.How to reverse relentless habitat destruction, unsustainable agriculture, mining and a warming planet will dominate discussion during the conference."We are facing huge challenges. We are seeing the climate changing and impacting hugely our societies," said IUCN chief Bruno Oberle in a speech before the congress opened."We are seeing biodiversity disappearing and the pandemic hitting our economies, our families, our health."The meeting, delayed from 2020 by the pandemic, comes ahead of crucial UN summits on climate, food systems and biodiversity that could shape the planet's foreseeable future.Previous IUCN congresses have paved the way for global treaties on biodiversity and the international trade in endangered species.But efforts to halt extensive declines in numbers and diversity of animals and plants have so far failed to slow the destruction.In 2019 the UN's biodiversity experts warned that a million species are on the brink of extinction -- raising the spectre that the planet is on the verge of its sixth mass extinction event in 500 million years.Protesters in Marseille, with banners that read "Nature is not for sale!" and "Change the system not the climate!", urged more urgent action."It's hard to read the headlines: floods, fires, famines, plagues and tell your children that everything is alright," said actor Harrison Ford, who has become a vocal environmental campaigner, the opening ceremony."It's not alright. Dammit, it's not alright!"'Our right to exist'The nine-day IUCN meeting will include an update of its Red List of Threatened Species, measuring how close animal and plant species are to vanishing forever.Experts have assessed nearly 135,000 species over the last half-century and nearly 28 percent are currently at risk of extinction, with habitat loss, overexploitation and illegal trade driving the loss.Big cats, for example, have lost more than 90 percent of their historic range and population, with only 20,000 lions, 7,000 cheetahs, 4,000 tigers and a few dozen Amur leopards left in the wild.The IUCN will also, for the first time in its seven-decade history, welcome indigenous peoples to share their knowledge on how best to heal the natural world as voting members.Oberle thanked indigenous groups for joining the IUCN's membership and bringing a "wealth of experience" on how to have a different relationship with the planet.Recent research has warned that rampant deforestation and climate change are pushing the Amazon towards a disastrous "tipping point" which would see tropical forests give way to savannah-like landscapes.Rates of tree loss drop sharply in the forests where native peoples live, especially if they hold some degree of title -- legal or customary -- over land."We are demanding from the world our right to exist as peoples, to live with dignity in our territories," said Jose Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, lead coordinator for COICA, which represents indigenous groups in nine Amazon-basin nations.Motions on the table include protecting 80 percent of Amazonia by 2025, tackling plastic in the oceans, combating wildlife crime and preventing pandemics.Macron has said the conference should lay the "initial foundations" for a global biodiversity strategy that will be the focus of UN deliberations in China in April next year.The international community is trying to frame interim goals for this decade as well as longer-term aims for 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-meeting-aims-to-protect-species-on-the-brink-101630693550650.html
