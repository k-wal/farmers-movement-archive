As journalists were ushered out of the room at the start of the bilateral meeting, Johnson said, “Thanks everybody, get AstraZeneca vaccines.” Johnson told Bolsonaro, “I’ve had it twice.” The Brazilian leader pointed at himself and said “not yet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-kicks-up-a-storm-tells-un-he-s-against-covid-vaccine-passports-101632248777270.html
21-09-2021||World||UK charges third Russian agent over Novichok attack||Britain on Tuesday warned three Russian intelligence officers wanted for a 2018 Novichok attack on a former double agent in the English city of Salisbury that they face arrest and prosecution if they ever leave their home country.UK home secretary Priti Patel said Britain “will not tolerate such malign activity” and said it applied for an Interpol notice to detain and extradite all three from abroad if given the chance.“Should any of these individuals ever travel outside Russia, we will work with our international partners to take every possible step to detain them and face justice,” she told parliament.Patel’s warning came after prosecutors said there‘s evidence to charge a third Russian man with the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Counterterrorism detectives said it was in public interest to charge Denis Sergeev who went by the alias “Sergey Fedotov”, with conspiracy to murder.Skripal and his daughter were left fighting for their lives after the attack in 2018 while a cop probing the case fell ill and a woman who came into contact with the nerve agent later died.The incident soured diplomatic ties between Britain and Russia that were already strained by the 2006 radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The announcement of a third suspect came as Europe’s top rights court ruled that Russia was responsible for the murder of Litvinenko, a dissident former agent who accused President Vladimir Putin before his death.Moscow rejected the court’s claim as well as renewed British allegations the Kremlin was behind the Skripal attack. “We resolutely condemn all attempts by London to shift responsibility onto Moscow,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-charges-third-russian-agent-over-novichok-attack-101632248552165.html

21-09-2021||World||At UNGA, Biden says ‘future’ belongs to those who allow people to ‘breathe free’||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday, while talking about growth and development across the globe, said that the future belongs to those nations who provide their citizens with the “ability to breathe free,” and not those who seek to “suffocate” people with an “iron hand.”Addressing the plenary of the 76th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) for the first time since becoming the President of the United States, Biden spoke about authoritarian governance around the world that pose a threat for individuals to live freely. During the speech, Biden emphasised that it's important for individuals hailing from the LGBT community to “live and love freely.”The US President said that as countries move to meet the “cost-cutting challenges” of the fast-moving world, he wants to quash any speculation about him being “agnostic about the future” that nations want for the world.“The future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it. The future will belong to those who unleash the potential of their people, not those who stifle it,” Biden told the attendees at the UNGA.Biden pointed out that authoritarians of the world may seek to proclaim the end of democracy but the latter lives on. “The truth is that democratic world is everywhere,” the US President said, adding that it lives among peace protests, humanitarian rights defenders, journalists, and anti-corruption activists.Referring to the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan after 20 years, which eventually saw the swift takeover of the country by the Islamist militant group Taliban, Biden said that for the first in two decades, “US is not at war.” He noted that in the current scenario, the US is going to utilise all its resources for what lies ahead and for the future.Also Read | ‘Not same as 20 years ago’: US President Joe Biden says country better equipped to deal with terrorist threatsUrging the members of the United Nations to work towards creating a better world in the days ahead, the US President stressed that countries need to start working “now”. “I can tell you where America stands – we will choose to build a better future. We – you and I, have the will and capacity to make it better,” Biden told the UN General Assembly.While speaking about human rights and the importance of democracy, Biden also mentioned the Taliban – who now rules Afghanistan. “[The] UNSC adopted a resolution outlining how to support people of Afghanistan, laid out the expectations from the Taliban,” he said, adding that all nations must collectively advocate the rights of women and girls to pursue their dreams “free of violence and intimidation.”“We cannot afford to waste any more time. Let’s get to work. Let’s make our future better now. We can do this; it’s within our power and capacity,” Biden said to close his speech at the UNGA.Also Read | At UNGA, Joe Biden calls for cooperation on Covid-19, climate change; hails QuadBiden’s speech for a free and democratic world, with stress on human and women’s rights comes close on the heels of the Taliban announcing an all-male cabinet in the group’s recently formed government in Afghanistan. On Tuesday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid announced the names of the remaining ministers, defending that ethnic minorities such as Hazaras were included. Although he said that women might be included later, another spokesperson of the group Sayed Zekrullah Hashimi had earlier told Tolo News that women should give birth and not be ministers – citing that a woman becoming a minister is like putting something on her neck that “she can’t carry.”“It is not necessary for women to be in the cabinet – they should give birth.

21-09-2021||World||At UNGA, Joe Biden calls for cooperation on Covid-19, climate change; hails Quad||US President Joe Biden, in his maiden address at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday, called on UN member states to work together to confront common challenges such as climate change and Covid-19, and underscored his commitment to multilateralism citing the elevation of the Quad grouping with India, Australia and Japan to summit-level engagement. Crucially, the US president said the Indo-Pacific was among the most consequential regions in the world.Biden defended the messy end to the war in Afghanistan, said America was ready to compete with China economically and ideologically but was not seeking to relaunch another Cold War, and reaffirmed support for multilateral bodies such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization that had been attacked and abandoned by his predecessor, former US president Donald Trump.Joe Biden stressed on a theme in his UNGA speech that contrasted Trump’s America First approach as he called for countries to work together. Citing the death and devastation brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the American president said “our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognise our common humanity and to act together… I believe we must work together as never before”.Defending his decision to end the war in Afghanistan he said, “We’ve ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan. And as we close this period of relentless war, we’re opening a new era of relentless diplomacy of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up.”The US president has faced criticism and questions at home and abroad about the pull-out of international troops from Afghanistan, including from allies and partners such as India, and of the chaotic evacuation marked by the killing of 13 US troops and about 200 Afghan civilians. Ten people were killed in a US drone strike during that period who turned out to be civilians, including seven children, and not Islamic State-Khorasan operatives as the US had initially described them.In his UNGA address, Joe Biden went on reiterate the importance of working together with other countries and multilateral bodies. Over the last eight months, he said he had prioritised “rebuilding our alliances, revitalising our partnerships, and recognising they are essential and central to America’s enduring security and prosperity”. He spoke of the Nato and the EU, which also had faced withering criticism and harsh words from Trump.“We elevated the Quad partnership among Australia, India, Japan and the United States to take on challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies,” Biden said of the Quad grouping, which is scheduled to hold its first in-person summit meeting on Friday, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian PM Scott Morrison and Japan’s PM Yoshihide Suga at the White House. The first in-person summit of the Quad was held virtually in March as Biden’s initiative, elevating engagement of the grouping rapidly from the level of officials to ministers.Though the US president did not name China, it formed the backdrop for chunks of his speech. Arguing that the world faced a choice between those who support western democratic values and authoritarian regimes such as the one in Beijing, Joe Biden said, “The future belongs to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with iron-hand authoritarianism.”“The authoritarians of the world, they seek to proclaim the end of the age of democracy, but they’re wrong,” the US president said.Biden, however, made it clear that he isn’t seeking any conflict. The United States would “compete vigorously and lead with our values and our strength to stand up for our allies and our friends”, he said at the UNGA. “We’re not seeking - say it again, we are not seeking - a new Cold War, or a world divided into rigid blocks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unga-joe-biden-calls-for-cooperation-on-covid-19-climate-change-hails-quad-101632246854365.html
21-09-2021||World||French Prez Macron, upset over AUKUS, dials PM Modi, discusses Indo-Pacific||French President Emmanuel Macron telephoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to discuss cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region against the backdrop of France’s anger over the creation of a new security alliance by Australia, the UK and the US. Modi tweeted after the call that he and Macron had discussed “closer collaboration between India and France in the Indo-Pacific” and the situation in Afghanistan. “We place great value on our Strategic Partnership with France, including in the UNSC,” the prime minister said. A readout from the French president’s office said the two leaders “reaffirmed their shared commitment to act jointly in an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”, with this approach aimed at promoting “regional stability and the rule of law, while precluding any form of hegemony”. AUKUS, a security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US, was unveiled by the leaders of the three countries on September 15 and its first initiative is aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines built with American and British technology. France was upset by the creation of the alliance as it led to the scrapping of a $90-billion programme to build 12 French-designed submarines. France has recalled its envoys to Australia and the US because of the “exceptional gravity” of the situation. India has publicly sought to distance itself from AUKUS because of its strong strategic relations with Australia, France and the US. A statement from the external affairs ministry said Modi and Macron “reviewed the increasing bilateral collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region, and the important role that the India-France partnership plays in promoting stability and security in the region”. They also discussed regional issues, including developments in Afghanistan, and “shared their concerns about possible spread of terrorism, narcotics, illicit weapons and human trafficking”, and the need to ensure human rights. “The leaders agreed to maintain close and regular consultations, in the spirit of the India-France Strategic Partnership, which both countries cherish deeply,” the statement added. The readout from the French president’s office said the two sides would act jointly in the Indo-Pacific within the framework of the Europe-India relationship and European initiatives in the region. Macron reiterated “France’s commitment to contributing to strengthening India’s strategic autonomy, including its industrial and technological base, as part of a close relationship based on mutual trust and respect”, the readout said. Bilateral cooperation in all areas, particularly in the economic sphere, will be boosted, it added. The two leaders expressed “grave concerns” over the situation in Afghanistan. “The authorities in power must cut their ties with international terrorism, allow humanitarian organisations to operate throughout the country and respect the fundamental rights of Afghan women and men. Evacuation operations should continue unhindered,” the readout said. The two sides will maintain regular discussions to coordinate at upcoming events, especially the G20 and COP26 on climate change, and continue joint actions against the pandemic. Macron welcomed India’s decision to resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX, the readout said. External affairs minister S Jaishankar also met his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on the margins of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. “A comprehensive discussion with FM @JY_LeDrian on Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific and other contemporary issues,” Jaishankar tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-dials-pm-modi-creation-of-aukus-inclusive-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101632245895839.html

Biden made the remarks during his address at the 76th session of the United Nations general assembly (UNGA).“We must also remain vigilant to the threat of terrorism poses to all our nations emanating from distant regions of the world or in our backyard. We know the bitter sting of terrorism. Last month, we lost 13 American heroes and many Afghan civilians in the heinous terrorist attack at Kabul airport,” Biden said, referring to a terrorist attack near the gates of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul earlier on August 26.Also read | US military power must be a tool of last resort, says Biden at UNGAThe US administration also retaliated against the Islamic State of Khorasan (IS-K), the group which claimed it was behind the deadly attacks, killing the planner suspected of plotting more attacks.Further, he also said that the US was not the same country as it was 20 years ago, referring to the 9/11 attacks. “US is not the same country it was when it was attacked on 9/11, 20 years ago. Today we are better equipped to detect and prevent terrorist threats and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond,” he said.“We know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their finances and support systems, countering their propaganda, preventing their travel as well as disrupting imminent attacks. We will meet terrorist threats that arrive today and in the future with a full range of tools available to us including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large-scale military deployments,” Biden said during his address.The remarks came as the US completed its total pullback from Afghanistan on August 31, a country where it has been present for close to two decades. Following the drawdown of US troops, several countries, including the US’ close allies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and other Nato countries, scrambled to evacuate their personnel, embassy staff and citizens along with Afghan nationals who wished to move out of the country.The Taliban had rapidly taken over the country after the US announcement in a few days and on August 15, reached the capital city Kabul. Also, the US recently marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks earlier on September 11 when Biden visited all the sites of the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-same-as-20-years-ago-us-president-joe-biden-says-country-better-equipped-to-deal-with-terrorist-threats-101632241575569.html

Former US President Barack Obama pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, the United Nation’s flagship climate finance initiative, but delivered just $1 billion before leaving office, according to a report by Climate Home.However, his successor Donald Trump went back on that pledge and in 2017-18 the US delivered less climate finance than France, Germany, Japan or the United Kingdom despite having an economy larger than all of them combined.In his speech on Tuesday, Biden said that the world was approaching a “point of no return” and reeling from “widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis”. He urged all nations to bring their “highest possible ambitions to the table” when leaders meet at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November.COP26 president Alok Sharma took to Twitter to hail Biden’s announcement.Strongly welcome @POTUS further doubling 🇺🇸climate finance commitment to over $11bn by 2024 This demonstrate the increased ambition required to deliver on the $100bn/year goalWe must build on this momentum#UNGA #COP26The accord calls for public, multilateral and private financing of $100 billion a year from 2020-2025 to assist poor nations already coping with floods, heatwaves, rising seas and superstorms made worse by climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-double-climate-finance-support-to-aid-low-income-nations-biden-at-unga-101632239251018.html
21-09-2021||World||‘Still alive’: Pope jokes some people wanted him dead after recent operation||Pope Francis has joked that some people in the Church hoped he would not survive his recent colon operation, and denounced vociferous conservative critics for doing "the work of the devil" by undermining the Roman Catholic Church.Francis made the comments during a meeting with members of the Jesuits, a Catholic religious order, in Slovakia this month. They were reported on Tuesday by the Jesuit magazine La Civilta Cattolica.Asked about his health by one of the Jesuits, Francis was quoted as replying: "Still alive. Although some people wanted me dead.""I know that there were even meetings between prelates who thought that the Pope was in a more serious condition than was being said," he added. "They were preparing the conclave (to elect a new pope). So be it. Thank God, I am well."Francis, who was elected pontiff in 2013, underwent colon surgery on July 4, and spent 11 days in hospital. He has since resumed a full work schedule.Addressing some of the challenges facing the Church, Francis took aim at traditionalists, saying that "turning back is not the right way" and that it was important to move forward.He denounced a "major Catholic television station", which he did not name, that he said was constantly attacking him."I personally may deserve attacks and insults because I am a sinner, but the Church does not deserve this. It is the work of the devil," he said.In recent years, Francis has been the focus of criticism from a small but powerful number of American conservatives unhappy with his stands on various theological issues as well as social matters from immigration to climate change.They are regularly given time on the US - based Catholic television network EWTN.The pope admitted that criticism from clerics within the Church annoyed him at times."I sometimes lose patience, especially when they make judgments without entering into a real dialogue. I can't do anything there. However, I go on without entering their world of ideas and fantasies," he said.He warned against clerical "rigidity" and said God wanted society to be free.The Catholic Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are, but Francis has been more conciliatory towards gay people than perhaps any other pope."We are afraid to accompany people with sexual diversity," he was quoted as saying by the magazine, adding that priests should offer support to homosexual couples.However, he cautioned against the rise of "gender ideology"."It is dangerous because it is abstract with respect to the concrete life of a person, as if a person can decide abstractly at will whether and when to be a man or a woman," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-alive-pope-jokes-some-people-wanted-him-dead-after-recent-operation-101632237722145.html

Scientists and researchers from dozens of countries collaborated on a remarkable feat of human ingenuity,” Abdulla Shahid said, adding, that the largest vaccine roll-out in the history of mankind is currently underway.Shahid called the vaccine invention a “monumental undertaking" even as he acknowledged the vaccination is not without flaw.“While certainly not without flaws, it is monumental in its undertaking. For these accomplishments alone, we should be proud,” Shahid told the gathering of world leaders.“The world wants peace of mind. The people want solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” he added.Shahid opened UN General Assembly’s high-level meeting for leaders of its 193 member nations by challenging delegates to rise to the occasion. “There are moments in time that are turning points. This is one such moment," he said.More than 100 heads of state and government kept away by the pandemic are returning to the United Nations in person for the first time in two years. But with the pandemic still raging, about 60 will deliver pre-recorded statements over coming days.“We are on the edge of an abyss — and moving in the wrong direction," Guterres said. “I’m here to sound the alarm. The world must wake up," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his speech.Guterres said people may lose faith not only in their governments and institutions but in basic values when they see their human rights curtailed, corruption, the reality of their harsh lives, no future for their children — and “when they see billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remarkable-feat-of-human-ingenuity-unga-prez-abdulla-shahid-hails-scientists-101632232759346.html
21-09-2021||World||US military power must be a tool of last resort, says Biden at UNGA||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that America will continue to defend itself and its allies against any terrorist threat but stressed that the mission must be clear and achievable. During his maiden speech at the UN General Assembly, Biden noted that the security, prosperity and freedom of countries are interconnected more than ever. Defending the pullout from Afghanistan, the US commander-in-chief said that America is concentrating on devoting its resources to take on the challenges that hold the key to collective future instead of fighting the “wars of the past”. He told global leaders that issues like the pandemic, climate crisis, terrorism, and managing the shifts in power dynamics should be the focus. "US military power must be our tool of last resort not our first and should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world," Biden said."We've ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan, and as we close this period of relentless war, we're opening a new era of relentless diplomacy, of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world, of renewing and defending democracy, of proving that no matter how challenging or how complex the problems we're going to face, government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our people," he added.Biden was speaking on the backdrop of recent US troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan that turned chaotic in the final days. He also talked about the challenges arising out of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic."We meet this year in a moment of intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility. We've lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and impact so much on our existence. We're mourning more than 4.5 million people, people of every nation, from every background. Each death is an individual heartbreak," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-power-must-be-a-tool-of-last-resort-says-biden-at-unga-101632234397671.html
21-09-2021||World||World has never been more threatened or divided: UN chief tells global leaders||The world has never been more threatened or more divided, and is facing the "greatest cascade” of crises, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told global leaders on Tuesday, sounding an alarm over the Covid-19 pandemic, a climate crisis pummeling the planet and an upheaval in Afghanistan and other nations that is thwarting peace.Guterres, in his address to the opening of the General Debate of the 76th Session of the General Assembly, said that human rights are under fire, science is under assault and economic lifelines for the most vulnerable are coming too little and too late, if they come at all, and solidarity is missing in action just when the world need it the most.“I am here to sound the alarm: The world must wake up. We are on the edge of an abyss — and moving in the wrong direction. Our world has never been more threatened. Or more divided. We face the greatest cascade of crises in our lifetimes,” he said.The annual high-level week, which had to be held virtually last year due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic, returned to a hybrid format this year with over 100 Heads of State and Government as well as foreign ministers and diplomats scheduled to address world leaders in-person from the iconic General Assembly Hall here.Outlining the crises facing the world today, Guterres said that the Covid-19 pandemic has supersized glaring inequalities, the climate crisis is pummeling the planet, the upheaval from Afghanistan to Ethiopia to Yemen and beyond has thwarted peace and a surge of mistrust and misinformation is polarising people and paralysing societies.The Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 4.6 million people and infected over 228 million people globally, has exposed glaring inequalities among nations over vaccine access and affordability, he said.More than 5.7 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally, but only 2 per cent of them in Africa, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).“Perhaps one image tells the tale of our times. The picture we have seen from some parts of the world of Covid-19 vaccines… in the garbage. Expired and unused,” Guterres said.The UN chief noted that while on the one hand vaccines have been developed in a record time on the other hand “we see that triumph undone by the tragedy of a lack of political will, selfishness and mistrust.“A surplus in some countries. Empty shelves in others. A majority of the wealthier world vaccinated. Over 90 per cent of Africans are still waiting for their first dose. This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity,” Guterres said.He said the world passed the science test when it produced vaccines in a record time and highlighted the victory of science and human ingenuity, but “we are getting an F in Ethics.”Guterres underlined the urgent need for a global vaccination plan to at least double vaccine production and ensure that vaccines reach 70 per cent of the world’s population in the first half of 2022.On climate change, Guterres said that the climate alarm bells are ringing at “fever pitch” and there are warning signs in every continent and region.“Scorching temperatures. Shocking biodiversity loss. Polluted air, water and natural spaces. And climate-related disasters at every turn,” he said.Guterres warned that the window to keep alive the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is rapidly closing. The world needs a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 yet with present national climate commitments, emissions will go up by 16 per cent by 2030.“That would condemn us to a hellscape of temperature rises of at least 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels.“Covid-19 and the climate crisis have exposed profound fragilities as societies and as a planet,” the UN chief said.Urging the world leaders that “now is the time to deliver”, Guterres outlined the six great divides, the “Grand Canyons” that must be bridged now.He called on the world leaders to bridge the peace divide.“For far too many around the world, peace and stability remain a distant dream. In Afghanistan, where we must boost humanitarian assistance and defend human rights, especially of women and girls,” he said, adding that in Myanmar, the world must reaffirm unwavering support to the people in their pursuit of democracy, peace, human rights and the rule of law.He said that the world must bridge the climate divide by bridging trust between North and South.“We need more ambition from all countries in three key areas — mitigation, finance and adaptation. My message to every Member State is this: Don’t wait for others to make the first move. Do your part,” he said.He called on nations to bridge the gap between rich and poor, within and among countries.“That starts by ending the pandemic for everyone, everywhere,” Guterres said.Warning that there is no time to lose, he said that a lopsided recovery from the pandemic is deepening inequalities as richer countries could reach pre-pandemic growth rates by the end of this year while the impacts may last for years in low-income countries.Underscoring that the gender divide must be bridged, Guterres said Covid-19 exposed and amplified the world’s most enduring injustice: the power imbalance between men and women.“Bridging the gender divide is not only a matter of justice for women and girls. It’s a game-changer for humanity,” he said.Guterres called on world leaders to bridge the digital divide and the divide among generations.He said that half of humanity has no access to the internet and we must connect everyone by 2030.“Young people will inherit the consequences of our decisions — good and bad. At the same time, we expect 10.9 billion people to be born by century’s end. We need their talents, ideas and energies.

Since the takeover of Afghanistan by the Islamist militant group on August 15, there has been a global worry and fear that Afghan soil would become a safe haven for Islamist terrorist organisations for attacks on foreign countries, albeit the Taliban repeatedly assuring against it.“Taliban have reiterated on several occasions that no group or terrorist organisation will be allowed to use Afghan territory for any terrorist activity against any country, including Pakistan,” Iftikhar told Urdu News.He added that there isn’t any “reason to doubt” the Taliban’s “intentions,” and this is the reason why Pakistan is in continuous touch with the group to safeguard the nation’s security interests.In the past, Pakistan has on many occasions stressed on the need to give the Taliban a chance in governing Afghanistan. Last week, it was reported that Pakistan’s national security advisor Moeed Yusuf is displeased with the international community’s “wait-and-watch” tactic on recognising the Taliban government in Afghanistan.Also Read | Pakistan bats for Taliban, says should be given time to run AfghanistanYusuf told the Dawn newspaper that in order to influence and mold the Taliban governance, in the way “the world wants,” the international community must have a conversation with the government directly. “Without engagement that would not be possible,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by the Dawn.As per the latest update, the Dawn reported that one of Pakistan’s major concerns following the re-emergence of Taliban in Afghanistan has been the existence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group in the latter nation – which took responsibility of shooting Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai in 2012.The report further stated that Pakistani authorities and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have been holding discourse on new border control measures to eradicate unwanted movement of elements inside Pakistan.“Our goal has always been better management on this (Pakistan) side of the border. Fencing the Pakistan-Afghan border was a major responsibility due to the region’s terrain and other difficulties,” Iftikhar said.The fencing work has been done on 90% of the 2,600-km border area, Iftikhar claimed, and added that the border management between the two countries is “constantly improving”.“We are hopeful that it will be fully secured in the near future,” he noted.The Pakistan military spokesperson’s comments come after the country’s Prime Minister Imran Khan last Saturday said that they have “initiated dialogue” with the Taliban in Afghanistan to make the latter’s administration “inclusive” – thereby including Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.But the Taliban didn’t take his comments very well as the group’s spokesperson and deputy information minister Zabihullah Mujahid said that no nation, including Pakistan, has any right to “ask the Islamic Emirate to establish an ‘inclusive’ government in Afghanistan.”Meanwhile, the Islamist militants on Tuesday announced the expansion of its cabinet in Afghanistan, with the all-male approach intact. However, Mujahid – who presented the list of the names of the remaining ministers — defended the choice, citing that it comprises those from ethnic minorities such as the Hazaras.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-trusts-taliban-s-intentions-to-not-let-afghan-soil-be-used-for-terrorism-101632226606309.html

Here are the reasons||Australia has lost one-third of its koala population in just three years, the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) warned about the rapid decline on Monday. The alarming figures suggest that the population of koalas has dropped from more than 80,000 in 2018 to less than 58,000 this year, with New South Wales reporting a decline as high as 41%. Not a single region showed an upward trend in the marsupial’s population.The independent non-profit group estimated the numbers in each of the federal electorates that had koala since white settlement and found that the marsupial is now extinct in 47 of them. Only one federal electorate, Mayo, has more than 5000 koalas, according to AKF. The trend showed that some regions are left with just 5-10 koalas."The declines are quite dramatic," AKF chair Deborah Tabart said on Tuesday.Also Read | Mama koala cuddling her sleeping baby makes for a delightful watchReasons for declineThe deadly bushfires of 2019-20 have been cited as one of the major contributors to the sharp decline in the koala population but, according to the study, is not the only reason. The foundation said that drought, heatwaves, the felling of trees by developers, and the lack of water for koalas to drink have also contributed to the decline.“We have witnessed a drastic decrease in inland populations because of drought, heatwaves, and lack of water for Koalas to drink. I have seen some landscapes that look like the moon – with dead and dying trees everywhere,” Tabart said in a statement.Pointing to the huge land clearance across New South Wales and South East Queensland in recent years, Tabart said that land clearing is lethal to the koala population. She urged Australian lawmakers to bring in a law to immediately stop land clearance in prime koala habitat, saying the offsets don’t work and displaced koalas die.We need a Koala Protection Act now which can and will do exactly that; why won’t our political leaders just sign that into being?” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-koala-population-declines-by-30-in-3-years-here-are-the-reasons-101632223716813.html

Both men have always denied involvement."The court found it established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the assassination had been carried out by Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun," the ruling said."The planned and complex operation involving the procurement of a rare deadly poison, the travel arrangements for the pair, and repeated and sustained attempts to administer the poison indicated that Mr Litvinenko had been the target of the operation."It too concluded that the Russian state was to blame and that had the men been carrying out a "rogue operation", Moscow would have the information to prove that theory."However, the government had made no serious attempt to provide such information or to counter the findings of the UK authorities," the ruling said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-responsible-for-killing-ex-kgb-officer-litvinenko-european-rights-court-rules-101632217910764.html

The report, which was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, also found that people who contract this viral illness through the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2, exhale “43 to 100 times” more virus into the air than those infected with its original strains.Sharing thoughts on the study, doctoral student Jianyu Lai, one of its lead authors said, “We already knew that the virus in saliva and nasal swabs was higher in infections caused by the Alpha variant. Virus from the nose and mouth might get transmitted by large droplets up close to an infected person. However, we found that the virus in exhaled aerosols is rising further,” Lai said.These major increases in airborne virus due to Alpha, researchers said, took place when the Delta variant was yet to be discovered. This, according to them, indicates that the variants are “getting better” at transmitting through air.Meanwhile, Don Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Health, said that the research provides further evidence of the importance of airborne transmission. “We know that Delta is more contagious than Alpha. Our research indicates that the variants just keep getting better at travelling through the air. Therefore, in addition to vaccination, we must provide better ventilation and wear tight-fitting masks to help stop it from spreading,” Milton explained.To check the efficacy of face masks, the team measured how much SARS-CoV-2 is breathed into air, and then tested how much less virus is exhaled by Covid-19 patients after putting on a cloth or surgical mask.While face masks were found to have significantly reduced, by around 50 per cent, virus-laden particles in the air around the Covid-19 patient, loose-fitting cloth and surgical masks failed at preventing infectious droplets from going out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-variants-getting-better-at-transmission-through-air-study-finds-101632215785857.html
21-09-2021||World||China: PLA soldiers killed at Galwan Valley now part of education on patriotism||The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is citing the example of Chinese soldiers killed during the Galwan Valley clash with Indian border personnel in mid-June 2020 to teach lessons on patriotism to China’s primary schoolchildren.A video exchange between a border battalion of the Xinjiang military region and primary school students in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, focusing on border defence, was held over the weekend.It lauds the hardships and bravery of PLA troops posted along the border with India.An article on the exchange between soldiers and students was published on Tuesday in an official military portal under the headline, “The heroic deeds of defending the country and border areas were introduced to the school classes, and the officers and soldiers stationed on the plateau were connected online to pupils thousands of miles away.”The article mentioned how the death of one Chinese soldier at Galwan Valley left an impression on the students.Though it did not mention the specific battalion, the ongoing India-China border tension in eastern Ladakh falls on the Karakoram mountain side of China, which is under the Xinjiang military region, and overall, under PLA’s Western Theatre Command.Woven into the officially sanctioned exchange between the soldiers and students was the pro-China narrative that the PLA soldiers were defending their borders, and that India had allegedly trespassed the Line of Actual Control (LAC).India has consistently denied allegations by Beijing of acting in a provocative manner since the standoff began in May last year and said that it was the PLA that breached the LAC.The aim of educating the students about border military personnel’s “heroic deeds” was to guide them to “draw spiritual strength and patriotism from the soldiers and plant the seeds of patriotism in the hearts of the students”, the article quoted the school principal as saying.The video conference was held between the soldiers and the students of the second primary school of Huazhong Road in Anqing city in Anhui province.It was only in February that the Chinese government shared the details of the five Chinese officers and soldiers killed and injured at Galwan Valley - unlike India, which announced the death of 20 soldiers soon after the deadly clash in mid-June 2020.The four who died were Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran. Regimental commander Qi Fabao was injured in the skirmishes.“Chen Xiarong was born after 2000. When he sacrificed his life, he was only seven years older than me. It really touched me that he wrote ‘I only devote my pure love to China’,” a student said.“The story left great impressions on these pupils. Many of them hoped to express their salute by sending letters and others wanted to see soldiers via video call,” a teacher said.“Students were moved by the vivid stories told by the soldiers on the 5,300-metre-high plateau,” the article said.Ahead of the video interaction, the students and soldiers had exchanged letters, postcards and videos. The session on patriotism ended with a patriotic song and a pledge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pla-soldiers-killed-at-galwan-valley-now-part-of-education-on-patriotism-101632216251806.html
21-09-2021||World||CIA agent reports Havana syndrome during India trip. What do Cubans say?||A CIA officer, who was travelling with the US agency director William Burns to India this month, reported symptoms consistent with mysterious Havana syndrome and had to receive medical attention, according to reports on Monday. "We have protocols in place for when individuals report possible anomalous health incidents that include receiving appropriate medical treatment," a CIA spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.In July, Burns said he has tapped a senior officer who once led the hunt for Osama bin Laden to head a task force investigating the Havana syndrome. Burns has said there is a "very strong possibility" that the syndrome is intentionally caused and that Russia could be responsible.Havana syndrome is a mysterious set of ailments that include migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness. As many as 200 US officials and family members have been sickened by Havana syndrome, first reported by officials based in the United States embassy in Cuba in 2016. Several suspected cases have been reported among US officials and intelligence officers in China, Germany, Australia, Taiwan, Austria and Washington. Last month, US vice president Kamala Harris delayed her arrival to Hanoi for three hours after the US embassy there said someone reported a health incident consistent with Havana syndrome.Also read | Austria, US probe reports of 'Havana syndrome' among officialsIt is called Havana syndrome because the first cases affected personnel in 2016 at the US embassy in Cuba. A US National Academy of Sciences panel found that the most plausible theory is that "directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy" causes the syndrome. However, despite years of study, there is no consensus as to what or who might be behind the incidents or whether they are, in fact, attacks.People who are believed to have been affected complain of headaches, dizziness and symptoms consistent with concussions. Some have reported hearing high-pitched or sharp sounds before the sudden onset of symptoms. Sometimes the afflicted had bloody noses, headaches and some affected with Havana syndrome need months of medical treatment.Some say that the injuries are the result of directed energy attacks, others believe the growing number of cases could actually be linked to “mass psychogenic illness,” in which people learning of others with symptoms begin to feel sick themselves.Cuban scientists said earlier this month there was no evidence for claims of US diplomats coming down with so-called "Havana syndrome" on the island. A panel convened by the government with 16 experts in a variety of fields and affiliated to the Cuban Academy of Sciences said the claims were not "scientifically acceptable," and there was "no scientific evidence of attacks" of this nature on Cuban soil. "We conclude that the narrative of the 'mysterious syndrome' is not scientifically acceptable in any of its components," the panel said in a report published on Cubadebate, an official news site of the one-party state.Also read | US officials confirm 130 cases of ‘Havana syndrome’ as CIA probes cause: ReportThe report said some have accepted "as an axiom that attacks occurred in Havana." "However, after four years, no evidence of attacks has appeared," and "neither the Cuban police, nor the FBI, nor the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have discovered evidence of 'attacks' on diplomats in Havana despite intense investigations.""No known form of energy can selectively cause brain damage (with laser-like spatial accuracy) under the conditions described for the alleged incidents in Havana,” the Cuban experts said. They also said that most of the symptoms reported could be explained by disease. "There is no novel syndrome."The panel said it would review any new evidence.(With agency reports)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-agent-reports-havana-syndrome-during-india-trip-what-do-cubans-say-101632211111352.html

21-09-2021||World||Jagmeet Singh, 17 other Indo-Canadians secure victories in Canada elections||There will be a sizeable contingent of Indo-Canadians in the House of Commons as 18 candidates from the community secured victories in the Canada elections held on Monday that incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won. All three Indo-Canadian ministers in the dissolved cabinet emerged victorious as did Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party (NDP).Defence minister Harjit Sajjan was re-elected from Vancouver South, with nearly 49% of the vote share, despite facing headwinds over issues such as a major sexual harassment crisis in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch and a much criticised evacuation mission in Afghanistan. Among Indo-Canadians, another high profile minister Anita Anand, who handled the public services and procurement portfolio and was described by Trudeau as his minister for vaccines, retained her seat from the riding of Oakville, Ontario. Also winning comfortably in the Canada elections from Waterloo in Ontario was Bardish Chagger, minister of diversity, inclusion and youth.NDP leader Jagmeet Singh - a popular figure among Indo-Canadians - was re-elected from Burnaby South, with approximately 38% of the votes cast. However, his focus may well have been on the national performance of the party he leads, as the NDP increased its vote share to 17.7% from 15.98% in 2019 but could only gain one more seat in the House of Commons, rising from 24 to 25. It will again be the fourth-largest group there, behind Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, the principal opposition Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, which was on course to capture 34 seats in the Canada elections.Focus will also be on another Indo-Canadian Liberal Party winner, George Chahal, who edged out incumbent Conservative MP Jag Sahota from Calgary Skyview in Alberta. While Justin Trudeau’s ruling party was blanked in the province in 2019, this seat may well see the city councillor-turned-first-time MP possibly finding a place in the next cabinet.Several sitting MPs from the Greater Toronto Area were re-elected, and the most prominent among them are former parliamentary secretary Kamal Khera from Brampton West, Ruby Sahota from Brampton North, Sonia Sidhu from Brampton South and Arif Virani from Parkdale-High Park. In Metro Vancouver, veteran Sukh Dhaliwal retained his Surrey-Newton seat while Randeep Sarai won again from Surrey. Making it a hat-trick of victories from Dorval-Lachine-LaSalle in Quebec was Anju Dhillon, while emulating her feat was Chandra Arya from Nepean, near Ottawa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jagmeet-singh-17-other-indo-canadians-secure-victories-in-canada-elections-101632210671350.html

He believes in vigorous, intensive, principled competition”."The president will essentially drive home the message that ending the war in Afghanistan closed the chapter focused on war and opens a chapter focused on personal, purposeful, effective American diplomacy," the official added.Biden’s expected announcement comes after UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres expressed his concerns about the “completely dysfunctional” US-China relationship that could lead to a new Cold War.However, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said relations between the two nations were “one not of conflict but of competition”.Apprehensions about a possible Cold War between the two superpowers came a week after a long-time ally of the US, France, recalled its ambassador after Australia scrapped a submarine deal with a French company in favour of nuclear-powered submarines under a trilateral security pact with the United States and Britain. The move came as a possible measure by both the US and UK to underscore the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.White House officials expressed confidence in Biden’s ability to rework the ties with France, adding the President would remain focused on the main issue at hand -- supporting regional networks to resist China's growing military and commercial footprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unga-joe-biden-may-assure-world-us-intends-to-avoid-cold-war-with-china-101632208779165.html

That majority, however, was lost in 2019. In August this year, he called for snap polls in a bid to regain it. At last count, the Liberals had won or were leading in 156 seats, with the Conservatives at 123.

21-09-2021||World||Canada elections: PM Justin Trudeau set to stay in power but miss majority mark||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will remain in power in Ottawa, but his ruling Liberal Party has been unable to secure the majority mark it had desperately sought in the Canada elections that were held on Monday. Justin Trudeau himself had initiated the call for snap polls in mid-August in a bid to turn his minority government into a majority one. But the projected results of the 2021 Canada elections have turned out to be almost a replay of the 2019 polls when the Liberals settled for a minority government.A party will have to win at least 170 out of 338 seats in Canada’s House of Commons to form a majority government.Trudeau won comfortably from his riding of Papineau in Quebec, while the Liberals were leading or had won 156 seats and the Conservatives had 123 in the Canada elections. In the 2019 general elections, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals had won 157 seats while the Conservatives had secured 121. Addressing his supporters in Montreal, Trudeau said “millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan”. “You are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get through this pandemic,” he told the cheering crowd.In a message to voters who seemed unhappy with the decision to call snap elections, he said in French, “I’ve heard you, you don’t want to be talking politics or elections any more.”The PM said the voters had given his government “clear direction” and that it was “ready” to deliver on a number of issues, such as as the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy, climate change and Indigenous reconciliation.This time round, the Conservative Party had about 34% of the vote share, about 1.5% higher than the Liberals that is also a repeat of the 2019 outcome, according to the Canada election results.Canadian networks announced that a Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau would be formed at 10.30pm local time in Ottawa on Tuesday as early results and trends made it clear that the principal opposition Conservative Party would be unable to match the number of seats the ruling party was on target to capture. Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole spoke at the party headquarters in Oshawa in Ontario, attacking Trudeau and saying the PM “was hoping for a quick power grab” and Canadians denied him the “majority mandate he wanted”.He said he had congratulated Trudeau before arriving to deliver his speech, but warned the PM against trying to precipitate another round elections in 18 months.While the New Democratic Party (NDP) under Indo-Canadian leader Jagmeet Singh may have hoped for a considerable increase in the number of seats, progressive voters instead seemed to have opted for the Liberals. The NDP was at around 30 seats, an improvement over the 24 in 2019 and this may ensure that Jagmeet Singh will remain as the party’s leader, according to Canada election results.The NDP is in a tight race in the Canada elections with the Bloc Quebecois for the position of the third-largest party in the House of Commons.The Conservatives failed to make a dent in the seat-rich Greater Toronto Area (GTA), which was crucial in the party’s bid to overtake the Liberals on seat count and form the single-largest party.The defeat in the 2021 Canada elections could go on to endanger the continuation of Erin O’Toole as the leader of the Conservative Party since he has been unable to improve the party’s performance considerably. His predecessor Andrew Scheer had won the national vote share over the Liberals in 2019 with 121 seats, increasing the figure over the 99 in 2015, but still had to resign as he couldn’t manage an outright win.Despite managing to win, according to Canada election results, Justin Trudeau might still have to face questions over why he precipitated a CAN$610 million (US$478mn) election in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.In the initial days of campaigning after the snap polls were declared in mid-August, the Liberals first led the Tories by double digits, but the gap disappeared within days of the announcement of the September 20 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-pm-justin-trudeau-set-to-stay-in-power-but-miss-majority-mark-101632201070390.html

And again, as we said last month, the country cannot access IMF resources, SDRs and so on at this point,” Rice added.Expressing concerns over the economic and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, Rice assured that the IMF is ready to work with the international community to advocate for urgent actions to stall the humanitarian crisis.Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan last month, ending a two-decade-long military mission led by the United States, the country has plunged into a severe economic crisis. Afghanistan's banking assets have been frozen since August 15, when the capital city of Kabul fell into the hands of the Islamic Emirate.There is a constant fear that the worsening economic crisis could push millions of Afghan citizens into poverty and hunger. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), said last week that 97% of the population is at risk of going below the poverty line. The UNDP said that 50% of the population already requires humanitarian support, adding, Afghanistan's real GDP could contract by 13.2%, which would cause an increase in the poverty rate of up to 25% points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-to-not-allocate-funds-to-afghanistan-due-to-political-uncertainty-report-101632191455896.html

It cited the recent clash during the government formation talks between Baradar faction and the Haqqani network to say that the former emerged as the "principal loser".The chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) also threw his weight behind the Haqqanis, ensuring that all of the key positions went to Pakistani loyalists, principally from the hardline Haqqani network, The Spectator reported.The clashes in early September saw "furniture as well as large thermos flasks full of hot green thrown around", said The Spectator. At one point during the meeting, Haqqani network leader Khalil-ul-Rahman Haqqani rose from his chair and began punching Baradar, The Spectator report said. Baradar had pushed for an "inclusive" cabinet that included non-Taliban leaders and ethnic minorities, which would be more acceptable to the rest of the world.He disappeared for a while after the clashes and resurfaced in Kandahar. He held a meeting of tribal leaders who are supporting him, but was also forced to release a video message on the state-run TV network controlled by the Taliban. The message "looked like a hostage video", The Spectator reported.On Akhundzada, the publication reported that his whereabouts are not known. "He has not been seen or heard from for some time, and there are many rumours that he is dead," reported The Spectator.This vacuum at the top has allowed for arguments between the Taliban factions - something which was not seen during their earlier rule two decades ago, the report further said.The Taliban and Haqqani groups merged around 2016.Baradar and those involved in Doha talks were trying to project a moderate image of the Taliban, but Haqqanis have praised suicide attacks. Khalil Haqqani, Afghanistan's minister of refugees, is on the United Nations sanctions list and has been linked to its military operations.The Haqqanis are deeply embedded into Pakistan's security apparatus and take their name from the Darul Uloom Haqqania madrassa near Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leader-mullah-baradar-held-hostage-haibatullah-akhundzada-dead-report-101632195007476.html
21-09-2021||World||Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's ruling Liberal Party will win election: Report||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals were on track to win the Canadian election, CBC News projected, but with results trickling in the network said it was too soon to say how strong a government they would form.Trudeau heads a government with a minority of House of Commons seats that relies on the support of other parties to pass legislation. He called an election two years early in hopes of securing a parliamentary majority."People would be very pleasantly surprised if there was a Liberal majority government, within the Liberal camp, but I think it's still way too soon to make that call," Gerald Butts, a former top Trudeau adviser and close friend, told CBC TV.Elections Canada showed the Liberals leading in 146 electoral districts with only a small fraction of votes counted.The House of Commons holds 338 seats and a party needs to win 170 to hold a majority.Polls reported results much more slowly than usual, with some stations forced to limit occupancy due to COVID-19 restrictions. Long lines forced some electors to wait hours to vote in southern Ontario, a critical battleground.The Liberals were leading in 113 parliamentary seats in Ontario and Quebec, which have 199 seats, or more than half of the national total.In the first set of regional results, Liberals were leading in 23 of 32 parliamentary districts in the four Atlantic provinces. The Liberals held 27 seats before the election.Erin O'Toole's opposition Conservatives had focused on adding to their four Atlantic seats, and were leading in nine.The Canadian dollar strengthened as early results came in, rising 0.4%.A delay in counting mail-in votes could further hold up results in tight races.Elections Canada will not start counting roughly 800,000 mail-in ballots until Tuesday, after it is able to verify them against in-person votes. Those could help to determine the outcome in at least two Atlantic districts and many more across Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-s-ruling-liberal-party-will-win-election-report-101632192051152.html

When the family went outside a nearby mosque to fetch drinking water from a tap, some local landlords beat them up.As the family was returning home after unloading the cotton, the landlords held them hostage at their dera (outhouse) and tortured them again for “violating the sanctity” of the mosque, the report said.The police did not register a case as the attackers were related to a local parliamentarian of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, the report said citing Bheel.Protesting the police apathy, Bheel held a sit-in outside the police station along with other members of the community.A case was registered on Friday after the intervention of PTI lawmaker Javed Warriach, the report said.Farooq Rind, a senior lawyer and former district bar president, said the Bheels had been living in the area for over a century and most of them were farm workers and extremely poor.The accused landlords, Rind said, were notorious for picking up fights with other villagers over petty issues. He has promised free legal aid for the complainant, the report said.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 7.5 million Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 9 million Hindus are living in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-as-hindu-family-tortured-in-pak-for-fetching-drinking-water-from-mosque-101632191241863.html
21-09-2021||World||Canada polls: Justin Trudeau’s party leads in Atlantic provinces; full results likely to be declared today||Results for the snap elections called by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau started to trickle in from Monday evening, with Trudeau’s Liberal party leading in 23 of 32 parliamentary districts in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Polls are yet to conclude in Quebec and Ontario which together sends 199 representatives to the Parliament, more than half of the national total.Even though Trudeau’s party is leading in Atlantic provinces it secured less seats from the last election, when it had won 27 of the 32 seats. Trudeau’s biggest opponent Erin O’ Toole's rival Conservative party is lagging behind but has added four more seats in the province to its election tally. The Conservatives are currently leading in nine seats.Trudeau called a snap election early in hopes of securing a parliamentary majority, after leading a minority government since 2019. A minority government is entirely reliant on the support of opposition parties to pass legislation. A party needs at least 170 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons in Canada to qualify as a majority government. The Liberals have been surviving on 155 seats since 2019. Counting for all 338 seats are expected to take longer than usual as many voters opted for mail-in-ballots due to Covid-19.Also Read: Canada elections: Indo-Canadian MPs in Justin Trudeau cabinet expected to retain their seatsBanking on his government’s effective handling of the coronavirus pandemic and effective vaccine roll-out, Trudeau called for the snap elections last month. However, if he fails to win a majority his party will be forced to rely on opposition parties, such as the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the Greens, once again, to pass legislation.Trudeau, whose father Pierre Trudeau governed Canada as the Prime Minister, has tried to persuade voters that the country should be governed by a party that believes in science as the coronavirus pandemic rages through the globe. This is in stark contrast with the pitch of Trudeau's rival O’Toole whose party has said vaccination will be a “personal health choice” and has been critical of lockdowns and vaccine mandates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-justin-trudeau-s-party-leads-in-atlantic-provinces-full-results-likely-to-be-declared-today-101632190582424.html
21-09-2021||World||El Salvador prez Nayib Bukele changes Twitter profile description to 'dictator'||El Salvador’s bitcoin-pushing president apparently changed his Twitter profile description to “dictator” Monday, in what might be an ironic comment on last week’s protests against him.The office of President Nayib Bukele did not respond to requests for comment on the profile change, but there was no clear sign the president’s account had been hacked.Bukele is a heavy Twitter user, and after his description changed to “dictator,” he continued tweeting normally Monday about bitcoin. The price and potential of the cryptocurrency appears to fascinate Bukele, and he made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, the first country to do so.Not everyone was charmed by the tactic.“Changing his Twitter profile to call himself the dictator of El Salvador is a very childish act on the part of the president," said legislator Johnny Wright Sol, a member of the opposition Nuestro Tiempo party.“This is part of the president's strategy," said lawyer Eduardo Escobar, of Citizen's Action, a civic group devoted to government accountability. “He is trying to ridicule the feelings of the public or the opposition.”Last week, thousands of people gathered in El Salvador’s capital for the first mass march against Bukele, who protesters say has concentrated too much power, weakened the independence of the courts and may seek re-election.Bukele, known for his wry style, dismissed the Sept. 15 demonstration by saying protesters “took to the streets to fight a dictatorship that doesn't exist.”The populist president elected in 2019 has maintained high popularity with his vows to stamp out corruption that was rampant among the country’s traditional parties. But some Salvadorans say he is becoming a dictator for real.Bukele’s New Ideas party won a congressional majority this year and immediately after taking its seats in the National Assembly in May, it replaced the five members of the Constitutional Chamber and the independent attorney general who had balked at several of Bukele’s earlier actions.Soon after, the Constitutional Chamber tossed aside what had long been interpreted as a constitutional ban on consecutive presidential reelection, setting the stage for Bukele to potentially seek a second term in 2024. Bukele has not so far announced plans to seek reelection, but critics assume he will.Some marchers last week protested the controversial decision by Bukele’s government to roll out a digital bitcoin wallet known as the “Chivo” one week ago. The system has been down frequently for maintenance.Some marchers wore T-shirts that read “NO To Bitcoin.” A few demonstrators vandalized the special ATM machines set up to handle bitcoin transactions, but which have been inoperable anyway much of the time. The cubicle housing one ATM machine was destroyed.The digital wallet appears to have been overloaded by the sheer number of Salvadorans looking to take advantage of the $30 bonus that the government put in each account to incentivize adoption.Bukele, the main promotor of using the cryptocurrency, acknowledged the government’s three-month rollout may have been too ambitious. He said technical glitches had prevented the app from working on some kinds of phones.Any business with the technological capacity to do so is required to accept payment in bitcoin, but no private citizen is required to use it.Recent public opinion surveys in El Salvador have said a majority of Salvadorans oppose making the bitcoin an official currency. Still Bukele says there are now 1.6 million users of the digital payment system in the Central American nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/el-salvador-prez-nayib-bukele-changes-twitter-profile-description-to-dictator-101632188460157.html
21-09-2021||World||NASA selects Moon site for ice-hunting rover||NASA on Monday announced it would land an ice-seeking rover on a region of the Moon's south pole called the Nobile Crater in 2023.The space agency hopes the robot will confirm the presence of water ice just below the surface, which could one day be converted into rocket fuel for missions to Mars and deeper into the cosmos."Nobile Crater is an impact crater near the south pole that was born through a collision with another smaller celestial body," Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division told reporters.It is one of the solar system's coldest regions, and has only so far been probed from afar using sensors such as those aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite."The rover is going to get up close and personal with the lunar soil, even drilling several feet down," said Glazer.The robot is called Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER.Its dimensions are similar to a golf cart -- five feet by five feet by eight feet (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 2.5 meters) and looks somewhat similar to droids seen in Star Wars. It weighs 950 pounds (430 kilograms).Unlike rovers used on Mars, VIPER can be piloted in near real time, because the distance from Earth is much shorter -- only around 200,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) or 1.3 light seconds.The rover is also faster, topping out at 0.5 mph (0.8 kph).Solar-powered VIPER comes with a 50-hour battery, is built to withstand extreme temperatures, and can "crab walk" sideways so that its panels keep pointing toward the Sun to maintain charging.In terms of the mission's scientific goals, the VIPER team wants to know how frozen water reached the Moon in the first place, how it remained preserved for billions of years, how it escapes and where the water goes now.The mission is part of Artemis, America's plan to return humans to the Moon.The first crewed mission is technically set for 2024, but will likely take place significantly later as various aspects are running behind schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-selects-moon-site-for-ice-hunting-rover-101632188311736.html

Voting across Canada’s six time zones started in the Atlantic island province of Newfoundland at 8.30am local time and was to wrap up in westernmost British Columbia at 7pm.Trudeau is pitching its management of the pandemic and leveraging the wedge issue of vaccine passports against the principal opposition leader O’Toole who has opposed imposition of mandatory vaccination.That single issue has bolstered Trudeau’s campaign to return to power in Ottawa, and indications on the eve of the polls were that he may even have an outside chance at capturing the majority he craved while precipitating snap elections on August 15.As per the latest data from the tracking website 338 Canada, the Liberals have 31.9% vote share translating to 148 seats, while their rival Conservatives have 31.4% support equal to 125 seats.The outlet CBC’s poll tracker gives the ruling party a 57% chance of forming a minority government but just 17% for a majority. The majority mark in the House of Commons is 170 and the ruling party captured 157 seats in 2019.Approximately, 6.3mn have voted prior to Monday, at advance polls that spanned four days and through mail-in ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-vote-in-pandemic-election-101632163639004.html

The palatial villa was where Tagore translated his famous collection of poems ‘Gitanjali’.Earlier in 2015 and 2017, the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the Indian High Commission in London to look into ways of acquiring the property on behalf of the Bengal government so that the property could be converted into a museum and a memorial.“From our point of view, we are in the business of selling and as long as our client gets the value they seek and it meets all requirements under British law, all offers are welcome,” Philip Green, director of Goldschmidt & Howland, the estate agents handling the sale, told news agency PTI.The three-bed terrace house is valued at GBP 2,699,500. It is described as a stylish Grade II listed Victorian Villa constructed circa 1863.The Blue Plaque — a scheme run by the English Heritage charity to honour notable people and organisations associated with particular buildings across London — mentions Rabindranath Tagore and his year of stay.“It is a wonderful home in a spectacular part of London and we are privileged to be handling the sale. Its historical significance is recognised with the Blue Plaque but besides that, there has been a lot of interest because of its unique location, period features and beautiful views of the Heath,” Philip Green said.The Indian High Commission in London told news agency PTI it is unaware of any renewed interest in the property from the West Bengal government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-london-villa-where-rabindranath-tagore-translated-gitanjali-up-for-sale-101632163251597.html
