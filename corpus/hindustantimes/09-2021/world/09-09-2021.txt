09-09-2021||World||97% of Afghanistan's population could plunge into poverty by mid-2022, says UN||As much as 97 per cent of Afghanistan's population is at risk of sinking below the poverty line unless a response to the country's political and economic crises is urgently launched, according to a rapid appraisal released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on Thursday.The study, which analysed four potential scenarios of escalating intensity and isolation, indicated that real GDP could contract by as much as 13.2 per cent, leading to an increase in the poverty rate of up to 25 percentage points, the UNDP said."We are facing a full-on development collapse on top of humanitarian and economic crises," said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific."Half of the population is already in need of humanitarian support. This analysis suggests that we are on course for rapid, catastrophic deterioration in the lives of Afghanistan's most vulnerable people."The appraisal used a computable general equilibrium model for Afghanistan to simulate scenarios based on the latest available data (2018). The modelling identified a worst-case scenario defined by a two-month interruption to trade with all major partners, a four per cent decrease in capital spending efficiency, and disruptions in connectivity, the statement added.According to the appraisal, this combination of factors could cause the baseline poverty rate, now at 72 per cent, to balloon.In addition to a prolonged drought and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, Afghanistan is contending with the upheaval caused by the current political transition: frozen foreign reserves, collapsing public finances, increasing pressure on the banking system, and rising poverty.In response, UNDP is proposing a package of interventions designed to help improve the immediate living conditions of the most vulnerable people and communities, prioritising safeguarding women and girls' rights.The package focuses on essential services, local livelihoods, basic income and small infrastructure and aims to support close to nine million vulnerable people through a 24-month community development programme.Under the plan, the most vulnerable would benefit from cash-for-work schemes, grants for small and medium enterprises, especially women-run businesses. Children, people with disabilities and elderly citizens would receive temporary basic income through monthly cash transfers.The proposed Local Area-Based Programme will be implemented directly with local networks of community groups, NGOs and small businesses. Speaking at a press conference, UN Assistant Secretary-General Wignaraja called on the international community to launch a response commensurate with the scale of the crisis in Afghanistan."A transition to new authorities, a pandemic, a drought, an oncoming winter season - each of these on their own would already pose a major challenge. Taken together, they form a crisis that demands urgent action," she said. "This program aims to contribute to improving the lives of the most vulnerable, while also reducing displacement that could further compound the situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/97-of-afghanistan-s-population-could-plunge-into-poverty-by-mid-2022-says-un-101631210004058.html

Xi Jinping said the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries must strengthen public health cooperation and international cooperation on sharing vaccines.“We need to promote global solidarity against Covid-19, join forces to tackle the pandemic, uphold a science-based approach to tracing its origins, and oppose the politicisation and stigmatisation,” Xi Jinping said, adding that the BRICS need to boost the research, production and equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good.Xi Jinping said the member countries should facilitate the “early launch of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Centre in a virtual format”.On the issue of terrorism and security, Xi Jinping said the BRICS countries need to support each other on “issues concerning our respective core interests and jointly safeguard our sovereignty, security and development interests”.Xi Jinping stressed on the need for the BRICS to have a “bigger, collective voice” to better coordinate positions on major international and regional issues. “The BRICS Counter Terrorism Action Plan adopted earlier this year should be implemented in real earnest.”Xi Jinping said the five BRICS countries have become an important force on the international stage to reckon with, adding that the countries have expanded strategic communication among them.Announcing that China will take over as the BRICS chair in 2022, Xi Jinping said the country looks forward to building a more closer and result-oriented partnership.“Over the past 15 years, our five nations have enhanced strategic communication and political trust in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and equality, respected each other’s social system and explored a sound way for nations to interact with each other,” Xi Jinping said. “The five countries have also conducted practical cooperation in various fields. BRICS countries have become an important force on the international stage to be reckoned with.”“While seeking synergy between their development policies and drawing on their complementarities, the five countries have made solid progress in various areas of cooperation in the spirit of pragmatism, innovation and win-win cooperation, and have forged ahead on the common journey of development,” Xi Jinping said.The five countries have supported multilateralism and taken part in global governance in the spirit of equity, justice, and mutual assistance, he said. “What has happened shows that come what may, we can make smooth, solid and sustained progress in BRICS cooperation as long as we pull our minds and our efforts,” Xi Jinping added.“China looks forward to working with BRICS partners to deepen cooperation in all areas and build a closer and more results-oriented partnership to meet common challenges and create a better future,” Xi Jinping said.Xi Jinping echoed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, in his opening remarks, said BRICS is an influential voice for emerging economies of the world and the countries must ensure that it becomes more productive in the next 15 years.Besides Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping, the summit was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Brazil’s Jair Bolsanaro.Xi said that in order to promote BRICS practical cooperation, China proposes to hold multiple forums including the BRICS Industrial Internet and Digital Manufacturing Development Forum, the BRICS High-level Meeting on Climate Change, the BRICS Sustainable Development Big Data Forum, and online training courses for media from five countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-provide-100mn-more-covid-vaccines-to-developing-nations-xi-jinping-101631209495289.html
09-09-2021||World||Shouldn’t become sanctuary for terror groups to attack others: Brics on Afghanistan||The Brics grouping on Thursday asserted Afghanistan’s territory shouldn’t become a sanctuary for terror groups to mount attacks on other nations and called for an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue to ensure stability and peace in the war-torn country following the Taliban takeover. The Delhi Declaration issued after a virtual summit of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) expressed concern at developments in Afghanistan and made a call for “refraining from violence and settling the situation by peaceful means”. The grouping highlighted the importance of fighting terror and upholding human rights, including those of women and minorities. The strongly worded joint statement came two days after the Taliban unveiled an interim setup in Kabul led by Mohammad Hasan Akhund and dominated by 17 leaders sanctioned by the UN Security Council. Despite recent remarks by Taliban leaders that they would form an inclusive government, the new regime comprised mainly members of the group’s old guard and top military commanders such as Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Delhi Declaration, issued at the conclusion of the summit, said: “We underscore the priority of fighting terrorism, including preventing attempts by terrorist organisations to use Afghan territory as terrorist sanctuary and to carry out attacks against other countries, as well as drug trade within Afghanistan.” While calling on all parties to refrain from violence and to settle the situation through peaceful means, the declaration added, “We stress the need to contribute to fostering an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue so as to ensure stability, civil peace, law and order in the country.” The Brics members condemned the terrorist attacks near Kabul airport on August 26 that resulted in the death of more than 180 people, mostly Afghans and 13 US military personnel. They also emphasised the need to address the humanitarian situation and to “uphold human rights, including those of women, children and minorities”, the declaration said. Russian President Vladimir Putin was the only one of the five leaders to raise the situation in Afghanistan in the televised opening remarks, saying all members of Brics do not want Afghanistan to remain a threat to its neighbours, or Afghan soil to be a source of drug trafficking and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted in his opening remarks that the grouping had adopted the Brics Counter-Terrorism Action Plan. The plan is aimed at implementing the Brics counter-terrorism strategy adopted by the national security advisors and defines the approach for cooperation in this field, including joint efforts to identify and respond to “persistent and emerging terror threats”. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the situation in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil figured extensively in the closed deliberations between the five leaders. Putin highlighted the dangers posed by terrorism while Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro pointed to the problem of narcotics originating from Afghanistan, the people said. “The Russian position, as outlined by President Putin and Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, during his visit this week, is very similar to India’s position and we have similar concerns regarding Afghanistan,” one of the people cited above said. Briefing the media after the summit, secretary Sanjay Bhattacharyya, who is the Sherpa to Brics, said a key outcome of the meeting was a “very strong sense of consensus” on Afghanistan, which supports India’s perspective on developments in the war-torn country and the region. “There was a very strong condemnation of terrorism and that Afghan territory should not be used either for terrorism or for drug trafficking, and that it should not become a reason for problems in the neighbourhood,” he said. The role of the UN Security Council in addressing the humanitarian aspects of the situation was highlighted, he said. Putin, in his opening remarks, said close partnership between the Brics states is required because the situation across the world remains turbulent and long-standing regional conflicts were flaring up with renewed vigour. “The withdrawal of the US and its allies from Afghanistan has led to a new crisis and it’s still unclear how this will affect regional and global security,” he said. Russia and its Brics partners have “consistently advocated the establishment of long-awaited peace and stability on Afghan soil”, and the people of the country have “fought for many decades and earned the right to independently determine what their state will be like”, Putin added. “We are all interested in Afghanistan ceasing to be a threat to the neighbours, so that terrorism and illegal drug trafficking threaten us from Afghan territory. We are interested in stopping migration flows. We stand for Afghans to be able to live peacefully and with dignity in their homeland,” he said. Putin also said that the current crisis in Afghanistan stems directly from “irresponsible attempts to impose alien values from the outside and the desire to build so-called democratic structures using methods of socio-political engineering without taking into account either the historical or national characteristics of other peoples and ignoring their traditions”. “All this results in destabilisation and chaos, after which the authors of these experiments back down, abandoning their charges to their fate. The entire international community will have to clear up the mess as a result,” Putin said, without naming the US. Bhattacharyya said all the leaders focused on post-Covid-19 recovery and vaccines during their deliberations in light of the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic. Modi noted that the post-pandemic agenda of Brics should focus on building back, resilience, innovation, credibility and sustainability. The leaders discussed the need for extensive vaccination and the development of vaccines. A vaccine R&D centre is now being proposed as a virtual network to facilitate the development and distribution of vaccines. The Delhi Declaration regretted the “glaring inequity in access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, especially for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations” and highlighted the “importance of safe, efficacious, accessible and affordable vaccines”. The leaders also discussed the reforms of multilateral bodies such as the UN Security Council in view of a long-standing feeling that the existing systems need to respond to the needs of global governance and be more responsive. There were also discussions on the New Development Bank (NDB), which has emerged as a flagship project in economic and financial cooperation between Brics members. The bank has provided funding worth $29 billion to 73 infrastructure projects, including $7 billion for 18 projects in India. The Delhi Declaration further said the world community has a “collective responsibility to work together against the Covid-19 pandemic” within existing international frameworks such as the WHO, and noted that cooperation on the “origins of the SARS-COV-2 is an important aspect of the fight”. It added, “We support science-based, inclusive of broad expertise, transparent, and timely processes, free from politicisation or interference, to strengthen international capabilities to better understand the emergence of novel pathogens and to help prevent future pandemics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shouldnt-become-sanctuary-for-terror-groups-to-attack-others-brics-on-afghanistan-101631209255185.html
09-09-2021||World||Amid rising Iran tension, US Navy sets up drone task force in Gulf||The US Navy's Fifth Fleet said Thursday it launched a new task force in the Gulf incorporating drones and artificial intelligence following maritime attacks blamed on Iran.A statement by the US Naval Forces Central Command, or NAVCENT, said the task force would rely on regional and coalition partnerships."The bottom line on why we're doing this is so that we can develop and integrate unmanned systems and AI as a means to do two things," NAVCENT commander Brad Cooper said."One, enhance our maritime domain awareness, and two, increase deterrence," he said in the statement.Since February, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been accused of engaging in what analysts have called a "shadow war", in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.On July 29 an attack against the Israeli-linked MT Mercer Street oil products tanker off Oman's coast killed a British security guard and a Romanian crew member.G7 foreign ministers last month said "all available evidence clearly points to Iran" being behind the attack in which drones were used.Iran rejected the allegations, which came days before ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi took office in the Islamic republic.The attack on the Mercer Street came amid stalled talks between Tehran and world powers aimed at reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.US Navy spokesman Tim Hawkins told AFP the task force was "dedicated to rapidly integrate unmanned systems and artificial intelligence with maritime operations in the Fifth Fleet region"."When we talk about the integration of new unmanned systems, we're talking about systems that can be used under, on and above the water," he said.Iran has also been accused of hijacking an asphalt and bitumen tanker in the Gulf of Oman in August, which it denied.The Fifth Fleet is based in the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-rising-iran-tension-us-navy-sets-up-drone-task-force-in-gulf-101631206328758.html

The crew turned on a filter to eliminate possible smoke pollution and went back to sleep, the Russian space agency said. The incident is the latest in the string of problems related to the Zvezda service module, the Russian segment of the space station."A smoke detector was triggered in the Zvezda service module of the Russian segment of the International Space Station during automatic battery charging, and an alarm went off," Roscosmos said in a statement.Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov today went on a spacewalk as per the schedule to continue the integration of the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module into the Russian segment of the ISS through extravehicular activities. Nauka is designed to build up the technical and operational capabilities of the Russian segment of the International Space Station."All systems are operating normally," Roscosmos said.In July, a “short-term software failure” threw the space station out of control for a brief period after a research module was docked. An unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module Nauka resulted in a “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes.Nasa later assured that ground teams regained attitude control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it. The US space agency, however, stressed that the seven crew aboard the ISS were never in any immediate danger.In the past, Russia has indicated to leave the space station after 2025 and launch its own orbital station given the frequent issues with the ISS. A space official even warned last month that out of date software could lead to "irreparable failures".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smoke-at-international-space-station-latest-in-series-of-issues-in-russian-module-101631204664493.html
09-09-2021||World||Pakistan minister says they can send people to Kabul. To help in various affairs||Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Tarin on Thursday said people could be sent from Pakistan to run various affairs in Afghanistan as he was addressing a session of the Senate Standing Committee in which he also talked about the future framework of trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, several Pakistani media, including Geo TV, reported.The comment comes amid several Pakistani ministers speaking in favour of the Taliban. While countries are buying time to decide on whether to recognise the interim Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan ministers are pressing for continued co-operation with Afghanistan. Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Thursday that Afghanistan's assets should be unfrozen so that they can be used, Reuters reported.Taliban open fire to disperse anti-Pakistan march in Kabul: ReportsWhile Shaukat Tarin's comment on sending people to Afghanistan has drawn sharp reaction on social media, especially after the recent visit of the ISI chief Faiz Hameed to Kabul underlined the Pakistan hand behind the Taliban, many claimed that it was an offer from the finance minister to help the Taliban government to fill the technical positions left vacant due to the recent evacuations by the western countries.The Pakistan minister also said that Pakistan will trade with Afghanistan in the Pakistani currency as Kabul is facing a shortage of dollars.Afghanistan's acting Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund has appealed to ex-officials to return to Afghanistan and that they have no security threat in the country as the Taliban will guarantee their security and safety. We have suffered huge losses in money and lives for this historical moment in the history of Afghanistan. The stage of bloodshed, killing and contempt for people in Afghanistan has ended, and we have paid dearly for this. No one will be able to prove that he was subjected to revenge. And in such tense circumstances, it is easy to do what you want. But the movement is disciplined and controls its gunmen. And, we have not harmed anyone because of his previous actions," he said in an interview to Al Jazeera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-they-can-send-people-to-kabul-to-run-various-affairs-101631204545514.html
09-09-2021||World||Zebulon Simentov, Afghanistan's last Jew, leaves after Taliban takeover||The last member of Afghanistan's Jewish community has left the country following the Taliban takeover, an Israeli-American businessman who organized his evacuation told AFP Thursday.Zebulon Simentov began his journey out of Afghanistan on Friday and arrived in a "neighboring country" Wednesday, said Moti Kahana, who runs a US-based private security firm.For decades, Simentov refused to leave Afghanistan -- surviving a Soviet invasion, deadly civil war, brutal rule by the Taliban and the US-led occupation of his homeland.Having already endured the Taliban's regime from 1996 to 2001, Simentov was reluctant to go when Kahana's security team arrived 10 days before his departure."At that time, he did not want to come out," said Kahana, who explained to Simentov that he was at risk of being killed by Islamic State-Khorasan militants."But he listened and I think he came to the conclusion himself," Kahana recalled.Simentov asked Kahana if they could also take his "best friend" and their kids, so 29 neighbors joined him on the journey out.Kahana said that Simentov has family in New York and plans to join them there soon, hopefully around the Yom Kippur holiday next week."He's definitely coming," Kahana added.Born in the 1950s in the western city of Herat, Simentov moved to Kabul during the Soviet invasion in the early 1980s for the capital's then relative stability.Over the decades, all Simentov's relatives left -- including his wife and two daughters.But Simentov stayed put, despite the Taliban trying to convert him to Islam and imprisoning him four times.He continued to mark Jewish new year Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur at Kabul's only synagogue."I have resisted. I have made the religion of Moses proud here," he told AFP during an interview earlier this year.Jews lived in Afghanistan for more than 2,500 years, with tens of thousands once residing in Herat, where four synagogues still stand -- testimony to the community's ancient presence.But they have steadily left the country since the 19th century, with many now living in Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zebulon-simentov-afghanistan-s-last-jew-leaves-after-taliban-takeover-101631203976603.html
09-09-2021||World||Kim Jong Un is trim, tanned and loving a parade||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held center stage at a military parade, showing off to a national television audience a thinner frame, a trace of a tan and a haircut reminiscent of his grandfather -- state founder Kim Il Sung.There were no major new weapons on display at North Korea’s first military parade since U.S. President Joe Biden took office that was broadcast on Thursday, but there was a lot of attention on a new-look Kim, who has undergone a noticeable weight loss over the past several months.Dressed in a light-colored suit, Kim didn’t speak at the parade. But he waived, smiled and gave a thumbs up as thousands of goose-stepping paramilitary and public security forces marched for more than an hour through central Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, fixing their gazes to the balcony where the leader was watching as they passed.Kim -- overweight and a smoker -- has been the subject of health speculation for years and his public appearances are closely tracked for insights about the autocratic and secretive regime in Pyongyang, especially since his family has a history of heart disease.The North Korean leader may have dropped at least 20 kilograms (44 pounds) over the past several months, according to a South Korean lawmaker briefed by a spy agency official in July. He looked even thinner at the parade. At the parade, Kim also appeared to paying homage to his grandfather with a haircut similar to one sported by Kim Il Sung about 70 years ago. In June, state media cited a citizen as saying North Koreans broke down in tears over seeing a dramatically thinner Kim Jong Un. The  37-year-old leader returned to the public eye cutting a much thinner figure after being absent for most of May, which raised questions about his health.Kim has been looking to rally support as North Korea is facing one of its worst food shortage in years. He is struggling to build an economy hit by sanctions to punish the country for its testing of nuclear weapons and missiles that can deliver warheads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-is-trim-tanned-and-loving-a-parade-101631194284669.html
09-09-2021||World||200 passengers leave Kabul in first evacuation airlift after US pullout from Afghanistan||Some 200 passengers, including US citizens, left Kabul airport on Thursday, on the first flight carrying foreigners out of the Afghan capital since a US-led evacuation ended on August 30.The flight to Doha comes as the Taliban continue their transition from insurgents to governing power, less than a month after they marched into Kabul and ousted former president Ashraf Ghani.Thursday afternoon's Qatar Airways flight took some 200 people from Kabul's airport -- the first since a mammoth, chaotic airlift of more than 120,000 people came to a dramatic close with the US pullout.An Afghan-American dual citizen, waiting to board the flight with his family, said the US State Department had called him in the morning and told him to go to the airport."We got in contact with the State Department, they gave me a call this morning and said to go to the airport," the father, who asked not to be named, told AFP.In the days that followed the Taliban's blitz, the airport had become a tragic symbol of desperation among Afghans terrified of the militants' return to power -- with thousands of people crowding around its gates daily, and some even clinging to jets as they took off.More than 100 people were killed, including 13 US troops, in a suicide attack on August 26 near the airport that was claimed by the Islamic State group's local chapter.Waiting with suitcasesFootage broadcast by Al Jazeera TV on Thursday showed families including women, children and elderly people waiting with suitcases at the airport for their turn to leave.It was not immediately clear whether any countries other than Qatar had played a role in organising the airlift.Qatar has acted as the central intermediary between the Taliban and the international community in recent years, and numerous countries, including the United States, have relocated their embassies from Kabul to Doha in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover."We are very appreciative of the Qataris," one man told the channel, giving his nationality as Canadian.Away from the airport, there was a noticeably stronger Taliban presence on the streets of Kabul as armed fighters -- including special forces in military fatigues -- stood guard on street corners and manned checkpoints, according to AFP journalists.Protest banQatar's special envoy to Afghanistan, Mutlaq al-Qahtani, called it a "historic day" for the airport.He also said it marked a major step on the road to "reopening ... the airport to international flights, but it may be gradual".Most of the early Afghan evacuees were desperate to flee fearing Taliban reprisals for having worked with foreign powers during the 20-year, US-led occupation.The United States has repeatedly pledged to continue working to evacuate any American citizens still in Afghanistan after last month's airlift ended.Earlier Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said only around 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan."It's right around 100 right now and we're working to get those American citizens who want to depart out of the country, as well as legal permanent residents and other key partners," Psaki told MSNBC.The Taliban have said they will not prevent anyone who wishes to from leaving the country, even as they have urged skilled Afghans, such as doctors and engineers, to remain.The Islamist hardliners have pledged a more moderate brand of rule than in their notoriously oppressive 1996-2001 reign. However, they have shown clear signs that they will not tolerate opposition.Earlier this week armed Taliban militants dispersed hundreds of protesters in cities across Afghanistan, including Kabul, Faizabad in the northeast and in Herat in the west, where two people were shot dead.Late Wednesday, they moved to snuff out any further civil unrest, saying protests would need prior authorisation from the justice ministry, adding that no demonstrations were allowed "for the time being".One protest organiser told AFP rallies in Kabul had been cancelled because of the overnight ban.Promises of inclusionA Taliban interim government, drawn exclusively from loyalist ranks, formally began work this week with established hardliners in all key posts and no women -- despite previous promises of an inclusive administration for all Afghans.All the top positions have been handed to key leaders from the movement and in particular the Haqqani network -- the most violent Taliban faction, known for devastating attacks.The dreaded Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice -- previously responsible for arresting and punishing people for failing to follow the movement's restrictive interpretation of sharia -- is being reinstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/200-passengers-leave-kabul-in-first-evacuation-airlift-after-us-pullout-from-afghanistan-101631197653108.html

This comes at a time when the countries are reiterating that they are in no hurry to recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan.After postponing it twice, the Taliban announced its interim Cabinet on Tuesday, under the leadership of Taliban's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. The composition of the government, mostly prominent Taliban and Haqqani leaders, has raised international concern as the United States also said it is watching the new government closely. Several Cabinet members are on the sanction list of the United States and the Taliban on Thursday took objection to this stance and urged for the removal of these names from theUS sanction list."The family of honourable Haqqani Sahib is part of Islamic Emirate and does not have a separate name or organisational setup. Similarly, in Doha Agreement all officials of the Islamic Emirate without any exception were part of interaction with the US and should have been removed from the UN and US blacklists, a demand which still remains valid," the Taliban said.Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, the caretaker Prime Minister, invited all former officials to return to the country and the Taliban will guarantee their security and safety, he said. “We have suffered huge losses in money and lives for this historical moment in the history of Afghanistan. The stage of bloodshed, killing and contempt for people in Afghanistan has ended, and we have paid dearly for this," Akhund said.Ceremony on September 11?A ceremony is being planned in Kabul though the date has not been finalised. It is also not confirmed whether the Taliban want 9/11 to be the date to embarrass the United States. After capturing Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had said that there was no proof that Osama bin Laden was involved in the September 11 attack. “When Osama bin Laden became an issue for the Americans, he was in Afghanistan. Although there was no proof he was involved," he had said to NBC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-hold-oath-taking-ceremony-on-9-11-anniversary-reports-101631197309249.html

Reports suggest that the foreigners allowed to leave Afghanistan include 30 Americans in the first airlift since the final US withdrawal and the first international flights to take off since the Taliban took control of Kabul in mid-August."Not all 200 are US citizens. There are American citizens amongst the group departing Kabul to Doha," news agency AFP quoted a person in Doha, who was briefed on the operation, as saying.The Taliban have allowed the departure of charter flights carrying non-Afghans two days after the Islamist hardliners announced an interim government headed by Mullah Hassan Akhund. A US official claimed that the Taliban were pressed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to allow the departures, Reuters reported.Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV broadcasted the visuals from Hamid Karzai International Airport which showed women, children, and the elderly waiting there with suitcases.Earlier this week, a Qatari technical team landed at Kabul airport aboard the country's flagship carrier Qatar Airways to discuss reopening the airport. Qatar's foreign minister had said that the Gulf nation was working with the Taliban to reopen the airport as soon as possible and urged the insurgents to allow Afghans to leave.While the Taliban have shown interest in engaging with regional and Western governments, most of the democratic countries are apprehensive about the assurance given by the insurgents regarding inclusivity and human rights. The all-male members of the newly-announced Taliban-led government, with almost no ethnic diversity, have done little to address the concerns of democratic countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-the-first-airlift-since-us-withdrawal-200-non-afghans-set-to-leave-taliban-controlled-kabul-101631186471647.html

"Women's rights must be the litmus test for our collective engagement with the Taliban," Naciri said, according to local media reports."The decisions that are made in the coming days on how the international community will engage with the Taliban will have long-term implications," Naciri added.The Taliban, known for its radical way of ruling, returned to power in Afghanistan last month following the withdrawal of the US military from the war-torn country. Designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States, the group ruled over the country from 1996 to 2001, when the American forces ousted them in anti-terror operations.Since then the women in Afghanistan have been reclaiming the public space, by joining workforces and enlisting themselves in police forces. They also competed in Olympics, became engineers, doctors and diplomats over the past few years and pushed the Islamic country to become more progressive. However, with the Taliban returning to power after 20 years, the same women are facing an uncertain future and fear that the group will reintroduce their regressive policies.The Taliban's position, in turn, is equally unclear - whether they will seek international legitimacy, turn to their established friends for support or turn inward.On Tuesday, the group announced their appointments of key ministers of the caretaking cabinet. However, the group made no mention of women as part of any governance structure. According to local media reports, the Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has recommended women stay at home, "for their own protection."Women have also started disappearing from the media landscape, the group banned women's voices from the radio. Reports are also emerging from across the country claiming forced marriage of young girls, women being sent home from their workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-engagement-with-global-bodies-to-depend-on-safety-of-women-s-rights-in-afghanistan-un-101631186594003.html

While some of these airports have been built and are functional, the remaining are under construction.Among the three new airports to be built in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) are those at Lhunze county, Tingri county and Burang county, close to the border with India, official media had reported earlier this year.Another strategic airport to be opened by the middle of 2022 is the Tashkurgan, the first super-high plateau airport in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) on the Pamir plateau, close to China’s border with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Afghanistan.Tiny Tashkurgan is the last important town in China close to PoK and located in the Tajik Autonomous County of the Kashgar prefecture in XUAR.Once completed, the new airport will be strategically located close to the Wakhan Corridor, the narrow pass which separates PoK and Tajikistan besides China and Afghanistan.Nearly two dozen new air routes have also been inaugurated connecting TAR and XUAR with cities across China this year, the report said.The opening of new routes and rapid construction of new airports come in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.China is bolstering its presence all along the border with India, fortifying the remote regions by building critical civil-military dual use infrastructure like airports and railway routes.The report published by the official military portal of the Chinese military this week said the development of the airports in border areas is making transportation more convenient.“A chartered flight carrying 115 veterans took off from the Shigatse Heping Airport in Tibet and headed for Chengdu, Sichuan province, on the morning of September 1, marking the official opening of 23 air routes for transporting new recruits and veterans into and out of Xinjiang and Tibet in the second half of this year,” the report said.The report quoted an officer in charge of a military transportation centre under the PLA Western Theatre Command as saying that there are “…currently nearly 30 civil airports built or under construction in Xinjiang and Tibet. The rapid development of civil aviation in the border areas has provided convenience for the air transportation of recruits and veterans”.“It is learnt that after coordinating with airports in Urumqi, Kashgar, Lhasa, Shigatse and other places, the dispatch centre has opened up 23 routes to transport recruits and veterans into and out of Xinjiang and Tibet this year, and temporarily opened three routes from Yinchuan, Jiayuguan, and Zhangye to Ngari,” the report said.While Yinchuan is in the northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, both Jiayuguan and Zhangye are in Gansu province, also in the northwest of China; Ngari is in TAR.“It is also learnt that, in addition, some airlines help to reserve tickets of regular flights to Ngari in response to the troops’ emergency needs. And some urgently needed military supplies could also be delivered free of charge or at preferential rates by the civil airliners,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-airports-routes-for-pla-to-transport-personnel-to-tibet-xinjiang-101631186326565.html

Their crime? They were covering the women's protest in the Capital. As reported by news agency AFP, photographer Nematullah Naqdi said one of the Taliban put his foot on his head and then crushed his face against the concrete. "I thought they were going to kill me," he told AFP.Naqdi and his colleague reporter Taqi Daryabi, both of whom work for Etilaat Roz (Information Daily), were assigned to cover a protest in front of a police station in Kabul by women demanding the right to work and education. This was one of the many protests that took place in the country before the Taliban banned protests without permission. اطلاعات روز: تقی دریابی و نعمت‌الله نقدی، دو گزارشگر روزنامه اطلاعات روز پس از بازداشت توسط طالبان، به شدت مورد لت‌وکوب قرار گرفته‌اند.آثاری از شلاق و کیبل‌ بر سر، صورت و بدن این دو گزارشگر اطلاعات روز به چشم می‌خورد. pic.twitter.com/0vuEwYW28bThey were interrupted as soon as they started taking photos.

The report suggests that a Chinese business representatives group in Afghanistan named “China Town in Kabul” is working to establish a so-called Afghan Institute.China has been warming up to the Taliban even as they are wary of Uyghurs separatists getting support from the Islamic fundamentalists. In an interview aired Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin termed the formation of the provisional Taliban government a “necessary step” for the restoration of “domestic order” and in pursuing the post-war reconstruction.A member of the Chinese business group in Kabul said that they have already made agreements with domestic enterprises and other organisations to jointly build the “platform,” reported Global Times. A rough framework for the industry platform has reportedly been formed and may be launched next week. The business representatives group in Kabul will provide services like personnel safety, government liaisoning, and bank exchange, tax and logistical services to the Afghan Insitute, according to Global Times."Various Chinese enterprises in the sectors of infrastructure construction and mining have contacted us for discussion since the release of the platform plan," the state media quoted the member as saying.Also Read | China says it will maintain communication with Taliban-led Afghanistan govtThe interim Taliban government includes several UN- and US-designated terrorists which could work as an impediment to global humanitarian aid. While western countries have been walking a diplomatic tightrope on the Afghanistan situation, China is one of the few countries readily taking the initiative to build ties with the Taliban.China announced 200 million yuan (US$31 million) worth of aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban’s government formation announcement. The insurgents have also been appreciative of China’s aid and projects in the region, which is reflected in the Taliban spokesperson’s statement calling Beijing their most important partner.“China has decided to urgently provide 200 million yuan ($30.96 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines, and medicines to Afghanistan according to the needs of the Afghan people,” State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said at a meeting, according to the official news agency, Xinhua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eyes-investment-opportunity-in-taliban-controlled-afghanistan-to-set-up-industry-platform-101631180993928.html

"Pentagon officials have remarked that some cabinet members of the Islamic Emirate or family members of late Haqqani Sahib - may Allah be pleased with him - are on the US blacklists and still targets. The Islamic Emirate considers this position a clear violation of the Doha Agreement which is neither in the interest of the United States nor Afghanistan," the group said in a statement.Haqqani network chief Jalaluddin Haqqani's son Sirajudin Haqqani is a global terrorist who carries a reward of USD 10 million bounty on his head. In the recently announced Cabinet, he has been given the post of acting interior minister. While this makes the Taliban-Haqqani link clear, raising concern of many countries, the Taliban in its statement said: "The family of honourable Haqqani Sahib is part of Islamic Emirate and does not have a separate name or organisational setup. Similarly, in Doha Agreement all officials of the Islamic Emirate without any exception were part of interaction with the US and should have been removed from the UN and US blacklists, a demand which still remains valid."Such positions are detrimental for America, the Taliban said terming these as a repetition of past failed experiments.Also Read | Not only PM; at least 14 members of Taliban govt are blacklisted by UN: ReportA day after the Taliban announced their interim cabinet, the state department of the United States said that many of them have questionable track records. "We note the announced list of names consists exclusively of individuals who are members of the Taliban or their close associates and no women. We also are concerned by the affiliations and track records of some of the individuals," the statement issued by the US state department said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States is closely watching the new government in Afghanistan and they will have to earn legitimacy and support.Haqqanis are Afghanistan's most feared militants, part of a group fomred by anti-Soviet Jihadist Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Haqqanis have also hugely contributed to the Taliban's fighting ranks, and are the group's "most combat-ready forces", UN monitors said in a June report. Two Haqqani members, Sirajuddin Haqqani and his uncle Khalil Haqqani have been inducted in Afghanistan's new Cabinet.

NRF leader Ali Nazary said in an interview that 60 per cent of Panjshir is still under the NRF control.Nazary also told CNN that the Taliban have suffered heavy casualties."The current situation in Pajshir is a hit more complex than what is being reported. The Taliban haven't taken the province, they have only taken the main road and the provincial centre is located near the main road. So this is why they were able to hoist their flag," Nazary said on CNN Connect.He further said that the topography of Panjshir valley is very complex, which doesn't allow an invader to take over the entire area, adding that it has many sub-valleys. "60 to 65% of these sub-valleys and strategic positions are under our control."Nazary said the NRF forces made a "tactical withdrawal" from the main road and will soon return.Meanwhile, ousted Afghan government's ambassador to Tajikistan has said that Panjshiri leader Ahmad Shah Massoud and former Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh have not fled Afghanistan."Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have not fled to Tajikistan. The news that Ahmad Massoud has left Panjshir is not true; he is inside Afghanistan," Zahir Aghbar said at a press conference.Aghbar added that he is in regular contact with Saleh and that the resistance leaders were out of general communication for security reasons.The Taliban swept to power last month and the militant group has said they have captured the Panjshir valley, a last holdout province, though the resistance has not conceded defeat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/made-tactical-withdrawal-nrf-leader-says-60-of-panjshir-still-under-control-101631166194644.html

But, the Indian high commission has asked Canadian authorities to protect Indians from “racially motivated crimes”.One person of interest was arrested and later released by Truro Police.Following an emergency call on Sunday, police arrived at the apartment building where the deceased lived and found him with life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a hospital but succumbed to the injuries sustained.India’s consulate in Toronto is in touch with his family members and has promised to provide all support in the repatriation of the mortal remains to India. “We have taken up the matter with federal and local Canadian authorities, who have assured us of quick and transparent investigations into the matter,” a statement from the Indian high commission said. It also warned Indian nationals, especially students, “to exercise caution, avoid moving alone in desolate and lonely areas, especially at night, and report to local police any suspicious or hateful activities they may encounter”.A candlelight vigil in memory of Katri will be held in Truro on Friday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-asks-canada-to-ensure-safety-of-its-nationals-after-murder-of-student-101631166465238.html
09-09-2021||World||Can the Taliban govern Afghanistan?||By announcing a caretaker government, the Taliban have temporarily unified their bickering factions. The interim setup, however, remains problematic and poses several domestic and international challenges to the group.The Taliban leadership took a long time to announce their interim government — three weeks after taking control of Kabul.Analysts say the fight for Panjshir province kept them busy all this while, and once the last resistance stronghold fell to the group, their spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, unveiled the caretaker government on Tuesday.Even though it is just a caretaker government, and what the Taliban's actual government will look like remains unclear, Afghanistan's Islamist rulers face a tough task running the country.Internal riftsThere had been reports of a tug-of-war among Taliban factions over the allocation of key posts in the new government. The transitional setup suggests that Afghanistan's new rulers have been able to unify their ranks, at least for now.Mullah Hasan Akhund has been nominated as acting prime minister, while Sirajuddin Haqqani will serve as acting interior minister. The decision to delegate a senior position to Haqqani is proof that the Taliban did not want to irk the powerful Haqqani Network, which is believed to have become a suborganization of the Taliban in its own right.Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban founder Mohammed Omar, will be acting defense minister and Amir Khan Muttaqi will be acting foreign minister in the new setup.In his column for Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, Zahid Hussain, a senior political analyst, wrote that "the most serious challenge for the Afghan Taliban is to maintain the unity within their ranks.""Some fear that the formation of an interim government will further widen the cleavage. The struggle between the moderates who would want to take a break from some of the harshest legacies of the previous dispensation and the hardliners who are not willing to reform could sharpen," he wrote."While the Taliban may have appeared as a monolith during the war, the differences over military tactics and other policy matters kept surfacing. Yet the disagreement didn't affect the resistance. The end of the war has widened the fault lines," Hussain added.Not inclusiveTaliban officials had claimed that their new government would include different political and ethnic groups, but the interim setup is dominated by their old guard."The Taliban do not see the need for an inclusive government anymore. For them it is more important that powerful figures are leading their government so that they can crush potential resistance movements," Sami Yousufzai, an Afghan journalist, told DW."They have appointed ministers on the basis of their loyalties to the group," he added.The European Union on Wednesday said that the Taliban-appointed caretaker government "does not look like the inclusive and representative formation in terms of the rich ethnic and religious diversity of Afghanistan we hoped to see and that the Taliban were promising over the past weeks."The 27-nation bloc said the formation of an "inclusive and representative" transitional government is vital for its engagement with the Taliban.The Taliban also reportedly disbanded the Ministry for Women's Affairs, days after violently clamping down on women-led protests against curbs to their freedoms under Taliban rule.There are also no women in the new power structure, something protesters in Kabul had been calling for as women fear losing their hard-won rights.Faiz Mohammad Zalan, a lecturer at the University of Kabul, said that although the Taliban are predominantly Pashtun, they do not believe in appointing people on the basis of their ethnic affiliations."Basically, the Taliban wanted to put their most powerful leaders in charge of ministries to control the situation in Afghanistan," Zalan told DW.Dependence on international aidBut it won't be an easy task to "control" a multiethnic, war-torn, and impoverished country like Afghanistan.Protests have already erupted across the country, with anti-Taliban groups defying the new regime.The new Afghan rulers also need international aid, but certain prominent figures in the caretaker government have already angered Western countries.Some of the interim Cabinet members are accused of carrying out attacks on US forces over the last two decades.Akhund, the acting premier, is on a UN blacklist, while Haqqani, the acting interior minister, is wanted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.But Afghan journalist Yousufzai said the international community has no other option but to engage with the Taliban."I think the Western countries don't care who heads an Afghan ministry," Yousufzai said. "They will, however, keep a close eye on the government's policies."Even if the Taliban managed to keep their ranks united and avoid international sanctions, running the country will still prove to be a difficult task for them, said Ahmad Saidi, a former Afghan diplomat."Most Taliban ministers are uneducated and are not familiar with government affairs. Some interim ministers are still facing UN sanctions and won't be able to travel abroad," he told DW. "They still don't have a minister for health and a minister for commerce. We don't know what will happen to these government posts."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-the-taliban-govern-afghanistan-101631165506550.html
09-09-2021||World||Canada polls debate: Rivals target Justin Trudeau over Afghanistan policy||Foreign policy made its presence felt in the first official debate of the 2021 Canadian Federal elections as incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced attacks over Ottawa’s evacuation efforts in Afghanistan and its position on China. The French-language debate on Wednesday also witnessed Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole currently leading in surveys, assert a government led by his party will impose sanctions upon Chinese officials complicit in human rights violations in the Xinjiang province.Justin Trudeau came under criticism from each of the other party leaders over calling an election on August 15 just as the crisis in Kabul was developing. Erin O’Toole said that Canadian veterans of the country’s mission in Afghanistan had asked the government “months ago” for an action plan for evacuation of interpreters and other Afghans who had worked with Canadian units. “He ignored the problem and called an election,” Erin O’Toole said.New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh said that Canada’s “allies were simply left behind”, describing that outcome as “unacceptable”.Green Party leader Annamie Paul said her party had called for an emergency debate on Afghanistan in parliament but that never happened as Federal polls were declared.Justin Trudeau defended his government’s actions, saying it had acted “quickly” and evacuated 3,700 from Afghanistan and will continue to “be there” for those who were associated with the Canadian mission.China also figured in the debate, particularly in the context of the Uighur “genocide” in the Xinjiang province. Erin O’Toole promised that Magnitsky sanctions would be imposed upon Chinese officials found complicit in such human rights violations. Those sanctions, also enshrined in Canadian law, are named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who was murdered in that country. “We need to have a more serious approach when it comes to China. Mr Trudeau has always mishandled this file,” the Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole said. Justin Trudeau was not asked to react to the China factor but was instead quizzed on why current American President Joe Biden had virtually ignored Ottawa since assuming office, a charge the PM denied.Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchett accused the Trudeau government of creating a situation where Canada’s “credibility has deteriorated” internationally.Much of the debate, held in the Canadian city of Gatineau in Quebec, focused upon domestic issues including the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory vaccinations, Indigenous issues, childcare and Quebec-focused themes.The debate was held as the ruling Liberal Party led by Justin Trudeau continues to trail the opposition Conservatives ahead of the Federal elections. The second official debate, in English, will be held on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-debate-rivals-target-justin-trudeau-over-afghanistan-policy-101631164125025.html

The Rodong Sinmun newspaper published a photo of Kim, wearing a cream suit, waving from a balcony toward the assembled troops and spectators. The reports didn't say if Kim made a speech during the event.North Korea often celebrates major state anniversaries by displaying thousands of goose-stepping troops and its most advanced military hardware in parades at Kim Il Sung Square. State television hasn't broadcast footage of the parade as of Thursday morning and it wasn't immediately clear what kinds of weapons systems were displayed. Previous night time parades were not aired live but a taped broadcast was shown on state TV hours later.KCNA's report came hours after South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was closely monitoring the North after detecting signs of a military parade.Amid a stalemate in diplomacy with the U.S., Kim and his powerful sister have emphasized North Korea will boost its nuclear deterrent and preemptive strike capabilities while demanding that Washington abandon its “hostile” policies — a reference to the US maintaining sanctions and refusing to accept North Korea as a nuclear power.The military parade likely is a measured attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the Trump presidency.But experts say Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade in rule, with North Korea maintaining a border lockdown indefinitely to keep out the coronavirus and with no prospect in sight to end international sanctions.Last month, Kim Yo Jong berated the United States and South Korea for continuing their combined military exercises, which she said were the “most vivid expression of the U.S. hostile policy.”She and another senior North Korean official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would leave the allies facing a “security crisis.”The allies say the drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-parades-goose-stepping-troops-military-hardware-to-mark-nation-s-73rd-anniversary-101631162916867.html

It has independently supplied millions of doses of vaccines from its stockpile to countries around the world either directly or through the WHO-led Covax programme.“We are still planning the president’s schedule around UN General Assembly High Level week, but it is safe to assume we are actively looking at Covid-19 and public-health-centered options,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. “I would anticipate there will be an opportunity for the president to engage with his counterparts on this issue during the UNGA week.”The Joe Biden administration is trying to get a grip on the response to the pandemic, which has come unstuck in recent weeks belying the president’s key election promise of doing a better job of it than his predecessor. New infections and hospitalisation cases are surging, due mostly to the highly contagious Delta variant and people who have refused to be vaccinated because of political reasons or over suspicions about the efficacy of vaccines and their long-term side-effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-call-for-global-summit-on-covid-19-around-narendra-modi-visit-101631162685120.html

This was the largest such protest since the militants assumed power, and experts believe the brutal crackdown was about sending a message about how things will be under the new regime.Also Read | Afghan woman stands face to face against Taliban armed man, image called ‘iconic’“They [the Taliban] hit with whips and they tell us to go to our homes and recognise and accept the Emirate,” a woman present at Wednesday's protest was quoted as saying in the video and reported by CNN. “Why should we accept the Emirate while no inclusion or rights have been given to us?”Multiple journalists covering the protests were also reported to have been assaulted in a similar manner.Marcus Yam, a journalist with the Los Angeles Times covering the protest, also confirmed that Taliban fighters were ready to strike protesters with whips. He said on Twitter: “While some tried to put their hands on me, there was one fighter that kept interfering and at one point muttered ‘foreigner’. There were others standing around with their whips ready.”They tried yanking my cameras off me, pushed me around, and out their hands on my lens. They asked me to delete photos and footage, I said no. I tried to make an audio recording of the encounter and they wanted to confiscate my phone. I said no.While some tried to put their hands on me, there was one fighter that kept interfering and at one point muttered “foreigner.” There were others standing around with their whips ready.Notably, the Taliban had promised to put on a more “moderate” face this time, with the new rulers vowing to respect women's rights in accordance with Islamic law. However, with the announcement of a new hardline regime, reports suggest that the Taliban have gone back to their usual ways.Also Read | To escape Taliban, here is what Afghan women were forced into doingA video shared by Afghan journalist Zahra Rahimi, a correspondent for Tolo News, on Twitter also showed a Taliban fighter ferociously cracking a whip against a woman present at the protest. The clip was shared multiple times on the social media platform by public personalities, who pointed out that the new Taliban regime was just as “barbaric” as the previous one and that all the promises of a ‘moderate’ regime were just a sham.This is Taliban 2.0, as barbaric as 1.0. Watch a Talib wrap a whip around his hand + unleash it on young Afghan women. This is on you @suhailshaheen1 + your govts @Amb_AlThani @HMuratMercan @asadmk17 @ChinaEmbKabul for propping up terrorists. The world is with you @ZahraSRahimi💓 https://t.co/sm85b34oecNotably, the United Nations warned on Wednesday that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the subsequent position of the new rulers on women's rights have generated an “incredible fear” across the country. “The lack of clarity of the Taliban's position on women's rights has generated incredible fear,” said Alison Davidian, a senior UN official. “And this fear is palpable across the country.”Pointing out that there were daily reports of the Taliban imposing restrictions on the rights of women, she said that the new rule is reminiscent of the previous Taliban regime in the 1990s when the Islamist rulers forbade women from working jobs or receiving education.The UN official said that women are being prevented from leaving their homes without a male relative, and in many other provinces, they are being forced to stop working. Protection centers for women fleeing violence and safe houses for women's rights activists, already at a full capacity, are also being targeted, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-used-whips-against-afghan-women-protesting-new-regime-report-101631155928305.html

Canada-based WestJet and United Airlines in the US have said employees who fail to get themselves vaccinated will face termination of employment.WestJet has asked all employees to get their vaccination status attested by September 24, or get fully vaccinated by October 30. The Onex Corp-owned airline said a full vaccination status would be mandatory for all future employees hired by the airline."As part of its vaccine mandate, the airline will not provide testing as an alternative to vaccination," the company said in a statement.United, on the other hand, has set September 27 as the deadline for its employees to get vaccinated. However, those whose bids for exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs are denied will get five more weeks to get vaccinated, the airline said.After that, it added, they will face termination or unpaid leave.United said requests for medical exemptions will be judged by medical staffers including nurses, while requests for waivers based on religious beliefs will be handled by personnel-office employees.Workers who routinely come in contact with passengers, such as flight attendants, gate agents and pilots, and whose exemptions are approved will face indefinite unpaid leave starting October 2. They won't be allowed back on the job until the pandemic “meaningfully recedes,” according to one of the memos circulated by the Chicago-based company.United has taken the strongest pro-vaccination stance among US airlines. Delta Air Lines says it will levy a $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated employees who are covered by the company’s health plan. Others, including American Airlines, say they will cut off paid leave for unvaccinated workers who contract Covid-19.According to US government data, new infections are at their highest level since March and likely to rise into the fall as more people are hospitalised.The resurgence in Covid-19 cases has been spurred by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, prompting many companies to come out with mask mandates and change their vaccination policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-employees-to-face-unpaid-leave-or-termination-warn-2-airlines-101631157293670.html

These 18 officers from the Air Force Academy, the Military Academy, and the Naval Academy were considered to be allies of Trump, all of who had been named to the US military academy boards in the final months of the Republican president's term in office. The White House, however, insists that the move is not political and was instead taken on the basis of the ‘qualifications’ of the aforementioned personnel.Among those Biden removed are high-profile Trump advisors — like former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway (Air Force Academy) and former press secretary Sean Spicer (Naval Academy) — both of who were appointed just before the former president left office. Other officials include former national security adviser H R McMaster on the West Point board (US Military Academy), Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought (Naval Academy), and former White House liaison to the Justice Department Heidi Stirrup.These officials received a letter on Wednesday from Cathy Russell, director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, calling on them to resign by close of business on Wednesday or they would be terminated.White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the development and told reporters that the officials were forced out of their posts based on President Biden's “qualification requirements”.“I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards,” Psaki said. “But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you are aligned with the values of this administration.”Meanwhile, several of those officials who were ousted from their posts pushed back against the decision.Conway, the former advisor to the president, said that it is in fact Biden who should resign. She went on in a statement to call it a “disappointing but understandable” effort to distract from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, a rise in Covid-19 cases, and a ‘disappointing’ August jobs report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-ousts-trump-appointed-officials-from-military-academy-advisory-boards-101631152974606.html

Another former western intelligence official, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity, said Jawad directed suicide networks and was “tight with Pakistan’s security establishment”.Rahmatullah Nabil, who served as head of Afghanistan’s spy agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), had in 2018 blamed Jawad, also known as Maulvi Zabiullah, of supervising the Al-Hamza Martyrdom Brigade, a training centre for suicide bombers. Nabil had said at the time that the suicide attacker who killed Abdul Raziq Achakzai, a police chief, was trained by the Al-Hamza outfit.Jawad was largely based in Peshawar at the time and had planned the killing of Raziq with Mullah Shireen, a member of the Taliban’s Quetta council, named after the Pakistani city where it is based.The Long War Journal, a website that tracks jihadi groups, had reported as far back as 2013 that Jawad was also a senior commander in the dreaded Haqqani Network and jointly led what was referred to as the “Kabul Attack Network” with another Taliban commander named Dawood, who was the shadow governor for Kabul.“The Kabul Attack Network operates in the capital and in the surrounding provinces of Wardak, Logar, Nangarhar, Laghman, Kapisa, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. It has executed numerous high-profile attacks in the capital over the years,” the Long War Journal had reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-new-deputy-intel-chief-ran-suicide-attack-network-101631151576526.html

Just like last year’s event, the current edition, too, will take place virtually due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, making it the second straight BRICS meeting to be held via videoconferencing.Also Read | Taliban takeover in Afghanistan to figure at BRICS meet chaired by PM ModiThe theme for this year’s programme is “BRICS@15: Intra BRICS Cooperation for Continuity, Consolidation and Consensus.” India’s chairmanship of this year’s summit coincides with the 15th anniversary of the grouping which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China. South Africa became a member in 2010.This year's summit comes amid the prevailing situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized power last month. The situation in the war-torn nation is, therefore, likely to be among key global and regional issues which are taken up for discussion. “Leaders are likely to underscore the priority of fighting terrorism, including preventing attempts by terror groups to use Afghanistan as sanctuary to carry out attacks against other countries. The participating countries are also likely to emphasise the need to address the humanitarian situation and to uphold human rights, including those of women, children and minorities,” officials told news agency ANI.India has highlighted four priority areas for its presidency of BRICS: reform of the multilateral system, counter-terrorism cooperation, using digital and technological tools to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and enhancing people-to-people exchanges. “In addition to these areas, the leaders will exchange views on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global and regional issues,” the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.Also Read | BRICS Countries adopt counter-terrorism action plan ahead of summitAt the summit, PM Modi will be joined by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Russian president Vladimir Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-to-chair-13th-brics-meet-today-101631146560669.html

The move comes days after the regime said it won't tolerate any resistance to their rule. The decision will raise eyebrows around the world, as several countries have denounced the seizure of power by Taliban.Also Read| Any international legitimacy will have to be earned, US warns TalibanIn their latest diktat, the Taliban said permission needs to be taken from the ministry of justice before any protest is organised, according to local publication Pajhwok News. They said that purpose, slogans, place, time and all 'other' details of the protest need to be shared with the government authorities, Pajhwok News further reported.Details of the protest also need to be shared with the security agencies 24 hours before it is organised.The developments came amid an increase in the protests against the Taliban in the country.Watch: How CIA's last base in Kabul looks like nowHundreds of Afghans took to the streets on Tuesday to protest against Pakistan's alleged role in the fall of elected government in Afghanistan. Slogans were raised against Pakistani's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).On Wednesday, residents of Faizabad took to the streets to support the resistance in their fight against the Taliban.On September 7, a group of women also held a protest in Balkh province calling to preserve the achievements of the past 20 years and demanding women's representation in the future government in Afghanistan.Also Read | UN warns of ‘incredible fear’ among Afghan women as Taliban rule returnsSimilar protests were also held in Kabul, Parwan and Badakhshan province.The Taliban have been issuing diktats after returning to power in Afghanistan and some of these are a reminder of their regressive rule 20 years ago. Last week, a Taliban spokesperson said that women should not get education without a veil (burqa). The group later released a list of guidelines to be followed by educational institutions.Though the Taliban have tried to project a moderate image in front of the world, such announcements show little regard for the promise. And experts say that the all-male cabinet of hardliners that was announced on Tuesday proves that it is “old Taliban in a new bottle”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-diktat-no-protest-without-permission-share-details-with-ministry-101631145884183.html
