24-09-2021||World||Quad to announce fellowships, initiatives on semiconductors||A working group on space, a joint mechanism on semiconductors and a fellowship for master’s and doctoral studies in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields are among some initiatives that the Quad leader are expected to announce when they meet on Friday (Sept 24) for their first in-person summit.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will join their host President Joe Biden at the White House for the in-person summit which starts later in the day and is expected to last two hours.The four leaders will also receive and review updates on initiatives they had launched at their virtual summit in March, which included a commitment to make 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines for distribution in the Indo-Pacific region by 2022, and working groups on climate, cybersecurity and emerging technologies.Previewing the meeting for reporters, senior Biden administration officials made clear once again the informal nature of the group. “The Quad is an unofficial gathering, although we have a number of working groups and we are deepening cooperation on a very daily basis,” one of the officials said, adding, “It is also the case that it is not a regional security organisation.”The official also drew a distinction between the Quad and the recently launched trilateral alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States called AUKUS. They are two “completely separate initiatives” that have nothing to do with one another, even though there are overlaps.“The Quad is a discussion and engagement effort around a number of practical matters, like - we’ve discussed Covid and issues associated with climate change,” the official said, adding, “There is not a military dimension to it or security dimension to it. And it is an informal grouping.”There has been an outpouring of commentary from experts who have argued that the Quad’s security and defence related role stands diminished by the AUKUS.But others, including Indian officials, believe the Quad was never intended as a military alliance even though there had been some talk of it during former president Donald Trump’s term - of formalising the group with the reference point being Nato, a purely military alliance of 30 countries.The Quad will remain focused on non-security related challenges in the Indo-Pacific, with the new initiatives previewed by the US officials.They will announce the launch of working groups on space, the officials said but did not share any details.They were far more forthcoming about the fellowships. Sponsored by private donors, 25 students from each of the four countries will be selected to pursue master’s and post-doctoral degrees in STEM fields at leading US universities every year.The four countries will also announce a supply chain initiative on semiconductors. It will be a detailed joint initiative to map overall capacity; identify respective vulnerabilities; and to take critical steps to bolster supply chain security, particularly for semiconductors and all their vital components, one of the officials said.They will also launch a 5G deployment and diversification effort. “And this is to support the critical role of Quad governments in fostering and promoting a diverse, resilient, secure telecommunications ecosystem,” it was said.Other announcements will an effort on Open RAN (interoperability on wireless networks) development and adoption, which will be a part of the 5G plan. And the other will be on sharing information on illegal fishing and issues associated with maritime domain awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-to-announce-fellowships-initiatives-on-semiconductors-101632494767929.html
24-09-2021||World||'I miss you very much…': Young Taliban are singing and dancing in Afghanistan||When the Taliban first came to power in 1996, they imposed a harsh version of Sharia law and banned all sorts of avenues of entertainment in Afghanistan as they found it un-Islamic. The return of the Sunni Pashtun militants at the helm of power has again triggered the fear of human rights violation, especially against women and girls.While the Taliban have maintained that women could soon return to workplaces, the signs remain grim. The newly announced Cabinet has no women members and the ethnic minority communities have not been given any significant post in the government. But there is a palpable change in the entertainment scene, according to a report by news agency AFP.Seven young Taliban, who probably didn’t witness the cultural onslaught two decades ago, were seen singing and dancing while chanting the lyrics of a patriotic Afghan song: "Send me a hello from Kabul... I miss you very much", reported AFP.One evening, they were reportedly clapping their hands and moving side by side in traditional Afghan style on the bank of Arghandab river, which was the side of bloody clashes between the insurgents and government forces just months ago.Singing and dancing were strictly forbidden during their previous rule from 1996-2001. But the younger Taliban listen to music as well, even if most of it is religious, according to AFP. The report suggests that the song they were singing celebrates national unity in a country marred by ethnic division."This song belongs to us, it belongs to our country," AFP quoted Hafiz Mudasir, a young Taliban dancer.While the world closely monitors the actions of the Taliban for their assurance of respecting human rights, the AFP report shows how the last two decades have brought a gradual change in the group’s acceptance of music and dance.(With inputs from agency)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-miss-you-very-much-young-taliban-are-singing-and-dancing-in-afghanistan-101632492640680.html
24-09-2021||World||Taliban govt remains non-inclusive and all-male after Sept 21 expansion||The Taliban recently announced a Cabinet expansion to showcase to the world that the Sunni Pashtun militants have opted for an inclusive government in the wake of repeated demand from the international community. While announcing the expansion, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had claimed that the new Cabinet includes members of ethnic minorities such as Hazaras and Tajiks. But the reality is different.These ethnic minority communities have not been given any significant post and all inductions are unknown faces, with Haqqani and Baradar factions getting the major share of power. The Islamist fundamentalists have not included a single woman in the Cabinet, which they had already indicated, but the Cabinet remains monopolistic even in terms of ethnic minorities. Formers presidents of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, have not been given any role in the new government.New ministers like Qalandar Ibad, Abdul Bari Omar, Mohammad Hassan Ghiasi, Haji Gul Mohammad, Arsala Kharoti Lutfullah Khairkhwa belong to the Haqqani Network, which merged into the Taliban in 2016. Qalandar Ibad is their new health minister while all others are deputy ministers in various departments.On the other hand, Mullah Mohammad Ibrahim, the new deputy minister of interior security, is a Pashtun from the Baradar faction. The deputy minister of defence Mullah Abdul Qayyum Zakir is also Pashtun and said to be a close aide of Mulla Yaqoob, the minister of defence in the Taliban set up. Nazar Mohammad Muttamin, who has been appointed as acting president of Afghanistan’s National Olympic Committee is again a Pashtun from Kandahar and belong to the Baradar faction.Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Omar, deputy minister of power and energy; Mohammad Faqir, acting head of central statistics office; and Gul Zarin Kochi, second deputy minister of border affairs also belong to the Baradar faction.The 50-member Cabinet includes just one representative from the Hazara community, three from Tajiks, and one from Uzbeks. Tajiks like Haji Ghulam Ghaus has been appointed as deputy minister of disaster management, while Haji Nooruddin Azizi, a resident of Panjshir Province has been appointed as acting minister of commerce. Haji Mohammad Bashir, another Tajik, has been appointed as the deputy minister of commerce. Haji Mohammad Azim Sultanzada is the only Uzbek in the new set-up.Najibullah, the director of atomic energy; Mawlawi Abdul Rahman Rashed, minister of agriculture; Molavi Sad Razam, deputy minister of agriculture; and Mawlawi Ataullah Omari, deputy minister of agriculture, are also from the Taliban factions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-govt-remains-non-inclusive-and-all-male-after-sept-21-expansion-101632487611749.html

This will be the first-ever in-person Quad summit at the White House and assumes significance in the backdrop of China criticising the "exclusive closed cliques". “The leaders are hopeful for an opportunity in an intimate setting to sit down and talk about issues of mutual interest and concern. They'll have discussions on critical issues that are confronting the Indo Pacific; issues associated with climate change, with matters relating to Covid. They will also talk about how to advance infrastructure,” a senior administration official told PTI.Also Read: China sniggers at Quad ahead of summit in WashingtonA White House official underscored the unofficial nature of the Quad gathering and said that it is not a regional security organisation but as the leaders want to focus on the challenges confronting the Indo-Pacific region, the issues will be addressed.   “Although we have a number of working groups, and we are deepening cooperation on a very daily basis, it is also the case that it is not a regional security organisation. We are going to address particular issues associated with the challenges confronting the Indo Pacific in the current environment,” the official said. “President Biden believes that too often these kinds of discussions are scripted and he really wants to be able to sit down and have a deeper conversation with all leaders in an environment where they can really share perspectives on what's important to each of them as they go forward,” the official said.“It also indicates that the Biden administration understands that the challenges of the 21st century will largely play out in the Indo-Pacific and we are doubling down on our efforts. This quad is part of a larger fabric of engagement that you will see,” the official added.India, Australia agree on low emissions tech partnershipAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he and his Indian counterpart and "dear friend" Narendra Modi have agreed on some important new initiatives, including low emissions technology partnership and ultra-low-cost solar programme, which will help in further deepening the economic ties between the two countries.Space, 5G, Quad fellowship - What Quad leaders may announce“We're going to announce a 5G deployment and diversification effort.

24-09-2021||World||'Illegal': Chinese central bank on crypto transactions||China's central bank on Friday said all financial transactions involving cryptocurrencies are illegal, sounding the death knell for the digital trade in China after a crackdown on the volatile currencies.The global values of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin have massively fluctuated over the past year partly due to Chinese regulations, which have sought to prevent speculation and money laundering."Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities," the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in an online statement Friday, adding that offenders would be "investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law."The notice bans all related financial activities involving cryptocurrencies, such as trading crypto, selling tokens, transactions involving virtual currency derivatives and "illegal fundraising".Bitcoin fell as much as 5.5 percent following the announcement, hitting $42,232 around 1000 GMT before stabilising. Around 1030 GMT it was trading down 5.0 percent at $42,464.The central bank said that in recent years trading of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies had become "widespread, disrupting economic and financial order, giving rise to money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal and criminal activities."This was "seriously endangering the safety of people's assets," the PBOC said.While crypto creation and trading have been illegal in China since 2019, further crackdowns this year by Beijing warned banks to halt related transactions and closed much of the country's vast network of bitcoin miners.Friday's statement by the central bank sent the strongest yet signal that China is closed to crypto.ControlBitcoin, the world's largest digital currency, and other cryptos cannot be traced by a country's central bank, making them difficult to regulate.Analysts say China fears the proliferation of illicit investments and fundraising from cryptocurrency in the world's second biggest economy, which also has strict rules around the outflow of capital.The crypto crackdown also opens the gates for China to introduce its own digital currency, already in the pipeline, allowing the central government to monitor transactions.In June, Chinese officials said more than 1,000 people had been arrested for using the profits from crime to buy cryptocurrencies.Several key Chinese provinces banned the operation of cryptocurrency mines since the start of this year, with one region accounting for eight percent of the computing power needed to run the global blockchain -- a set of online ledgers to record bitcoin transactions.Bitcoin values tumbled in May on the back of a warning by Beijing to investors against speculative trading in cryptocurrencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-chinese-central-bank-on-crypto-transactions-101632485805780.html
24-09-2021||World||China blames India for Galwan Valley clash||China on Friday blamed India for the Galwan Valley clash in June last year in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed, saying New Delhi had violated all border-related agreements and encroached on Chinese territory.India and China have been locked in a border row for 16 months, a row that witnessed the deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods and clubs covered with barbed wires.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley clash, the first fatalities on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 1975.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to fully resolve the tension, the worst in decades.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.China, however, has continued to blame India.Responding to a question on the reorganisation of the Indian military into theatre commands and its impact on the management of the Sino-India border, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: “All the agreements and treaties between China and India on upholding the peace and stability in the area of the LAC have played an important role in upholding stability in the border areas.”“In the last year, Galwan Valley incident took place because India violated all the signed agreements and treaties and encroached upon Chinese territory, illegally crossed the line (LAC). We hope India will abide by all the signed agreements and uphold peace stability in the border region with concrete actions,” Zhao Lijian said.In September, 2020, China had said that it abides by the LAC, the notional Sino-India boundary, as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in a letter dated November 7, 1959 - an offer New Delhi has consistently rejected since it was first made 61 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-india-for-galwan-valley-clash-101632485946796.html
24-09-2021||World||China sniggers at Quad ahead of summit in Washington||The four-member Quad, an “exclusive, closed” group will find no support, China said on Friday ahead of the first in-person summit of the bloc’s leaders in Washington to be attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Besides Narendra Modi, the high-profile summit will be attended by Prime Ministers Scott Morrison (Australia) and Yoshihide Suga (Japan) and US President Joe Biden.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry sniggered at the summit of the Quad, which is often seen as a counter to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.“China always believes that any regional cooperation mechanism should not target a third party or harm its interests. Seeking exclusive closed cliques against a third country runs against the trend of the times and aspirations of countries in the region,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Friday. “It (the Quad) will find no support.”China, Zhao Lijian said, is a builder of world peace, contributor of global development and upholder of world order.“The growth of China means the growth for peace and stability in the world and China’s contribution to peace and stability and development in the Asia-Pacific is there for all to see,” Zhao Lijian said. “Relevant countries should do more that is conducive to solidarity and cooperation with countries in the region.”China had reacted strongly to an online meeting of the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) leaders in March, saying that the “will end up nowhere” if it does not abandon its ideological bias and cold war mentality, underscoring its opposition to the bloc.The March summit attended by all four leaders via video link was closely monitored and critiqued by Beijing.The consensus in Beijing is that the four countries came together to counter China’s increasing influence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.In November 2017, New Delhi, Tokyo, Washington, and Canberra gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a coordinated strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific maritime region free of any influence.In 2018, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had described the Quad as “...seafoam in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”.By 2020, Wang Yi came around to acknowledging that the Quad had become a “security threat” and a so-called Indo-Pacific “New Nato”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sniggers-at-quad-ahead-of-summit-in-washington-101632483726769.html

Reports said that he has been sent to the UNGA to 'raise awareness' about what is happening in Jammu and Kashmir. But Imran Khan's 'Kashmir' man has already gone viral on social media for a vlog that he shot from the street of Manhattan.Shooting the video of women roaming around the street, Afridi, clad in a casual t-shirt, said women in Pakistan have a far better condition than those countries who preach to the world. Accompanied by a few men, Afridi is seen taking a stroll and saying, "Whatever the ethnicity is --Baloch, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashtun, Kashmiri-- we give respect to women. See here, these are America's daughters. Recognise the values that we have. This is not a political slogan. This is the reality. See the condition of those who give us lectures, who tell us 'I am the king'". Video of #Pakistan-i Parliamentarian Shehryar Afridi taking a weekend stroll in Times Square, New York, while bashing American Women & Values.He is in US as part of Pakistan’s delegation to #UNGA: pic.twitter.com/gyjWMvGHEZThe video surfaced a few days ago and has now gone viral with several social media users pointing out the condition of women in Pakistan."Once again PM Imran Khan is going to address UNGA as an ambassador of Kashmir.

The Pakistan Embassy in Washington said that it was a routine screening as Afridi is a first-time visitor. “As noted by the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, as a first-time visitor, Mr Afridi had secondary screening briefly and was cleared in routine without any guarantees being sought or given by anyone from the Embassy or the Consulate,” a statement from the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/see-america-s-daughters-imran-khan-s-un-leader-s-deriding-video-goes-viral-101632480972124.html

Pakistan border officials have refused to let anyone move into its part of the land citing security issues even as Afghans cry and beg for a chance to enter the country for some life-saving treatment or a reunion with a loved one.Also read | UN refugee agency reveals how many Afghans recorded for registration in India since Aug 1According to an article in the New York Post, even cross-border trade has remained shut for days. The border crossing connects Spin Boldak in Kandahar province with Pakistan’s Chaman and Quetta.Earlier this month, at least one person died during a stampede when Pakistan temporarily closed the Chaman crossing, the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan.However, those patrolling the area on the Afghan side claimed several people have lost their lives from dehydration and heatstroke, while some met their end, unable to access medical care in Chaman district.Also read | Empires slay, publics pay: The global refugee crisis unfolding in AfghanistanThe article said two more Afghans died near the Mazal gate on Wednesday afternoon, a less frenetic exit to the primary thoroughfare and designated for local families and special cases.While officially, Pakistan has restricted entry at the key international intersection to Pakistani or Kandahar identification cardholders, locals say the gates have been sealed to almost everyone.Trucks were seen stranded for miles with perishable goods rotting and public services, including those in the health sector, have stopped operations.A lot of families have starved for days as they make regular rounds of the fortified checkpoint, only to be turned away.The area has become a "military zone" over the past several days as thousands have been making desperate bids to move across Pakistan ever since the Taliban took over Kabul after the fall of the Ashraf Ghan-led elected government.Taliban officials, who now patrol the overstuffed space, said Pakistan was creating problems and not sticking to its words"We have an understanding with Pakistan to allow Kandahar people to cross into Pakistan. In return, people from Chaman and Quetta can enter Afghanistan using National IDs," Mohammad Sadiq Sabery, authority in charge of the border area in Kandahar, was quoted as saying in the article.The Taliban are calling on Pakistan to open the border at least on urgent humanitarian grounds, but Pakistan has defended its move saying it had by far taken the highest number of Afghan refugees over the two-decade war.According to Islamabad, the country is currently home to some 1.4 million registered refugees and an estimated 2 million more who are undocumented.The United Nations estimates that about 10,000 refugees have come to Pakistan since mid-August, when the Taliban took over the Presidential Palace and secured control of the embattled country.Reports of smugglers exploiting the situation and taking thousands of money from desperate Afghans have also come in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-perish-at-border-town-as-pakistan-refuses-to-let-any-more-refugee-in-101632472390820.html
24-09-2021||World||‘Welcome to hell’: Chinese brand JNBY printed kids’ clothes with alleged anti-India imagery||A top Chinese clothing brand JNBY is facing backlash after one of its clothing lines produced children’s clothes with images of people identified as Indians being shot at and phrases like “welcome to hell” and “let me touch you” embossed on them.The brand JNBY apologised and pulled the clothing line in question after the complaint of a mother went viral on Chinese social media this week.A report in the state-run tabloid Global Times called the prints “inappropriate” and “horrific” but avoided mentioning the anti-India images that were found on clothes made and sold by JNBY.The woman, identified as Mogu Mogu on Chinese social media, wrote that her family bought one of the shirts for her 4-year-old son.She shared photos of a white shirt with the images and remarks in black, the meaning of which she realised only recently as it was bought by her son’s grandparents who don’t speak English.“Welcome to hell. Excuse me? Who are you welcoming? And all these images of purgatory … a child aged four wearing such a shirt. Just the thought of it disturbs me,” she was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP).Soon after her post went viral, another user shared the photo of anti-India imagery. “The whole place is full of Indians. I will take this gun and blow them to pieces,” the SCMP report said.The company has since apologised on the lifestyle sharing app Xiaohongshu. “We apologise for the concern caused to customers caused by the design and will tighten regulation,” the customer service said on the official T-mall store of the brand, the Global Times report said.The company did not explain how inappropriate words and images ended up being printed on clothes.The Hong Kong-listed company, based in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China, describes itself as “the most influential designer brand fashion house in China”.The company says its “universal brand philosophy” is “Just Naturally Be Yourself”.According to Global Times, by the end of last year, the company had 1,931 stores nationwide, and overseas stores in the US and Canada.In the fiscal year ended June 30, JNBY saw sales rise 33.1 percent year-on-year to 4.126 billion yuan ($638.70mn).The angry mother, however, is still fuming.“Between 2018 and 2019, it produced and sold many such clothes. Thousands of children may be wearing them. As far as I know, several mothers protested at its T-mall shop or physical shop last year after buying this one, but the issue was left unsettled,” she said in a follow up post quoted by the SCMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/welcome-to-hell-chinese-brand-printed-kids-clothes-with-anti-india-imagery-101632470225131.html
24-09-2021||World||Kamala Harris slams Pakistan on terror in meeting with Narendra Modi||US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday called upon Pakistan to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil to ensure they do not threaten the security of both the United States and India and underscored the need to closely monitor Islamabad’s support for terrorism.Kamala Harris’s remarks came during her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that lasted over an hour and “reflected warmth and cordiality”. She also accepted Narendra Modi’s invitation to visit India and said she had wanted to “go back”, reminiscing about her earlier visits and the time she spent there.The meeting with Kamala Harris was politically important for the Indian prime minister because Kamala Harris, a leading progressive in the Democratic party, had been severely critical of the Modi government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 guaranteeing special status of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Act that speeds up Indian citizenship for Hindus seeking refuge in India from repressive regimes. Other progressives who had been critical of these measures were Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. Additionally, the vice-president’s niece Meena Harris brought the Modi government further grief by endorsing celebrities who came out in support of farmers protesting a legislation that they feared would strip them of government protection. Kamala Harris did not bring up any of these issues at the talks, according to all available indications.SHARED PRIORITIESKamala Harris and Narendra Modi had made initial remarks before their bilateral meeting, in which they had reiterated the importance of the relationship between the two countries and had stressed shared concerns and priorities such as climate change and Covid-19 and the need to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two leaders had a short one-on-one interaction without aides and officials, before starting the bilateral, during which time Vice-President Kamala Harris, whose late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was born and raised in India, reminisced about her visits to India and the time she spent with her grandfather, said people familiar with the conversation. She expressed the desire to “go back”, it was said. She has accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to her and first gentleman Douglas Emhoff to visit India, but there was no word on the timing.PAKISTAN AND TERRORISMPakistan came up at the bilateral meeting when the two sides were discussing terrorism. “The vice-president, suo moto (on her own, unprompted) referred to Pakistan’s role in that regard,” Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters at a news briefing.The vice-president further said that there were terror groups that were working there. “She asked Pakistan to take action so that these groups do not impact on our security and that of India,” the foreign secretary said further, adding, “She agreed with the prime minister’s briefing on the fact of cross-border terrorism, and the fact that India had been a victim of terrorism for several decades now; and on the need to rein in and closely monitor Pakistan’s support for such terrorist groups.”Kamala Harris’s ringing rebuke of Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism came shortly after another senior member of the Biden administration, secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed US appreciation of Pakistan’s role in continuing diplomatic engagement over Afghanistan and help in evacuating people, to his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in New York.The United States appreciates “the work that Pakistan has done to facilitate the departure of American citizens who wish to leave as well as others”, Antony Blinken said ahead of their meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He added, “but a lot to talk about there as well as our own bilateral relationship, including the economic relationship between our countries and working in the region as a whole”.US-PAKISTAN TIESUS-Pakistan ties have been extremely troubled in recent years and have not shown any sign of recovering despite Islamabad’s help in ending the war in Afghanistan, and the evacuation of Americans there. US President Joe Biden, for instance, has still not spoken to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.INDIAN PM MEETS AUSTRALIAN, JAPANESE COUNTERPARTSThe bilateral with the Indian-descent US vice-president was among three the prime minister held on his first day of this US visit. The others were with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga, key Indo-Pacific partners. These were Modi’s first in-person meetings with these leaders and they will all join US President Joe Biden on Friday for the first in-person summit of the Quad.The meeting with Morrison started early - because the Australian leader arrived way early - and lasted longer than scheduled, which, both Indian and Australian officials said, was a “good thing”. Briefing reporters at the end of the day, foreign secretary Shringla said, “They discussed a broad range of issues, which covered bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest. They noted with satisfaction the high level engagement between the two countries.”This was their first in-person meeting. Scott Morrison was scheduled to visit India in January 2020 but cancelled in view of devastating forest fires and then cancelled his March visit the same year because of Covid-19.“Outstanding,” Morrison said when asked about the meeting when he was leaving.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with his Japanese counterpart went off extremely well also, helped in no small measure by the fact they are staying in the same hotel, although a few floors apart. They are staying at Willard Hotel, just across the street from the White House, whose lobby now defines the practice of lobbying - people intending to meet and influence White House officials would typically hang out in Willard’s lobby.“They discussed a broad range of issues, which covered bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest,” Shringla said of the Narendra Modi’s bilateral with Yoshihide Suga. “They noted with satisfaction the high level engagement between the two countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-slams-pakistan-on-terror-in-meeting-with-narendra-modi-101632461344609.html

In children, the lower dose triggered higher antibody levels than the dosage approved for use in adults in China, according to the peer-reviewed finding supplementary-data from a mid-stage trial.The trial recruited 150 children and around 300 adults.The results also showed that children given one lower dose had a stronger antibody response than adults who were given a booster shot 56 days after the first dose.But the antibody readings did not show to what extent the vaccine can offer protection against Covid-19, researchers from a Chinese disease control agency, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutes cautioned in a paper.CanSinoBIO's vaccine has not yet got the greenlight for children. China has approved two vaccines, developed by Sinovac and Sinopharm, for use in children from the age of three but vaccinations have yet to begin for those under 12.The paper said the booster shot for CanSinoBIO's vaccine improved antibody responses in participants of different age groups, especially for older adults.But cellular responses, another important part of human immune system, were not boosted by the second shot and researchers said a wider interval than 56 days should be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cansinobios-covid-19-vaccine-tested-at-lower-dosage-safe-for-children-aged-6-17-report-101632458827673.html
24-09-2021||World||Pakistan remains a problem for US and China for Japan and Australia||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is gearing up for the key bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden and the Quad summit after excellent conversations on Pakistan with Vice President Kamala Harris and on Chinese belligerence with Japanese and Australian PM. Narendra Modi will be the first PM of India in four decades to engage with three different US presidents in person as a prime minister. The PM Modi-Biden one hour meeting is at 11am EST in the White House while the Quad Summit will be held for two hours from 2 to 4pm.According to diplomats based in Washington and New Delhi, Pakistan based terror groups was raised by VP Harris during her “good” conversation with PM Modi with the former stating that theUS will take up this issue with Islamabad so that the security of both US and India are not threatened by these global terror groups.However, the Indian side detected that the US was in a bit of quandary over Pakistan. Just as it was quite evident to them that Pakistan was harbouring terror groups with global reach, it was equally clear that theUS was unclear about the role that Pakistan could play in Afghanistan as it has also harboured all the Taliban leaders in the past.While Pakistan dominated the conversation with VP Harris, China was the flavour of PM Modi’s bilateral meetings with PM Yoshihide Suga and PM Scott Morrison. Prime Minister Suga showed Japanese interest in the production linked incentive scheme announced by PM Modi and was keen on taking part in manufacturing in India. This move also dovetails into the Quad’s global resilient supply chains with India being a key hub of manufacturing. PM Modi and PM Suga shared notes on Indo-Pacific with both countries’ victims of PLA aggression in East Ladakh and Senkaku Islands respectively.Although the Australian trade minister is arriving in India to firm up bilateral ties, PM Modi’s conversation with PM Morrison was more China-centric and security related.Just as Australia is augmenting its naval capabilities through the AUKUS pact by taking an orbital jump to nuclear powered conventionally armed submarines, India is reforming its Navy with new and potent platforms in all three dimensions. India is now operating Predator drones for maritime awareness, P-8I and MH-60 R multi-mission platforms and will launch Visakhapatnam class of guided-missile destroyers in November. India has also built a new Kalvari class of diesel-electric submarines and is now looking at nuclear power conventionally armed submarines to deter belligerent players in Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-a-problem-for-us-and-china-for-japan-and-australia-101632457725131.html
24-09-2021||World||CIA fires its Vienna chief over handling of ‘Havana syndrome’ cases: Report||The CIA removed its Vienna, Austria station chief recently amid criticism the person did not take seriously a surge in mysterious "Havana syndrome" cases, the Washington Post reported Thursday. Dozens of cases affecting embassy staff and Central Intelligence Agency officers and family members have been reported in Vienna recently, but the unnamed station chief expressed skepticism and showed insensitivity, the Post said, citing intelligence sources.A CIA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the report but said the agency takes seriously scores of possible incidents of the mysterious ailment in US diplomatic missions around the world.The cause and source remain enigmatic, CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said last week."Have we gotten closer? I think the answer is yes -- but not close enough to make the analytic judgment that people are waiting for," he said.The US government, including the CIA and Pentagon, has ramped up staff to investigate and provide treatment for the cases.Dubbed "Havana syndrome" because reports of the condition first showed up in the Cuban capital, the ailment is marked by bloody noses, headaches, vision problems, and other symptoms that resemble concussions.Some people experiencing it have reported hearing focused, high-pitched or sharp sounds that left them nauseated.The incidents are little understood and have sparked theories that they were caused by a weapon that used focused microwaves, ultrasound, poison, or are even a reaction to crickets.But for several years, senior government officials dismissed the complaints, judging them to be the symptoms of people under stress or reacting with hysteria to unknown stimuli.The administration of Joe Biden has geared up the investigation into what has been renamed anomalous health incidents, or AHI.If the cases are caused by something like a directed energy attack, US officials suspect Russia could be behind it.The Post called Vienna, where the United States has a large embassy and intelligence collection operation, a "hotbed" of AHI incidents, with dozens of people reporting unexplained symptoms.The issue has US officials around the world jittery. In August Vice President Kamala Harris delayed by several hours a visit to Vietnam after the US embassy there reported a possible case involving "acoustic incidents."And during a visit to India by CIA Director William Burns in early September, an official in his retinue reported symptoms and sought medical assistance, according to the Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-fires-its-vienna-chief-over-handling-of-havana-syndrome-cases-report-101632452765847.html
24-09-2021||World||France still upset with US over submarine snub. Patching up will take time||Top diplomats of France and the United States said on Thursday that patching up bilateral ties will take some time yet, as French discontent still sizzles over the trilateral AUKUS nuclear submarine deal that tore up one of its contracts with Australia. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, a fluent French speaker who spent a part of his childhood in Paris, appeared remorseful as he spoke to reporters during the day, and said that he tried making amends with the French side on Washington's part. Later, a French foreign ministry statement confirmed that the process to repair ties have been initiated but resolving the matter completely will take time and further remedial actions.Also Read | ‘Give me a break’, says Boris Johnson as France upset over submarine dealThe development comes days after US president Joe Biden held a phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and discussed the crisis between the two countries – a “friendly” conversation which had the two leaders, according to the White House, vowing to launch “in-depth consultations... for ensuring confidence” and to meet in Europe at the end of October.For context, France has been fuming ever since the US and the United Kingdom made the surprise announcement about the deal to build nuclear submarines for Australia – thus scuppering a previous French deal to sell conventional submarines. Paris called the US-Australian plan, which was launched as part of a new Indo-Pacific security group along with Britain, a stab in the back and also pulled its ambassador from Australia.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian earlier accused Australia of back-stabbing and the US of betrayal, calling the move reminiscent of the unilateralist attitude of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.Also Read | Aukus: Which countries have nuclear-powered submarines?However, in what comes as a positive development for both sides, Le Drian met US secretary of state Anthony Blinken on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Thursday, days after he gave the US the cold shoulder. “He recalled that a first step had been taken with the call between the two presidents but underlined that resolving the crisis between our two countries would take time and require actions,” a French foreign ministry statement said.Blinken, in turn, said he would keep up talks with Le Drian, much as Biden agreed to meet late next month with Macron. He also promised to work closely with France in the US strategy toward the Indo-Pacific, seen by the Biden administration as the paramount priority amid the growing assertiveness of China.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-still-upset-with-us-over-submarine-snub-patching-up-will-take-time-101632449392398.html

We have similar values, similar geopolitical interests, and also our coordination and cooperation is continuously increasing”.The prime minister then told Harris they had shared interests and concerns.
