The New Jersey senator also threatened to subpoena Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who he said declined an invitation to testify alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“This rapid collapse laid bare a fundamental fact -- that successive administrations lied to the Congress over the years about the durability of Afghan military and government institutions and we need to understand why,” Menendez said.It was a bipartisan challenge, a day after Blinken testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where Republicans attacked the administration and demanded Blinken’s resignation while Democrats largely blamed former President Donald Trump for the deal his administration cut with the Taliban last year for the U.S. to withdraw.On Tuesday, James Risch of Idaho, the Senate committee’s ranking Republican, called the Biden administration’s handling of Afghanistan a “dismal failure” and “a stain on America’s credibility.”“The Biden administration left Afghanistan in total disarray and singlehandedly created a humanitarian crisis,” Risch said. “The Taliban is now one of the best-armed terrorist organizations on the planet.”Repeatedly questioned about the failure to predict the rapid Taliban advance, Blinken said there was nothing the administration saw that “suggested that this government and security forces would collapse in a matter of days”“We need to look back at all of this,” Blinken said. “We did not see this collapse in a matter of 11 days but it is important that we go back and look at all of this.”Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire criticized the efforts to assign blame, saying “the important thing for us to do now is to figure out how we can work together to address those people who still need to be evacuated from Afghanistan. There are a lot of people to blame, and we all share in it.”Blinken told lawmakers on Monday that the US had given many warnings to Americans that they should leave Afghanistan and is still working to evacuate the 100 or so believed to remain there. He said the U.S. also wants to help all those Afghans to whom the US “has a special commitment.”As the United Nations and other groups warn of a humanitarian catastrophe in the country, Blinken said the US will provide $64 million in new humanitarian aid to Afghanistan that “will not flow through the government” but instead through nongovernmental organisations.The demand by Menendez that Austin appear before his panel is a departure from the usual protocol that the secretary of state testifies to the Foreign Relations committee while the secretary of defense goes before the Armed Services panel. Austin is schedule to testify there on September 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-democrat-joins-republicans-to-criticise-blinken-on-afghanistan-withdrawal-101631641056031.html
14-09-2021||World||US senator moves bill for climate ties with India||Bob Menendez, a Democratic lawmaker who heads the foreign relations committee of the US Senate, introduced a legislation on Monday proposing to create a main forum for cooperation between the United States and India related to clean climate technologies and energy transmission.The forum will be called United States-India Climate and Clean Energy Partnership (CCEP) as proposed by the Prioritizing Clean Energy and Climate Cooperation with India Act moved by Bob Menendez.“By establishing the US-India CCEP, we are laying the groundwork for successful partnerships between not only the US and Indian governments, but also our universities and private sectors,” Bob Menendez said, adding, “I am proud to lead this effort to further strengthen our relationship with India.”The introduction of the bill comes amidst heightened cooperation between India and the United States on climate. US Presidential Envoy on Climate John Kerry is wrapping up a three-day visit to India during which the two countries activated a mechanism to fund India’s transition to clean energy, which was launched by the two sides at the time of the Climate Summit convened by President Joe Biden in April.Climate will figure in the first in-person summit that President Biden is hosting on September 24 here at the White House of the Quad leaders Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga.Bob Menendez’s office said the bill introduced by the senator follows his visit to India in 2019 with a congressional delegation. The senator had met Indian ministers and business leaders to discuss what can the two countries do to address the threat of climate change and deepen cooperation on clean energy production.In addition to “establishing groundbreaking new programmes”, this bill will also serve to bolster the Biden administration’s US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, which aims to elevate bilateral cooperation on strong climate action and support the achievement of India’s ambitious climate targets, said Bob Menendez’s office.Apart from setting up a main forum for cooperation on climate and energy, the legislation proposes to promote ties between universities and government research laboratories on the research, development, and application of clean energy technologies. It aims to promote sharing of intellectual property between private sector entities for renewable energy technology, air conditioning technology, refrigeration systems technology, and other advanced energy technologies. It will encourage US private investment in the Indian clean energy technology market; support technical assistance and expertise on electrical grid and energy efficiency improvements in India and support initiatives to develop new renewable energy generation capacity in India.The statement said the bill also requires the administration to submit a multi-year strategy to congress for implementing the CCEP; it seeks a report on opportunities for states in the countries to cooperate on these issues; and, finally, sets advancing climate risk reduction and resilience capacities as a priority for the US’s diplomatic, security, and development work in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-moves-bill-for-climate-ties-with-india-101631639316631.html

Anti-migrant sentiment has been running high in Turkey as it grapples with economic woes, including high unemployment, that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.“President Erdogan underlined that Turkey does not have the capacity to handle a new migration burden,” said a statement from the presidential communications office.Erdogan added that “no one wants to relive an experience similar to the Syrian refugee wave of 2015,” when hundreds of thousands of people reached Greek islands by boats from the nearby Turkish coast, on their way to seek asylum in more prosperous EU countries.In 2016, Turkey and the EU signed a deal for Ankara to stem the flow of migrants heading toward Europe, in return for visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and substantial EU financial support.Erdogan told the German president that the EU should “rapidly take steps” to ensure that the deal is implemented by re-starting Turkey's stalled membership talks, updating the customs union with Ankara and granting visa-free travel to Turkish citizens, according to the statement.There was no statement on the call from the office of the German president, whose duties are largely ceremonial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-have-capacity-to-handle-new-refugee-influx-turkey-on-afghanistan-crisis-101631636764630.html

Sirajuddin Haqqani, a dreaded terrorist with a bounty of $5 million on his head, has been given the role of the interior minister, while Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, the eldest son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, was named the defence minister, apart of Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister.The reclusive Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada was named the supreme leader with the final say on religious, political and security affairs.Meanwhile, the United States has expressed concern over the “lack of diversity” in the composition of the Taliban-led caretaker government of Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-coordinate-with-countries-pledging-humanitarian-aid-to-afghanistan-taliban-101631627576618.html

He also said that a third dose might extend the protection offered by the vaccine against the disease for longer than the second dose.Meanwhile, England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam too made similar remarks regarding the booster, saying that the third doses would be used to keep the pressure of the National Health Service (NHS) during the winter. “The booster programme will make a very substantial impact on keeping the lid on things Covid wise in terms of hospitalisations and deaths and keeping pressure off the NHS (National Health Service) this winter,” Reuters quoted him as saying.The comments from the experts came even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to brief his government’s strategy for the winter in a media conference later on Tuesday, during which he is expected to warn the public that the fight against the pandemic was not over.“The booster programme will make a very substantial impact on keeping the lid on things COVID wise in terms of hospitalisations and deaths and keeping pressure off the NHS (National Health Service) this winter,” a statement from Johnson’s office said. “Today I will set out a clear plan for the autumn and winter, when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made,” he added.The UK would join France, Germany and the Netherlands among other European nations in administering the booster doses to its citizens.While many western nations, including the US, have made clear their plans for booster doses, several experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) including the body’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus have expressed their concerns over vaccine distribution.The WHO chief has even sought a moratorium on boosters globally at least until the end of this year for poor nations to immunise their population. Supporting the WHO’s concerns, a report published in the medical journal Lancet, co-authored by WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said that a booster dose was not needed for fully vaccinated individuals as they continue to be protected against hospitalisation and death by the vaccines.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-provide-covid-19-boosters-for-vulnerable-people-above-50-pm-johnson-to-set-out-plan-for-winter-101631622613049.html
14-09-2021||World||Covid affected everyone, but not equally: Melinda Gates||On the occasion of Gates Foundation’s fifth annual Goalkeepers Report launch on Tuesday, Melinda French Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, talks in an email interview about how health care delivery system is going to change post Covid-19 pandemic; and how India has managed to scale up Covid-19 vaccination remarkably well. Goalkeepers is the foundation’s campaign to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. How do you think the whole health care system will change post Covid-19 pandemic? The Covid-19 pandemic affected everyone. But it didn’t affect everyone equally. Historically marginalised countries and communities were hit the hardest, and they continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the suffering, both in their lives and in their economies. What’s also clear is that the countries that had invested in their health systems over decades were better prepared to manage the pandemic. In the years to come, in addition to strengthening health systems, I’m optimistic the world will heed this lesson and make the long-term investments we need in research and development and manufacturing, especially when it comes to vaccines, and focus on interventions that best serve the most vulnerable. These investments are critical not just to addressing the next pandemic, but to getting the world back on track to meet the Global Goals. And these investments must be made closer to the people who most stand to benefit, which helps us ensure that life-saving interventions and technologies are distributed equitably. In the Indian context, what should be the key focus areas of the government to manage such public health crisis? The pandemic proves that preparing for crises starts years before they happen. India’s Covid-19 management and country-wide immunization drive have demonstrated why long-term investments in health systems are crucial. In particular, India’s thriving R&D and vaccine manufacturing and delivery ecosystem have enabled the country to rapidly scale up Covid-19 immunization to deliver more than 750 million doses. That’s remarkable. Also Read | India vaccinations cross 750 millionIt is also important for governments to put systems in place that can more quickly help the most vulnerable people to minimize the impact of such a crisis. India is taking some encouraging steps to do just that, such as implementing its Digital Health Mission to boost the efficiency and transparency in the country’s healthcare services. And the Indian government’s direct benefit transfer program, which has provided financial support to 200 million women during the pandemic, has helped those who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Putting women at the centre of the economic recovery is something that all governments must continue to focus on and at the Gates Foundation we remain committed to providing strong support to this. We’ve committed $2.1 billion globally over the next five years to promote women’s economic empowerment, to strengthen women and girls’ health and family planning, and to support women’s leadership. It’s clear that we have to make sure that the most vulnerable groups and communities are protected whenever such crises occur. Strengthening social safety nets, improving service delivery to vulnerable communities, including women, and ensuring access to affordable quality healthcare will continue to be critical areas to focus on. How do you see this pandemic affecting global efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? It will take years to understand the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs. As this year’s Goalkeepers report demonstrates, we have already witnessed considerable setbacks, but we’ve also been able to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios on several key indicators—thanks to people around the world stepping up. Consider the global goal for routine vaccine coverage. A year ago, we predicted a drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage, which would have amounted to 25 years of progress lost. New analysis from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) shows the drop, while still unacceptable, was only half that. We have a lot of ground to cover on some important indicators, especially on gender equality, and we need to ensure continued efforts and commitment even on the issues where we avoided catastrophe. This is not simply a fight for one country. Regaining the lost ground on the SDGs needs to be a priority global effort. What’s your opinion on the inequity that we have seen in use of Covid-19 vaccines globally, wherein developed countries have vaccinated a major chunk of their population and are already looking at booster shots, and low-income countries still waiting for doses? Despite some historic successes and unprecedented collaborations, we still have a long way to go to ensure everyone has equal access to vaccines. Outbreaks and new variants around the world show the consequences of this vaccine inequity and the significant and tragic costs of inaction. We have a moral imperative to remove all barriers and use every lever available to rapidly improve access to Covid-19 vaccines for everybody, everywhere. We’ve been focused on this mission over the last year, and we will keep it up. Until more people worldwide get the vaccine, we won’t be able to put the pandemic behind us. Also Read | Covaxin may get WHO nod this week: ExpertWe’ve also seen that Covid-19 vaccine access is directly correlated with locations with vaccine R&D and manufacturing capability. Africa, for example, has 17% of the world’s population, but less than 1% of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities. That’s why we support efforts to invest in and build a sustainable regional vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem—to ensure vaccines can be available everywhere. The path forward is challenging. But it’s not impossible. We all can, and must, do more to accelerate the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Any country or company sitting on the sidelines should step in to do its part. In the past one-and-a-half year, what has been the silver lining ? It’s hard to think about silver linings amid so much devastation, but the Covid-19 pandemic has also shown our collective resolve, resilience, determination, and capacity to fight these challenges with innovation and collaboration. In the toughest of circumstances, countless individuals, organizations, and countries went above and beyond to innovate, adapt, and build resilient systems and to look out for one another. In India, we witnessed the unprecedented efforts of government, private institutions, and millions of ordinary individuals coming together to help those in need. The Gates Foundation was proud to partner with the government and Indian non-profits to expand testing, surveillance, vaccine discovery, and evaluating new and repurposed drugs. We also witnessed remarkable efforts from small collectives in India. Self-help groups played a crucial role in management of Covid-19 in their communities. For example, when Covid-19 arrived in Bihar, India—home to more than 100 million people—local self-help groups established trust with their neighbours by delivering meals and home-based health care to those who fell ill, then served as sources of information and support to encourage the community to get vaccinated. In Uttar Pradesh, apart from playing a similar role of community support that peer groups did in Bihar, self-help groups have also been engaged by the government to facilitate the state’s ‘Take Home Ration’ program and to support the most vulnerable. There are so many examples like these, and they all demonstrate that some of the most effective interventions happen at a hyperlocal level, headed by leaders who have worked long and hard to earn the trust of their communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-affected-everyone-but-not-equally-melinda-gates-101631620835923.html
14-09-2021||World||China slams upcoming in-person Quad summit in Washington||China on Tuesday said regional cooperation cliques formed to target a third country will not be popular and have no future, in its first warning shot against the upcoming US-led first in-person meeting of the Quad countries including India, Japan and Australia to be held in Washington on September 24.Beijing has described the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, in the past as a clique based on a cold war ideology and “detrimental to the international order”.The Chinese foreign ministry reacted hours after Washington announced that US President Joe Biden will host the first in-person summit of leaders of the Quad countries, which have sought to boost cooperation in an apparent attempt to push back China’s growing assertiveness especially in the Indo-Pacific region.The US visits of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and Australian PM Scott Morrison will coincide with the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which Joe Biden will address on September 21.When asked about the Quad conclave, which is to be held on September 24, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said: “It (the Quad) should not target any third party.”“China believes that any regional cooperation framework should go with the trend of the times and be conducive to mutual trust and cooperation between the regional countries. It should not target any third party or harm their interests,” Zhao Lijian said. “To form exclusive cliques targeting other countries does not conform with the country’s aspirations, won’t be popular and has no future.”“I want to stress that China is not only an engine for economic growth in Asia Pacific, it is also the main force safeguarding peace,” Zhao Lijian said, adding that China’s growth is an increase in “forces for peace” in the world and “good news” for the region.“Relevant countries should abandon outdated zero-sum game thinking and narrow geopolitical concepts, take a correct view of China’s development, respect the hearts of the people in the region, and do more things that are conducive to promoting unity and cooperation of regional countries,” Zhao Lijian added.China had reacted strongly to an online meeting of the Quad leaders in March, saying that it “will end up nowhere” if it does not abandon its ideological bias and cold war mentality, underscoring its opposition to the bloc.The March summit attended by all four leaders was closely monitored and critiqued by Beijing.The consensus in Beijing was that the four countries came together to counter China’s increasing influence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.In November 2017, New Delhi, Tokyo, Washington, and Canberra gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to develop a coordinated strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific region free of any influence.In 2018, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had described the Quad as “...seafoam in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”.By 2020, Wang came around to acknowledging that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue had become a “security threat” and a so-called Indo-Pacific “new Nato”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-upcoming-in-person-quad-summit-in-washington-101631617475404.html
14-09-2021||World||Global vaccine coverage dropped to 1/2 of what was anticipated: Gates Foundation||The global vaccine coverage dropped to just half of what was anticipated, finds Gates Foundation’s fifth annual Goalkeepers report, adding that the world stepped up to avert some of the worst-case scenarios amid the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “In last year’s Goalkeepers Report, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicted a drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage—effectively erasing 25 years of progress in 25 weeks. New analysis from IHME demonstrates that the decline, while still unacceptable, was only half of what was anticipated,” said the report.However, the report also acknowledges that disparities caused by Covid-19 remain stark, and those who have been hardest hit by the pandemic will be the slowest to recover. Because of Covid-19, an additional 31 million people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020 compared to 2019. And while 90% of advanced economies will regain pre-pandemic per capita income levels by next year, only a third of low- and middle-income economies are expected to do so.Also Read | Covid-19: Southeast China cases soar amid outbreak led by Delta variantTo ensure a truly equitable recovery from the pandemic, the co-chairs call for long-term investments in health and economies—like the ones that led to the rapid development of the Covid-19 vaccine—to propel recovery efforts and get the world back on track to meet the Global Goals.“[The past year] has reinforced our belief that progress is possible but not inevitable,” write the co-chairs in the report. “If we can expand upon the best of what we’ve seen these past 18 months, we can finally put the pandemic behind us and once again accelerate progress in addressing fundamental issues like health, hunger, and climate change.”While vaccine against Covid-19 was developed in record time as a result of decades of investment, policies, and partnerships that established the infrastructure, talent, and ecosystems necessary to deploy them quickly, there has not been equitable distribution of the supply.“The lack of equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines is a public health tragedy,” said Bill Gate, Co-chair of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and co-author of the report, in a statement.“We face the very real risk that in the future, wealthy countries and communities will begin treating Covid-19 as yet another disease of poverty. We can’t put the pandemic behind us until everyone, regardless of where they live, has access to vaccines.”According to the report, 80% of all Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries to date, with some securing two to three times the number needed so they could cover boosters; less than 1% of doses have been administered in low-income countries.Further, Covid-19 vaccine access has been strongly correlated with the locations where there is vaccine research and development, and manufacturing capability. Though Africa is home to 17% of the world’s population, for example, it has less than 1% of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities.“We must invest in local partners to strengthen the capacity of researchers and manufacturers in lower-income countries to create the vaccines and medicines they need,” said Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman. “The only way we will solve our greatest health challenges is by drawing on the innovation and talent of people all over the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-vaccine-coverage-dropped-to-1-2-of-what-was-anticipated-gates-foundation-101631617235811.html

The dreaded ministry was notorious for enforcing the Taliban’s harsh version of Sharia law, including a ban on women venturing outside their house without a male relative and prohibition on music and other forms of entertainment.A Taliban official said their main purpose is to “serve Islam”, for which a ministry of vice and virtue is needed, reported New York Post. Mohammad Yusuf, who claims to be responsible for the “central zone” of Afghanistan, told the US daily tabloid that the Taliban regime will punish the violators as per the “Islamic rules”.Yusuf explained that a murderer who has committed the crime intentionally will be killed but “if not intentional, then there might be another punishment like paying a certain amount of money.” During their earlier rule from 1996-2001, the ministry installed moral police in the streets of Afghanistan and violators were flogged, stoned, amputated and even publicly executed depending on the crime.Also Read | Taliban claims to recover $6.5 million,18 gold bricks at former Afghan VP's homeThe Taliban official said that the hands of thieves would be cut off, while those involved in “illegal intercourse” will be stoned, reported New York Post. Although stoning was mostly reserved for women, Yusuf claimed that both males and females involved in “illegal intercourse” would be executed in the same draconian manner. Yusuf further stated that four witnesses with the “same story” would be required to announce conviction in the case.“If there is a small difference in the story, there will be no punishment. But if all of them are saying the same thing, the same way and the same time, there will be punishment. The Supreme Court will overlook all these issues. If they are found guilty, then we will punish,” New York Post quoted Yusuf as saying."We just want a peaceful country with Islamic rules and regulations.

14-09-2021||World||International Day of Democracy 2021: History, significance of September 15||September 15 is celebrated as International Day of Democracy after being established in 2007 through a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In the words of the United Nations, “International Day of Democracy provides an opportunity to review the state of democracy in the world. Democracy is as much a process as a goal, and only with the full participation of the international community, can the ideal of democracy be made into a reality.”The International Day of Democracy owes its existence to the Universal Declaration on Democracy, which was adopted on September 15, 1997 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which is an international organisation of national parliaments. In the following years, Qatar led efforts to promote an International Day of Democracy. Finally, on November 8, 2007, the day was established as the UNGA adopted by consensus the resolution titled “Support by United Nations system of efforts of governments to promote and consolidate a new or restored democracies.” The IPU suggested that the occasion be celebrated on September 15 to commemorate the adoption of Universal Declaration on Democracy 10 years prior.The first such celebration took place in 2008. Every year, events take place under an individual theme. In 2020, the theme was “Covid-19: A Spotlight on Democracy,” while celebrations in 2019 took place under the theme “Participation.” From 2013 to 2016, the events took place under the taglines of “Strengthening voices for democracy,” “Engaging youth on democracy,” “Space for civil society” and “Democracy and 2030 agenda for sustainable development,” respectively, while that for 2018 was “Democracy under strain: Solutions for a changing world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-democracy-2021-history-significance-of-september-15-101631603548356.html
14-09-2021||World||Hurricane Nicholas makes landfall on the Texas coast||Hurricane Nicholas made landfall along the Texas coast on Tuesday, bringing the threat of up to 20 inches of rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast, including the same area hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and storm-battered Louisiana.Nicholas touched down on the eastern part of the Matagorda Peninsula, about 10 miles (17 kilometers) west southwest of Sargent Beach, Texas, with maximum winds of 75 mph (120 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Nicholas was the 14th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.The storm was moving north northeast at 10 mph (17 kph) and the center of Nicholas was expected to move slowly over southeastern Texas on Tuesday and over southwestern Louisiana on Wednesday.The biggest unknown about Nicholas was how much rainfall it would produce in Texas, especially in flood-prone Houston.Nearly all of the state’s coastline was under a tropical storm warning that included potential flash floods and urban flooding. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said authorities placed rescue teams and resources in the Houston area and along the coast.In Houston, officials worried that heavy rain expected to arrive by Tuesday could inundate streets and flood homes. Authorities deployed high-water rescue vehicles throughout the city and erected barricades at more than 40 locations that tend to flood, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.“This city is very resilient. We know what we need to do. We know about preparing,” said Turner, referencing four major flood events that have hit the Houston area in recent years, including devastating damage from Harvey.Numerous school districts along the Texas Gulf Coast canceled classes Monday because of the incoming storm. The Houston school district, the state’s largest, as well as others, announced that classes would be canceled on Tuesday. The weather threat also closed multiple Covid-19 testing and vaccination sites in the Houston and Corpus Christi areas and forced the cancellation of a Harry Styles concert scheduled for Monday evening in Houston.Six to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain were expected along the middle and upper Texas coast, with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches (46 centimeters) possible. Other parts of southeast Texas and south-central Louisiana and southern Mississippi could see 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) over the coming days.A tornado or two may be possible Tuesday along the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coast, according to the weather service.“Listen to local weather alerts and heed local advisories about the right and safe thing to do, and you’ll make it through this storm just like you’ve had many other storms,” Abbott said during a news conference in Houston.Nicholas brought rain to the same area of Texas that was hit hard by Harvey. That storm made landfall in the middle Texas coast then stalled for four days, dropping more than 60 inches (152 cm) of rain in parts of southeast Texas. Harvey was blamed for at least 68 deaths, including 36 in the Houston area.After Harvey, voters approved the issuance of $2.5 billion in bonds to fund flood-control projects, including the widening of bayous. The 181 projects designed to mitigate damage from future storms are at different stages of completion.But University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said he expects that Nicholas “will be magnitudes less than Harvey in every regard.”The worry with Nicholas will be how slowly it moves. Storms are moving slower in recent decades, and Nicholas could get stuck between two other weather systems, said hurricane researcher Jim Kossin of The Climate Service.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Sunday night, ahead of the storm’s arrival in a state still recovering from Hurricane Ida and last year’s Hurricane Laura and historic flooding.“The most severe threat to Louisiana is in the southwest portion of the state, where recovery from Hurricane Laura and the May flooding is ongoing,” Edwards said.The storm was expected to bring the heaviest rainfall west of where Ida slammed into Louisiana two weeks ago.Across Louisiana, almost 120,000 customers remained without power Monday morning, according to the utility tracking site poweroutage.us.While Lake Charles received minimal impact from Ida, the city saw multiple wallops from Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta in 2020, a winter storm in February as well as historic flooding this spring.Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the city is taking the threat of the storm seriously, as it does all tropical systems.“Hope and prayer is not a good game plan,” Hunter said.In Cameron Parish in coastal Louisiana, Scott Trahan was still finishing repairs on his home from Hurricane Laura, which put about 2 feet of water in his house. He hopes to be finished by Christmas. He said many in his area have moved instead of rebuilding.“If you get your butt whipped about four times, you are not going to get back up again. You are going to go somewhere else,” Trahan said.Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said via Twitter that only four other years since 1966 have had 14 or more named storms by Sept. 12: 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-nicholas-makes-landfall-on-the-texas-coast-101631604471405.html

The incident took place when Biden was asking a question to an audience member.That person was George Geissler of the national association of state foresters."Can I ask you a question?" Biden asked."Of course," Geissler responded."One of the things that I've been working on with some others is..." the US president had spoken only this much when the feed was cut and was replaced with "Thank you for joining" message.The clip was posted on Twitter by the Republican National Committee.BIDEN: “Can I ask you a question?”*White House feed cuts out” pic.twitter.com/YQ9I9u3r98The White House has so far not responded on the issue.This is not the first time that such a thing has happened with the 78-year-old US President. The livestrem was interrupted last month when Biden was about to answer a reporter's question on American forces' withdrawal from Afghanistan.In March, Biden was attending a Democratic Party event and said he was "happy to answer" questions when the feed was cut, Fox News reported.The buzz around abrupt ending of the President's speech gained traction since Politico carried a report last week which quoted White House staffers as saying that they "mute" Biden's remarks over worries that he will veer off the scheduled agenda prepared by his office.The US President, meanwhile, used his visit to Idaho and other western states to hold out the wildfires burning across the region as an argument for his $3.5 trillion rebuilding plans. He called the year-round fires and other extreme weather a climate change reality the nation can no longer ignore.“We can't ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,” Biden said, noting that catastrophic weather doesn't strike based on partisan ideology. “It isn't about red or blue states. It's about fires. Just fires.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-asks-question-on-wildfires-white-house-cuts-livestream-midsentence-101631604227532.html
14-09-2021||World||Stuck in India: Academics allege racism on Canada’s Covid testing policy||Two Indo-Canadian academics stuck in India due to the ongoing ban on direct flights to Canada are alleging Ottawa of pursuing racism with regard to this and allied measures.Among them is Mitu Sengupta, a professor in the department of politics and public administration at Ryerson University in Toronto, who is particularly upset with the Canadian government rejecting Covid-19 RT-PCR tests conducted in India and instead mandating such molecular tests at the final point of departure for Canada for connecting flights. “It’s absurd they don’t trust the Indian Covid test. That’s an instance of blatant discrimination. This particular policy - a blanket no to Indian Covid tests does smack of racism to me. What is racism, after all? When you think a group of people are inferior to you based on something like their nationality and this is what they’re suggesting. I find that really objectionable,” she said. Mitu Sengupta is presently in Delhi.Her comments follow a letter to the editor published by the Canadian daily Toronto Star last week, in which Arun Paramekanti, professor of physics at the University of Toronto, alleged, “The prolonged Canadian government regulation to forbid direct flights from India to Canada, and to completely distrust pre-flight Covid-19 RT-PCR tests carried out in India while trusting test results from any other third country, is a racist policy which places significant burden on Canadian citizens of Indian origin.”“To ban travel from India at this stage, when nearly 80% of the eligible Canadian population (76.35% of Canadians aged 12 and older have been fully vaccinated) has been fully vaccinated, and we have far more knowledge of the disease, reeks of racism,” he claimed. Arun Paramekanti, who is in Bangalore at this point, confirmed that viewpoint while speaking to the Hindustan Times, saying such policy seemed to be “picking on India” and was “overkill and really discriminatory”.Canada opened its borders to fully-vaccinated travellers from the United States in August and earlier this month, to all fully-vaccinated visitors even if that was for discretionary reasons. Cases per thousand in America and in European nations like the United Kingdom are higher than in India.Responding to emailed queries from the Hindustan Times, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said, “The requirement for pre-entry molecular testing in a third country is in place so that the Covid-19 molecular test is performed after leaving a high-risk country (India in this case). In this way, the risk of the traveller being exposed to the virus and its variants in India between the time of testing and boarding the plane, which can take up to 72 hours, is reduced.”As for the high cases in the US and UK, also driven by the Delta variant, she replied that the flight ban and testing requirements were “implemented to address a consistently high number of imported cases into Canada from India. PHAC is continuing to monitor the situation.”Finally, as to the charge of racism, she said, “Canada’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic is guided by the latest science and research.”Dr S D Dwivedi, national president of the Canada India Global Forum (CIGF) isn’t convinced by these explanations, as he said the flight ban extension “was purely a political decision to insulate the government from complaints that they were irresponsible in protecting Canadians against Covid”. He added that the policy was a “sham” and the government “acted in this way with blatant disregard for actual facts, and showed no regard for the hardships faced by the Indo-Canadian community”.The flight ban and the testing regimen were put in place in April as India faced its second wave with the Delta variant causing havoc. The ban has been extended several times since then, and is in place till September 21, a day after the federal elections in Canada end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stuck-in-india-academics-allege-racism-on-canada-s-covid-testing-policy-101631600194581.html
14-09-2021||World||Justin Trudeau vs Erin O’Toole: Pollsters yet to pick a winner in Canada elections||The campaign for the 44th Federal elections in Canada has entered its final days and attacks have turned sharper as the ruling Liberal Party and the principal opposition Conservatives are locked in the closest of contests in the final week before the September 20 voting day.The difference between the two principal parties in most polling is within the margin of error but, in the last couple of days, incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did benefit from a revival of sorts, catching up with the Conservatives. Opposition leader Erin O’Toole has seen his party’s upward trajectory stall and in fact, head in the wrong direction.According to the latest data from the tracking website 338 Canada, there’s dead heat between the two parties. The Liberals have 31.9% support, just 0.3% behind the Conservatives. 338 Canada now projects that the Liberals will get 146 seats and the Conservatives 20 fewer, at 126. In either case, neither party is in a position to garner a majority, that is 170 seats in the next House of Commons.The four-year term of the House of Commons would normally have expired with elections in October 2023 but Trudeau precipitated snap elections in his quest for a majority verdict. In the 2019 federal elections, Liberals won 157 seats forming a minority government under Justin Trudeau. The Conservatives got 121 seats to emerge as the official opposition party.The tracker for CBC News points in the opposite direction with the Liberals having the same numbers but the Conservatives trailing by only 0.6%.A fresh survey from the non-partisan foundation Angus Reid Institute (ARI) on Monday underscored this trend, as it said, “New data finds the Conservative (32%) and Liberal (30%) parties in a statistical deadlock, with each garnering support from three-in-ten voters.”“The 44th federal election campaign is in its final week, with no party separating itself among Canadian voters, half of whom are saying they’re not yet fully committed to their party choice,” it added.Campaigning in Vancouver on Monday, Justin Trudeau focused on Erin O’Toole and linked the Conservatives to the anti-vaccination groups in the country. “What we need is leadership that will be unequivocal that Canadians need to get vaccinated, not leadership like Mr O’Toole who pretends that testing is equivalent to vaccination,” he said, as anti-vaxxer protests continue in the country.And as the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic also makes its presence felt, Erin O’Toole again questioned scheduling an election amid a health crisis. In the town of Carp in Ontario, Erin O’Toole said, “Every Canadian has met a Justin Trudeau in their lives - privileged, entitled and always looking out for number one. He was looking out for number one when he called this expensive and unnecessary election in the middle of a pandemic. That’s not leadership, that’s self interest.”With margins wafer-thin, the rhetoric will only become shriller till voting next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-vs-erin-o-toole-pollsters-yet-to-pick-a-winner-in-canada-polls-101631597435767.html

14-09-2021||World||Joe Biden’s nuclear envoy tells North Korea door is open for talks||President Joe Biden’s envoy for North Korea said the door remains open for talks, after Pyongyang claimed it tested new long-range cruise missiles that bolster its nuclear strike capabilities against Japan and South Korea.“We hope the DPRK will respond positively to our multiple offers to meet without preconditions,” Sung Kim, the State Department’s special representative for North Korea, said in Tokyo on Tuesday ahead of discussions with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea. Kim was referring to North Korea by its formal name. Kim also reiterated the long-stated US position that Washington has no hostile intentions toward Pyongyang.About a day before Biden’s envoy arrived in Tokyo, North Korea said it tested new cruise missiles that flew in “pattern-8 flight orbits” for more than two hours on Saturday and Sunday, covering some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) over land and waters off North Korea before hitting targets.The tests, if confirmed, would be North Korea’s first reported missile launches since firing off two short-range ballistic missiles in March. The new cruise missiles were designed to fly below the radar and evade defense systems, which fits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s goal of deterring a U.S.-led attack. North Korea is barred from launching ballistic missiles under United Nations resolutions, but its cruise missiles don’t face the same restrictions. Even though Biden has indicated the U.S. could offer incentives that would help North Korea’s struggling economy in return for disarmament steps, Pyongyang has shown no interest in coming back to the talks that have been stalled for about two years. Pyongyang has touted efforts to build up its tactical strike capability, with leader Kim telling a top ruling party meeting before Biden came to office in January that he was putting North Korea on a path to develop more advanced nuclear technologies and missiles. The plan included making smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, and suggested a sweeping modernization of the country’s nuclear and conventional forces. The talks in Tokyo with the three envoys come as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was due to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday on a two-day trip that includes discussions with South Korean officials on issues such as the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.   China is North Korea’s biggest benefactor, for years providing a lifeline that helped keep its neighbor’s struggling economy afloat. The Biden administration has told Beijing that it’s in its own self-interest to get Pyongyang back to the bargaining table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-nuclear-envoy-tells-north-korea-door-is-open-for-talks-101631585633198.html

The top diplomat said Pakistan has a "multiplicity of interests", including some that are in "clear conflict" with that of the United States, when asked about how the US sees Islamabad’s involvement in Afghanistan. Blinken, while testifying before Congress on the Taliban victory in Afghanistan, said India's involvement in Afghanistan has influenced some "detrimental" actions by Pakistan."What we have to look at is an insistence that every country, to include Pakistan, make good on the expectations that the international community has of what is required of a Taliban-led government if it's to receive any legitimacy of any kind or any support," Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "So Pakistan needs to line up with a broad majority of the international community in working toward those ends and in upholding those expectations," Blinken said.Also read | US warns Pak, says will reassess ties based on its relationship with TalibanPakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the group overtly and covertly. Those charges have been denied by Islamabad. Pakistan is also considered as one of the two countries, along with Qatar, with the most influence over the Taliban. It is also a place where many senior Taliban leaders were thought to have escaped to after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh alleged earlier this month the Taliban are being micromanaged by ISI—Pakistan’s notorious intelligence agency—and that Islamabad is in charge of Afghanistan effectively as a colonial power.US lawmaker Bill Keating during the testimony reminded Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's remarks after the Taliban seized control. "Prime Minister Khan claimed Afghanistan had broken the shackles of slavery. So we used to always hear diplomatically that we have a complicated relationship with Pakistan. I would say it's often duplicitous," he said.Also read | Pakistan's poll says 55% Pakistanis are happy that Taliban seized AfghanistanHe said that Pakistan's ISI had such strong ties in cooperation with the Haqqani Network, "responsible for so many things including the deaths of some of our soldiers, and even recently when the Taliban took over in the last month".Keating asked Blinken how the US can reassess that relationship “how we, how we learn from their actions” as well as a way forward. Blinken said Pakistan is involved in "hedging its bets constantly" about the future of Afghanistan. "It's one that's involved harbouring members of the Taliban, including the Haqqanis. It's one that's also involved at different points, cooperation with us on counterterrorism, and so there are a number of things that have come into play it. It has a multiplicity of interests, some that are in conflict, clear conflict with ours," Blinken said."When it comes to Afghanistan, it's focused, of course as well, on, on India and the role that India is playing in Afghanistan, and it looks at it through that prism as well. All of these things, I think, have influenced what it has done on many occasions detrimental to our interests. On other occasions in support of those interests," Blinken added.Also read | ISI chief meets intelligence heads of China, others over Afghanistan situationThe US top diplomat said that if the Taliban want any legitimacy or any support going forward, it must ensure freedom of travel to include making good on its commitments on not allowing Afghanistan to be used as a haven for outward-directed terrorism to include upholding the basic rights of the Afghan people. Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro also called on the United States to consider removing its status as a major non-Nato ally, which gives Pakistan privileged access to US weaponry.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-involved-in-harbouring-taliban-must-line-up-blinken-101631579468773.html

The government has said it aims to increase travel to and from the nation once 80% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. Currently that rate stands at about 34%, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. Australia sets 70% Covid vaccination target to start reopeningEurope is so far the only region where so-called vaccine passports are widely used.

14-09-2021||World||Apple announces fix for flaw linked to Pegasus spyware||Apple released a fix Monday for a weakness that can let the spyware at the heart of the Pegasus scandal infect devices without users even clicking on a malicious message or link.The Pegasus software from Israeli firm NSO Group has been under intense scrutiny since an international media investigation claimed it was used to spy on the phones of human rights activists, journalists and even heads of state.Researchers at Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog organization in Canada, found the problem while analyzing a Saudi activist's phone that had been compromised with the code."We determined that the mercenary spyware company NSO Group used the vulnerability to remotely exploit and infect the latest Apple devices with the Pegasus spyware," Citizen Lab wrote in a post.In March Citizen Lab examined the activist's phone and determined it was hacked with Pegasus spyware introduced via iMessage texting and that it didn't even require the phone's user to so much as click.Hours after releasing the fix, Apple said it had "rapidly" developed the update following Citizen Lab's discovery of the problem."Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals," the company said.NSO did not dispute Pegasus had prompted the urgent software upgrade, and said in a statement that it would "continue to provide intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world with life saving technologies to fight terror and crime."No click neededPegasus has evolved to become more effective since it was uncovered by Citizen Lab and cyber security firm Lookout five years ago.Pegasus can be deployed as a "zero-click exploit," meaning that the spyware can install itself without the victim even clicking a booby-trapped link or file, according to Lookout senior manager Hank Schless."Many apps will automatically create a preview or cache of links in order to improve the user experience," Schless said."Pegasus takes advantage of this functionality to silently infect the device."UN experts recently called for an international moratorium on the sale of surveillance technology until regulations are implemented to protect human rights following an Israeli spyware scandal.An international media investigation reported in July that several governments used the Pegasus malware, created by NSO Group, to spy on activists, journalists and politicians.Pegasus can switch on a phone's camera or microphone and harvest its data."It is highly dangerous and irresponsible to allow the surveillance technology and trade sector to operate as a human rights-free zone," the United Nations human rights experts said in a statement at the time.The statement was signed by three special rapporteurs on rights and a working group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other businesses.Israel's defense establishment has set up a committee to review NSO's business, including the process through which export licences are granted.NSO insists its software is intended for use only in fighting terrorism and other crimes, and says it exports to 45 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-announces-fix-for-flaw-linked-to-pegasus-spyware-101631576102261.html
14-09-2021||World||‘Inherited a deadline, not a plan’: Blinken on US withdrawal from Afghanistan||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday insisted the Biden administration had prepared for worst-case scenarios in Afghanistan, as irate lawmakers accused the White House of presiding over a historic disaster.The famously even-tempered top US diplomat stayed cool as he faced the toughest grilling of his career at the first congressional hearing on President Joe Biden's end to the 20-year war, which brought a swift victory by the Taliban.As rival Republicans raised their voices, waved pictures of slain soldiers and occasionally demanded he resign, Blinken repeatedly noted that former president Donald Trump had set the withdrawal from Afghanistan."We inherited a deadline; we did not inherit a plan," Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.After Trump's February 2020 deal with the Taliban and drawdown of US troops, the Islamist movement was in the "strongest military position it had been since 9/11," the attacks 20 years ago that prompted America's longest war, Blinken said.Blinken said the Biden administration was "intensely focused" on the safety of Americans and had been "constantly assessing" how long the Western-backed government could survive."Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while US forces remained," Blinken said."Nonetheless, we planned and exercised a wide range of contingencies," he added."The evacuation itself was an extraordinary effort -- under the most difficult conditions imaginable -- by our diplomats, by our military, by our intelligence professionals."- 'Unmitigated disaster' -Republican lawmakers, seeing a vulnerability for Biden, have portrayed the pullout as chaotic and accused the president of abandoning Americans to the fate of the Taliban."This was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions," said Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the committee."I never thought in my lifetime that I would see an unconditional surrender to the Taliban," he added.Accusing the administration of "betrayal" of Afghan allies, McCaul pointed out that the Taliban's caretaker government included figures such as Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose arrest is sought by Washington on terrorism allegations. "We are now at the mercy of the Taliban's reign of terror," McCaul said, warning of a "dark veil of sharia law" as the Taliban reinstitute their draconian treatment of women.Republicans noted that last year's agreement with the Taliban -- signed in the presence of Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo -- had set conditions for the withdrawal."You can't blame the Trump administration for your failure," said Representative Greg Steube."Your administration in the White House was seeing in real time what was happening in Afghanistan and you did absolutely nothing to stop it," he said.Blinken, however, suggested that the Taliban violated the accord through their "relentless march," even as the Trump administration pressed the former Afghan government to free battle-hardened militants.Blinken said that the new administration's planning made it possible to draw down the embassy within 48 hours, and secure the airport and start evacuations within 72 hours.The United States and its allies ultimately evacuated 124,000 people out of Afghanistan, one of the largest airlifts in history.The administration says only around 100 US citizens remain and that all had been contacted repeatedly by US diplomats, with some leaving after the withdrawal in line with promises by the Taliban.Blinken said there was "no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining.""If 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in support, equipment and training did not suffice, why would another year, another five, another 10?"Representative Gregory Meeks, the Democrat who led the committee, accused Republicans of having been silent when Trump and Pompeo pursued the same policies on Afghanistan."Disentangling ourselves from Afghanistan was never going to be easy," Meeks said."I would welcome hearing what exactly a smooth withdrawal from a messy, chaotic 20-year war looks like," he said. "I don't believe one exists."sct/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inherited-a-deadline-not-a-plan-blinken-on-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101631575205462.html

The list of participants for the summit has so far not been revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-address-un-general-assembly-on-september-21-white-house-101631575121343.html
14-09-2021||World||US warns Pak, says will reassess ties based on its relationship with Taliban||The United States will be looking at its relationship with Pakistan in the coming weeks, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, to formulate what role Washington would want it play in the future of Afghanistan.In the first public hearing in Congress about Afghanistan since last month's collapse of the US-backed Afghan government, Blinken told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Pakistan has a "multiplicity of interests some that are in conflict with ours.""It is one that is involved hedging its bets constantly about the future of Afghanistan, it's one that's involved harboring members of the Taliban ... It is one that's also involved in different points cooperation with us on counterterrorism," Blinken said.Asked by lawmakers if it is time for Washington to reassess its relationship with Pakistan, Blinken said the administration would soon be doing that."This is one of the things we're going to be looking at in the days, and weeks ahead - the role that Pakistan has played over the last 20 years but also the role we would want to see it play in the coming years and what it will take for it to do that," he said.The United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan culminated with a hastily organized airlift that left thousands of US-allied Afghans behind and was punctuated by a suicide bombing outside Kabul's airport that killed 13 US troops and scores of Afghans.The United States and Western countries are in a difficult balancing act in the aftermath of the Taliban's victory - reluctant to recognize the Islamist group while accepting the reality that they will have to engage with them to prevent a looming humanitarian crisis.Pakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the group as it battled the US-backed government in Kabul for 20 years - charges denied by Islamabad.It is also considered as one of the two countries, along with Qatar, with the most influence over the Taliban, and a place where many senior Taliban leaders were thought to have escaped to after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-pak-says-will-reassess-ties-based-on-its-relationship-with-taliban-101631574506704.html
