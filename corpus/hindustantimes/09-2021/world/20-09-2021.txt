On September 11, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken took to Twitter to post a series of tweets on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks.One of the tweets was regarding the evacuation of 21 US nationals and 11 Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) from the war-gripped country. While 19 Americans were airlifted on Qatar Airways, the remaining two and all the lawful permanent residents were taken out of Afghanistan via an overland route, Blinken’s statement read.“We continue to work to uphold our commitment to assist departures for those to whom we have a special commitment,” the US Secretary of State’s Twitter post added.An additional two U.S. citizens and 11 Lawful Permanent Residents departed Afghanistan today overland, while another 19 U.S. citizens traveled out on Qatar Airways. We continue to work to uphold our commitment to assist departures for those to whom we have a special commitment.Kabul airport returned to action on September 9 with the evacuation of some 200 foreigners, including several US citizens, on the first flight flying out of the Hamid Karzai airport since the US and its allied forces departed Afghanistan after a war of two decades. After the last soldier of US-led forces left the Kabul airport, the Taliban burst firecrackers to celebrate independence.Among the 200 foreigners, were an Afghan-American dual citizen, who said that he was told by the US State Department on September 9 morning to reach the Kabul airport. “We got in contact with the State Department, they gave me a call this morning and said to go to the airport,” the father of the citizen, who requested anonymity, told the old news agency AFP.Blinken had been constantly hedging on enabling charter flights from Hamid Karzai Airport, even saying earlier this month that the US has been in contact with the Taliban for the same – stressing on the fact that the Islamist group had reiterated to permit Afghans to “freely leave” their homeland.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-us-citizens-48-lawful-residents-leave-kabul-airport-in-evac-flight-us-101632161408589.html

They had last met in March, but virtually.Modi is also expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Joe Biden and meet vice-president Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to hold America’s second highest political office.These will be Narenda Modi’s first in-person meetings with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. He had met Joe Biden before, on his first visit to the US as prime minister in 2014. Joe Biden was vice-president at the time, in the administration of President Barack Obama. Narendra Modi and Kamala Harris have never met, but have spoken on phone before.The prime minister’s engagements in New York are still being worked out though he is expected to leave for India just hours after his speech on September 25. His remaining schedule for the rest of the day is unlikely to be as expansive and busy as in previous years, which would be packed with bilateral meetings with counterparts from around the world and sessions with business leaders, American politicians and the diaspora.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is arriving in New York on Monday for a series of UN and related meetings, including those that are held almost every year on the sidelines of the general assembly, such as the G-4. India, Brazil, Germany and Japan, are seeking permanent seats in an expanded UN Security Council in long overdue reforms of the world body.S Jaishankar will also participate in a meeting of the foreign ministers of the G-20 countries on Afghanistan. Both the G-4 and G-20 meetings are scheduled for September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-pm-narendra-modi-to-address-un-general-assembly-on-sept-25-101632161227703.html

Following a sudden surge in cases in India, the airline had earlier in April suspended India operations.Replying to multiple users on the microblogging site Twitter, Air Canada confirmed that its flight to Delhi is resuming. In one such tweet asking about the resumption of direct flights to India between Toronto and Delhi, Air Canada replied, “Yes they are, however it is subject to change depending on the Canadian Government.”Further, the company also notified the passengers of the Covid-19 testing requirements for flights from India. It said that a negative RT-PCR test or a rapid PCR test, not older than 18 hours before departure, from the testing centre at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi is necessary.Also read | Working with India, says UK on recognising Covishield vaccine certificate“Please note that Air Canada’s requirements for boarding the flight from India to Canada have now changed. The only accepted COVID-19 tests are an RT-PCR test or a rapid PCR test that must be taken no more than 18 hours before your departing Air Canada flight to Canada from the COVID-19 Testing Centre & Lounge across from Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi,” the airlines said.It also noted that no other tests would be accepted even in the case of flyers coming in from other cities in India. “Air Canada requires either of these specific tests as no other test from any other clinic within India will be accepted, even if you are connecting from a different city,” it added. “You may also be able to travel if you provide proof of a certified positive PCR test result taken between 14 and 180 days before your scheduled departure flight to Canada,” it further said.As far as vaccinations are concerned, four shots, namely those of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Vaxzevria and Covishield by AstraZeneca and Janssen by Johnson and Johnson are accepted currently in Canada, according to the government’s Travel and Tourism website.

20-09-2021||World||Conservative leader Erin O’Toole among the early voters in Canada elections||Canadians started voting on Monday in the country’s 44th elections, following a 36-day campaign. Among the early voters was Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, who voted at a polling station in the town of Bowmanville in Ontario. However, it’s the person he’s attempting to unseat, incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who has the definite edge in the contest.The elections were called on August 15 and Justin Trudeau’s objective was to secure a majority to govern the country. He may well return to the helm in Ottawa but the likelihood of a minority government is far higher, though, if his ruling Liberal Party performs optimally across close contests, a majority cannot be considered impossible.As per the latest data from the tracking website 338 Canada, the Liberals had 31.9% vote share translating to 148 seats, while their principal rival Conservatives had 31.4% support equal to 125 seats. The outlet CBC’s poll tracker gives the ruling party a 57% chance of forming a minority government but just 17% for a majority.The majority mark in the House of Commons is 170 and the ruling party captured 157 seats in 2019 with the Tories at 121.The campaign has been described by many analysts as the most divisive in recent times, witnessing noisy protests at Justin Trudeau’s rallies over vaccine mandates, including one in Ontario where gravel was tossed at him.The Covid-19 pandemic may well be the main factor as people vote, though the economy, with inflation at a three-decade high and issues like climate change and indigenous rights will also count.Approximately, 6.3 million Canadians have voted prior to Monday, at advance polls that spanned four days and through mail-in ballots.The contest is extremely tight and the suspense may well stretch on for a couple more days. While results are normally announced the same night of the elections, Elections Canada has said it will only start counting mail-in ballots on Tuesday morning after verifying those using that option had not voted in person as well. With over a million such votes to be tallied, results for seats with narrow margins may remain in doubt.The ruling Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau is pitching its management of the Covid-19 pandemic and leveraging the wedge issue of vaccine passports against the Conservatives, as its leader Erin O’Toole has opposed imposition of mandatory vaccination. That single issue has bolstered Justin Trudeau’s campaign, and indications on the eve of the election are that he may even have an outside chance at capturing the majority he craved for while precipitating snap elections on August 15.With Western Canada, particularly the province of Alberta, suffering from the fourth wave of the coronavirus, Justin Trudeau has, with some success, linked that to the failure of the provincial governments which are all run by right-of-centre parties and their ties to Erin O’Toole. He has described the fourth wave as one of the unvaccinated, criticising Erin O’Toole for indulging anti-vaxxers. Canada, he said, at a campaign event on Sunday, was “at a crossroads, at a moment where we have to make a really important choice”. That single factor may have given Justin Trudeau’s party enough impetus for a majority, which may have been unthinkable a week back.Erin O’Toole, meanwhile, is also making this a referendum, not just on Trudeau but also on his “selfish” call for elections in the midst of the fourth wave, an issue that continues to resonate with voters. “Now is the time for Canadians to make a choice. We can choose to settle for second-best - for a party that hardly tries and barely delivers. Or we can choose to believe in a brighter, better, more united future,” he said.Both leaders spent some of the last day campaigning in Canada’s most populous province Ontario, which could prove crucial in determining the shape of the next Government.Turnout amid voter malaise could be the X-factor in the final outcome. The agency Ipsos Canada forecast a “photo finish” to the contest. Its CEO Darrell Bricker tweeted, “Here’s what I’m seeing. It’s very close. Tory vote a bit more certain, energetic than LPC vote but incumbents have built in advantages. Do they cancel out? Hard to gauge.”It’s really that uncertain, but the advantage definitely lies with Justin Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conservative-leader-erin-o-toole-among-the-early-voters-in-canada-elections-101632153487082.html

The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.According to the reports, the new rule will open the door to fully vaccinated passengers and also those in clinical trials for vaccines not yet approved in Britain -- a policy applying to about 40,000 people.Currently only US citizens, residents and foreigners with special visas are allowed to enter the United States from most European countries.The restriction has deeply irked EU and British authorities. On Monday, the European Union recommended that member states reimpose restrictions on American travelers who had earlier been free to enter if vaccinated.Biden's reported move would come on the eve of the UN General Assembly in New York, where the pandemic is due to be the headline issue.The report also comes as Washington and Paris spar bitterly over Australia's sudden announcement that it will be getting US nuclear submarines, ditching a previous French contract for conventionally powered submarines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-lift-covid-travel-ban-for-vaccinated-eu-uk-passengers-reports-101632148528977.html

It is found to have compressive strengths as high as 25Mpa (megapascals) similar to that of ordinary concrete (20Mpa to 32 MPa).However, the scientists have also found that by incorporating urea, the compressive strength could further be increased by over 300% with the best performing material having a compressive strength of almost 40 MPa, substantially stronger than ordinary concrete. Urea is a biological waste product that the body produces and excretes through urine, sweat and tears.The new technique holds considerable advantages over many other proposed construction techniques in the moon and Mars, said Dr Aled Roberts from the University of Manchester who worked on the project. “Scientists have been trying to develop viable technologies to produce concrete-like materials on the surface of Mars, but we never stopped to think that the answer might be inside us all along,” he said.Over 500 kg of AstroCrete could be produced over the course of a two-year mission on the surface of Mars by a crew of six astronauts, the scientists calculated. “If used as a mortar for sandbags or heat-fused regolith bricks, each crew member could produce enough AstroCrete to expand the habitat to support an additional crew member, doubling the housing available with each successive mission,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-create-concrete-like-material-from-extra-terrestrial-dust-and-blood-sweat-and-tears-of-astronauts-101632147819570.html

A Reuters reporter saw heavy smoke coming from the volcano and houses burning.Officials said they were hopeful they would not need to evacuate any more people."The lava is moving towards the coast and the damage will be material. According to experts there are about 17-20 million cubic metres of lava," regional president Angel Victor Torres told Cadena Ser radio.The lava flow has destroyed about 100 houses so far, Mariano Hernandez, president of La Palma's council, told Cadena Ser.About 20 houses were engulfed in the village of El Paso along with sections of roads, Mayor Sergio Rodriguez told state broadcaster TVE. The lava was spreading through neighbouring villages, putting hundreds more at risk, he said.A group of 360 tourists were evacuated by boat to Tenerife from the beach resort of Puerto Naos, ferry operator Fred Olsen said, and more could be transferred later in the day.Despite the destruction, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told Canal Sur radio the eruption should be seen as an opportunity to entice visitors to the island."The island is open, if your hotel is affected we will find you another one," she said. "Make the most of this opportunity to enjoy what nature has brought us."Volcanologist Nemesio Perez said there were unlikely to be fatalities as long as no-one behaved recklessly.La Palma had been on high alert after thousands of tremors were reported over a week in Cumbre Vieja, which belongs to a chain of volcanoes that last had a major eruption in 1971 and is one of the Canaries' most active volcanic regions.One man was killed in 1971 as he took photographs near the lava flows. A submarine eruption occurred about 10 years ago close to the islands but caused little damage.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez arrived in La Palma on Sunday to coordinate with regional authorities and said citizens could "rest easy." He will visit affected areas later on Monday.Emergency services said it was unclear what path the lava would take to the ocean. Authorities had evacuated people with mobility issues from several coastal towns, including the Puerto Naos resort.Airspace around the Canaries remained open with no visibility problems, the Enaire civil air authority said. Local airline Binter cancelled four flights but said it would resume its service later on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-houses-damaged-so-far-after-volcanic-eruption-in-spain-s-la-palma-101632136100661.html
20-09-2021||World||'Hotel Rwanda' hero Paul Rusesabagina convicted on terror charges||Paul Rusesabagina, the "Hotel Rwanda" hero who became a fierce government critic, was found guilty on Monday on terror charges after what his supporters say was a politically motivated show trial.He was convicted of backing a rebel group blamed for deadly gun, grenade and arson attacks in Rwanda in 2018 and 2019."He founded a terrorist organisation that attacked Rwanda, he financially contributed to terrorist activities," Justice Beatrice Mukamurenzi said at the end of a seven-month trial.Rwandan prosecutors have sought a life sentence for Rusesabagina, the 67-year-old former hotelier credited with saving hundreds of lives during the 1994 genocide, and whose actions inspired the Hollywood film.Neither he nor his lawyers were in court for the verdict, although the 20 other defendants in the case attended.Rusesabagina, who used his fame to denounce Rwandan leader Paul Kagame as a dictator, was arrested in August 2020 when a plane he believed was bound for Burundi landed instead in the Rwandan capital Kigali.His family say Rusesabagina was kidnapped and had rejected the nine charges against him as payback by a vengeful government for his outspoken views.Earlier this month, Kagame had dismissed criticism of the case, saying Rusesabagina was in the dock not because of his fame but over the lives lost "because of his actions".The trial began in February but the Belgian citizen and US green card holder boycotted it starting in March, accusing the court of "unfairness and a lack of independence".The United States -- which awarded Rusesabagina its Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 -- along with the European Parliament and Belgium were among those to raise concerns about his transfer to Rwanda and the fairness of his trial.Conflicting testimonyRusesabagina was the former manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, where he sheltered hundreds of guests during the genocide that left 800,000 people dead, mostly ethnic Tutsis.A decade later the American actor Don Cheadle played Rusesabagina, a moderate Hutu, in the Oscar-nominated blockbuster that brought his story to an international audience.Rusesabagina soon became disillusioned with the new Tutsi-dominated government led by Kagame, the rebel leader-turned president whose forces ended the mass killings.He accused Kagame of authoritarian tendencies and left Rwanda in 1996, living in Belgium and then the United States.Abroad, he used his global platform to crusade for political change in Kigali, and developed close ties with opposition groups in exile.Kagame's government accused Rusesabagina of supporting the National Liberation Front (FLN), a rebel group blamed for the attacks in 2018 and 2019 that killed nine people.Rusesabagina denied any involvement in the attacks, but was a founder of the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD), an opposition group of which the FLN is seen as the armed wing."MRCD-FLN commited terror acts. MRCD cannot be separated from military acts" of FLN, said the judge, Mukamurenzi.Prosecutors in June said Rusesabagina "encouraged and empowered the fighters to commit those terrorist acts".But his co-defendants gave conflicting testimony about the level of Rusesabagina's involvement with the FLN and its fighters.His family, who have campaigned globally for his release, say Rusesabagina is a political prisoner and accuse the Rwandan authorities of torturing him in custody.The Hotel Rwanda Foundation, which supports Rusesabagina, said in a statement earlier this month it was a "show trial" and that the government had failed to provide any credible evidence against him.In July, meanwhile, a media investigation claimed that Rusesabagina's daughter Carine Kanimba was spied on using Pegasus malware developed by Israeli company NSO.Investigators confirmed that a cell phone belonging to Kanimba, a US-Belgian dual national, had been compromised multiple times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hotel-rwanda-hero-paul-rusesabagina-convicted-on-terror-charges-101632135860117.html

The shots were given 21 days apart.The 10 microgramme dose was "carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity" for that age group, the statement said.- Under-5s before year-end -The side effects were "generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age", it added.Among the most commonly reported side effects in the past have been pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.Israel has already given special authorisation to vaccinate children aged 5-11 who are "at significant risk of serious illness or death" from Covid, using the Pfizer jab at the lower dosage.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.The topline results for those trials are expected "as soon as" the fourth quarter of this year, the companies said.All together, up to 4,500 children aged six months to 11 years have enrolled in the Pfizer-BioNTech trials in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain.Like its Moderna rival, the Pfizer jab is based on novel mRNA technology that delivers genetic instructions to cells to build the coronavirus spike protein, in order to evoke antibodies when bodies encounter the real virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clinical-trial-results-show-pfizer-covid-19-jab-safe-for-children-aged-511-101632135552955.html

Amaaq News Agency said that “three separate bomb attacks" targeting three "Taliban vehicles" in Jalalabad on Saturday, and another "bomb attack" Sunday on "a Taliban vehicle". "More than 35 Taliban militia members were killed or wounded, in a series of explosions that took place," it said.Local media reported that a pickup truck carrying Taliban fighters was the target of a bomb in the eastern city of Jalalabad—the capital of Nangarhar province, the heartland of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan branch—on Sunday. Witnesses also told local media that several wounded Taliban fighters were taken to hospital after the explosion, which one journalist said happened near an interchange for transport to and from Kabul. At least two people were killed on Saturday in a series of blasts in the area, the first deadly blasts since the last US forces withdrew from Afghanistan on August 30.Also watch | Taliban officials killed in blast in Afghanistan's Jalalabad: ReportsThe Taliban have not commented about the death toll in the city. Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, is the only province where the Taliban are being targeted by IS after they recaptured Afghanistan in August. Some districts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces were the heartlands of IS during the previous Afghan government and the gourd ruled those districts for five years. They were finally driven out by Afghan forces, the people uprising and the Taliban.Both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist groups, but they differ on the issues of religion and strategy, which has led to bloody fighting between the two. The Taliban and IS were enemies before foreign troops left Afghanistan. The Taliban have focused on taking control of Afghanistan, while IS affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere call for global jihad. As the Taliban face major economic and security challenges in trying to govern Afghanistan, IS attacks will further complicate those efforts.IS-K also claimed responsibility for a bloody attack that killed more than 160 Afghans and 13 US troops at Kabul airport at the end of August as tens of thousands tried to flee the Taliban.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-25-taliban-killed-is-claims-attacks-in-afghanistan-s-jalalabad-101632133181525.html

That amount of the greenhouse gas would have roughly the same short-term climate warming impact as the annual emissions of 6,200 cars in the UK. A second, smaller plume was seen above the city on Aug. 31, emitting about 39 tons of methane an hour. Methane is a super-potent greenhouse gas, with more than 80 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide over two decades. That’s one reason scientists have been calling for rapid cuts to methane emissions in a bid to slow down climate change.While many large methane leaks come from a relatively easily identified source, such as oil and gas infrastructure, it’s difficult to pinpoint the origins of the ones in Lahore. Other sources of methane include cattle farming, rice production and waste management.“These kinds of events around cities are very difficult to find the origin of,” said a spokesperson for Kayrros. “Most of the time, it’s different sources that accumulate into methane clouds.”Lahore has a history of these kinds of leaks. Since the beginning of 2019, Kayrros has analyzed dozens of methane clouds spotted around the city. Kayrros uses data collected by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite. One potential source could be the Lakhodair landfill in the northeast part of the city, said Bram Maasakkers, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research who also uses Sentinel 5-P’s data to hone in on global methane hot spots. Landfills can produce methane when the waste deposited in them decomposes without the presence of oxygen. The methane can build up for a time until it escapes to the surface and up into the atmosphere.Following Maasakkers’ work, geoanalytics firm GHGsat, which offers higher resolution detection, captured a large methane plume on July 1 from Lakhodair landfill. The rate of release was about 4 tons per hour, which GHGSat captured using its own commercial satellites. The landfill operators didn’t reply to a request for comment.Still, a cloud as large as the one detected in Lahore in August likely comes from multiple sources. Leaky cities will have to better understand and account for these emissions in order to limit their impact on the climate. Scientists consider reduction of methane leaks one of the lowest-hanging climate solutions. Satellites are helping spot these leaks, including from landfills in Bangladesh and Argentina, and highlighting the regions of the world where more action is needed.Last week, major economies, including the US and European Union, agreed to reducing methane emissions by at least 30% relative to 2020 levels before the end of this decade. The countries are now calling on others to join the voluntary pact in a bid to help the world reach climate goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellites-spot-methane-plumes-floating-above-lahore-101632128486525.html
20-09-2021||World||China launches unmanned spacecraft with supplies for under-construction space station||China on Monday launched a second unmanned cargo spacecraft, which will join the core module of the country’s under-construction space station carrying supplies for future missions, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said.The robotic Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft was launched at 3pm (China time) on a Long March 7 carrier rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China’s Hainan province. “China launched cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-3 on Monday to deliver supplies for its under-construction space station,” the official news agency Xinhua said, quoting CMSA.The Tianzhou-3 is carrying supplies including water and propellant to sustain missions in the future and will dock with China’s Tianhe space station, which is expected to become operational in 2022. The Tianzhou-3 mission is the fourth of 11 missions designed to build China’s space station, Tiangong or “Heavenly Palace”.The combination of the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft and a Long March-7 Y4 carrier rocket was transferred to the launching area of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site last week. “On September 18, Tianzhou-2, the predecessor of Tianzhou-3, separated with the space station’s core module, conducted a fly-around and docked with the space station core module’s front-facing port,” China’s official English broadcaster, CGTN said in a report on Monday.Monday’s launch comes days after China concluded its Shenzhou-12 manned mission on September 17 with three Chinese astronauts returning to Earth after completing their three-month mission including two spacewalks and setting the Chinese record for the longest crewed spaceflight mission. On June 17, China had launched the Shenzhou-12 mission carrying three astronauts to stay at an under-construction space station.The return capsule of the Shenzhou-12 spaceship, carrying astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Its successor, the Shenzhou-13 spaceship will carry another three astronauts to the space station, who will stay six months in orbit, the CMSA had said. Tianzhou-3 is carrying the supplies for the crew of Shenzhou-13, which is scheduled to be launched in October.In late April, China had sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.Once built, China’s space station, Tiangong or “Heavenly Palace, will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency had reported earlier.The ISS - from which China is excluded - comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-unmanned-spacecraft-with-supplies-for-under-construction-space-station-101632127325450.html

But he was deemed fit to receive a license for the semi-automatic shotgun he used in the attack.On the day of that attack -- one of the worst in recent Russian history -- President Vladimir Putin called for a review of gun control laws.In November 2019, a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire at his college, killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting and killing himself.In October 2018, another teenage gunman killed 20 people at a Kerch technical college in Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.He was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the US, which left 13 people dead.The Crimea shooter was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist.The country's FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.In February 2020 the FSB said it had detained two teenagers on suspicion of plotting an attack on a school in the city of Saratov with weapons and homemade explosives.Authorities have claimed that young Russians are being increasingly exposed to negative influences online, especially from the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-8-dead-in-russian-campus-shooting-second-deadly-attack-in-months-101632125914788.html

Under that agreement French defense contractor Naval Group would build 12 submarines.The blindside led to the angry diplomatic response from Paris.French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden are expected to discuss the matter in the coming days.Continued tension on the Korean PeninsulaThe soured relations among Western allies comes amid a number of missile tests conducted by the Korean neighbors.North Korea test-fired two ballistic missiles last week. A few days before that state media reported the successful launch of a new long-range cruise missile capable of hitting targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles).South Korea meanwhile successfully fired a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM).The North didn't appear to be too impressed with Seoul's technology advancements.The head of Pyongyang's defence science agency Jang Chang Ha, called the effort, a "clumsy piece of work," adding, "the homegrown SLBM unveiled by South Korea will not be able to serve as an effective means of attack at war."While Jang said the South's SLBM test was rudimentary it did display level of intent."The South's enthusiastic efforts to improve submarine weapons systems clearly presage intensified military tension on the Korean peninsula," Jang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-warns-of-arms-race-in-france-australia-submarine-row-101632125338729.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said that the administration will be created in the framework of Islamic principles and there is no need to give it the name of a ministry or its sub-division, reported The Khaama Press News Agency.The Khaama Press said Mujahid, who is also the Taliban deputy minister of information and culture, has said in his recent interview said that the women’s ministry of the previous government did nothing for the betterment of the lives of Afghan women. Despite the existence of the ministry, the women in the rural areas of Afghanistan were not given their basic rights, Mujahid added.Also read | ‘Afghanistan's future depends on…’: Unesco urges reopening girls' schoolsLast week, the Taliban replaced signs for Afghanistan’ women's ministry with those for their moral police in the capital city of Kabul. Reuters reported citing photographs and witnesses that the sign for the building was covered by a replacement in a mixture of Dari and Arabic, reading "Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" on Friday. Women staff said they were told to go home after they tried to return to work at the ministry for several weeks since the Taliban takeover last month.When the Taliban were last in power from 1996 to 2001 girls were not allowed to attend school and women were banned from work and education. The ministry for promotion of virtue and prevention of vice during their last regime became known as the group's moral police. The ministry’s interpretation of Sharia included a strict dress code and public executions and beatings. However, Taliban officials have said they will not return to their earlier fundamentalist policies, including banning girls from receiving an education.Also read | No respect: Afghan rights commission says Taliban using its cars, other assetsAs the Taliban announced the list of cabinet posts earlier this month it included an acting minister for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice but made no mention of a women's minister. And, last week a senior Taliban leader said women would not be allowed to work in government ministries with men. The latest comment by the Taliban also comes as the girls have not been allowed to attend secondary and high schools.On Sunday, dozens of women activists protested outside the women's ministry on after it was closed by the Taliban. "The ministry of women's affairs must be reactivated. The removal of women means the removal of human beings,” Baseera Tawana, one of the protesters outside the building, told Reuters. Another protester, Taranum Sayeedi, said “the woman of Afghanistan today is not the woman of 26 years ago." "You cannot suppress the voice of Afghan women by keeping girls at home and restricting them, as well as by not allowing them to go to school," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-keeping-them-out-of-school-offices-taliban-say-this-about-women-101632121424021.html
20-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Indo-Canadian MPs in Justin Trudeau cabinet expected to retain their seats||All the Indo-Canadian ministers in incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet appear to be retaining their seats in the House of Commons while New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh is comfortably ahead of his closest challenger.Between them, the three main parties, the ruling Liberals under Justin Trudeau, the principal opposition Conservatives and the NDP, have fielded as many as 54 Indo-Canadian candidates. The Liberals have 20 such nominees, the Conservatives 18 and the NDP 16.The community could be eyeing a record number of seats in the House of Commons. In 2019, as many as 23 Indo-Canadians were victorious in the Federal elections, besting the mark established in 2015, when there were 21 MPs elected.The four most prominent candidates including minister of national defence Harjit Sajjan, minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand, minister of diversity and inclusion and youth Bardish Chagger and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. The latter pair is most comfortably positioned to retain their seats. Jagmeet Singh retained the Burnaby South riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) in the province of British Columbia with 37.7% of the vote in 2019, but has since expanded his support and is polling at 44%, according to the figures available at the tracking website 338 Canada. Similarly, Bardish Chagger is almost certain of being re-elected as she is receiving support at nearly the levels that saw her win the Waterloo in Ontario in 2019, which is around 49%.Bardish Chagger’s two Indo-Canadian Cabinet colleagues are facing closer contests but both are leading. Harjit Sajjan is recording around 42% of support, around the same level as in the previous federal elections and with votes being split between his Conservative and NDP rivals, he will be tipped to win again from Vancouver South in British Columbia. Anita Anand, meanwhile, is enjoying approximately 43% support, three points lower than when she first entered Parliament in 2019 from Oakville in Ontario but still three points ahead of her Conservative opponent.Perhaps the most high-profile Indo-Canadian trailing is former minister of state in the Conservative government of PM Stephen Harper, Tim Uppal. Uppal won from Edmonton Mill Woods in Alberta with over 50% of the votes cast in 2019, but is only at 35% in this cycle, two points behind his Liberal Party rival.Areas dominated by Indo-Canadians, including the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver and sections of the cities of Edmonton and Calgary will be critical in defining the overall outcome of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-indo-canadian-mps-in-justin-trudeau-cabinet-expected-to-retain-their-seats-101632117304917.html
20-09-2021||World||Justin Trudeau vs Erin O’Toole: Who will Canadians vote for?||As Canadians head for voting booths few hours from now, the race for the 44th federal elections has turned into a battle between contrasting views of Liberal Party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his bête noire Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole on the management of Covid-19.Justin Trudeau is pitching its management of the Covid-19 pandemic and leveraging the wedge issue of vaccine passports against the principal opposition Conservatives, as its leader Erin O’Toole has opposed imposition of mandatory vaccination. That single issue has bolstered the campaign of incumbent Justin Trudeau to return to power in Ottawa, and indications on the eve of the election are that he may even have an outside chance at capturing the majority he craved for while precipitating snap elections on August 15. But to secure that, his party will require optimum results across marginal contests.With Western Canada, particularly the province of Alberta, suffering from the fourth wave of the coronavirus, Justin Trudeau has, with some success, linked that to the failure of the provincial governments which are all run by right-of-centre parties and their ties to Erin O’Toole. He has described the fourth wave as one caused by the unvaccinated while accusing Erin O’Toole for indulging anti-vaxxers. Canada, Justin Trudeau said, at a campaign event on Sunday, was “at a crossroads, at a moment where we have to make a really important choice”. That single factor may have given Justin Trudeau’s party enough impetus for a majority, which may have been unthinkable a week back.Erin O’Toole, meanwhile, is also making this a referendum, not just on Justin Trudeau but also on his “selfish” call for elections in the midst of the fourth wave, an issue that continues to resonate with voters. “Now is the time for Canadians to make a choice. We can choose to settle for second-best - for a party that hardly tries and barely delivers. Or, we can choose to believe in a brighter, better, more united future,” Erin O’Toole said.Both leaders spent some of the last day campaigning in Canada’s most populous province Ontario, which could prove crucial in determining the shape of the next government.Surveys on the last day continue to predict that the Liberals will not garner a majority. The CBC Poll Tracker placed the ruling party’s vote share at 31.3%, translating to 155 seats and the Conservatives at 30.9% and 119 seats. If that holds, both parties will lose two seats from their 2019 tally in the 338-seat House of Commons.Turnout amid voter malaise could be the x-factor in the final outcome. The agency Ipsos Canada forecast a “photo finish” to the contest. Its CEO Darrell Bricker tweeted, “Here’s what I’m seeing. It’s very close. Tory vote a bit more certain, energetic than LPC vote but incumbents have built in advantages. Do they cancel out? Hard to gauge.”It’s really that uncertain, but the edge definitely lies with Justin Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-vs-erin-o-toole-who-will-canadians-vote-for-101632115145042.html
20-09-2021||World||‘Afghanistan's future depends on…’: Unesco urges reopening girls' schools||Days after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan ordered only boys and male teachers to come back to schools, restricting entry of girls, the United Nations (UN) said that doing so violates the fundamental right to education, the Tolo News reported on Sunday.The Taliban allowed boys from classes 6-12 to and male teachers to attend schools from September 18. “All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions,” a statement from the education ministry said ahead of classes resuming.After the Islamic Emirate's violent takeover of Afghanistan last month, some schools reopened for girls up to class 6 and women were also allowed to visit universities, Hindustan Times reported last week. However, high schools still remain closed for girls.In a statement, Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), warned about the "irreversible consequences" if girls are not permitted to resume schools at all levels of education swiftly.“In particular, the delayed return of girls to secondary school may risk them being left behind in education and ultimately, in life. It increases the risk of dropping out from education altogether and exposes them to negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage,” Azoulay said.The top Unesco official pointed out that the learning disparities between boys and girls would widen and would also hinder the latter's access to higher education and life opportunities.According to Unesco, Afghanistan has made crucial gains in the education sector in the last 20 years with female literacy doubling up from 17% to 30% since 2001, the Tolo news report said.The number of girls in primary schools surged from zero in 2001 to a massive 2.5 million in 2018. The number of girls in high educational institutions in Afghanistan also went up from 5,000 in 2001 to 90,000 in 2018, the report added.Urging all relevant stakeholders in the war-ravaged country to ensure that all children have unhindered access to education within the framework of the gradual reopening of schools, Audrey Azoulay said that the future of Afghanistan depends on the educated girls and boys and the right to education must be upheld at this critical period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-future-depends-on-unesco-urges-reopening-girls-schools-101632104812102.html

The mountainous Panjshir province in the northeastern part of Afghanistan held on for the longest time, with the support from resistance leader Ahmad Massoud and former vice president Amrullah Saleh.And it was not just the men who hit back. "I fought them with stones," 24-year-old Lailuma told New York Post. She said her whole family - husband, brothers, cousins, father-in-law, mother-in-law - was fighting the Taliban.Scores of other women too joined Lailuma and said they fought the Taliban with stones.Also Read | In new diktat, Taliban ask Kabul's women workers to 'stay at home'She is now living in a displacement camp in national capital Kabul after fleeing Panjshir. Armed with enormous weapons arsenal seized from the Afghan army, Taliban fighters continued their relentless advance and captured the Panjshir valley.Another resident of the province told the Post that the fighting is still on in Panjshir. Murtaza was hiding in the mountains for day before being found by the Taliban and stuffed into the overcrowded Kabul camp.Lailuma, meanwhile, vowed to "follow Massoud till my last breath". She hopes to go back to her home some day.Panjshir fighters earned a legendary reputation for resistance, defending their mountain homes first from the Soviet military for a decade, throughout the following civil war, and against the first Taliban regime from 1996-2001.The 115-kilometre (70-mile) valley surrounded by jagged snow-capped peaks offers defenders a natural advantage.But two decades since the late veteran fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud led the Panjshiris to victory, the province is no longer as isolated.On August 30, the Taliban launched a multi-pronged offensive - with some residents claiming the Panjshiri fighters were outnumbered three-to-one.

There is a lot at stake for Canada's Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau whose popularity has plunged majorly, placing him in a tight race with Conservative leader Erin O'Toole.According to the Canadian government data, over 27 million people are eligible to vote in this year's general elections. Approximately 5.78 million ballots have already been cast in advance polls.As per the pre-poll survey, neither the Liberals nor the right-leaning Conservatives have the 38% public support needed for a majority.Trudeau called the vote two years early to seek approval for his left-of-center government's handling of the pandemic and regain the Parliamentary majority he lost in 2019. His initial healthy lead in the race vanished amid unhappiness with the early call.Here key things to know about the snap elections:> Canada is a parliamentary democracy and Monday's vote will decide the 338 seats at the lower house of the Parliament, the House of Commons.> A party needs to secure a majority of 170 seats to successfully form their government.> The polls booths will open and close at staggered times across Canada due to the several time zones across the country. The last polls will close at 7pm (local time) on the country’s west coast.> The federal election campaign comes at a time when the country is going through a Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to this, issues like climate crisis, healthcare, housing and economy are also at the centre stage.> The outcome of Monday's vote is wholly unpredictable as the two main parties who've ruled Canada since its confederation in 1867 are neck and neck, with about 31 per cent of poll respondents saying they intend to vote for each.> According to experts, in case Trudeau does win the polls, it would most likely be a minority government, which would leave him dependent again on other parties to govern.> Besides Trudeau and O'Toole, other leaders of smaller factions include the leftist New Democratic Party's Jagmeet Singh, Yves-François Blanchet of separatist Bloc Quebecois and the Green's Annamie Paul.> The final results are expected to be delayed as mail-in ballots which are expected to number in the hundreds of thousands, will be counted.> Forty-seven-year-old O’Toole is a military veteran and former lawyer. He served as a member of Parliament for nine years.> Trudeau gambled that Canadians would reward his adept handling of the pandemic and smooth vaccine rollout by returning him to Ottawa with a strong majority that would allow him to pass his agenda without opposition support. Whatever the outcome, the election will almost certainly be deemed a failure for Trudeau, as it has weakened his political standing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-today-key-things-to-know-about-trudeau-vs-o-toole-battle-101632097102753.html

Here's what's on agenda||The 76th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is set to kick off its high-level week, where discussions will be held on expanding access to Covid-19 vaccines and confronting the rising dangers of climate change. After being held virtually last year due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the event will see physical participation of leaders from members states in New York.It will go on till September 27 and the entourage accompanying the visiting leaders won't be as large as in the past due to Covid-19 restrictions. Delegations will be limited to four members each in the main UN hall, while side events will be mostly virtual.Here are the key points about the UN event:• More than 100 world leaders are expected for the annual UN General Assembly.• Heads of state scheduled to attend the event include US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.• Russia's Vladimir Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping, France's Emmanuel Macron and Ebrahim Raisi, the new president of Iran will be among the no-shows.• The UN wants diplomats to have the face-to-face time they need to address crisis issues. However, a cap has been put on the size of entourage etc to prevent it from becoming a super-spreader event.• On climate change, Johnson will call upon world leaders to take a "concrete action". His visit is seen as an important precursor to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) UN climate summit, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow in November.• US President Joe Biden will focus on ending the Covid-19 pandemic, combating the climate crisis and defending human rights, democracy and the international rules-based order in his first address as the US President to the high-level UN General Assembly session next week.• UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will meet Biden on September 20 in New York City. Biden will address the General Debate on September 21, the first address of his presidency to world leaders from the iconic General Assembly hall.• He is also likely to speak about the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized Kabul. Biden will seek to assure the world that America is still a reliable leader on the multilateral stage despite its rushed withdrawal.• Foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - US, Russia, the UK, China and France - are expected to discuss the situation in Afghanistan in a meeting on Wednesday.• The week will end with the leaders of some of America's closest allies in Asia - Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga - heading to Washington for the first in-person meeting of the Quad bloc on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/actionpacked-week-of-un-general-assembly-to-begin-here-s-what-s-on-agenda-101632101667026.html

The photo, which shows her standing between two painted wings, was captioned with a broken heart and the words: "She touched the world."Laundrie has been named a "person of interest" in the case but has not been seen since leaving his family's home in North Port, Florida, last Tuesday. North Port is on the west coast of Florida, some 70 miles (112 km) south of St. Petersburg.Before disappearing, Laundrie had refused to speak with investigators and retained a lawyer.‘Heartbroken’North Port police said they only learned from Laundrie's family on Friday that he had been missing for three days. They have since been combing a nearly 25,000-acre (10,000-hectare) wilderness preserve near North Port for him, without success."Saddened and heartbroken to learn that Gabby has been found deceased," North Port police said on Twitter. "Our focus from the start, along with the FBI, and national partners, has been to bring her home. We will continue to work with the FBI in the search for more answers."Petito and Laundrie left her home state of New York in June, heading west in the van with plans to visit national parks along the way and documenting the trip on social media.Petito posted her last photo on Aug. 25. Her family believes she was headed to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming when they last heard from her. She was last seen walking out of a hotel in Salt Lake City on Aug. 24.Last week, police in Moab, Utah, released body camera footage of an Aug. 12 encounter two of their officers had with the couple during a traffic stop.In the video, Petito is sobbing as she describes a quarrel with Laundrie that she says became physical at times. The officers did not detain the couple but insisted they spend that night separately, Petito in the van and Laundrie at a hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-says-body-matching-description-of-missing-gabby-petito-found-in-wyoming-101632100464989.html

We do not expect it to happen often, its a fluke."There were also dead bees on the scene," he told AFP by telephone.The protected birds, found on Friday, were from a colony at Simonstown, a small town near Cape Town.The area is a national park and the Cape honey bees are part of the ecosystem."The penguins... must not die just like that as they are already in danger of extinction. They are a protected species," said Roberts.The South African National Parks said the birds were taken to the foundation for post-mortems and samples sent for disease and toxicology testing."There were no external physical injuries found on any of the birds," a parks statement said.The post-mortems showed all the penguins had multiple bee stings.African penguins, which inhabit the coast and islands of southern Africa, are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list, meaning they face a high risk of extinction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bees-kill-63-endangered-penguins-in-a-beach-outside-south-africa-s-cape-town-101632099818133.html
20-09-2021||World||India upset with UK’s fresh vaccine-linked travel curbs||The latest changes in the UK government’s Covid-19-related travel restrictions have upset the Indian side as travellers who have got both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be considered “unvaccinated” and will have to undergo 10 days of quarantine.The new rules, which were unveiled on Friday and will become effective from October 4, were described by the UK as an attempt to change the current “red, amber, green traffic light system” to a single red list of countries and “simplified travel measures” for arrivals from around the world.Under these rules, only people who have got both shots of a double-dose vaccine such as Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna or the single shot Janssen vaccine “under an approved vaccination program in the UK, Europe, US or UK vaccine programme overseas” will be considered fully vaccinated.The rules also consider who have received jabs under public health bodies in Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, Brunei,Canada, Dominica, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan as fully vaccinated.Effectively, this means even Indians who have received both doses of Covishield, the local version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and one of the two main vaccines being used for the domestic immunisation programme, will be considered unvaccinated. The Indian side is especially upset as the issue of vaccination-related travel restrictions has been repeatedly taken up with the UK at the highest levels, including by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.During his visit to the UK in July, foreign secretary Shringla called for early removal of travel restrictions for Indians and the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates during his discussions with British interlocutors. He pointed out that France had cleared travellers from India without quarantine if they were fully vaccinated and had a negative test. “The ministry of external affairs has been working on solving the issue,” a senior central government functionary said on condition of anonymity.The European Union (EU) has left it to individual member states to decide on acceptance of Indian vaccination certificates and more than a dozen members have recognised Covishield.The people cited above said the change in UK rules will mostly affect students, who are now returning in large numbers to British universities or travelling to Britain to start new courses. The change will mean they will have to pay extra for more tests and to quarantine.The Indian side has also been insisting on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates in negotiations with other countries. The people said New Delhi will be in a better position to press this issue once travel to India also starts opening up.Another person aware of the matter said New Delhi will be in a better position to press this issue once travel to India also starts opening up. Apart from the a digital vaccination certificate, India recently launched a new application programming interface (API) to easily verify whether a person is vaccinated against Covid-19 or not using the CoWIN platform.Besides India, several other countries are upset by the change in the UK’s travel restrictions, including countries in Africa, South America and West Asia that have been using the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are also used in Britain.In August, the UK had eased travel restrictions on India, and at that time, travellers from the country were no longer needed to undergo 10-day mandatory hotel quarantine. The move benefited thousands of Indians, mainly students, professionals and those who have family in the UK, who had been effectively barred from travelling to Britain after the second wave of infections in India.With inputs by Rhythma Kaul||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-upset-with-uk-s-fresh-vaccine-linked-travel-curbs-101632077253049.html
