When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001, women were barred from employment and education.The issue is of major importance to the international community and could impact the amount of aid economic crisis."We have fought for almost 40 years to bring (the) sharia law system to Afghanistan," Hashimi said in an interview. "Sharia ... does not allow men and women to get together or sit together under one roof."Men and women cannot work together. That is clear. They are not allowed to come to our offices and work in our ministries."It was unclear to what extent Hashimi's comments reflected the new government's policies, although they appeared to go further than public comments made by some other officials.In the days following the Taliban's conquest of Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters that women were an important part of the community and they would work "in different sectors".He also specifically included women employees in a call for government bureaucrats to return to their jobs.All-men cabinetHowever, the cabinet appointments announced on September 7 did not include any women and there have been widespread reports of women being sent back home from their workplaces.Hashimi said the ban on women would also apply to sectors like media, where women have become increasingly prominent since the Taliban fell in 2001 and a Western-backed government was installed.Contact between men and women outside the home will be allowed in certain circumstances, for example when seeing a male doctor, he added.Women should also be allowed to study and work in the education and medical sectors, where separate facilities can be set up for their exclusive use."We will of course need women, for example in medicine, in education. We will have separate institutions for them, separate hospitals, separate universities maybe, separate schools, separate madrassas."On Sunday, the Taliban's new education minister said women could study at university, but must be segregated from men.Women have staged several protests across Afghanistan, demanding that the rights they won over the last two decades be preserved. Some rallies have been broken up by Taliban gunmen firing shots into the air.Improved women's rights - more noticeable in urban centres than deeply conservative rural areas - were repeatedly cited by the United States as one of the biggest successes of its 20-year operation in the country that officially ended on Aug. 31.The female labour participation rate stood at 23% in 2020, according to the World Bank, up from effectively zero when the Taliban last ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/men-and-women-cannot-work-together-taliban-say-sharia-law-doesn-t-allow-it-101631554700173.html

Vaccinated nursing home residents will face renewed fears of infection. Workers will weigh the danger of returning to the office as hospitals are overwhelmed, once again.Almost everyone will be either infected or vaccinated before the pandemic ends, experts agree. Maybe both. An unlucky few will contract the virus more than once. The race between the waves of transmission that lead to  new variants and the battle to get the globe inoculated won’t be over until the coronavirus has touched all of us. “I see these continued surges occurring throughout the world,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and an adviser to US President Joe Biden. “Then it will drop, potentially somewhat precipitously,” he said. “And then I think we very easily could see another surge in the fall and winter” of this year, he added. With billions of people around the world yet to be vaccinated and little chance now of eliminating the virus, we can expect more outbreaks in classrooms, on public transport and in workplaces over the coming months, as economies push ahead with reopening. Even as immunization rates rise, there will always be people who are vulnerable to the virus: Newborn babies, people who can’t or won’t get inoculated, and those who get vaccinated but suffer breakthrough infections as their protection levels ebb. The next few months will be rough. One key danger is if a vaccine-resistant variant develops, although it is not the only risk ahead. In the coming months, Bloomberg will explore the pandemic’s long-term impact on economies and markets, the pharmaceutical industry, travel and more.“We’re going to see hills and valleys, at least for the next several years as we get more vaccine out. That’s going to help. But the challenge is going to be: How big will the hills and valleys be, in terms of their distance?” Osterholm said. “We don’t know. But I can just tell you, this is a coronavirus forest fire that will not stop until it finds all the human wood that it can burn.”Covid Compared to Other PandemicsThe five well-documented influenza pandemics of the past 130 years offer some blueprint for how Covid might play out, according to Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist and professor of population health sciences at Roskilde University in Denmark. She is an expert on the ebb and flow of such events.While the longest global flu outbreak lasted five years, they mostly consisted of two to four waves of infection over an average of two or three years, she said. Covid is already shaping up to be among the more severe pandemics, as its second year concludes with the world in the middle of a third wave — and no end in sight. It’s possible that the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 won’t follow the path set by the pandemics of the past. After all, it is a different, novel and potentially more transmissible pathogen. And with a death toll of more than 4.6 million people so far, it’s already more than twice as deadly as any outbreak since the 1918 Spanish flu.Despite brutal initial waves and relatively high vaccination rates, countries including the US, UK, Russia and Israel are flirting with record numbers of cases. Immunization is helping to moderate incidences of severe cases and deaths, but surging infections mean the virus is reaching the young and others who remain unvaccinated, leading to rising rates of serious disease in those groups.Nations where vaccination has been sparse — including Malaysia, Mexico, Iran and Australia — are in the midst of their biggest outbreaks yet, fueled by the contagious delta strain. With the virus still spreading out of control in vast swathes of the planet, another novel variant could quite feasibly emerge.History shows the commonly held belief that viruses automatically get milder over time — to avoid completely wiping out their host population — is wrong, according to Simonsen. Although new mutations aren’t always more severe than their predecessors, “pandemics can in fact get more deadly during the pandemic period, as the virus is adapting to its new host,” she said.Early in the Covid outbreak, there was good reason to hope that vaccines would provide long-term protection, much like childhood shots that stop diseases such as polio. Coronaviruses have a “proof-reading” mechanism that fixes the in-born errors caused when the virus replicates, reducing the likelihood of variants emerging when the virus is transmitted from one person to another. The number of global cases has been so vast, however, that mutations are occurring anyway.“With the pandemic, we have this enormous force of infection,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. “That has counterbalanced the ability of the virus to proof-read.”As a result, Covid could be like the flu, requiring regular vaccine top-ups to remain effective as the virus evolves. Some researchers say SARS-CoV-2 is poised to become completely resistant to the first generation of vaccines. A study from Japan, which has yet to be published or peer-reviewed, suggests that potentially dangerous mutations in the delta variant are already being picked up in a global database used to track such developments. Reports of current strains breaking through vaccinations or triggering higher fatality rates have not held up to rigorous scrutiny thus far.“This is a scenario we hope won’t happen,” Simonsen said. “My God, we would have to do it all again.”Other even grimmer possibilities for the coming months include the emergence of a novel influenza virus or another coronavirus making the leap from animals into humans.“As long as there are animal reservoirs of coronavirus there is still the possibility that another zoonotic coronavirus could emerge in the future,” Subbarao said. “There is that in the background, the risk of still dealing with this one when another one emerges.”How Will Covid End?What seems clear is that the pandemic will not be over in six months. Experts generally agree that the current outbreak will be tamed once most people — perhaps 90% to 95% of the global population — have a degree of immunity thanks to immunization or previous infection. The key element should be vaccination, they say.“Without vaccination, one is like a sitting duck, because the virus will spread widely and find most everybody this autumn and winter,” said Simonsen. More than 5.66 billion doses of vaccine have been administered around the world, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. But the success of rollouts in some regions, such as the European Union, North America and China, masks the failure in others. Most countries in Africa have only given enough vaccine to cover less than 5% of their populations with a two-dose shot. India has administered enough to cover only about 26%. The pandemic will end at different times in different places, just as previous outbreaks have, said Erica Charters, associate professor of the history of medicine at Oxford University and the coordinator of a project on how epidemics end. Governments will have to decide how much of the disease they are comfortable living with, she said.Approaches vary. While some countries are still shooting for zero Covid cases, the world is unlikely to eradicate the virus completely.Nations like Denmark and Singapore, which have managed to keep cases relatively contained, are already moving toward a post-pandemic future with fewer safety restrictions. Others, such as the U.S. and U.K., are opening up even as infection numbers near records. Meanwhile, China, Hong Kong and New Zealand have vowed to keep vigilantly working to eliminate the virus locally. As a result, they are likely to be among the last places to leave behind the disruption wrought by walling out the pandemic.“The end process is not going to be uniform,” Charters said. The pandemic “is a biological phenomenon, but it’s also a political and social phenomenon.” “Even now we have different approaches to it.” It’s likely to be messy, leaving a lasting legacy for years to come. Until then, most of us will need to brace for many more months in the pandemic’s grip. “We have to approach it with our eyes wide open and with a great deal of humility,” Osterholm said. “Anybody that thinks we're going to be over this in the next few days or a few months is sorely mistaken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brace-for-more-experts-on-what-covid-19-will-bring-in-the-next-6-months-101631554777604.html
13-09-2021||World||S Jaishankar calls for ‘unrestricted’ access to Afghanistan for aid work||Reaffirming India’s long and historical ties with Afghanistan and its people, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday called for humanitarian assistance providers to be accorded “unimpeded, unrestricted” access to the country” saying it faces a grave situation that could imperil global fight against poverty and regional stability.Participating virtually or in person in a high-level meeting of the United Nations on humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, representatives from other donor countries expressed similar sentiments and stressed the need for keeping a close eye on the Taliban to ensure they delivered on their commitments.“Among the challenges that the current situation poses, is that of efficient logistics,” S Jaishankar said in an intervention in the high level meeting called by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres. “It is therefore essential that humanitarian assistance providers are accorded unimpeded, unrestricted, and direct access to Afghanistan.”He added: “Once relief materials reach that country, the world will naturally expect a non-discriminatory distribution of humanitarian assistance, across all sections.”To draw attention to the urgency of the situation in Afghanistan, S Jaishankar cited recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) numbers that show Afghanistan’s poverty level could shoot from the current 72% to 97%, which, he added, “would have catastrophic consequences not just in our collective fight against poverty, but also for regional stability”.S Jaishankar underscored India’s interest - and concern - in Afghanistan as an immediate neighbour with long-time ties to the people of that country. “India’s own approach to Afghanistan has always been guided by its historical friendship with its people,” he said, adding, “This will continue to be the case.”S Jaishankar cited some of the more than 500 projects India undertook and carried out in Afghanistan, with footprints in all of its 34 provinces. In all, India provided assistance worth more than $3 billion in Afghanistan since the fall of the first Taliban regime in 2001.Shut out of Afghanistan by the Pakistan-backed Taliban now, as it was during the first Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001, India is recalibrating its approach to Afghanistan, and has sought to focus the future of its ties with the country on its people.“Today, I wish to underline that in the face of a grave, emerging situation. India is willing to stand by the Afghan people, just as in the past, to ensure that this (aid and humanitarian work) happens speedily and effectively,” S Jaishankar said, adding, “We believe that the international community must come together to create the best possible enabling environment.”Similar concerns and reservations were expressed by other countries, mainly those who have provided aid to Afghanistan and have committed to continue doing so, irrespective of the regime change in Kabul.The United States, for instance, announced $64 million additional aid to Afghanistan but called for the Taliban to assure safe passage and security of aid workers as they have promised. “Words are not good enough. We must see action,” said US permanent representatives to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “The international community is unified in this message - humanitarian aid agencies cannot do their job if the Taliban does not uphold those core commitments and humanitarian principles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/s-jaishankar-calls-for-unrestricted-access-to-afghanistan-for-aid-work-101631552011028.html

After being isolated for 14 days in Xiamen, he was transferred to the Xianyou county’s centralised isolation point on August 19 to continue the quarantineAccording to Fujian province’s epidemic prevention and control measures, Lin started a 7-day home health surveillance on August 26 after completing 21 days of centralised quarantine. “The official notification showed that during the 21-day quarantine period after entry, Lin Moujie conducted a total of nine nucleic acid tests and one serum test, and the results were all negative,” the report said.“The epidemic situation in the city of Putian is ‘serious and complex’ and it is very likely more new cases will emerge in communities, schools and factories,” state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday.“Authorities have traced 841 close contacts of the positive cases and further 1,690 close contacts of the aforesaid close contacts. A total of 1,293 people have been put under medical observation in designated places,” the Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.Local authorities are now scrambling to contain the latest flare-up before the mid-Autumn festival (September 21) and the National Day holidays in October.Authorities in Putian, a manufacturing hub for sneakers, clothing, and electronic components, has closed cinemas and gyms, sealed off some entries and exits to highways and told residents not to leave the town until the outbreak is controlled.Offline lessons in all schools in Putian have been suspended and China’s national health authority has sent a team of experts to the city, which has a population of 3.2mn.Since the latest resurgence emerged on Friday, the county of Xianyou has conducted extensive nucleic acid testing in Fengting township and five neighbouring townships. “By 4pm on Sunday, 196,758 people had been tested, of which 121,087 samples returned results,” the report said.As of September 12, mainland China, where Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019, had recorded 95,248 confirmed cases with a cumulative death toll of 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/negative-in-9-covid-tests-man-may-be-source-of-new-outbreak-in-china-101631540009685.html
13-09-2021||World||WHO envoy warns of increasing risk of Covid variants evading vaccines||Variants that can eventually evade Covid vaccines are increasingly likely with vast parts of the world unprotected, and rich countries should hold back on booster doses until others catch up, according to a special envoy to the World Health Organisation (WHO).“Variants that can beat the protection offered by vaccines are bound to emerge all over the world in the coming months and years,” David Nabarro, the WHO envoy, said in an interview Monday with Bloomberg Television. “This is an ongoing battle, and we need to work together.”Nabarro issued the warning as some countries such as the UK prepare to give an extra dose to people already vaccinated. With thousands of Covid deaths occurring each day 20 months into the pandemic, health advocates are urging governments and manufacturers to take action to narrow a glaring gap in access to shots.The envoy called for prioritising global needs over national agendas. Rich countries could use up all the manufacturing capacity for their booster programs, leaving minimal supplies for the rest of the planet, he said. The WHO has said that while in most instances the variants of concern lead to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness of varying degrees, the shots mostly retain their ability to protect against severe disease. Nabarro said he worries about the threat rising as the virus continues to spread.“This world is struggling with a dangerous virus that is constantly evolving and new variants are emerging, and there will be more,” he said. “I think this virus is most definitely here to stay for the foreseeable future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-envoy-warns-of-increasing-risk-of-covid-variants-evading-vaccines-101631537449577.html

The four crew members, said SpaceX, together represent the mission pillars of “leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity.”Also Read | SpaceX Inspiration4 to have 1st all civilian space mission with minimal trainingHere’s a look at the crew members as they get ready for an exciting journey ahead:(1.) Jared Isaacman (Leadership): An accomplished jet pilot, Isaacman, who is thirty-eight years old, is the mission commander for Inspiration4. In 1999, Isaacman, then aged only 16, started, from the basement of his home, Shift4Payments, which, today, is the leader in integrated payment processing solutions. He has participated in more than 100 air shows, and dedicated each performance to charitable causes. In 2011, Isaacman co-founded Draken International, the world’s largest private air force, which trains pilots for the United States Armed Forces.He described this mission as a “personal and lifelong dream.” Isaacman said, “I recognise the tremendous responsibility which comes with commanding this mission. I hope it reinforces how far inspiration can take us, and the extraordinary achievements it leads to here on Earth.”(2.) Hayley Arceneaux (Hope): At the age of 10, Arceneaux was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Now fully cured, she obtained an undergraduate degree in Spanish in 2014, and, in 2016, completed her Physician Assistant (PA) degree. Arceneaux currently works as a PA with leukemia and lymphoma patients at St. Jude Children’s Hospital, where she received treatment for cancer. “The mission is not only raising crucial funds for the lifesaving work of St. Jude, but also showing cancer survivors that anything is possible,” Arceneaux said of Inspiration4.(3.) Chris Sembroski (Generosity): A former member of the US Air Force, Sembroski always had a natural curiousity about outer space. In his college days, he served as a volunteer with ProSpace, a grassroot lobbying effort that called for legislation to help open space travel, and allow companies (such as SpaceX) to exist. After retiring from service in 2007, Sembroski earned Bachelor of Science (BS) in Professional Aeronautics.About Inspiration4, Sembroski said, “It’s a dream come true. I hope that this flight will inspire kids to dream the impossible, ushering in a new era of space exploration open to all.”(4.)

Many wore white as a sign of political neutrality but waved Brazilian flags -- often identified with the right -- or the rainbow colors of the LGBT movement, or wore "Lula 2022" t-shirts.A single message resounded through the crowd: "Out with Bolsonaro."Hundreds of white-clad protesters gathered in downtown Sao Paulo, the nation's economic engine, for a rally that was dwarfed by the 125,000 Bolsonaro supporters who converged on the same streets last Tuesday."We don't favor Lula or Bolsonaro here," civil engineer Ivete Ramalho, age 64, told AFP."But I'm scared about how many people came out to support a president (Bolsonaro) who has done nothing for the country, who has only brought conflict."Almost a year out from the election, polls show Lula, a former union leader who served as president from 2003 to 2010, with a sizeable lead over the incumbent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-protest-brazil-s-bolsonaro-after-week-of-tension-101631495471278.html
13-09-2021||World||UN seeks to raise $600 million for Afghanistan amid growing humanitarian crisis||The UN chief Antonio Guterres will convene a high-level humanitarian conference on Monday in an attempt to raise more than $600 million for Afghanistan amid the growing crisis in the war-torn nation. The country was thrown into turmoil after the Taliban seized power in a military takeover following the US drawdown in August.Even before the Taliban's seizure of Kabul last month, half the population of Afghanistan—or 18 million people—was dependent on aid. The figure looks set to increase due to drought, shortages of cash and food, with the United Nations officials warning about an impending crisis since the US withdrew its troops from the country.The US pullout also led to an abrupt end of billions of dollars in foreign donations, leading to an increase in pressure on the UN and its humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan.The conference to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, will be attended by top officials of the world body. It will also see participation from the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross Peter Maurer, as well as dozens of government representatives including German foreign minister Heiko Maas."Now more than ever, Afghan children, women & men need support & solidarity from the international community. I will convene a high-level humanitarian conference for Afghanistan on 13 September to advocate for a swift scale-up in funding and full, unimpeded access to those in need," Guterres tweeted last week as he announced the conference.According to a survey by the UN World Food Programme in August and September, 93 per cent of the 1,600 Afghans polled were not consuming sufficient foods, mostly because they could not get access to cash to pay for it. "It's now a race against time and the snow to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan people who need it most. We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out,” Anthea Webb, deputy regional director of the World Food Programme, said earlier.On September 9, UN special envoy Deborah Lyons warned that Afghanistan was in danger of "a total breakdown of the economy and social order" without an infusion of money. Lyon also cautioned that the crisis could push millions more Afghans into poverty and hunger, as he urged world leaders to come together to help Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-seeks-to-raise-600-million-for-afghanistan-amid-growing-humanitarian-crisis-101631496518979.html
13-09-2021||World||North Korea tests new long-range cruise missile: Report||North Korea says it successfully test fired what it described as newly developed long-range cruise missiles over the weekend, its first known testing activity in months, underscoring how it continues to expand its military capabilities amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations with the United States.The Korean Central News Agency said Monday the cruise missiles, which had been under development for two years, successfully hit targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away during flight tests on Saturday and Sunday.The North hailed its new missiles as a “strategic weapon of great significance” that meets leader Kim Jong Un’s call to strengthen the country’s military might, implying that they were being developed with an intent to arm them with nuclear warheads.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was analyzing the North Korean launches based on US and South Korean intelligence.Kim during a congress of the ruling Workers’ Party in January doubled down on his pledge to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of US sanctions and pressure and issued a long wish list of new sophisticated assets, including longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, spy satellites and tactical nuclear weapons. Kim also said then that his national defense scientists were developing “intermediate-range cruise missiles with the most powerful warheads in the world.”North Korea’s weapons tests are meant to build a nuclear and missile program that can stand up to what it claims as US and South Korean hostility, but they are also considered by outside analysts as ways to make its political demands clear to leaders in Washington and Seoul.The North’s resumption of testing activity is likely an attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the the presidency of Donald Trump.North Korea ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, continuing a tradition of testing new US administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at measuring Washington’s response and wresting concessions.But there hadn’t been any known test launches for months after that as Kim focused national efforts on fending off the coronavirus and salvaging his economy.KCNA said the missiles tested over the weekend traveled for 126 minutes “along an oval and pattern-8 flight orbits” above North Korean land and waters before hitting their targets.“The test launches showed that the technical indices such as the thrust power of the newly developed turbine-blast engine, the missiles’ navigation control and the end guided hit accuracy by the combined guided mode met the requirements of designs. In all, the efficiency and practicality of the weapon system operation was confirmed to be excellent,” it said.It appeared that Kim wasn’t in attendance to observe the tests. KCNA said Kim’s top military official, Pak Jong Chon, observed the test-firings and called for the country’s defense scientists to go “all out to increase” the North’s military capabilities.Kim’s powerful sister last month hinted that North Korea was ready to resume weapons testing while issuing a statement berating the United States and South Korea for continuing their joint military exercises, which she said was the “most vivid expression of US hostile policy.”She then said the North would boost its pre-emptive strike capabilities while another senior official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would leave the allies facing a “security crisis.”The allies say the drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response to Covid-19.Talks between the United States and North Korea have stalled since the collapse of a summit between Trump and Kim in 2019, when the Americans rejected the North’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Kim’s government has so far rejected the Biden administration’s overtures for dialogue, demanding that Washington abandon its “hostile” policies first.The latest tests came after Kim threw an unusual parade in capital Pyongyang last week that was a marked departure from past militaristic displays, showcasing anti-virus workers in hazmat suits and civil defense organizations involved in industrial work and rebuilding communities destroyed by floods instead of missiles and other provocative weaponry.Experts said that the parade was focused on domestic unity as Kim now faces perhaps his toughest test with North Korea wrestling with US-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons, pandemic border closures that are causing further strain to its broken economy, and food shortages worsened by floods in recent summers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-tests-new-long-range-cruise-missile-report-101631494856304.html
13-09-2021||World||Canada polls: Man charged with assault for throwing stones at PM Justin Trudeau||Canadian police have arrested and charged an opposition politician over an incident of throwing gravel at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the town of London, Ontario earlier this month during a pre-poll campaign stop.Shane Marshall, 25, resident of St Thomas, was charged with “assault with a weapon” on September 6 and appeared before a court in London town on Saturday, local police said.Marshall, until recently, led the association for the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) in his local riding or constituency. He was recently fired from his position by the party.Trudeau was uninjured in the gravel-throwing incident that occurred as he was preparing to board his campaign bus. Mediapersons accompanying him said some of them were also hit by small stones.On Friday, an unidentified man was charged by police for threatening Trudeau while he was campaigning in the town of Cambridge, Ontario in August. Trudeau has faced protests by noisy crowds at several campaign stops ahead of the September 20 snap elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-man-charged-with-assault-for-throwing-stones-at-pm-justin-trudeau-101631491453576.html
13-09-2021||World||Afghan women can study in university but mixed classes banned||Women in Afghanistan will be allowed to study in universities as the country seeks to rebuild after decades of war but gender-segregation and Islamic dress code will be mandatory, the Taliban’s new higher education minister said on Sunday.The minister, Abdul Baqi Haqqani, said the new Taliban government would “start building the country on what exists today” and did not want to turn the clock back 20 years to when the movement was last in power.But he remained unapologetic about bringing an end to mixed sex classes. “We have no problems in ending the mixed-education system,” he said. “The people are Muslims and they will accept it.”The issue of women’s education has been one of the central questions facing the Taliban as they seek to persuade the world that they have changed since the harsh fundamentalist rule they imposed in the 1990s when women were largely banned from studying or working outside the home.Taliban have said women will be able to study and work in accordance with sharia law but strict dress rules will apply. Haqqani said hijab religious veils would be mandatory for all female students but did not specify if this meant headscarves or compulsory face coverings.He said female students would be taught by women wherever possible. “Thanks to God we have a high number of women teachers. We will not face any problems in this. All efforts will be made to find and provide women teachers for female students,” he said in Kabul.Some fear the new rules will exclude women because the universities do not have the resources to provide separate classes. “It all depends on the university’s capacity,” he said. “We can also use male teachers to teach from behind a curtain, or use technology.” Classrooms divided by curtains have already been seen in many places since the Western-backed government collapse and the Taliban seized Kabul last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-women-can-study-in-university-but-mixed-classes-banned-101631473240038.html
13-09-2021||World||Justin Trudeau denies asking Jody Wilson-Raybould to lie in SNC-Lavalin case||A controversy that dogged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2019 returned to prominence on Saturday as Jody Wilson-Raybould, a former attorney general in his first government, accused him of asking her to “lie” to cover up for a brewing scandal.Wilson-Raybould, who was AG and justice minister in Trudeau’s first cabinet in 2015, made the allegation in her forthcoming memoir, Indian In the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power, to be published on Tuesday.In the excerpts carried by the daily Globe and Mail, Wilson-Raybould recounted meetings with Justin Trudeau early 2019 as controversy swirled over an article in the same newspaper that “inappropriate” pressure was being brought upon her to allow Quebec-based firm SNC-Lavalin to cut a deal over an investigation into the bribery of Libyan officials being undertaken by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). In the excerpt, she writes, “In that moment, I knew he wanted me to lie - to attest that what had occurred had not occurred. Lie to protect a Crown government acting badly; a political party; a leader who was not taking responsibility.”Justin Trudeau immediately denied the charge while campaigning in the Greater Toronto Area, as he said, “I did not want her to lie. I would never do that. I would never ask her that. That is simply not true.” Jody Wilson-Raybould’s memoir was originally scheduled for publication in October, but the date was advanced and the book will become available six days before the snap elections on September 20.Jody Wilson-Raybould, the most prominent indigenous leader in Justin Trudeau’s first cabinet, was moved to veterans’ affairs in early 2019 and she resigned thereafter. Later, testifying before a House of Commons justice committee, she said, “I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.” Trudeau, at that time, denied those allegations and said he “completely disagrees” with her version of events. However, those developments led to the departure of Trudeau’s closest aide in the PMO, principal secretary Gerald Butts.Trudeau was admonished on the matter by Canada’s ethics commissioner Mario Dion. In a report on the SNC-Lavalin affair in August 2019, he noted, “The prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms Wilson-Raybould.” Trudeau denied those charged as well, stating, “The commissioner took the strong view that all contact with the attorney general on this issue was improper. I disagree with that conclusion, especially when so many people’s jobs were at stake.” Trudeau’s argument for the company was that it was a major Canadian multinational and a large employer in Quebec and legal action against it would jeopardise its operations.In the book, Jody Wilson-Raybould also explains the reasons for her resignation - “There was now no trust. I had lost any belief I had in the prime minister. And there is no room in cabinet for someone who thinks the prime minister is untrustworthy. There was also no room for me in a government that would act this way on matters of core principle such as upholding the rule of law.”Trudeau countered those charges on Saturday, as he said, “I genuinely, obviously, regret how it ended up. But I don’t regret the things that I chose to do to stand up for Canadians and move forward; because every step of the way, that’s what has to guide me. That’s my responsibility as prime minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-denies-asking-jody-wilson-raybould-to-lie-in-snc-lavalin-case-101631472563343.html
13-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Man charged with assault for throwing stones at Justin Trudeau||Canadian police have arrested and charged an opposition politician over an incident of throwing gravel at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the town of London, Ontario earlier this month during a pre-poll campaign stop.Shane Marshall, 25, resident of St Thomas, was charged with “assault with a weapon” for the September 6 and appeared before a court in London town on Saturday, local police said.Marshall, until recently, led the association for the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) in his local riding or constituency. He was recently fired from his position by the PPC.Trudeau was uninjured in the September 6 gravel-throwing incident that occurred as he was preparing to board his campaign bus, and mediapersons accompanying him reported that some of them were also hit by small stones.On Friday, an unidentified man was arrested and charged by police for threatening Trudeau while he was campaigning in the town of Cambridge, Ontario in late August.Trudeau has faced protests by noisy crowds at several campaign stops ahead of the September 20 snap elections, mostly over his announcement that Covid-19 vaccines will be mandatory for public sector employees, and for travel on domestic trains and flights. Trudeau faced protests also in Surrey, British Columbia, while a campaign event in the town of Bolton, Ontario was cancelled last month due to the gathering of a large number of protesters. However, previous incidents were limited to hurling of abuses at Trudeau.Trudeau said last week that he will “not allow” such “anti-vaxxer mobs” to “dictate how this country gets through this pandemic”. Those attacks have drawn criticism from the PM’s principal rival, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, who had tweeted, “This is disgusting and I condemn these actions in the strongest terms possible.”Trudeau is not the only leader to have faced an attack during his campaign. Earlier this month, PPC leader Maxime Bernier was hit with an egg at an event in Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan. Bernier disavowed the London incident in a tweet the day after it happened, saying, “Someone hit me with an egg last week. I note that none of the other party leaders made any statement. Some idiot threw pebbles at Mr. Trudeau yesterday. I condemn it. Words are our weapons. But physical violence is always wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-man-charged-with-assault-for-throwing-stones-at-justin-trudeau-101631426059302.html
