Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant.It is the strictest law against abortion rights in the United States since the high court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and part of a broader push by Republicans nationwide to impose new restrictions on abortion. At least 12 other states have enacted bans early in pregnancy, but all have been blocked from going into effect.The high court's order declining to halt the Texas law came just before midnight Wednesday. The majority said those bringing the case had not met the high burden required for a stay of the law.“In reaching this conclusion, we stress that we do not purport to resolve definitively any jurisdictional or substantive claim in the applicants’ lawsuit. In particular, this order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts,” the unsigned order said.Chief Justice John Roberts dissented along with the court's three liberal justices. Each of the four dissenting justices wrote separate statements expressing their disagreement with the majority.Roberts noted that while the majority denied the request for emergency relief “the Court’s order is emphatic in making clear that it cannot be understood as sustaining the constitutionality of the law at issue.”The vote in the case underscores the impact of the death of the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year and then-president Donald Trump's replacement of her with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Had Ginsburg remained on the court there would have been five votes to halt the Texas law.Justice Sonia Sotomayor called her conservative colleagues' decision “stunning.” “Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand,” she wrote.Texas lawmakers wrote the law to evade federal court review by allowing private citizens to bring lawsuits in state court against anyone involved in an abortion, other than the patient. Other abortion laws are enforced by state and local officials, with criminal sanctions possible.In contrast, Texas' law allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in facilitating abortions. Among other situations, that would include anyone who drives a woman to a clinic to get an abortion. Under the law, anyone who successfully sues another person would be entitled to at least $10,000.In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan called the law “patently unconstitutional,” saying it allows “private parties to carry out unconstitutional restrictions on the State’s behalf.” And Justice Stephen Breyer said a “woman has a federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion during” the first stage of pregnancy.After a federal appeals court refused to allow a prompt review of the law before it took effect, the measure’s opponents sought Supreme Court review.In a statement early Thursday after the high court's action, Nancy Northup, the head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers challenging the law, vowed to “keep fighting this ban until abortion access is restored in Texas.”“We are devastated that the Supreme Court has refused to block a law that blatantly violates Roe v. Wade. Right now, people seeking abortion across Texas are panicking — they have no idea where or when they will be able to get an abortion, if ever. Texas politicians have succeeded for the moment in making a mockery of the rule of law, upending abortion care in Texas, and forcing patients to leave the state — if they have the means — to get constitutionally protected healthcare. This should send chills down the spine of everyone in this country who cares about the constitution," she said.Anti-abortion groups cheered the court's action.“We are celebrating this decision for what it is, baby steps in the right direction toward the obvious conclusion that Roe is fatally flawed and must go," said Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, in a statement.Texas has long had some of the nation’s toughest abortion restrictions, including a sweeping law passed in 2013. The Supreme Court eventually struck down that law, but not before more than half of the state’s 40-plus clinics closed.Even before the Texas case arrived at the high court the justices had planned to tackle the issue of abortion rights in a major case after the court begins hearing arguments again in the fall. That case involves the state of Mississippi, which is asking to be allowed to enforce an abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-blasts-high-court-failure-to-block-texas-abortion-curb-101630601058990.html

The survey for the sixth Population and Housing Census was undertaken under former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and got completed in 2017. The results, however, were delayed after some provinces, including Sindh and Balochistan flagged the issue of undercounting.Pakistan Bureau of Statistics published the data of the sixth Population and Housing Census after approval from a constitutional body that resolves power-sharing disputes between the provincial and federal governments. While Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan caved in under pressure from the Imran Khan government, Sindh continued to raise objections on the census data.According to the 2017 census data, Pakistan’s overall population has grown to 207.68 million, an increase of around 75 million since 1998 when the country recorded 132.3 million people. The census suggests that the Muslim population in Pakistan grew by 96.47% while the population of other religious minorities reported negligible growth and even shrank in some cases.Hindus in Pakistan account for 1.73% of the total population while Christians make up for 1.27% of Pakistani residents. Other minorities like Ahmaddiyas account for less than 0.1% of Pakistan’s population. Karachi Supreme Court attorney Neel Keshav claimed that the Hindu population in Pakistan is likely to be much higher, reported Pakistan Today."The 1998 census data showed a Hindu population of nearly 2 million. Yet the new census showed that it had only risen to 3.5 million in 20 years," the Pakistani daily quoted Keshav as saying.Human rights groups have frequently raised concerns over the condition of religious minorities in Pakistan. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said in a 2019 report that both the Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continued to report cases of forced conversion."Even though Christians have migrated overseas and converted to Islam, our church records make us suspect that Christians may have been undercounted by at least half a million. We're struggling to find accurate data, and somehow the government is not helping. It is not investigating," Pakistan Today quoted Center for Social Justice Director Peter Jacob as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-faces-accusations-of-undercounting-hindus-christians-in-latest-census-101630602766899.html

"They suffered heavy losses."However a spokesman for the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, a grouping of rebels, said it had full control of all passes and entrances and had driven back efforts to take Shotul district at the entrance to the valley."The enemy made multiple attempts to enter Shotul from Jabul-Saraj, and failed each time," he said, referring to a town in the neighbouring Parwan province.The spokesman said NRFA forces had also killed large numbers of Taliban fighters on two fronts since clashes first broke out earlier in the week."It has been proven to the other side that they cannot resolve this issue through war," the spokesman said in reference to the Taliban's losses.Both sides provided varying figures for the other's casualties, without offering evidence. It was not possible to verify the numbers of fighters on either side killed.The Taliban says the Panjshir valley is surrounded on all four sides and a rebel victory is impossible. The rebels say they will refuse to surrender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-rebels-and-taliban-claim-heavy-casualties-in-fighting-over-valley-101630600036014.html

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of ivermectin for humans to treat infections caused by internal and external parasites and not for Covid-19. The AMA said in a statement that they are alarmed by the reports of exponential increase in prescribing and dispensing of the drug in the past few months.A recent study found that ivermectin dispensing from outpatient retail pharmacies in the United States shot up to 39,000 prescriptions in the week ending January 8, 2021, as against an average of 3,600 prescriptions per week in the pre-pandemic period. The AMA highlighted that calls to poison control centres due to ivermectin ingestion have increased five-fold from their pre-pandemic baseline.“As such, we are calling for an immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing, and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial,” the association said, urging physicians and pharmacists to warn patients against its use outside of FDA-guidance.Also Read | ‘Lower mortality...’: Goa govt defends Ivermectin’s efficacy against Covid-19The US drug regulator recently clarified that they haven’t reviewed the data to support the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients, though some initial research is underway. Referring to the misinformation around the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients, the FDA warned that any drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous.“There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong,” the regulator said, adding that patients can also overdose on the drug which can nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, allergic reactions, dizziness, seizures, coma and even death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-medical-association-calls-for-immediate-end-to-ivermectin-use-in-covid-treatment-101630597388429.html

Massoud was known as the Lion of Panjshir and led the strongest resistance against the Taliban from his stronghold in the valley until he was assassinated two days before 9/11.His son Ahmad Massoud is currently leading the resistance against Taliban along with former vice president of Afghanistan Amrullah Saleh and former defence minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in Panjshir valley. Panjshir is separated from Tajikistan by Badakhshan province where Tajiks and Uzbeks are a majority rather than Pashtuns, who form the core of the Taliban.This is the only region which was not captured by the Soviets or the Taliban in the 1980 and 1990s.Rabbani, meanwhile, served as the political head of the Northern Alliance, when it took on the Taliban in the 1990s.Tajik President Emomali Rahmon issued the decree awarding the Order of Ismoili Somoni 1st Class on both the leaders posthumously. According to the president's official website, the award has been given to Massoud and Rabbani "for their assistance and mediation in organising inter-Tajik peace negotiations in 1993-1996". The honour is a recognition of the role the two leaders played in ending the civil war in Tajikistan.The website also said that the decrees have been issued as Tajikistan marks 30 years of its independence on September 9, 2021.The award comes just days after American soldiers left, and fuels speculation that Tajikistan will support the resistance being led by Ahmad Massoud and Saleh.Saleh is a Tajik and fought with Massoud's father as he took on the Taliban. After the US' withdrawal, Saleh said that he will not betray his mentor and vowed to continue fighting Taliban.The Order of Ismoili Somoni is Tajikistan's highest distinction. It is named after Isma'il ibn Ahmad, the ruler of the Samanid dynasty, also known as Ismoili Somoni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tajikistan-honours-lion-of-panjshir-ahmad-shah-massoud-after-two-decades-101630593138174.html

They marched on the tarmac of Kabul airport, the last stronghold of the western forces till August 31, even fired in the air expressing their happiness.But just days later, all that has changed.According to a report in Al Jazeera, the Taliban have said that they "feel betrayed" because Americans disabled military helicopters and planes before their departure from Kabul.The fighters said they expected the Americans to leave helicopters in one piece for their use, according to Al Jazeera report. "We believe it is a national asset and we are the government now and this could have come to great use for us," the report added.Early on Tuesday (August 31), Kabul airport was littered with artifacts of the withdrawal. Inside the terminal were scattered piles of clothes, luggage and documents. Several CH-46 helicopters used by American forces were parked in a hangar. The US military said it disabled 27 Humvees and 73 aircraft before leaving.The Taliban are now left with 48 aircraft, though no information is available on how many of these are operational.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Wednesday that their technical teams are "repairing and cleaning" the airport and advised people to avoid the area for the time being.For now, the Taliban appear to be engaged in getting Afghanistan running again, a task that could prove challenging to fighters who have spent most of their lives waging an insurgency in the countryside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-they-feel-betrayed-because-us-disabled-helicopters-planes-report-101630586829214.html

The secretive regime, which has not reported a single case of Covid-19, suggested that the vaccines should be given to severely affected countries, according to the UN agency that manages the supply of Covid-19 vaccines for lower-income countries under the COVAX scheme.North Korea was the first country to impose strict nationwide lockdown and close its borders in January last year to stop the spread of coronavirus from neighbouring China where the virus first emerged. While the isolated country has not officially reported any Covid-19 case to the World Health Organization (WHO), analysts doubt the claim.North Korea's public health ministry "has communicated that the 2.97 million Sinovac doses being offered to DPR Korea by Covax may be relocated to severely affected countries in view of the limited global supply of Covid-19 vaccines and recurrent surge in some countries", AFP quoted a spokesperson for Unicef as saying.Watch | Why watchdog IAEA is alarmed over North Korea restarting reactorThe public health ministry will continue to communicate with the COVAX facility to receive vaccines in the coming months, agencies reported quoting Unicef spokesperson.In July, a South Korea think tank said that Pyongyang had also rejected shipments of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine over safety concerns. Several Western countries had temporarily halted administering AstraZeneca’s vaccine after cases of blood clotting were reported in some people. But most of them resumed their vaccination campaign after the WHO and European medical agency insisted that the benefits outweigh the risk.Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS), affiliated with South Korea’s spy agency, said in its report that Pyongyang was also not keen on Chinese vaccines due to concerns over their efficacy.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-rejects-nearly-3-million-chinese-covid-19-shots-gives-humanitarian-angle-report-101630573980809.html

This is the latest round of spat between the two companies in race to dominate the space internet field.According to documents posted on Twitter by CNBC's space reporter Michael Sheetz, Amazon, founded by Bezos, asked the United States' Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to dismiss SpaceX's latest amendment to its Starlink satellite network. Musk's company responded by calling it "the latest in continuing efforts by Amazon to slow down competition".And then came Musk's salvo. "Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job," the SpaceX founder tweeted in response to Sheetz's post.Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job pic.twitter.com/XifRICQ62kStarlink is SpaceX's ambitious project, launched by Musk to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites. It is competing with Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is also aiming to dominate the field.Musk explained how the system will work. "Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber & shorter path. Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!" he said in response to another post on Twitter.Musk also said that Starlink's satellites will be launching in next few months with inter-satellite laser links, which would not require local downlink.Other major companies including Google, Apple and Amazon also rely on satellites to transmit data, as do telecom providers, government agencies and universities working on space research, insurance sources said.The number of active satellites has jumped 68% from a year ago and more than 200% from five years ago.There are 8,055 satellites roaming Earth's orbits, 42% of them inactive, according to Seradata, which tracks the statistics. Most operate in the Lower Eart Orbit (LEO), which extends 2,000 kilometres beyond Earth.LEO satellites are much smaller than GEO satellites. Typically the size of a small refrigerator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-full-time-job-is-to-file-lawsuits-against-spacex-elon-musk-101630568277662.html

Deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Sranikzai, has said that the announcement will come in a day or two. This will mark a crucial development in the history of Afghanistan as after the Taliban form the government, countries will decide whether to recognise the Taliban rule or not.Supreme leaderThe Islamist movement's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is expected to have ultimate power over a governing council, with a president below him, reports said.“Consultations are almost finalized on the new government, and the necessary discussions have also been held about the cabinet. The Islamic government that we will announce will be a ... model for the people. There is no doubt about the presence of the Commander of the Faithful (Akhunzada) in the government. He will be the leader of the government and there should be no question on this,” Anamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, told Tolo News.Will there be a ceremony?Taliban official Ahmadullah Muttaqi said on social media that a ceremony was being prepared at the presidential palace in Kabul.Inclusive government?Earlier, the Taliban said that the new government in Afghanistan will not be a totalitarian government and will have representation of all ethnic communities of Afghanistan.Sharia lawThe Taliban have made it clear that the guiding light of the Afghan rule would be Sharia. Sharia is Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran. In Arabic, Sharia literally means "the clear, well-trodden path to water".Panjshir ResistanceThe anti-Taliban force in Afghanistan, led by Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Massoud, will continue their protest as a negotiation between Panjshir leaders and Taliban leaders has failed. Reports claimed that conflict is going on in the Panjshir province which had remained undefeated during the earlier regime of the Taliban between 1996 and 2001.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sharia-law-supreme-leader-what-we-know-so-far-about-taliban-government-101630566647353.html

"This resistance is based in Panjshir, not for Panjshir and for Panjshir. Today, this valley hosts all the country and is a hope for all the Afghan people who are escaping from oppression, revenge, prejudice, slipping on people's property and your dark thinking," news agency ANI quoted Saleh as saying.The former vice president of Afghanistan also slammed the Taliban leaders who are claiming to form a more moderate government this time in comparison to their previous regime. "If the nation trusts you a bit, then why are people lining up on the borders of the country," said Saleh, adding, "Have you asked yourself why? Dominating the structure in the last years has not meant stability, and your modern dominance over the soil does not mean stability.""Stability and sustainability is a consistent system with components that your group is far from," he also said, as per the ANI report.Saleh, along with Ahmad Massoud, the son of famous Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, another leader of the resistance, are presently in Panjshir valley and trying to mount a challenge to the Taliban. Panjshir is the only province left that is not in control of the Taliban group.He further lashed out at the Taliban for their history of violence and forced military takeover of the country following the withdrawal of US forces. "The collapse of the economy and absence of service machines will soon destroy people and your weapons and harsh methods will not be effective against the uprising and anger of people. Only time is between, not if and unless," Saleh told the terrorist group.He further urged the international leaders to focus on the Taliban's action and not their words. "It is enough to pay attention to the interview and performance of your appointed first ranks so that you know that the Afghan administration is not possible today with a bunch of obsessed illiterates," he said.Last month, the Taliban captured Kabul after mounting a swift offensive in a matter of few weeks. So far, the Taliban have controlled all the regions apart from the Panjshir province.The US completed its troop withdrawal on Monday, after 20 years of anti-terrorist operations in the country. In the fallout of troop withdrawal, the Taliban has taken control of the city and is set to announce a new Afghan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/your-dominance-over-afghan-soil-doesn-t-mean-stability-resistance-leader-sale-101630565251524.html

There was a plane that was burned all the way. You could see its cockpit, while the rest of the plane resembled the skeleton of a fish,” Lt. Colonel Coleman remarked.Also Read | 'Will continue fighting,' says resistance force in Afghanistan's Panjshir as negotiation talks with Taliban failMeanwhile, Captain Kirby Wedan, who piloted the plane that led the formation of the final five aircraft out of Afghanistan, said that the situation was “definitely very tense.” The Air Force officer said, “We were definitely on the edge watching everything going on to make sure that we were ready. What added to our stress what that the planes were parked in such an area of the airport which had been attacked and breached in the past.”Also Read | China trying to 'take over' Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, says ex-diplomat Nikki HaleyCaptain Wedan further revealed that during the night, a group of civilians entered the airfield and tried to board the aircraft but were stopped by US Army troops securing the planes.Also Read | Pakistani terrorists coming to Afghanistan: Ghani informed Biden on July 23General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the commander of the Air Mobility Command who was watching the final departure from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, said she could hear instructions being issued by Lt.

Proud of a you all.” Major General Donahue was the in-charge of security for the evacuation mission.The group’s departure from Afghanistan meant that American forces were no longer present in the country after landing here following the 9/11 attacks. Their withdrawal was earlier scheduled to end by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the attacks, but was preponed to August 31.

"I am declaring a state of emergency to help New Yorkers affected by tonight's storm," New York Governor Kathy Hochul tweeted, after Ida, which slammed into the southern United States as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, caused tornadoes and flooding as it steamed north.This emergency was declared hours after the weather department had issued a 'flash flood emergency for New York City. It was the first time that such a warning was issued for the city.Nearly all New York City subway lines were suspended as water stormed inside the tunnels. According to local media reports, Central Park saw more than 3 inches of rain in one hour. Flight operations were also disrupted in the city.At least five flash-flood emergencies were issued Wednesday evening by the National Weather Service, stretching from just west of Philadelphia through northern New Jersey.Many people also took to social media to share photos and videos of the rainwater gushing over inside subway platforms and flooded streets.Video from 145th st on 1 line.

02-09-2021||World||Canada: Trudeau announces $61.80bn in new spending to woo voters||Struggling to arrest a slide in support ahead of the September 20 general elections, the ruling Liberal Party of Canada released an expansive election manifesto on Wednesday that includes 78 billion Canadian dollars ($61.80 billion) in new spending to be funded from higher taxes on banks and insurance companies and individuals in higher income brackets.However, the 86-page manifesto has no mention of India while it does talk of measures to “respond to illegal and unacceptable behaviour by authoritarian states, including China, Russia, and Iran”.Much of the manifesto recaps the achievement of the government of outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the past six years, including various benefits announced to counter the economic challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In an introduction to the manifesto, Trudeau said, “This is our moment to decide where our country goes from here. This is our time to choose. And this platform is our path ahead for generations to come.” It was released at an event in Toronto, with Trudeau adding that this was “the plan that Canada needs to be even more ambitious, to draw all that we’ve learned in fighting this crisis of Covid, to apply it to the crisis of climate change, of housing, of health care, of child care”.It addresses the current crisis in Afghanistan, promising to increase the number of refugees to be accepted from that country from 20,000 to 40,000. However, it does not mention the logistics of that plan. It added that a Liberal Party government will “continue to help support Afghan citizens through humanitarian assistance and to work with our allies to protect democratic and human rights, including for women, girls, and minorities”. The new plan has many giveaways and is meant to be funded through revenue generated via new sources such as raising corporate income taxes “on the largest, most profitable banks and insurance companies who earn more than 1 billion Canadian dollars per year” and creating a “minimum tax rule so that everyone who earns enough to qualify for the top bracket pays at least 15% every year”.The manifesto was launched as the ruling party continues to trail the principal opposition Conservatives in voter preference across a range of fresh surveys. In fact, according to the poll tracker 338 Canada, the Conservatives led by Erin O’Toole are now in a position to garner the highest number of seats, at 143, with the Liberals at 132. That agency, along with others, places the Conservatives at least 2% ahead in national vote share.A warning for Trudeau was sounded by pollster Darrell Bricker, CEO, Ipsos Public Affairs, as he tweeted, “An election that was supposed to be an opportunity for Trudeau and the LPC to score a quick majority has turned now into a fight for survival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-trudeau-announces-61-80bn-in-new-spending-to-woo-voters-101630560491737.html

"All top Taliban leaders were born and brought up in Pakistan. This has been our 'service' that we trained them and many more might be studying," Sheikh Rashid said in an interview on Hum News programme called 'Breaking Point with Malick'.At the same time, he countered the international criticism of Pakistan aiding the Taliban and said, "Mullah Baradar was in Pakistan jail. America asked us to release him.""We want peace on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Peace suits both Pakistan and Afghanistan border," Sheikh Rashid said.Pakistani terrorists coming to Afghanistan: Ghani informed Biden on July 23This comes at a time when Pakistan is officially throwing its weight behind Afghanistan and is also refuting allegations that Pakistan had a hand in the fall of Afghanistan. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday said the world must not abandon Afghanistan as that would have dangerous consequences. "Such a move would have dangerous consequences and no one would be spared,” the foreign minister said.This is not the first time that Pakistan leaders admitted the country's link with the Taliban. Neelam Irshad Sheikh earlier said that the Taliban will help Pakistan in Kashmir.Pakistan's aid to the Taliban remains an open secret as Pakistan attempts hard to distance itself from the Taliban. Reports have revealed that in the last phone call between US President Joe Biden and then Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on July 23, Ghani informed Biden that Afghanistan was under full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not alone. There was full support of Pakistan and several international terrorists, mostly from Pakistan, had already infiltrated Afghanistan at that time.Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, has recently countered the allegation that Pakistan had a crucial role behind the rise of the Taliban in his scathing letter where he said that the fall of Kabul was because of the corrupt army and not Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-top-taliban-leaders-born-and-trained-in-pak-101630559079232.html

An FAA spokesman told Reuters the vehicle "deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America. The FAA investigation is ongoing."Virgin Galactic acknowledged in a statement to Reuters that "the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan" but added it "did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the protected airspace."The company said "the flight did drop below the altitude of the airspace ... "for a short distance and time (1 minute and 41 seconds) before re-entering restricted airspace."It added that "at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public." The company said it is "working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights."Virgin Galactic said that "when the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters."The New Yorker reported that during the flight a red light flashed on the ship's console, indicating an "entry glide-cone warning." Virgin Galactic said that "at no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory."Branson, one of six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the flight, soaring more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert, in July touted the mission as a precursor to a new era of space tourism and said the company he founded in 2004 was poised to begin commercial operations next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-probes-off-course-descent-of-richard-branson-s-virgin-galactic-spaceflight-101630547066817.html

She was charged with two misdemeanor counts of violating Hawaii's emergency rules to control the spread of Covid-19. She had been in custody on $2,000 bail until a judge released her at a hearing Wednesday and scheduled another hearing in three weeks.State Public Defender James Tabe, whose office represented her at hearings this week, declined to comment on her case, noting it's not clear if she'll hire her own attorney or apply to have a public defender represent her.The voicemail at a number listed for her in court documents was full Wednesday. She didn't immediately respond to a text message from The Associated Press.In addition to the suspicious card, authorities determined that the travel information she provided listed she would be staying at a Waikiki Holiday Inn but didn't include a reservation number and return flight information, court documents said.An assistant manager at the hotel confirmed to Lau she didn't have a reservation. Lau said in the court document that he tried to call the number she listed but her voicemail was full. He said he emailed her and didn't get a response.Lau said he searched for her on Facebook and found a photo showing a “distinctive tattoo on her left hip area.”The tattoo helped authorities find her at a Southwest Airlines counter when she was trying to leave Honolulu on Aug. 28, the court document said. She showed her ID and vaccination card to Lau, who informed her she was being arrested for falsifying vaccination documents.Other visitors to Hawaii have been arrested for fake vaccination cards, including a father and son from California, who appeared in court via Zoom Wednesday and waived their rights to a jury trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-maderna-tourist-arrested-in-hawaii-after-spelling-error-on-covid-19-vaccine-card-101630546034156.html

Thursday marks the 138th birthday of the scientist.In the doodle, the inventor is illustrated with a test tube in his gloved hands. The illustration also had lice on the wall, and a human body at the extreme left corner, while the tech giant's name is illustrated with a microscope, beakers on bunsen burners, and test tubes in holders all placed on a lab table.Typhus spreads through lice in the body and has been responsible for millions of deaths throughout history.Weigl was born in 1883 in Moravia's Prerau, modern-day Czech Republic, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was a native German speaker but was raised in Poland where he adopted the Polish language and culture.In 1907, Weigl graduated with a degree in biological sciences from Poland's Lwow University. He then went on to earn doctoral degrees in zoology, comparative anatomy and histology -- the study of the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues.During the spread of Typhus across Europe, Weigl carried out innovative research in which he grew infected lice in his lab and harvested their stomachs to be mashed into a vaccine. At the time of research, Weigl himself got infected with the disease but recovered.In 1936, Weigl's vaccine was successfully administered to its first beneficiary.For his landmark work, Weigl was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize. He died in 1957 at the age of 74.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-doodle-honours-polish-biologist-rudolf-weigl-who-invented-typhus-vaccine-101630545601520.html

You are going to see more lone wolf situations,” she added.“We need to make sure we are protected. We need to make sure our cybersecurity is strong because actors like Russia are going to continue to hack us because we show no signs of willingness to fight back. We need to watch China because I think you are going to see China make a move for Bagram Air Force Base,” Haley apprehended.“I think they are also making a move in Afghanistan and trying to use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India. So, we have got a lot of issues. The biggest thing he should do is strengthen our allies, strengthen those relationships, modernise our military, and make sure we are prepared for the cyber-crimes and the terrorist crimes that are headed our way,” she said in response to a question.Haley slammed Biden for his disastrous withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. “By the end of that speech that President Biden gave, it was the beginning of the lame-duck presidency for Joe Biden,” she said.“I mean, he has lost the trust and confidence of every member of the military and the military families that I'm proud to be a part of. He has lost the trust and confidence of our allies who are now negotiating without us because they don't know why we are doing what we're doing,” she said.Biden, she alleged, has lost the trust and confidence of the American people. “If you look at the fact that the jihadists are celebrating in the streets because America has run out of town – and they left them with billions of dollars worth of equipment and ammunition as a housewarming present,” she said.“You couldn't ask for a more embarrassing, humiliating situation than what we have right now. The world is more definitely a dangerous place. Just because we are out of Afghanistan does not mean this war is over,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trying-to-take-over-bagram-airbase-in-afghanistan-says-ex-diplomat-nikki-haley-101630545009392.html
02-09-2021||World||Biden always said Afghan leaders needed to lead: White House on US President's last phone call to Ghani||Talking about the last phone call between Joe Biden and Ashraf Ghani, accessed by news agency Reuters, the White House said that it won't get into private diplomatic conversations or leaked transcripts of phone calls but what has been reported as Biden's last advice to Ashraf Ghani remained Biden's public advice for Afghanistan leaders, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said."What the President conveyed publicly, and certainly privately as well, repeatedly, to Afghan leaders — as did our national security officials — is that it’s important that the leaders in Afghanistan do exactly that: lead and show the country that they are ready to continue to — the fight against the Taliban; that they have the will for the Afghan National Security Forces to continue that fight even as our US forces leave," the press secretary said.Reuters reported that the last phone call between Biden and Ashraf Ghani was on July 23-- just 23 days before the fall of Kabul in which none of the leaders appeared to have any inkling about the imminent takeover of the country by the Taliban. In that call, Biden promised Ghani close air support and advised him to mobilise Afghan leaders to change the perception of the world that the Taliban were winning.To this advice, Ashraf Ghani informed Biden that the country was facing a full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not alone as over 10 to 15,000 Pakistani terrorists were already inside the country at that time.The White House said that Biden has been consistently conveying this to the Afghan leadership that they were required to lead. "The President has consistently conveyed — and I just noted an example — publicly that the Afghan leadership, at the time, needed to do exactly that: lead. They needed to come together in a cohesive manner. They needed to be united. They need to just show the country and the Afghan people they were going to fight and they are going to lead through this transition, even as US forces left. That is entirely consistent with what he has said publicly throughout," the press secretary said.Confirming that it's true that the fall of Kabul was not anticipated, Psaki said, "what I can reiterate for you is that we have stated many times that no one anticipated — the vast majority, I should say — there may have been individuals and agencies, so I don’t want to eliminate that option — but our national security team and no one in Congress or, I would say, most people out in the public anticipated that the Taliban would be able to take over the country as quickly as they did or that the Afghan National Security Forces would fold as quickly as they did."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-always-said-afghan-leaders-needed-to-lead-white-house-on-us-president-s-last-phone-call-to-ghani-101630544541443.html

Panjshir is the only province, where the anti-Taliban forces have maintained a stronghold and which is out of the Taliban's reach following their blitz across Afghanistan.On Wednesday, the Taliban, who have negotiated with the leaders of the resistance force, said that the talks the group’s efforts to find a political solution to a dispute "went in vain" and led to no results.In an audio message on Wednesday, Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of Taliban’s commission for guidance & encouragement, also urged Panjshir residents to join the Islamic Emirate and promised that it will be a home for all Afghans. "We still want to prevent war and find a political solution," Motaqi said in the message posted on social media.The Panjshir valley lies in the Hindu Kush mountains, approximately 90 miles north of the capital city of Kabul, which fall into Taliban control on August 15 after the collapse of the Afghan government. The Taliban have been unable to take this major holdout of resistance after steamrolling across pro-government troops in a matter of months.The resistance in Panjshir is being led by Ahmad Massoud, son of famous Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, and Amrullah Saleh who is a current acting president of the South Asian nation. Presently they are all in Panjshir valley and trying to mount a challenge to the Taliban.Meanwhile, the last remaining troops of the United States have left the country, ending the two-decades-old war in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-continue-fighting-says-resistance-force-in-afghanistan-s-panjshir-as-negotiation-talks-with-taliban-fail-101630544952451.html

In the administrative vacuum that has since followed the retreat of the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani regime, the Taliban rulers are struggling the keep the country afloat with their newfound administrative duties at the end of 20 long years of military activity and chaotic warfare.Also Read | US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'The Taliban are finding it difficult to keep hospitals and government machinery running, news agencies reported. Prices have soared amid the tumultuous state of economic affairs, and the financial system is in shambles after 40 years of war while liquidity and inflation continue to rise. Foreign aid and currency reserves now seem largely out of reach for Afghanistan, as many in power in the international monetary community take to a policy of alienating the Taliban. The new rulers of the country, too, have provided little detail so far on how they will acquire funds to get the financial system fully functional.Under the Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001, Afghanistan had little functioning banking sector and although a handful of commercial banks retained licences, none were operational and few loans were made. This time, too, their immediate concern is staving off economic collapse. However, it seems unlikely that the militants will get quick access to most of the roughly $10 billion in assets held by DAB, much of which is outside of the country.The Taliban have ordered banks to reopen, but strict weekly limits on withdrawals have been imposed. Since 80% of the transactions done by banks are in dollars, it is critical that the Taliban leaders make their relationship with the US, bankers say.Also Read | Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawalWashington, on the other hand, says that it would keep having conversations with the Taliban that serve US interests and look at how it could give aid to Afghanistan without benefiting any government that it forms. The European Union has also said that it will need to engage with the Taliban but won't rush into formally recognising them as the new rulers of Afghanistan anytime soon.The Kabul airport, too, lies currently inoperable, but the Al Jazeera television reported that technical experts from Qatar had arrived at the Taliban's request to discuss resuming operations there.Outside the Afghan capital of Kabul, humanitarian organisations have warned of impending catastrophe as severe drought has hit farmers and forced thousands of rural poor to seek shelter in the cities. But foreign donors are unsure about who to speak to. Taliban officials have, however, said the problems will ease once a new government is in place, and urged other countries to maintain economic relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinking-currency-soaring-prices-how-afghanistan-looks-as-taliban-take-charge-101630542301695.html
02-09-2021||World||US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'||The United States said it is in no rush to recognise the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Neither do countries that the US has spoken to in the recent past have any such rush, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a press briefing on Wednesday (Washington time). "It will be very dependent on their behaviour and whether they deliver on what the expectations are of the global community," she said.Commenting on whether there is any communication channel between the Taliban and the White House after the pullout of the last army personnel, the press secretary said that some form of communication and coordination will be necessary as the Taliban oversee the majority of Afghanistan.Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawalThe United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in coordination with many countries which makes it clear what the countries want from the Taliban. "These are many of the countries that worked with us to help build a list of 100 countries — more than half the countries in the world — making clear we are united in what we expect from the Taliban," the press secretary said.The evacuation operation which has come to a close was the largest airlift in US history. But the fact that the Taliban allowed safe passage for more than 120,000 people does not make the US think that the Taliban are good actors. "We don't. But we needed to work with them in coordination to get this done," the press secretary said.America's former envoy to the United National Nikki Haley said the US needs to closely watch China as it is making a move to take over the Bargam air force that was controlled by the US for the last 20 years. “The first thing you should do is immediately start connecting with our allies, whether it's Taiwan, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's Israel, whether it's India, Australia, Japan, all of them, and reassure them that we will have their back and that we need them as well,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recognition-will-depend-on-us-doesn-t-think-taliban-are-good-actors-101630540406154.html
02-09-2021||World||Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawal||With the United States finally completing its troops withdrawal in Afghanistan, hastily ending its extended two-decade-long military mission in the war-torn country, one of its top generals has now expressed "pain and anger" over the situation which has long plagued the land now overrun by Taliban insurgents. "When we see what has unfolded over the last 20 years and over the last 20 days, that creates pain and anger," said General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Wednesday. "And mine comes from 242 of my soldiers killed in action over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan."Also Read | US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'Milley added, however, that he was a "professional soldier" and was thus going to contain his pain and anger and continue to execute the mission at hand.Also watch | Top US General on Afghanistan: ‘How we got to this moment will be studied for years’﻿Notably, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which was completed on Tuesday morning, has been dissed as "hasty" and "chaotic" by many of the Biden administration's critics, including former US president Donald Trump, several Republican leaders, and even officials in China and Russia.The rapid takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban came amid the US withdrawal, and many considered it a "tactical mistake" to leave the war-torn nation at the mercy of the militants. “Afghanistan under Biden was not a withdrawal, it was a surrender," Trump had said, adding that leaving people behind for death is an "unforgivable dereliction of duty, which will go down in infamy."Now one of Biden's top military generals has also voiced displeasure with the administration's decision to mark a chaotic and messy exit from Afghanistan's longest war. "I have all the same emotions, and I'm sure the secretary does, and anyone who served," General Milley said. "And I commanded troops. And I wasn't born a four-star general. I have walked the patrols and been blown up and shot at and RPG'd and everything else. My pain and anger come from the same as those grieving families, the same as those soldiers that are on the ground."Also Read | Sinking currency, soaring prices: How Afghanistan looks as Taliban take chargeThe "mess" that the Biden administration had made over the Afghanistan withdrawal was exacerbated, according to critics, by the terror attack on Kabul airport which killed 13 US service members, including 10 members of the Marine Corps, many of who were barely in their twenties.US defence secretary Lloyd J Austin III on Wednesday honoured those who died over the course of the war in Afghanistan. "Our forces risked their own lives to save the lives of others, and 13 of our very best, paid the ultimate price," he said, adding that the administration has managed to evacuate around 6,000 American citizens and a total of more than 124,000 civilians from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-general-in-pain-and-anger-over-afghanistan-situation-after-withdrawal-101630539744439.html
02-09-2021||World||One student killed in shooting at North Carolina high school||One student was killed in a shooting at a North Carolina high school Wednesday and authorities were looking for the suspect, officials said.Winston-Salem police Chief Catrina Thompson, fighting back tears, told a news conference that Mount Tabor High School went into immediate lockdown as emergency responders, sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived just after noon to search for the suspect, who she said was believed to be a student at the school.The injured student was taken to a local hospital, where he died, Thompson said.Forsyth County Sheriff Bobby Kimbrough Jr., who joined deputies and officers at the school on the initial call, identified the dead student as William Chavis Raynard Miller Jr.“I haven't cried in a while, but I've been crying since I left the hospital,” Kimbrough said.Sheriff’s office spokeswoman Christina Howell said all other students were safe and authorities were “actively seeking the suspect.”Police blocked roads to the school, which has an enrollment of more than 1,500 students, and numerous emergency vehicles were on the scene. Parents frantic for information parked their cars on the sidewalks several blocks from the school as police directed traffic away from campus. Students and parents could be seen walking toward a nearby shopping center.Christopher Johnson said his son told him that he heard the gunshots while in the school gym and students were told to hide because there was an active shooter on campus.“You see stuff like this in the media,” said Johnson, whose son was still at the school awaiting transportation to a pickup point. “It’s scary to know that it actually reached out and touched you this time. My son’s not a victim, but he’s part of this and he’ll probably remember this forever.”Later, law enforcement vehicles were seen escorting school buses with Mount Tabor students off the campus to be reunited with their parents.The sheriff's office said other schools in the area were on lockdown as a precaution but no other shootings or injuries had been reported.Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement that he has been briefed by law enforcement and noted this was the second school shooting in the state this week. A 15-year-old was charged after a student was shot and wounded during a fight Monday at a Wilmington high school.“We must work to ensure the safety of students and educators, quickly apprehends the shooter and keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-student-killed-in-shooting-at-north-carolina-high-school-101630534430786.html
02-09-2021||World||UN committee to discuss Taliban travel sanctions||The UN 1988 sanctions committee, currently chaired by India and responsible for overseeing sanctions on designated Taliban leaders, is set to meet this month to consider the extension of travel exemptions for top Taliban leaders such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.Under UN Security Council resolution 1267, adopted about a month after the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, the Taliban and its leadership were subject to various sanctions, including an assets freeze, a travel ban and an arms embargo, for sheltering al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.In 2019, Baradar, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, Qatar, and 14 members of the group’s negotiating team were granted a travel exemption by the UN in early 2019 to join peace talks with the US as part of efforts to end the war in Afghanistan. Those talks led to the signing of a peace deal between the Taliban and the US in February 2020.The Taliban leaders have used the travel exemption, which has been renewed from time to time, to travel to several other countries, including Russia and Central Asian states. Before the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, Afghan officials had been pressing the Indian side to tighten the scope of the travel exemption to ensure it wasn’t misused by the Taliban leaders. The 14 members of the Taliban negotiating team include Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, Shahabuddin Delawar, Mullah Abdul Manan Omari, the brother of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Anas Haqqani, the brother of Haqqani Network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. Both Stanekzai and Anas Haqqani have been involved in an informal outreach towards India and are key Taliban negotiators.Though the travel exemption is set to be renewed by September 20, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that it was too early to say what could transpire at the upcoming meeting of the 1988 sanctions committee.There are currently no indications that other restrictions on designated Taliban leaders would be eased, or that some of them would be delisted, the people said.India’s envoy to the UN, TS Tirumurti, is the chair of the 1988 sanctions committee till December 31, and the two vice-chairs are the envoys from Russia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.With Russia and China working closely with the Taliban leadership since the group assumed power on August 15, the stance taken by other permanent members of the Security Council – the US, the UK and France – will set the stage for 1988 sanctions committee’s approach towards the designated Taliban leaders.However, the UN secretary-general’s special representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, had suggested in a special Security Council meeting on August 6 that the travel exemption should be used to pressure Taliban leaders to deliver on commitments to ensure peace.Speaking at a time when the Taliban were still fighting Afghan security forces, Lyons had said: “It should be made clear to the Taliban Political Commission that the exemptions to the travel ban and the high protocol with which they have been received by many of the countries were, in fact, predicated on a commitment and progress in the peace process.” Further extension of the exemption, she added, “must be predicated on real progress on peace”.Brian O’Toole, a former senior US treasury department official, wrote in a recent article for the Atlantic Council that the lack of clarity over the Taliban’s sanctions status by the UN may have “serious ramifications” at a time when the group is seeking international legitimacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indialed-un-sanctions-committee-to-decide-travel-exemptions-for-taliban-leaders-101630516202974.html
