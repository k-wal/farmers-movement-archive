Many also raised doubts about the value of mass boosters.The panel, however, voted in favour of authorising Pfizer vaccine boosters for everyone aged 65 and above, as well as for people at high risk of developing severe Covid-19.The decisions came after a day-long meeting full of data presentations and at times charged debate that was convened by the FDA.“I think this should demonstrate to the public that the members of this committee are independent of the FDA,” said Archana Chatterjee, dean of Chicago Medical School.UNGA: Spotlight on NYC’s Covid vaccine mandatesSome 100 world leaders will descend on New York next week in a partial return of the annual UN General Assembly (UNGA) despite Covid-19 concerns, with progress sought on pressing global problems - starting with the pandemic.Much of the focus at the UNGA will be on the subject of coronavirus vaccine mandates that were recently declared by New York City. Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has kicked up a firestorm by saying he will attend it even though he’s unvaccinated against Covid-19 - something that could violate the city’s vaccine mandates.In Melbourne on Saturday, several police officers were wounded and hundreds of protesters were arrested in Australia’s second most populous city at violent clashes during an anti-lockdown march.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-panel-rejects-booster-proposal-101631987234620.html

Noting that a lot of voters were “torn” between options, Trudeau said it wasn’t an “impossible choice” to support the incumbent Liberals. “You can actually vote for the party that is going to stop the Conservatives and move forward with the strongest plan to get things done,” the PM asserted.Rival O’Toole made a similar pitch, but to those who have gravitated to the extreme right People’s Party of Canada. “There are actually millions of Canadians who are very frustrated with Mr Trudeau. If they allow that frustration to do anything other than vote Conservative, they’re voting for Mr Trudeau.”The CBC poll tracker gives the Liberals a 61% chance of forming a minority government, but only 16% odds of garnering the majority that Trudeau targeted while precipitating snap elections on August 15.With 31.6% support, the Liberals are likely to get 153 seats, 17 short of the majority mark of 170 and four short of its 2019 tally. At 31% support, the Conservatives could also lose seats, down to 118 from 121 it won last time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-main-rival-tell-people-not-to-vote-for-smaller-parties-101631987046677.html

The statement, issued on Friday, made no mention of women teachers or girl pupils.Secondary schools, with students typically between the ages of 13 and 18, are often segregated by sex in Afghanistan. During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have faced repeated closures and have been shut since the Taliban seized power.The United Nations said it was “deeply worried” for the future of girls’ schooling in Afghanistan. “It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays. For that, we need female teachers to resume teaching,” the UN’s children’s agency Unicef said.Primary schools have already reopened, with boys and girls mostly attending separate classes and some women teachers returning to work. The country’s new regime has also permitted women to go to private universities.In a further sign that the Taliban’s approach to women and girls hasn’t softened, they appeared to have shut down the government’s ministry of women’s affairs and replaced it with a department meant for enforcing strict religious doctrine during their first rule.Videos posted on social media showed women workers from the ministry protesting outside after losing their jobs.Pak supports inclusive Afghan governmentPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said he has “initiated a dialogue” with the Taliban for an inclusive Afghanistan government having Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks in it, a day after SCO members sought representation for all ethnic, religious and political groups in the new dispensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-girls-says-afghanistan-as-secondary-schools-reopen-101631986759852.html

Turns out, as The New York Times summed it up, “Almost everything senior defence officials asserted in the hours, and then days, and then weeks after the August 29 drone strike turned out to be false.”“Sorry” is not enough for the survivors of the deadly drone strike. Emal Ahmadi, whose three-year-old daughter Malika was killed on August 29, when the US hellfire missile struck his elder brother’s car, told AP on Saturday the family demands Washington to investigate who fired the drone and punish those responsible for the attack.“That is not enough for us, to say sorry,” said Ahmadi. “The USA should find the person who did this.” Ahmadi said the family is seeking financial compensation for their losses.On Friday, General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, commander of the US Central Command that carried out the drone strike, said at a press meet, “Our investigation now concludes that the strike was a tragic mistake. This strike certainly did not come up to our standards, and I profoundly regret it.”He said the US was considering ex-gratia payments to the victims and, going forward, strikes in Afghanistan “will be under a higher standard”.2 die in Jalalabad blastsTwo people were killed when three blasts struck Jalalabad on Saturday, one of which targeted a Taliban vehicle, in the country’s first deadly attack since the United States withdrew.“In one attack, a Taliban vehicle patrolling in Jalalabad was targeted,” a Taliban official who asked not to be named told AFP. “Women and children were among the injured.”An official from the health department in Nangarhar told AFP three people, not two, died and 18 were wounded, contradicting local media reports that said the attacks left two dead.Photos taken at the site of the blast showed a green pick-up truck with a white Taliban flag surrounded by debris as armed fighters looked on. Jalalabad is in Nangarhar, heartland of the IS group’s Afghanistan branch.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drone-attack-in-kabul-killed-civilians-confesses-america-101631986525163.html

The three countries are known for their high levels of equality, low unemployment and modern social service systems.Speaking about humanitarian issues, Rashid said that Pakistan has requested the international community for providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan as it does not want anyone to die of hunger in the war-ravaged country.This is not the first time when Interior Minister Rashid has compared Afghanistan with Scandinavian countries.Last week, he said it would be unfair for the world to expect Afghanistan to become as prosperous as some Scandinavian countries in eight days and cautioned that freezing of Afghan accounts could create a humanitarian crisis.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US' complete troop withdrawal on August 31 after a costly two-decade war. This forced Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country to the UAE.The Taliban insurgents stormed across Afghanistan and captured all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away.Thousands of Afghan nationals and foreigners have fled the country to escape the new Taliban regime and to seek asylum in different nations, including the US and many European nations, resulting in total chaos and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-possible-afghanistan-becomes-scandinavian-country-in-17-days-pak-minister-101631968482903.html

While two IED blasts took place at 10.30 am, the third one struck 50 minutes later, the reports said.The twin blasts targeted two convoys of vehicles, carrying members of the Taliban. The third one exploded near the university hospital.The convoys were travelling from Jalalabad (the capital of Nangarhar province) to Kabul. The road from the eastern city to the national capital is dominated by Zadran tribe, whose cadre the Haqqani network that is led by interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani.Kabul watchers say that the explosions are a result of infighting between various factions of the Taliban. Jalalabad is the fifth-largest city of Afghanistan which is about 80 miles from Kabul.Local media reported that another IED blast took place at 11.50am in the Angor Bagh area, which also targeted the passing Taliban vehicles. Any injury or casualty in this blast is still being determined. An IED also exploded in the Rokhan Mina area at 12.30pm, the media reports said. The target of the attack is not known yet.The attacks are the first deadly blasts since the new government was established in Afghanistan.Also on Saturday a sticky bomb exploded in the capital Kabul wounding two people, said police officials. The target of the Kabul bomb was not immediately clear.Two Taliban vehicles were also targeted in Sherzad and Hisarak districts of Nangarhar on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jalalabad-blasts-result-of-infighting-between-taliban-factions-report-101631960612133.html

18-09-2021||World||Which Covid-19 vaccines are approved? Here’s the global progress||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues its rampage across the world, with the total number of infections having crossed 227 million (227,655,835, to be precise) on the John Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker. The total number of deaths from the infectious disease has also just crossed the grim milestone of 4 million. In a silver lining, however, vaccination rates have been picking up across the world; more than 5.85 billion doses have been administered across 184 countries, according to data collected by the Bloomberg news agency. In India, a record landmark in the vaccination campaign against Covid-19 was achieved on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on September 17. In an extraordinary feat, the country vaccinated as many as 25 million citizens, more than three times the average daily total of the past month.There are more than 200 clinical trials worldwide testing potential vaccines, known as candidates, against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). So far, only six of the vaccine candidates have been approved around the world. Here's a review of the Covid-19 vaccine situation so far:How many vaccines have been approved so far?Note: To be considered a globally-approved Covid-19 vaccine in this chart, a candidate needs to have either been approved by the US FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or cleared for emergency use by the FDA, the EMA, or the WHO.The approved vaccines were developed by:BioNTech-Pfizer (mRNA vaccine)Moderna (mRNA vaccine)AstraZeneca (nonreplicating vector vaccine)Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)(nonreplicating vector vaccine)Sinopharm (inactivated virus vaccine)Sinovac (inactivated virus vaccine)How far have researchers gotten in the development of a vaccine?Still, the majority of vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are still in a preclinical phase. That means the vaccine candidates are being tested in animal experiments, for example, rather than with human patients. When those tests are deemed successful, candidate vaccines can move into clinical trial phases. That's when they are tested with humans. There are three clinical trial phases for efficacy and safety before a vaccine can be approved for use by humans. The phases differ from each other, most significantly in their scale:Some companies, such as BioNTech-Pfizer in Europe, and Sinovac in China, have tested their vaccine candidates in several trials in parallel. For example, they have tested the same vaccine but in different age groups or with different dosages.If clinical trials are successful, a company can formally apply to regulatory bodies to have their vaccine approved for use by the general public.Three regulatory authorities are considered to be particularly important in this context: The FDA in the US, the European EMA, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency in Japan.How fast can vaccines be developed?t can take several years to develop an effective and safe vaccine. On average, it takes between 10 and 12 years, but it can take longer. The search for a vaccine against HIV has been going since the early 1980s — so far without success.In the case of Covid-19, researchers are racing to shorten the time it usually takes because of the ongoing pandemic. Despite the pressure that that brings, vaccine developers, manufacturers, and the World Health Organization (WHO) say there will be no compromises on safety.Research teams are aiming to accelerate, or limit, the time it takes to get to approval during the pandemic to an average duration of 16 months.That will only be the beginning. Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is approved and produced, researchers start phase IV, during which they observe the progress of vaccinated patients.Which types of Covid-19 vaccines are in development?Researchers are pursuing 13 different approaches for vaccines against Covid-19.Most of the vaccine candidates use a protein-based subunit — so, instead of using a complete pathogenic virus, they are built on a small component of it, such as a protein found in its outer shell.That protein is administered to patients in a high dose, with the aim of inducing a fast and strong reaction by the human immune system.The hope is that the immune system will "remember" the protein and trigger a similar defense reaction if or when it comes into contact with the actual virus.Vaccines against hepatitis B and HPV (human papillomavirus), for example, are based on this principle.Four additional approaches have made it to phase III.Nonreplicating viral vectors are a type of so-called recombinant vaccines: Researchers modify the virus's genetic information by switching on or off or altering certain functions. By doing that they can, for example, reduce the infectiousness of a virus. Such genetic modifications, however, require that science already has detailed knowledge about which parts of a virus' genetic material are responsible for which functions in order for them to be able to manipulate them effectively. The term "nonreplicating" means that the virus in the vaccine enters cells in the human body but is unable to reproduce there on its own.Inactivated vaccines use a "dead" version of the pathogen. They tend to provide a lower level of protection than live vaccines. Some vaccines in this class have to be administered several times to achieve sufficient immunity. Examples of inactivated vaccines include ones against influenza and hepatitis A.RNA vaccines follow a different strategy, without using any "real" component of the virus at all. Instead, researchers aim to trick the human body into producing a specific virus component on its own. Since only this specific component is built, no complete virus can assemble itself. Nevertheless, the immune system learns to recognize the non-human components and trigger a defense reaction.Vaccines based on virus-like particles use another approach: Researchers only use the empty virus envelope — without any genetic material inside of it — to train the immune system.With DNA-based vaccines, patients are injected with the virus's genetic makeup for the human body to produce virus particles themselves without being actually infected. Confronted with these self-produced virus particles, the immune system is supposed to learn to recognize and fight the actual virus.Who is working on a Covid-19 vaccine?At the time of this writing, there were well over 100 research teams worldwide developing a Covid-19 vaccine. So far, 37 teams have advanced their vaccines to the third phase of clinical trials. Although some of these vaccines have already been approved in some countries, they still continue to be tested in clinical trials in parallel.Five teams stand out for conducting the most extensive clinical trials:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-covid-19-vaccines-are-approved-here-s-the-global-progress-101631951930907.html
18-09-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine tracker: Countries with highest vaccination numbers||India reached a new milestone on Friday by administering over 25 million (2.5 crore) doses of Covid-19 vaccines in a single day. The feat was achieved on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Friday was the fourth day that India has crossed the 10 million mark of daily doses in the past month. The previous record for single-day dose administration was set on August 31, with 12.87 million doses administered across India.More than 5.85 billion doses have been administered so far across 184 countries, according to Bloomberg. The average daily vaccination stands at 31.1 million doses a day, Bloomberg further said.When compared to other countries in the world, only China has administered vaccines to more number of people than India. Here's a look at global vaccination statistics based on data shared by health authorities of these countries:ChinaThe Chinese government said this week it had given more than 2.16 billion shots and that 1 billion Chinese people were fully vaccinated.The Chinese government record further showed that 4,937,857 vaccine doses are being administered daily.IndiaThe over 25 million vaccine shots (administered on Friday) equals the entire population of Australia, is two-thirds the population of Canada, and five times the entire population of New Zealand, according to the central government.The Union health ministry said on Saturday that the special drive had raised India's overall vaccinations to more than 790 million.India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people, has given at least one dose to more than 62% of eligible adults and two doses to about 21%.United StatesAccording to Bloomberg data, which is based on the numbers provided by the country's health authorities, 383 million doses have been given so far. In the last week, an average of 781,574 doses per day were administered.Roughly half of the US population has been fully vaccinated, while 63.5 per cent people have received single dose.BrazilThe South American country, which was hard hit by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May, has administred 216,611,648 doses of vaccines to its population.

The new Taliban ministry of education made the announcement in a statement on Friday, saying state and private schools at the primary and secondary level as well as official madrasa religious schools would be open from Saturday. "All teachers and male students should attend school," the Taliban said in the statement.Most educational institutions across Afghanistan have remained closed more than a month after the Taliban seized the capital Kabul. Girls up to Class 6 have attended classes at some of the schools that have managed to stay open and women have gone to university classes. But high schools for girls have been closed in Afghanistan. Taliban officials have promised that girls will be able to go to school so long as they do so in segregated classrooms and they have said they will not replicate the fundamentalist policies of the previous Taliban government, which banned girls' education. However, women still are not allowed to continue their work in some of the provinces, with exceptions for those who have worked in health departments, hospitals and education.Also read | Taliban to track, secure 2000-year-old Bactrian gold treasure: ReportThe UN Children's Fund (Unicef) has welcomed the reopening of schools in Afghanistan from Saturday but said that girls must not be kept away from the classrooms.

Around 60 per cent of them are girls,” Unicef chief Henrietta Fore said in a statement on Friday."Girls cannot, and must not, be left behind. It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays.

Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The number of H-1B visas issued each year is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 reserved for individuals with advanced degrees. The current system for selecting applications for consideration is a hybrid of first-come, first-served, and a lottery.During former president Donald Trump's final days in office, the US Citizenship, and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced to do away with the traditional lottery system in deciding the successful applicants for the H-1B visas.The USCIS had said it would prioritise wages to protect the economic interests of American workers, and better ensure that the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme.The H-1B cap allocation regulation was originally set to take effect on March 9, 2021. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) delayed the effective date of the regulation to December 31, 2021, in response to a Biden administration regulatory freeze."Because Mr Wolf was not lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary at the time the Final Rule was approved, the Court concludes the rule must be set aside. In light of this ruling, the Court does not reach Plaintiffs’ alternative arguments. Accordingly, the Court vacates the Final Rule and remands this matter to DHS," the judge said in its order.“Plaintiffs argue the Final Rule must be set aside because Mr Wolf was not lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary at the time the DHS promulgated the rule,” he wrote.The Court concluded the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Wolf’s appointment was not lawful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visa-us-court-sets-aside-proposed-trump-era-wage-selection-rule-101631945545276.html
18-09-2021||World||‘Justice for J6’: All you need to know about September 18 rally in Washington||Washington is on high alert ahead of a rally in support of the pro-Trump rioters who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6. Compared to that time, the security forces are better prepared to avoid a repeat of the mayhem.The rally is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Sean Gallagher, acting assistant chief for the Capitol Police's uniformed operations, said that authorities are expecting "a peaceful event this weekend" but the security apparatus is ready "to handle anything that occurs".Since it's a Saturday, members of Congress will not be in the building; many are still on summer recess and won't be back in town until next week.Who is organising the rally?The "Justice for J6" rally is being organised by Look Ahead America, a non-profit organisation led by Matt Braynard, who worked as an analyst for the Republican Party.Braynard started the non-profit after he was dismissed by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, but his fortunes changed after Trump's 2020 loss. He joined an aggrieved group of Trump allies seeking to overturn the election - and in the process reaped recognition, lucrative fees and fundraising windfall.The group is planning to organise similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks. It has appealed to the attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners.How many protesters are expected to attend the rally?Though there are no exact numbers, the police say that organisers have obtained a permit for 700 protesters. The officers, however, are prepared a larger turnout."What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter-demonstrators making it to this demonstration and there being violence between those two groups," Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger told reporters.What are the security arrangements?A black fence that surrounded the complex for six months after the deadly riot has been put back up for the weekend along with surveillance cameras.The National Guard has 100 officers standing ready to act as a "physical security task force" backing up the Capitol Police and local law enforcement if requested.Capitol Police warned in a news conference there had been "some threats of violence," with a counter-rally scheduled to take place nearby.What happened on January 6, 2021?Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature that day in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property.A rioter was shot dead by police as she tried to breach the Senate. Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-for-j6-all-you-need-to-know-about-september-18-rally-in-washington-101631945360872.html
18-09-2021||World||Indian works leave their mark at Toronto International Film Festival||While Indian films made their presence felt at the 2021 edition of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), there was a marked absence of talent from the country as a result of ban on direct flights from India to Canada that kept most filmmakers away.Of the three directors who had their debut projects premiere at Toronto International Film Festival , only Mumbai-based Ritwik Pareek, director of the fiction feature Dug Dug was able to make it to Toronto. Even in his case, the hassles associated with getting a RT-PCR test in a third country before connecting to a flight to Toronto meant he missed the in-person world premiere of his own film.Payal Kapadia, director of the documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing, also skipped the Toronto International Film Festival . And for Nithin Lukose, director of Paka, it wasn’t even possible to attend the festival as he has received the anti-Covid jab Covaxin, which is not recognised by Health Canada. That film was represented at the festival by Dallas-based producer Raj Rachakonda, while the other producer, Anurag Kashyap, a TIFF regular, couldn’t make it either.Those were not the only lack of Indian presence. The large press contingent from India was missing and an industry event India@75, promoting the country as a film destination, was cancelled without explanation.However, for Ritwik Pareek, the trouble he went through to attend TIFF in person was “totally worth it”. He described having his debut project Dug Dug, a satire on commercialisation of religion in India, showcased at TIFF as a “very big opportunity” and its selection in the official slate was “more than I could have asked for”.In fact, its world premiere was at an IMAX theatre and came right after TIFF’s most high-profile presentation of the year, the science fiction epic Dune.Nithin Lukose, meanwhile, participated in a virtual Q&A session after Paka’s premiere, and was excited at the opportunity, as he said, “It’s a matter of pride that a regional film like ours is getting a platform through a globally renowned festival like TIFF.” A statement from the filmmakers said he and Anurag Kashyap couldn’t make it due to “travel restrictions changing by the moment and vaccine mandates not yet streamlined internationally.”The 10-day Toronto International Film Festival concludes today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-films-leave-their-mark-at-toronto-festival-101631944050982.html
18-09-2021||World||How some EU countries managed to ditch Covid-19 restrictions||In parts of Europe, enjoying a pre-pandemic social life, or at least a close version of it is no longer a far-off dream.Fully vaccinated people in the Netherlands can go dancing in crammed clubs and can attend parties without having to keep social distance from 25 September. Instead, the government will begin mandating vaccine passes, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a press conference Tuesday.Denmark abandoned all Covid- restrictions last week, becoming the first EU country to go return entirely to pre-pandemic daily life. No masks or even proof of vaccination are necessary to go to concerts or gyms.In late August, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said the government no longer saw Covid-19 as a "socially critical disease." This approach effectively ends the ministry's mandate to implement measures such as national closures and requirements for coronavirus passes.Joining the league will be Sweden, which has stood out among European countries for its relatively hands-off response to the pandemic. Most restrictions, including limitations on private and public gatherings and the advice to work from home, will expire by the end of September, Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren announced earlier this month.Travelers to these countries are still required to be tested and quarantine upon their arrival if they are not fully vaccinated.Delta variant loomsDenmark and Sweden both have a relatively high vaccination rate. According to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data project, in Denmark, more than 80% of eligible adults are fully vaccinated and in Sweden, over 70% are vaccinated. "Among the most vulnerable of our patients and citizens, the vaccination rate is more than nine out of ten," said Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist at the University of Copenhagen.In the Netherlands, the vaccination rate stands at about 60%, But caretaker health minister Hugo de Jonge hopes that rewarding more freedoms to residents, in tandem with a vaccine mandate, will boost the country's vaccination rollout, according to the public broadcaster NOS.Easing restrictions comes at a time when infection rates are rising in some EU countries and the rest of the world, mostly due to the highly contagiousdelta variant. The latest update to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, (ECDC)'s map shows far fewer red zones compared to previous weeks, but it also highlights the radically varied status of the pandemic across Europe.In countries with slower vaccine rollout, the virus is still raging.With only 20% of its population fully vaccinated, Bulgaria has resorted to limiting social life and imposing more restrictions on public life and businesses. Despite a surge in infections, most Balkan countries have very few restrictions in place.But even countries with higher vaccination rates are now experiencing a rise in infections.Despite having vaccinated about 60% of eligible adults, Austria is seeing a surge in new cases and has therefore shortened the validity period of negative PCR tests, a mandatory document for entering most public places.Norway, the Scandinavian neighbor of Denmark and Sweden, is experiencing a new wave of infections, despite having a vaccination rate of about 70%, the ECDC data shows.Covid endgame?In late May, the Danish government presented its vaccine pass, in the form of an app, a printed QR code, or a green bar for people who had tested negative.When such measures were mandated in some European countries, like France, Italy, and Greece, the curbs often sparked resistance and in some cases, demonstrations.But Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark enjoy a high level of trust in authorities , which experts say has given the countries a leg up in fighting the pandemic. It made it much easier for the governments to carry out tracking programs."We had a large testing program, which allowed us to track the infected persons very locally, and we had local lockdowns that worked very effectively," Camilla Holten Moller, a Statens Serum Institut epidemiologist, told DW. "We were able to do so simply because the Danes historically have a high level of trust in their health authorities and vaccine programs."The decision-makers in the three countries are realistic about the possibility of new outbreaks in the fall and especially breakthrough cases, but they have set their policy goals on keeping the virus under control and reducing the coronavirus' strain on hospitals."I don't think that Denmark will have to go into national lockdown again. We have proven that our large test system allows us to control the outbreaks with local lockdowns," Holten Moller said.The Dutch cabinet will be monitoring the number of Covid-19 related hospital and ICU admissions, rather than looking at the number of infections, caretaker health minister Hugo de Jonge said in a letter to parliament, according to the public broadcaster NOS.The Covid endgame of the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden is a delicate balancing act: Containing the pandemic with restrictions and protections, and carefully resuming pre-pandemic life. High vaccination rates mean the countries can contain Covid-19's worst outcomes — hospitalisation and death — with fewer restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-some-eu-countries-managed-to-ditch-covid-19-restrictions-101631943226169.html
18-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Justin Trudeau, Erin O’Toole tell voters not to waste ballot on a smaller party||Heading into the final weekend prior to Canada elections on September 20, the main rivals for power, the ruling Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau and the principal opposition Conservatives leader Erin O’Toole, have asked voters to act strategically and not waste a ballot on a smaller party.That binary option was forwarded by incumbent Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau as he targeted voters who may opt for the left-of-centre New Democratic Party (NDP). Acknowledging a lot of voters were “torn”, Justin Trudeau said it wasn’t an “impossible choice” to support the incumbent Liberals. “You can actually vote for the party that is going to stop the Conservatives and move forward with the strongest plan to get things done,” Justin Trudeau asserted, according to the outlet CBC News.His main opponent, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole made a similar pitch but to those who have gravitated to the extreme right People’s Party of Canada (PPC). At a campaign event in the town of London in Ontario, Erin O’Toole said, “There are actually millions of Canadians who are very frustrated with Mr Trudeau. If they allow that frustration to do anything other than vote Conservative, they’re voting for Mr Trudeau.”The PPC, headed by former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier has gained some steam, and could be based on quadrupling its vote share from the 1.6% recorded in 2019. It may still win no seats in the House of Commons as in 2019 but it could dent the Conservatives’ prospects. In fact, as the PPC share has reached 6.3% according to the CBC Poll Tracker, it has siphoned support mainly from the Conservatives and benefited the Liberals, who have returned to frontrunner status.The CBC Poll tracker gives the Liberals a 61% chance of forming a minority government but only 16% odds of garnering the majority Justin Trudeau targeted while precipitating snap Canada elections on August 15. With 31.6% support, it is likely to get 153 seats, 17 short of the majority mark of 170 and also four short of its rally in 2019. At 31% support, the Conservatives could also lose seats, down to 118 from 121 in the last Canada elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-erin-o-toole-tell-voters-not-to-waste-ballot-on-a-smaller-party-101631942311039.html

The magnitude-4.3 quake struck shortly after 7:58pm and was centered near Carson, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) southeast of downtown LA, according to preliminary information from the U.S. Geological Survey website.Its depth was reported at about 9 miles (14 kilometers), the USGS reported.Some people reported feeling a jolt ranging from a moment to several seconds across the area. It was felt in neighboring cities, including Santa Monica, Torrance, and Beverly Hills.No problems were reported at an oil refinery in Carson.The Los Angeles Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode, sending vehicles and helicopters to patrol its 470 square miles (1,217-square-kilometer) area but said it didn't receive any reports of “significant damage or injury," according to a department statement.Seismologist Lucy Jones told KCBS-TV that the quake “doesn't look abnormal at all."“This size happens on average somewhere in Southern California every couple of months,” she said. “When it happens to be in the middle of the Los Angeles basin then a lot more people feel it and it becomes bigger news.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/magnitude-4-3-earthquake-rattles-los-angeles-no-injuries-reported-101631941613197.html
18-09-2021||World||10 civilians killed: US says Kabul drone strike was a ‘tragic mistake’||The US military on Friday acknowledged that the drone strike it carried out in Kabul on August 29 was a “tragic mistake” and all 10 persons killed were civilians, including seven children, and not one of them had anything to do with the terrorist group Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) as had been claimed earlier.It was a most profound reversal of the Pentagon’s earlier description of the drone strike in Kabul, which was touted as a successful operation that presaged the over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability that President Joe Biden said the US will have in Afghanistan after the pull-out.Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley had called it a “righteous” strike.Turns out, as The New York Times summed it up, “Almost everything senior defence officials asserted in the hours, and then days, and then weeks after the August 29 drone strike turned out to be false.”General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, commander of the US Central Command that carried out the Kabul drone strike, acknowledged it unequivocally. “Our investigation now concludes that the strike was a tragic mistake,” he said at a news briefing. “This strike certainly did not come up to our standards, and I profoundly regret it.”The general said the US is considering ex-gratia payments to the victims and, going forward strikes in Afghanistan “will be under a higher standard”.Asked if the blundered drone strike cast doubts on the over-the-horizon counterterrorism strategy - strikes carried out from outside Afghanistan, the American general said, “Let me be clear this was a self defence strike taken under self defence rules and engagement based on an imminent threat to attack us. That is not the way we would strike in an OTH (over the horizon) mission going into Afghanistan against ISIS-K targets, the one thing that will not be a self defence strike. It’ll be done under different – it’ll be different - done under different rules of engagement, so - and we’ll have a lot more opportunity probably than we had under this extreme time pressure to take a look at the target.”The US military had earlier described the drone strike target in Kabul as an IS-K leader who was driving an explosives-laden car to the Hamid Karzai International Airport for a terrorist attack as the Americans and other countries were evacuating personnel and Afghan allies after the fall of Kabul.After the August 26 terrorist strike at the airport that killed more than 170 Afghans and 13 American troops, the US was on heightened alert for more of these attacks. There were intelligence reports that were widely cited, including by President Biden, of an “imminent threat”.The August 29 strike should be considered in the light of the Kabul airport attack, the general said going into the process that led to the tragic incident, including the intelligence warning repeatedly of an “imminent threat”. The general went on to detail the movements of the car - a Toyota Corolla - stretching over hours before the strike from video recordings that showed its many stops. The vehicle picked up bags and packages at these stops, and people. “One of the most recurring aspects of the intelligence was that ISIS-K would utilise a white Toyota Corolla as a key element in the next attack,” General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr said.Zemari Ahmadi, the driver of the car was a long-time worker for a US aid group, and had nothing to do with the Islamic State, according to multiple US media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-kabul-drone-strike-was-a-tragic-mistake-101631940750858.html

Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission of the Taliban interim cabinet, said they have assigned the relevant departments the task to find and check on the Bactrian treasure. “The issue is under investigation, and we will collect information to know what the reality is. If it has been transferred (out of Afghanistan), it is treason against Afghanistan,” he was quoted as saying by Tolo News. “The government of Afghanistan will take serious actions if this and other ancient items are moved out of the country.”According to National Geographic, the Bactrian treasure consists of thousands of gold pieces from all over the ancient world and was found inside six tombs, dating from the first century BC to the first century AD. “They contained more than 20,000 objects, including golden rings, coins, weapons, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, weapons, and crowns. In addition to gold, many of these were crafted from precious stones such as turquoise, carnelian, and lapis lazuli,” the magazine said.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’Scholars believe the graves belonged to six wealthy Asian nomads, five women and one man, according to National Geographic. “The 2,000-year-old artifacts found with them exhibit a rare blend of aesthetic influences (from Persian to classical Greek) and the great number of precious objects found surprised the archaeologists, in particular the intricate golden crown found in the sixth tomb,” National Geographic said in 2016.The Bactrian treasure was brought to the presidential palace by the former government in February 2021 and was put on display for public viewing. However, after the collapse of the former government, concerns were raised over its safety.Also read | Afghanistan can’t be ‘controlled from outside’, says Pak PM Imran KhanTolo News reported that Wasiq has said any contract that has been signed with the international community over the protection of ancient and historical monuments will remain in place.

It should remain in our country,” Hashmat said.Tolo News reported in December 2020 that the Bactrian treasure collection has been displayed in 13 countries in the past 13 years, “bringing in more than 350 million Afghanis (more than $4.5 million) to the country’s contemporary treasury.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-track-secure-2000-year-old-bactrian-gold-treasure-report-101631932521548.html
18-09-2021||World||UK relaxes rules for vaccinated travellers; minor benefit for long haul flights from India||Britain is simplifying its system for international travel for vaccinated travellers coming in and out of the UK and scrapping its current three-tiered red-amber-green country list with a single red one, transport minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter on Friday, adding that these measures will be applicable from October 4. The latter move is set to benefit long haul flights between India and the UK.From October 4, the current traffic light system of red, amber and green countries based on levels of Covid-19 risk in different countries will be scrapped and replaced with one red list only. UK will no longer require pre-departure tests before arrival into England for fully vaccinated travellers coming from non-red list countries.For India, which is currently on the amber list, this will translate into reduced travel costs for the Indian diaspora vaccinated in the UK, as they will no longer be required to undergo compulsory PCR tests. However, those who have been inoculated with Covishield, the Serum Institute of India produced Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, have not been exempted from mandatory Covid-tests as the newly expanded list of countries whose vaccines are recognised in England does not include India.Passengers who aren’t recognised as being fully vaccinated with authorised vaccines under the UK’s international travel rules, including India, will still have to take a pre-departure test, a day two and day eight PCR test, and self-isolate at their given address for 10 days upon entry.The UK expanded the list of countries with recognised vaccines to include Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and 14 other countries, thus travellers from these countries will no longer need to be tested for Covid-19. In addition to this, eight countries—Turkey, Bangladesh, Egypt, Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Kenya—will be removed from the red list from October 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-relaxes-rules-for-vaccinated-travellers-minor-benefit-for-long-haul-flights-from-india-101631930578393.html
18-09-2021||World||Washington braces for rally supporting January 6 Capitol rioters||The ‘Justice for J6’ rally in support of pro-Trump rioters, who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6, is scheduled to be held on Saturday. The rally has been organised by Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign operative, and his organisation, Look Ahead America. The supporters are demanding that the US justice department drop charges against January 6 protesters who are not charged with “destruction of property” or “committing violence against police officers”."Our advocacy is on behalf of the vast majority of people arrested at that event who are not charged with committing violence against police officers, who are not charged with destruction of property," Braynard told reporters on September 17. He added those who have “committed violence against police officers or destroyed property at the Capitol building on January 6 should be given a speedy trial -- if guilty, convicted and locked up”.Around 600 people have been charged so far, with at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding Capitol police officers or employees and more than 70 have been indicted for destruction or theft of government property during the January 6 riots.The Biden administration has deployed scores of National Guard troops and the black fence that surrounded the US Capitol building for six months following the January 6 riots has been brought back along with surveillance cameras. Members of the US Congress will not be in the Capitol building on Saturday.Capitol Police chief Tom Manger told reporters that three groups of counter-protesters were planning on showing up to Saturday’s rally, which might lead to a potential clash between the groups. “What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter-demonstrators making it to this demonstration and there being violence between those two groups," Manger said.The January 6 riots stormed the Capitol building as Congress was starting the electoral vote count. They were egged on by the then-president Donald J Trump, who had reiterated previously made claims of a “stolen” and “rigged” election. Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, breached police parameters and scaled the Capitol building leading to chaos. One rioter was shot dead as she tried to breach the Senate. Officials say the rioters assaulted 140 officers and caused $1.5 million to the Capitol building.Trump extended his support to Saturday’s rally and continued to claim that the election which led to his defeat was “rigged”. "Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-braces-for-rally-supporting-january-6-capitol-rioters-101631929532292.html

18-09-2021||World||US real estate tycoon Robert Durst guilty of Beverly Hills murder of best friend||US real estate scion Robert Durst was Friday convicted of killing his best friend to prevent her talking to police about his wife's disappearance.Durst, a multi-millionaire who was the subject of explosive HBO documentary "The Jinx," had always denied that he shot Susan Berman in the back of the head in 2000 at her Beverly Hills home.But a jury in Los Angeles took just a short time to deliberate before finding him guilty of the slaying.Durst is an estranged member of one of New York's wealthiest and most powerful real estate dynasties.Prosecutors said he murdered crime writer Berman in December 2000 to prevent her from being questioned by New York police over the disappearance of his wife Kathleen two decades earlier.Berman, the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, had acted as a spokeswoman for Durst after he became a suspect in Kathleen's disappearance.Durst was never charged in his wife's case, but was arrested in March 2015 in a New Orleans hotel room in connection with Berman's murder, hours before the final episode of the HBO documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" aired.In the documentary's stunning finale, Durst is heard muttering to himself, "There it is, you're caught" and "Killed them all, of course" -- apparently unaware that a microphone remained switched on while he used the restroom.The series also delved into the 2001 death of Durst's neighbor in Texas, who was found dismembered. Durst admitted dismembering the neighbor but claimed the killing was self-defense. He was acquitted.The HBO filmmakers confronted Durst with a letter he once sent to Berman in handwriting similar to a cryptic note received by police locating Berman's body.When the trial opened last year, Durst's defense team said their client had written the note to police after finding Berman's body and panicking, but argued this did not mean he killed her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-real-estate-tycoon-robert-durst-guilty-of-beverly-hills-murder-of-best-friend-101631921331198.html

This forced Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country to the UAE.The Taliban insurgents stormed across Afghanistan and captured all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away.Thousands of Afghan nationals and foreigners have fled the country to escape the new Taliban regime and to seek asylum in different nations, including the US and many European nations, resulting in total chaos and deaths.

18-09-2021||World||In a first, France recalls its envoy to US, Australia over submarine deal||France recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia in a diplomatic slap intended to convey its anger over a deal forged in secrecy that saw Paris lose a multi billion dollar submarine contract.While France and the US have at times been at odds on global affairs, including over the Iraq War in 2003, Paris has never gone so far as to remove its envoy to Washington, according to senior French diplomats who declined to speculate how long the envoys would be gone. It’s also unclear whether more slights are planned and if France is expecting a US overture in order to move on. French officials have already canceled a gala in Washington and Baltimore this week meant to celebrate Franco-American ties. The stunning decision comes two days after Australia’s Scott Morrison unveiled plans to buy nuclear-powered submarines in a joint announcement with U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The new partnership effectively scuppered Australia’s 2016 deal with French shipbuilder Naval Group to build as many as 12 conventional submarines in a project that had gone over budget but seemed secure.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made the announcement on the envoys late Friday and denounced the deal as “unacceptable behavior between allies and partners, the consequences of which affect the very conception we have of our alliances, our partnerships and the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe.” A White House official said the Biden administration would try to work out its differences with Paris. The official said France and the U.S. would continue to cooperate on issues including the pandemic and security.The loss of the Australian submarine deal is a personal blow for President Emmanuel Macron. In June, Macron invited Morrison to Paris after the Group of Seven summit, and the two discussed the contract with state-owned Naval Group, focusing on delays and pricing, two people familiar with the discussions said. From the French perspective, there was never a suggestion that Australia was about to ditch the contract, look for other partners, or had second thoughts. Two French officials describe it as the typical discussions befitting a deal of that size and that Macron felt he had responded to Morrison’s queries.Macron and Biden have previously had a warm relationship. The French president publicly rejoiced at the G-7 meeting in June that America was “back” and ready to work with European partners, after difficult years under former US President Donald Trump.If France had any suspicion the submarine deal was in danger, two French officials said, it would never have signed a road map with Australia only two weeks ago, in which they “committed to deepen defense industry cooperation” and “underlined the importance of the future submarine program.”How the communication went down with all the parties involved is still up in the air. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that high-level US officials discussed the Australia partnership with French counterparts before its public announcement. Officials in the UK and the US have said it was for Australia to warn France. Australia, for its part, justified the cancellation of the French contract by its fundamental need for nuclear-powered rather than diesel submarines in a changing security environment as China expands its military clout in the Indo-Pacific region. In short, it wasn’t personal. But the French, by their reaction, see it differently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-france-recalls-its-envoy-to-us-over-aukus-submarine-deal-101631920110869.html
18-09-2021||World||US' FDA approves Pfizer Covid boosters for over-65s, high-risk people||The Covid-19 vaccine booster shot proposed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE should be given to a smaller group of people who are the most vulnerable to serious disease, a panel of expert advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration said.The FDA and Pfizer had originally proposed approving a booster shot for everyone 16 and older. But the advisers rejected that idea out of concern that the data to support such a broad application was thin and there could be risks, especially for younger people.Instead, the panel voted 18-0 in favor of an emergency-use authorization -- a more limited clearance than a full approval -- for people 65 and older or individuals at high risk of severe Covid-19.The move is a setback to a sweeping plan from the Biden administration to roll out booster shots to a broad population next week.

Huge crowds were there clamoring to get inside and on board one of the final evacuation flights out of the country."There were over 60 clear threat vectors that we were dealing with at this time," McKenzie said.US officials believed that the car had been loaded with explosives. The New York Times reported that it was filled with canisters of water.McKenzie said that no civilians had been spotted in the area at the time the strike was authorized.'Completely harmless'One of those killed was an Afghan man who worked for a US aid group, Ezmarai Ahmadi."We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan," said Austin.He said Ahmadi's activities that day were "completely harmless," and that the man was "just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed."Ahmadi's brother Aimal told AFP that the car had been filled with children pretending that the parking routine was an adventure."The rocket came and hit the car full of kids inside our house," he said."It killed all of them.""My brother and his four children were killed. I lost my small daughter... nephews and nieces," he said disconsolately.AFP was unable to independently verify Aimal's account."On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, I offer my deepest condolences to surviving family members of those who were killed, including Mr. Ahmadi, and to the staff of Nutrition and Education International, Mr. Ahmadi's employer," Austin said.More than 71,000 Afghan and Pakistani civilians have died directly from the war launched by the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks, with casualties rising dramatically after then president Donald Trump relaxed rules of engagement in 2017, according to a Brown University study in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tragic-mistake-us-admits-kabul-airstrikes-did-not-kill-is-terrorists-101631906893610.html
