But he said real-time data from the US and Israel continues to come in showing waning efficacy among broader groups of people that will need to be addressed soon.In Italy, bookings for vaccine have spiked after the government said all staff must show proof of a jab, negative test or recent recovery from Covid-19. “On a national level, there was a generalised increase in bookings for the first dose between 20-40% compared to last week,” Covid-19 commissioner Francesco Figliuolo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-says-booster-dose-use-may-be-expanded-101632075861498.html

The explosion also injured one Taliban member, the eyewitness said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabuls-diktat-for-women-workers-in-govt-stay-home-101632075260655.html

They are slated to discuss the ongoing pandemic and their joint efforts to boost global vaccine supplies, the climate crisis, partnering on emerging technologies and cyberspace, and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.Their September 24 meeting is the first in-person summit level meeting of the group that is technically called the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue but is popularly known as just the Quad. It is seen as an emerging bloc of countries positioning itself as a check against China’s growing aggression in the Indo-Pacific and outside. The leaders held their first summit in March, but it was held virtually.Citing a draft of the joint statement, Nikkei reported that the four leaders are expected to say that “resilient, diverse and secure technology supply chains for hardware, software, and services” are vital to their shared national interests.Japan and the United States are the world’s leading manufacturers of semiconductors, along with Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. China is a big rival that has been called Asia’s “Big 4” along with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. India and Australia are nowhere in the market although New Delhi has moved aggressively to woo chipmakers in recent years.Nikkei reported that the draft document seeks to set common principles on technological development, arguing that “the way in which technology is designed, developed, governed and used should be shaped by our shared democratic values and respect for universal human rights”.The document does not specify any country as a threat or competition, but it does refer to China’s alleged theft of technology, saying that “illicit transfer or theft of technology is a common challenge that undermines the very foundation of global technological development and should be addressed”.In a barely veiled reference to China’s widely reported use of technology for surveillance of its population, specially Uighur minority Muslims, the draft reportedly says that the Quad believes “technology should not be misused or abused for malicious activities such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression”.The Quad group hopes to “launch a joint initiative to map capacity, identify vulnerabilities and bolster supply chain security for semiconductors and their vital components”, the draft says further according to the report in Nikkei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-summit-4-nation-leaders-to-announce-securing-semiconductor-supply-chain-101632073801854.html

Several DW correspondents and their families were able to leave Afghanistan via Pakistan earlier this month.In an interview for Radio Pakistan, according to Pakistani media outlet Urdupoint, the German ambassador acknowledged that Afghanistan's neighbours had a genuine understanding of how peace and stability in Afghanistan were vital for their interests.He said that Afghanistan was a key discussion point in Foreign Minister Heiko Maas' visit to Pakistan last month, Urdupoint reported.Situation in Afghanistan is in fluxMaas met with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa. His visit was part of a tour of Afghanistan's neighbours, following the Taliban takeover of the country and the subsequent departure of foreign troops.Schlagheck said the Taliban and the humanitarian crisis in the country were both realities, but that the situation going forward in the country was still in flux, Urdupoint reported.Germany, as a responsible partner within the international community, is willing to engage with Afghanistan. But he added that Berlin and the world would be monitoring the treatment of women and minorities and the question of an inclusive government.At a recent conference over Afghanistan in Geneva, Germany pledged €100 million ($118 million) in aid. Schlagheck told Radio Pakistan that the German government was considering providing an additional €500 million.Taliban seeks German aidA Taliban spokesperson in the city of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan called on the international community to ramp up its aid deliveries, stressing that the Taliban are not terrorists.In an interview with the German DPA news agency, provincial spokesman Matiullah Ruhani said the Taliban welcomed aid in any form of investment, reconstruction projects "or any kind of humanitarian support for the government or citizens of Afghanistan."Ruhani said he was appealing to "the entire international community, including Germany." He criticized the international community for having supported what he described as a "corrupt government" in Afghanistan for the past 20 years and then suspending aid to the country.But on the issue of the Taliban's controversial policies towards women, Ruhani did not comment but said only that the Taliban valued all citizens, women and men alike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-diplomat-thanks-pakistan-for-aiding-afghans-101632069569457.html

This is the reason||Some photos of Taliban riders pedalling boats in the idyllic background of a Hindu Kush mountains lake has gone viral on social media after journalist Jake Hanrahan shared the photos on Twitter. "There photos are real," he posted as Taliban fighters can be seen enjoying some serene moments in the lake with RPGs and assault rifles slinging from their shoulders.A Daily Mail report said the photos have been taken at Band-e Amir National Park, which used to be a hotspot for international travellers and domestic tourists as well. Around 45 miles from Bamiyan, the park contains a series of six deep blue lakes situated in the Hindu Kush mountains. Taliban in Bamyan Province…(These photos are real) pic.twitter.com/oWHJXDpVfZSome social media users also compared the photo with the iconic painting of Washington crossing the Delaware, which depicted the historic event of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolutionary War.Gun-toting Taliban fighters have become a commonplace sight in Afghanistan after the country was captured by the group on August 15. And it is not the first time that these photos of the changing face of Afghanistan have caught the attention of the world . Soon after the Taliban took over Kabul, Taliban fighters were seen enjoying rides in an amusement park in Kabul. This week only, heavily armed Taliban fighters were seen roaming inside Kabul zoo with AK-47s and M16 assault rifles, mingling with children and families that came to visit the zoo. When asked about the armed presence, which is not a common sight in any zoo in the world, one Taliban fighter told news agency AFP that the Taliban may bar guns from the zoo as they were in favour of it to make children and women comfortable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-of-taliban-fighters-pedalling-boats-go-viral-this-is-the-reason-101632067765230.html

Pakistan police registered a case against Aziz, who also runs the women’s seminary known as Jamia Hafsa, and cordoned off the area with an anti-riot unit.The Islamabad police spotted Afghan Taliban flags on Jamia Hafsa’s rooftops and received open threats from Aziz himself. Aziz, his students and fellow collaborators were booked under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).Islamabad police faced taunts, threatsThe Islamabad police personnel who reached the spot faced warnings from Aziz, who also allegedly brandished weapons at them. The people inside Jamia Hafsa invoked the name of Taliban and said the law enforcement personnel will face dire consequences for their intervention.Seminary students and teachers also taunted the police and led to tensions in the area. This is the third time since August that Afghan Taliban flags were hoisted in the seminary. The Islamabad deputy commissioner after removing the flags shared an update on Twitter. The law enforcement officials took action after residents were terrorized after the flags were hoisted once more.Aziz took advantage legal loopholeIslamabad deputy commissioner also said that Abdul Aziz took help of legal lacunae as Pakistan does not criminalise hoisting of any flag because of which no law addresses the issue or under which legal action can be taken.Aziz, infamous for his role in the Lal Masjid case, where he threatened to overthrow the Pakistan government and impose Sharia law in the nation.

Initial reports said five people were killed, including two civilians, among them a child. The Taliban were not immediately available for comment about possible casualties among their ranks, the report said.Who are attacking the Taliban?The target of the explosions, two days on the row, is the Taiban, reports have said as in both the cases vehicles carrying Taliban fighters have been attacked. Since Jalalabad is a stronghold of the ISIS-K, who claimed responsibility for the blast at Kabul airport on August 25, they are on the list of suspects.Saturday's attack was the first deadly blast in Afghanistan since the US withdrew its forces from the country, while Saturday's attack proves that the Taliban are facing stiff resistance in areas under their control.This comes at a time when the Taliban and the Haqqanis are at loggerheads with reports doing rounds that Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani had punched Mullah Baradar in the recent fighting between the two groups.The attacks come amid apprehension that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan would bolster terror activities in the region, though the Taliban have promised that they will ensure that the soil of Afghanistan is not used for any terror activities. US security experts have already alerted that al Qaeda has started activities in Afghanistan and will take a year or two to become capable of striking the US from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-targeting-taliban-in-jalalabad-for-2nd-day-in-row-hints-at-infighting-101632052938572.html

Attal was referring to the recently announced partnership between the US, United Kingdom and Australia, with the latter’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, unveiling his government’s plan to purchase nuclear-powered submarines from Washington.The development effectively means that Canberra has cancelled a 2016 deal with France's Naval Group to buy as many as 12 conventional submarines.

According to a report citing Finnish researchers, although the ‘Mu’ variant of the coronavirus has now been detected in as many as 39 other countries apart from Finland, the variant does not pose any additional threats compared to the other variants of the virus causing the infectious disease.Also Read | Is Mu variant of coronavirus vaccine resistant? WHO says it could be possible“All variants that can evade protection conferred by a previous infection or vaccine-provided immunity are potentially worrying, or ones that we have to monitor,” the report quoted Turku University virology professor Ilkka Julkunen as saying. “That's the case with the ‘Mu’ variant as well.”The Mu variant of the coronavirus was alerted by the WHO as being responsible for a growing number of Covid-19 cases in Colombia in South America and other countries. The variant, officially termed as B.1.621, “has been designated as a Variant of Interest as it has some mutations that need to be studied for their potential impact on the body’s immune response.”The WHO designated it as a variant of interest due to the several concerning mutations, and assigned a Greek letter name to it. Mu carries key mutations, including E484K, N501Y, and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection.According to the WHO's Bulletin published earlier this month, Mu has caused some larger outbreaks in South America and Europe. While the number of genetic sequences identified as Mu has fallen below 0.1% globally, Mu represents 39% of variants sequenced in Colombia and 13% in Ecuador, places where its prevalence has "consistently increased," WHO reported.Also Read | How some EU countries managed to ditch Covid-19 restrictionsThe global health agency said it continues to monitor Mu for changes in South America, especially in areas where it is co-circulating with the Delta variant. Maria van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said circulation of the variant is decreasing globally but needs to be observed closely. In a press briefing, White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci said US officials are watching it, but so far Mu is not considered an immediate threat. (With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-reports-first-case-of-mu-variant-of-covid-19-now-in-40-countries-101632037755074.html

Shocking at times, but also sweeping in its beauty, A Night of Knowing Nothing is a first feature that already demonstrates her strong voice as a filmmaker,” the award citation stated.Indian director Payal Kapadia had earlier directed the short films Afternoon Clouds in 2017 and And What Is the Summer Saying the next year. TIFF programmer Andrea Picard had described the film as “One of the year’s most electrifying debuts” and “a fever dream of impossible love tied to a broader reflection on contemporary India.” The film had earlier won the best documentary award at Cannes.The other awards in this category went to Somali director Khadar Ayderus Ahmed’s The Gravedigger’s Wife and Canadian Rhayne Vermette’s Ste. Anne.TIFF also announced its major honours on Saturday evening, with the People’s Choice Award going to British director Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast. This particular award is often a harbinger of Oscars, as in the case of the 2020 winner Nomadland, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year.While the People’s Choice Award is based on voting by the viewing public, TIFF’s competitive programme, based on selection by a jury, is the Platform Prize. This was awarded to Indonesian director Kamila Andini’s Yuni. The jury statement explaining the choice said this was a “film that brings a fresh, intimate perspective to a coming-of-age story, marked by a subtle structure, delicate framing, and lush cinematography”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-director-payal-kapadia-s-documentary-wins-award-at-tiff-101632031677512.html
19-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Justin Trudeau likely to pip Erin O’ Toole to post||With just over a day left before voting in Canada elections begins, it appears that barring a miracle, the results will be a rerun of the 2019 polls. Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to pip his Conservative rival Erin O’Toole to post and return to Ottawa to head another minority government. Survey data now consistently points to the Liberals under the leadership of Justin Trudeau emerging as the single-largest party and thereby favoured to form the next government. The polls indicate that maintaining of the status quo, though Trudeau, leader of the ruling Liberal Party, had precipitated snap elections with the intent of securing a majority. In a release titled “Déjà vu all over again?” the non-partisan polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI) emphasised this point, “The Liberals and the Conservatives are separated by very little daylight, fighting for advantage in a race that may now depend on factors not entirely in their control: voter turnout, and the performance of other parties.”That appears to be direction predicted by the CBC Poll Tracker as it has the ruling party at 150 seats, 20 short of the majority figure, while the principal opposition Conservative Party under Erin O’Toole is at 118. If those figures hold, Justin Trudeau’s party will be seven short of the seats it garnered in 2019 while the Conservatives, led by Erin O’Toole, will drop three.A somewhat brighter prospect is predicted by the Ottawa-based market research company Advanced Symbolics Inc Artificial Intelligence-based engine Polly, as it placed the Liberals under Justin Trudeau at 163 seats on Saturday evening, an improvement of six over 2019, and on the cusp of the majority mark in the 338-seat House of Commons, but also said the likelihood of a minority was at 66%, twice that of a majority.Among the factors playing into subduing Trudeau’s ambition could be the continued displeasure of Canadians over holding elections in the midst of the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. A poll conducted by the firm Ipsos Public Affairs for the outlet Global News noted that at the outset of the campaign, 56% of respondents didn’t think an election at this time was necessary and that figure has only increased, to 69%. Ipsos vice-president Sean Simpson stated that “if (the Liberals) they do win with a parliament that looks a lot like the previous one, Trudeau may once again need to explain to Canadians why we had an election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-likely-to-pip-erin-o-toole-to-post-101632029577042.html

Not only have the Taliban occupied the commission's offices, but they are also using its cars, computers, and other assets – indicating a total lack of respect for the human rights groups working in the war-torn land.“Since August 15, the AIHRC continues in office but has been unable to fulfil its duties to the Afghan people,” the statement read. “All AIHRC buildings have been occupied by Taliban forces, who have also made appointments and used AIHRC assets such as cars and computers.”The AIHRC demanded that the Taliban “respect” the independence of the commission and its staff and all the human rights defenders based in the country, all of who have been working tirelessly to protect the rights of the Afghan people.The organisation also highlighted the reported attacks on its female staff by the Taliban rulers. “Given the restrictions by the Taliban on women’s employment and role in public life, we fear the Taliban would not allow female staff to continue to carry out their duties, including at a leadership level. This is unacceptable: the AIHRC cannot protect the rights of all Afghans if it cannot protect the rights of its female staff,” the agency said.Meanwhile, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Friday that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is ‘pretty desperate’ and called for urgent aid to the country. During a press conference in Islamabad, Grandi stressed that food, medicines, shelter, and other necessities are needed urgently in Afghanistan.Earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) unanimously adopted a resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), specifying the importance of “equal and meaningful participation” of women in public life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-respect-afghan-rights-commission-says-taliban-using-its-cars-computers-other-assets-101632023856738.html

"There was so much unfair criticism of President Biden, and what he did was the most sensible thing to do," Khan told a Russian news channel on September 17.Khan’s defence of the American President comes a month after he blamed the US for expecting Pakistan to “clean up the mess” it leaves behind in Afghanistan. “Pakistan is just considered only to be useful in the context of somehow settling this mess which has been left behind after 20 years of trying to find a military solution when there was not one,” Khan told reporters in Islamabad in early August before Kabul fell to the Taliban.Khan himself has been a vocal critic of Biden’s decision to pull troops from Afghan soil. In an interview with The New York Times in late June, he blamed American withdrawal for diminishing the influence Pakistan had over the Taliban. “Given that the United States gave a date of withdrawal, from then onward, our leverage diminished on the Taliban. And the reason is that the moment the United States gave a date of exit, the Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so, therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel,” Khan alleged.Biden has been subjected to strong-worded criticism from opposition politicians in his country and from the international community, who termed the pullout “hasty”, and worried about the Taliban’s newfound legitimacy, after the botched US withdrawal on August 31.Khan also expressed doubts on America’s future intentions regarding Afghanistan, and said he wasn’t sure if the country had a coherent policy on how to deal with a war-ravaged country, Dawn reported on Sunday. He also simultaneously called on the US to engage in humanitarian efforts to help refugees, stressing the important role the country has to play after being in Afghanistan for over 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-us-afghanistan-withdrawal-was-sensible-defends-biden-against-unfair-criticism-101632028198287.html

It has an Indian connect||The Taliban have said they have begun efforts to track and locate the 2000-year-old Bactrian treasure, also known as Bactrian Gold. “The issue is under investigation, and we will collect information to know what the reality is. If it has been transferred (out of Afghanistan), it is treason against Afghanistan,” Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission of the Taliban interim cabinet, was quoted as saying by Tolo News. “The government of Afghanistan will take serious actions if this and other ancient items are moved out of the country,” Wasiq said.More than 20,000 artefactsThe Bactrian treasure was excavated in 1978-79 from the graves of six wealthy nomads—dating from the first century BC to the first century AD— in the Tela Tapa or Hill of Gold area of Sherberghan district in northern Afghanistan. The graves of the Saka tribesmen from Central Asia, perhaps, or the Yuezhi from northwest China, had more than 20,000 artefacts including gold cupids, dolphins, gods and dragons encrusted with semiprecious stones such as turquoise, carnelian, and lapis lazuli. They also contained golden rings, coins, weapons, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, weapons, and crowns.Also read | Taliban to track, secure 2000-year-old Bactrian gold treasure: ReportViktor Sarianidi, the Moscow archaeologist who led the joint Soviet-Afghan team that uncovered the graves, compared the impact of the find to the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb. "The gold of Bactria shook the world of archaeology. Nowhere in antiquity have so many different objects from so many different cultures—Chinese-inspired boot buckles, Roman coins, daggers in a Siberian style—been found together in situ,” Sarianidi has written, according to the Smithsonian Magazine.“The 2,000-year-old artifacts found with them exhibit a rare blend of aesthetic influences (from Persian to classical Greek) and the great number of precious objects found surprised the archaeologists, in particular the intricate golden crown found in the sixth tomb,” it added. Smithsonian Magazine said in 2009 that for example the diadem, “a five-inch-tall crown of hammered gold leaf, conveniently folds for travel, and a thumb-size gold figure of a mountain sheep is delicately incised with curving horns and flaring nostrils”.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’Kushan Empire, BuddhaSarianidi believed that the treasure had been assembled by Yuezhi nobles from China, who arrived in the Bactria region around the second century BC and later established the Kushan Empire in India. Other scholars say the hoard was interred by Scythians from modern-day Iran. “The contesting theories reveal the variety of influences that make up this huge collection of objects. Other items include a Roman coin with the head of the emperor Tiberius, a silver mirror with Chinese engravings, rings with Greek text, and a coin with Buddhist imagery,” National Geographic magazine said in 2016.Sarianidi and his workers found a skull and skeleton surrounded by gold jewellery and ornaments during the course of the excavation. They were the remains of a woman, 25 to 30 years old, whom Sarianidi called a nomadic princess. “He subsequently found and excavated five additional graves, all simple trenches containing lidless wooden coffins holding the remains of once ornately attired bodies,” according to Smithsonian Magazine.Also read | Taliban ban female employees from entering ministry of womenSarianidi's team uncovered in the grave of a chieftain—the only man found at the site—turquoise-studded daggers and sheaths and a braided gold belt with raised medallions that bear the image riding on a panther. Some say the image is that Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, and others speculate it's the Bactrian goddess Nana seated on a lion. An Indian medallion was also found near the chieftain's rib cage by the excavators. Véronique Schiltz, a French archaeologist with the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, has said it bears one of the earliest representations of Buddha.The remains of a woman in her 30s were found in a nearby grave and she was wearing signet rings with images of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, and a pair of matching jewelled pendants with gold figures grasping S-shaped dragons. Another grave, that of a teenage girl, contained thin gold shoe soles along with a Roman coin minted in the early first century AD in Gallic Lugdunum—present-day Lyon, France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-are-after-bactrian-gold-treasure-it-has-an-indian-connect-101632026306958.html
19-09-2021||World||In solidarity: Some Afghan boys stay back home as girls yet to resume school||As the Taliban ordered only boys and male teachers back to school, girls stayed home in Afghanistan. But there were some boys who did not go back to schools as they reopened in the country. The Wall Street Journal reported that some boys in the Afghan capital of Kabul stayed home in solidarity with their female schoolmates. “Women make up half the society... I will not show up at school until girls’ schools are open too,” Rohullah, an 18-year-old student of Class 12, was quoted as saying by WSJ.The Taliban education ministry on Friday said boys' secondary schools would soon reopen. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the local Bakhtar News Agency on Saturday that arrangements were being made to reopen girls' secondary schools but he gave no date. "All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions," a statement, issued late Friday, said, without mentioning anything about women teachers or girl pupils.Also read | Taliban reopen schools for Afghan boys, girls still not allowed in classesThe Taliban have said they will not enforce the fundamentalist policies, including a ban on girls going to schools, when they last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and have assured that girls will be able to study but only in segregated classrooms.Nazife, a teacher at a private school in Kabul, said they had made changes in order to reopen. "Girls study in the morning and boys in the afternoon. Male teachers teach boys and female teachers teach girls,” she told Reuters.Some girls did go back to their primary schools with gender-segregated classes on Saturday, but older girls are yet to figure out when they would be able to resume their studies at the secondary school level. "Their spirits are down and they are waiting for government announcements so they can resume studying," Hadis Rezaei, who teaches the school's female secondary-level pupils, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’"The education of girls is fixing a generation. The education of boys may affect a family but the education of girls affects society," said the school's principal, Mohammadreza. "We are very closely following the matter so that girls can resume their education and complete their studies."The United Nations has said it was "deeply worried" for the future of girls' schooling in Afghanistan. "It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays. For that, we need female teachers to resume teaching," the Unicef, the UN's children's agency, said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-solidarity-some-afghan-boys-stay-back-home-as-girls-yet-to-resume-school-101632021810661.html
19-09-2021||World||Hong Kong holds its first 'patriots only' election, pro-democracy candidates nearly absent||Fewer than 5,000 Hong Kong people from mostly pro-establishment circles began voting on Sunday for candidates to an election committee, vetted as loyal to Beijing, who will pick the city's next China-backed leader and some of its legislature.Pro-democracy candidates are nearly absent from Hong Kong's first election since Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system to ensure that "only patriots" rule China's freest city."The whole objective of improving the electoral system is to ensure patriots administer Hong Kong," Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, said on Sunday morning."I doubt very much that another government or country will allow the public election to their local legislature of people whose mission is to undermine the national interest or national security."The election committee will select 40 seats in the revamped Legislative Council in December, and choose a chief executive in March.Police have ramped up security across the city, with local media reporting 6,000 officers are expected to be deployed to ensure a smooth vote, in which about 4,900 people are expected to cast ballots.Changes to the political system are the latest in a string of moves – including a national security law that punishes anything Beijing deems as subversion, secession, terrorism, or collusion with foreign forces - that have placed the international financial hub on an authoritarian path.Most prominent democratic activists and politicians are now in jail or have fled abroad.China's rubber-stamp parliament in May changed Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in institutions and introducing the vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners. This all but removed any influence the opposition was able to exert.The changes also dramatically reduced the influence of the city's powerful tycoons, although groups close to their business interests retain a presence in the 1,500-strong committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive.Tycoons out, sons remainChina promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing.Democracy campaigners and Western countries say the political overhaul moves the city in the opposite direction, leaving the democratic opposition with its most limited space since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997.Committee membership for 117 community-level district councillors, dominated by democrats, was scrapped, while more than 500 seats designated for Chinese business, political, and grassroots groups were added.The new electoral list includes community-level organisations such as Modern Mummy Group and Chinese Arts Papercutting Association, Cable TV reported.Representation from professional subsectors that traditionally had a bigger pro-democracy presence was diluted by the addition of ex-officio members, reducing the number of elected seats.About 70% of the nominees did not feature in the last two polls for the committee, which will expand by 300 members to 1,500, Reuters calculations based on the election committee website showed.Many prominent tycoons, including Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-Shing, will not be on the election committee for the first time, as Beijing seeks to rebalance power from big conglomerates to small businesses.Three property moguls - Li, 93, of CK Asset Holdings, Lee Shau-kee, also 93, of Henderson Land, and Henry Cheng, 74, of New World Development - withdrew from the race, although their sons will retain their seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-holds-its-first-patriots-only-election-pro-democracy-candidates-nearly-absent-101632021491906.html

However, the warning came too late: the missile had already been launched and officials received a note of it just seconds before the projectile hit, according to a CNN report. The missile strike never got any of its intended terrorist targets, and instead killed 10 civilians, including seven children.Also Read | 10 civilians killed: US says Kabul drone strike was a ‘tragic mistake’The American multinational news network reported, citing those privy with the matter, that there may have been a “miscommunication” between the military and the intelligence community since rapidly evolving situations often call for prompt action without following up on the complete chain of command. The CIA, however, refused to comment when contacted regarding the development, the news organisation added.The gap in decision-making between the two institutions has resulted in what has been a consistent reality in Afghanistan – civilian casualties; however, analysts cited by the news network say that these “mistakes” are only going to get worse without the presence of US troops on the ground, who could potentially have verified the correct target before successful strikes on legitimate ISIS-K or al Qaeda targets are launched.The US military on Friday acknowledged that the drone strike carried out in Kabul on August 29 was a “tragic mistake” and all 10 people killed were civilians, including seven children, and not one of them had anything to do with the terrorist group Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) as had been claimed earlier.It was a most profound reversal of the Pentagon’s earlier description of the drone strike in Kabul, which was touted as a successful operation that presaged the over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability that President Joe Biden said the US will have in Afghanistan after the pull-out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-warned-of-civilian-casualties-in-kabul-drone-strike-but-it-was-too-late-101632015845653.html
19-09-2021||World||Russian parliamentary elections to conclude today; Putin projected to win||The three-day parliamentary elections in Russia, which began on September 17, will conclude on Sunday with President Vladimir Putin’s ruling United Party expected to win the polls marred by claims of widespread violations and suppression of opposition voices. However, some poll experts have said that Putin’s party will fall short of retaining its current two-third domination of the state Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament.The Communist Party of Russia is expected to gain from the loss Putin’s party may see in this election. The loss of a two-thirds majority in the State Duma assumes significance because the Russian constitution can only be changed by a party with a two-thirds majority in the parliament.The Communist Party is projected to benefit from the now-banned Smart Voting App promoted by incarcerated Putin critic Alexei Navalny. Tech giants Google and Apple took down the app from their respective stores after Russian authorities warned that failure to do so will be seen as an attempt to interfere with the country’s electoral process. Navalny used the Smart Voting App to inform voters on the strongest candidates who were in a position to defeat candidates fielded by Putin’s party, thereby undermining their vote share.Also Read: MI6, CIA chiefs and Russia’s Security Council secretary make beeline for IndiaBoth independent media and election monitoring agencies like Golos have reported violations like vote-buying and lack of proper measures for guarding ballots at polling stations. Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov told reporters on the second day of polling that the Russian police and the national election commission must respond to claims of ballot stuffing incidents in many regions.Central elections commission head Ella Pamfilova accepted Zyuganov’s claims and stated that 6,200 ballots have been annulled in five regions for ballot stuffing and other procedural violations.Navalny, Putin’s most vocal critic, who has been incarcerated in a Russian penal colony, and his organisation have been declared as “extremists” by the Putin administration and thus all of its candidates have been banned from contesting elections, thereby decimating one of the strongest opposition forces Putin has faced in recent history. Navalny’s efforts and the vacuum created by the banning of his organisation is expected to benefit the Communist Party.On the first day of the elections on September 16, long lines were seen outside polling stations in the country, with independent media outlets deducing that the queues were indicative of state-run companies forcing employees to vote. Voters who talked to journalists present at voting venues showed little to no interest in the country’s electoral process. Journalists also witnessed incidents of ballot stuffing and other poll violations in different provinces, reported the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-parliamentary-elections-to-conclude-today-putin-projected-to-win-101632019218129.html

The new defensive pact forced Canberra to give up on a $66 billion contract with France to develop 12 state-of-the-art conventionally powered attack submarines.The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The summit in Cornwall, held on June 11-13, was also attended by the leaders of the European Union and several guest nations, such as South Korea, Australia, and South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-australia-explored-aukus-pact-at-g7-meet-behind-macron-s-back-reports-101632019075483.html

But currently, there are fewer officers in the departments.At the moment, most of Afghanistan's embassies have cut off contacts with the Kabul administration and the host countries, he revealed, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.Some embassies are still led by former minister, Hanif Atmar and then vice-president Amrullah Saleh.Some remained neutral, while others were in contact with the new administration, the source said, without providing further details, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The official said 80 per cent of the embassies' expenses were met with their own revenue collected from services like issuance of passports and other facilities.He also disclosed workers of Afghanistan's embassies in France and Germany had sought asylum in the host countries, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The former MoFA official claimed the acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, had tried several times to organise online meetings with Afghan envoys abroad, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The minister reportedly planned to hold a virtual meeting with them on Wednesday, but it was cancelled because most of the ambassadors were absent, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.According to the source, a former officer of the ministry, in a voice message, had asked Afghanistan's embassies to continue discharging their responsibilities. However, the source explained such orders should be issued in writing.Embassies also did not know about their fate and whether or not host countries would recognise the new government, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-embassies-acting-independently-many-broke-contact-with-taliban-report-101632015334445.html

The four amateur astronauts who went on a private space trip this week landed safely back to Earth on Saturday night after orbiting the planet for three days. The SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft ‘Resilience’ splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida in the United States at approximately 7:07pm EDT (around 4:37am IST), writing a new chapter in the history of human spaceflight and perhaps bringing the civilisation closer to the much-speculated future of space tourism.Also Read | SpaceX crew member plays ukulele in zero gravity, makes spaceflight history“Splashdown!” SpaceX posted from its official handle on Twitter, with a clip of the landing. “Welcome back to planet Earth, Inspiration4!”“On behalf of SpaceX, welcome back to planet Earth,” a SpaceX mission controller was quoted as saying after the splashdown. “Your mission has shown the world that space is for all of us.”Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who sponsored the trip and was also its mission commander, said in reply, “Thanks so much, SpaceX.

The event generated great interest across the world since it is expected that this chapter will now lead to a future of spaceflight for average people, rather than just government-sponsored astronauts.However, it is to be noted that the aforementioned crew was still far from ‘average’, in the true sense of the word.The trip was sponsored by Jared Isaacman, billionaire and philanthropist with pilot training. He is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of payment processor Shift4 Payments Inc, and was also the mission commander of the spaceflight, having chosen the rest of the crew himself through a competition.Isaacman was joined in the SpaceX mission by Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old paediatric cancer survivor, now working as a physician assistant. Arceneaux also became the first person to fly to space with a prosthetic device—she lives with a rod implanted in her left leg as part of her treatment for bone cancer.Chris Sembroski, a US air force veteran who now works as an aerospace data engineer for Lockheed Martin in Seattle, was also part of the crew. The other member was Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old geoscientist in Phoenix, who was almost selected to become an astronaut for Nasa in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-inspiration4-all-civilian-crew-land-back-safely-after-3-day-private-earth-circling-trip-101632010626913.html

It was felt widely, from neighboring cities such as Santa Monica, Torrance and Beverly Hills to the Antelope Valley an hour's drive north and south to Orange County and possibly beyond.The Marathon Petroleum refinery in Carson lost power and began burning off excess gases in a process known as flaring that sent flames into the sky and prompted calls from people concerned that there was a fire.“Flares are safety devices and the flares are functioning as intended. There are no injuries or off-site impact,” company spokesman Jamal Kheiry told the Los Angeles Times in an email.The Los Angeles Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode, sending vehicles and helicopters to patrol its 470 square miles (1,217-square-kilometer) area but said it didn't receive any reports of “significant damage or injury," according to a department statement.Seismologist Lucy Jones told KCBS-TV that the quake “doesn't look abnormal at all."“This size happens on average somewhere in Southern California every couple of months," she said. “When it happens to be in the middle of the Los Angeles basin then a lot more people feel it and it becomes bigger news."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-injuries-as-4-3-magnitude-earthquake-rattles-los-angeles-101632008845857.html

"Their crimes do not justify the way they are being treated."Members of Congress were not in the building on Saturday as the rally unfolded under the watchful eye of police in riot gear with shields, with many lawmakers still on summer recess and not back in town until next week.Look Ahead America, which organized the event and is planning similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks, had appealed for attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners.But some carried signs that read "Free Biden's political prisoners" or "Justice for Ashli Babbitt," a woman who was shot dead by police on January 6 as she tried to breach the House of Representatives.- Four arrests made -Capitol Police said 400 to 450 people were inside the protest area, excluding law enforcement -- but that would include the numerous journalists on site.Daniel, a 35-year-old who only gave his first name, said he had a few friends who were being detained pending trial."I think they should release them," he said.Pointing at the Capitol, he added: "That's our Capitol, for taxpayers, so we're allowed to go in there when we want."Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature eight months ago in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property.Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million.Four people were arrested Saturday near the Capitol, including two for weapons charges.

"This will not do."A "serious crisis" was now in progress between the allies, he added.Le Drian was speaking a day after Paris, on the orders of President Emmanuel Macron, recalled its ambassadors to Canberra and Washington, an unprecedented act that revealed the extent of the anger in France over the rupture of the contract.He described the withdrawal of the ambassadors as a "very symbolic" act which aimed "to show how unhappy we are and that there is a serious crisis between us and to re-evaluate out positions to defend our interests.""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries," he said.He also issued a stinging response to a question over why France had not recalled its ambassador to Britain, when London was also part of the security pact that led to the rupture of the contrat."We have recalled our ambassadors to (Canberra and Washington) to re-evaluate the situation. With Britain there is no need. We know their constant opportunism. So there is no need to bring our ambassador back to explain," he said.Of London's role in the pact, he added: "Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel."NATO would have to take account of what has happened as it reconsiders strategy at a summit in Madrid next year, he added.France would make a priority now of developing a EU security strategy when it takes on the bloc's presidency at the start of 2022, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-accuses-australia-us-of-lying-in-serious-crisis-101632006744092.html

"They were not terrorists, and now it is clear for them and all the world to see," he said of his relatives.Haidari added that he wanted officials to "capture and prosecute" those responsible for firing the missile."Most of them had worked with Americans," Haidari said. "Naser had worked with Americans for about 10 years. My uncle had also worked with international organisations."At the time of his death Ahmadi was working for a US aid group.Haidari said all the victims had received evacuation papers and had hoped to go to the United States soon, like many Afghans eager to flee newly Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.- 'Intelligence was wrong' -On the night of the strike, Ahmadi pulled his car into his driveway before youngsters piled into the vehicle -- pretending the parking routine was an adventure -- while he watched from the side.A missile then came screeching down onto the car -- obliterating the lives of 10 people in an instant.The wreckage of the vehicle was still in the courtyard of the house on Saturday, alongside another burned-out vehicle.Broken glass was strewn across the ground and the tiny sandals of the young victims had been placed on the mangled chassis.US Central Command commander General Kenneth McKenzie said American intelligence had seen the vehicle at a site in Kabul that had been identified as a location from which IS operatives were believed to be preparing attacks on the Kabul airport.Three days earlier an Islamic State-Khorasan suicide bomber had killed scores at the airport, including 13 US service members."We selected this car based on its movement at a known target area of interest to us," McKenzie said."Clearly our intelligence was wrong on this particular white Toyota," he said.- 'America must compensate' -Defense secretary Austin said Ahmadi's activities that day were "completely harmless", and that the man was "just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed"."We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan," said Austin.Ahmadi's brother Aimal, whose three-year-old daughter Maleka died in the attack, said "America must compensate"."Today it was good news for us that United States officially admitted that they had attacked innocents civilians," he said. "Our innocence has been proven."We demand justice from international institutions... Then we want compensation."McKenzie said the US government was studying how payments for damages could be made to the families of those killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/relatives-of-afghan-family-killed-in-us-strike-want-face-to-face-apology-101632006549496.html

People must still wear masks indoors and maintain a distance of 1.5 metres if social distancing is not possible.However, mass drinking parties are still illegal and punishable with fines for taking part between 500 euros ($586.25) for minors and 600 euros ($703.50) for adults. Organisers face fines of up to 600,000 euros ($703,500.00) if a court judges it is an activity which puts public health at risk.There were other mass drinking parties in Barcelona and the northern Spanish city of Logroño on Friday night, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-25-000-spanish-students-hold-macro-botellon-drinking-party-101632006317844.html

Once in orbit, they chatted with St. Jude patients, conducted medical tests on themselves, rang the closing bell for the New York Stock Exchange and dabbled in drawing and ukulele playing.It will be the first Atlantic splashdown by a returning space crew in more than 50 years. SpaceX's two previous crew splashdowns, with NASA astronauts, were in the Gulf of Mexico.SpaceX envisions up to six private flights a year, sandwiched between astronaut launches for NASA to the International Space Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-1st-tourists-homeward-bound-after-3-days-in-orbit-101632006172845.html

There were many opportunities and many channels. Never was such a change mentioned.”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, however, rejected French criticism and said he had raised the possibility in talks with the French president that Australia might scrap the Naval Group deal.Morrison insisted he had told Macron in June that Australia had revised its thinking.“I made it very clear, we had a lengthy dinner there in Paris, about our very significant concerns about the capabilities of conventional submarines to deal with the new strategic environment we’re faced with,” he said in an interview on Friday. “I made it very clear that this was a matter that Australia would need to make a decision on in our national interest.”Expressing “regret” over the French envoy’s recall, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that France was a “vital ally” and that the United States would be engaged in coming days to resolve the differences.He added that the issue would be discussed “at the senior level”, including at the United Nations General Assembly next week, which both Le Drian and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will attend.Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby meanwhile acknowledged that telephone talks earlier between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and French counterpart Florence Parly showed “that there is still much work to do in terms of our defence relationship with France”.The French foreign ministry statement made no mention of Britain, but a diplomatic source said France considered Britain had joined the deal in an opportunistic manner.“We don’t need to hold consultations with our (British) ambassador to know what to make of it or to draw any conclusions,” the source added.The strain in multilateral ties comes as the United States and its allies seek additional support in Asia and the Pacific given concern about the rising influence of a more assertive China.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried on Thursday to calm the French outcry, calling France a vital partner in the region. France meanwhile called off a gala at its ambassador’s house in Washington scheduled for Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-recalls-envoys-to-australia-us-in-standoff-101631993088728.html

Imran Khan says country paid ‘heavy price’||A day after the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) called for an independent, terrorism-free, and peaceful state in Afghanistan, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his country paid a “very heavy price” for siding with the US in its invasion in the now Taliban-captured nation.He also said that several remarks that have been made by US politicians, including the secretary of state Anthony Blinken, which blame Pakistan for the current situation in Afghanistan, has left Khan “deeply hurt.”“As a Pakistani, I felt deeply hurt by some of the remarks made by those senators. To blame Pakistan for this debacle in Afghanistan is the most painful thing for us to listen to,” Khan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI based on his interview with Russia’s TV network RT.Khan believes that committing Pakistan’s support to the American occupation of Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, though helped Pakistan secure US military aid, was still a wrong call.Also Read | At SCO meet, Modi says Afghanistan proof that radicalisation key challenge to peaceThe Pakistani premier further pointed out that after the American invasion in Afghanistan, and his country’s subsequent support of the same, alienated the mujahideen forces – which the Pakistani intelligence helped in building up only 20 years before as part of the US anti-Soviet campaign. “We have trained them to fight against foreign occupation. It was a holy war, a jihad,” Khan told RT, adding that with the Americans invading, the same Pakistan began telling these mujahideen forces that fighting the US troops was “terrorism.”“So, they (mujahideen forces) turned against us. They called us collaborators,” he said.Khan’s remarks come in the backdrop of Blinken being faced with a string of questions after the recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings where several US lawmakers blamed Pakistan for facilitating the Taliban. The lawmakers, regardless of being Democrat or Republican, called for severe action against Islamabad for its inflammatory role in the Taliban’s reoccupation in Afghanistan.Also Read | Antony Blinken says ties with Pakistan under review over AfghanistanFor instance, New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, Idaho Republican James Risch and Florida Republican Marco Rubio – all called for “understanding” Pakistan’s role in the current Afghanistan debacle. “We need to understand the double-dealing by Pakistan and providing a safe haven to the Taliban,” Menendez, who is also the chairman of the Foreign Relations committee said.Blinken, meanwhile, has given a message to Pakistan, telling it to “line up” with the broad majority of nations to force the Taliban regime to uphold the basic rights to Afghans, including women and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-pak-paid-heavy-price-in-siding-with-us-in-afghanistan-invasion-101631989129609.html

"We did not have enough weapons."In Malaspa, a farming village surrounded by lush fields, 67-year-old Khol Mohammad said the Islamists convoy had been so large it seemed like "a thousand vehicles full of Taliban" had swept in.Panjshir fighters earned a legendary reputation for resistance, defending their mountain homes first from the Soviet military for a decade, throughout the following civil war, and against the first Taliban regime from 1996-2001.The 115-kilometre (70-mile) valley surrounded by jagged snow-capped peaks offers defenders a natural advantage.But two decades since the late veteran fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud led the Panjshiris to victory, the province is no longer as isolated.On August 30 the Taliban launched a multi-pronged offensive -- with some residents claiming the Panjshiri fighters were outnumbered three-to-one.- Vintage rifles - Many of the Panjshiri guns were decades old, Taliban commander Mullah Sanaullah Sangin Fatih told AFP, as he showed off a huge cache of weapons and rockets he said was abandoned as resistance fighters fled."It dates mainly from the time of the Soviet occupation," Fatih said.That stands in stark contrast to the modern arsenal the Taliban had at their disposal.One Panjshiri fighter said the Islamists used a drone, "which enabled them to easily locate and bomb our positions".Multiple witnesses reported aerial bombardments, but it was not clear who carried them out.Some in Panjshir accuse neighbouring Pakistan of air strikes against them, claims Islamabad has rejected outright.Others criticise the lack of leadership, saying that the 32-year-old Ahmad Massoud -- the son of the legendary fighter -- lacked both experience and international backing.The other leader, ex-vice president Amrullah Saleh, did little to galvanise support."When he came in August to call on people to fight with him, the elders criticised him for never having done anything for Panjshir," a local journalist said.It is unclear what remains of the resistance, and whether its leaders are even still in the country.- Calm, for now - On September 6, the Taliban seized the Panjshir's capital of Bazarak and raised their white banner.Today, the valley appears calm, with Taliban rule going "well", according to several residents interviewed by AFP.As a sign of respect, the group have repaired the tomb of Ahmad Shah Massoud, which some of their fighters damaged when they seized Bazark.They say they want to bring "peace and security" to Panjshir, while continuing to hunt down remaining resistance fighters.But Khair Mohammad, an elder from Peshjrur village, said it reminded him of the Soviet occupation."It was exactly the same. They came, they told us at the beginning that we could be friends, and we said yes of course," he said with a smile."And you know what happened next."emd/mep/pjm/fox/rbu||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outgunned-and-alone-how-panjshir-s-resistance-fell-to-the-taliban-101631987448535.html
