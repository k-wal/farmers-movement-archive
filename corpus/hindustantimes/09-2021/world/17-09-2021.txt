17-09-2021||World||UN extends Afghan mission mandate for six months||The UN Security Council voted Friday to extend the UN mission in Afghanistan for six months and called on the Taliban to create an inclusive government.The 15-member council acted in a resolution passed unanimously on the UNAMA political mission, which deals with development issues, among others, not peacekeeping.The document stressed "the importance of the establishment of an inclusive and representative government," although Afghanistan's new Islamist rulers have formed a government made up only of Taliban members and no women.The resolution also calls for "full, equal and meaningful participation of women, and upholding human rights, including for women, children and minorities."It was drafted by Estonia and Norway, which welcomed the unanimous passage.In August a council resolution calling for freedom of movement for Afghans wishing to leave the country after the Taliban takeover won 13 votes, as Russia and China abstained.The text approved Friday says the UN will continue to play an "important role" in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.Diplomats said the Taliban did not object to the UN mandate being renewed."They are obliged to be more flexible," an Afghanistan specialist at the UN said."They are more pragmatic" than they were in the first stint in power in 1990s, the person said. The Taliban then were known to be brutal in their strict enforcement of Islamic law."The Taliban need the UN and this is our leverage" to have an influence on their decision making, the specialist told AFP.The council asked Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to brief it every other month on the situation in Afghanistan until the mandate is due again to expire in March 2022.It also wants a written report on the future of the mission by January 31.In recent weeks several NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have pressed for the UN and its 2,000 staffers in Afghanistan to stay in place to report on human rights abuses."There's little evidence to suggest the Taliban will comply with international human rights law, especially the rights of women and girls," said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, welcoming the mission extension."UNAMA will need to regularly and publicly report on abuses, while helping meet the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-extends-afghan-mission-mandate-for-six-months-101631893334612.html

A United Nations spokesperson said that Ambassador Ghulam Isaczai has written to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres with a list of Afghanistan's delegation for the General Assembly.Guterres' spokesperson Farhan Haq said that the accreditation request was sent on Wednesday, a day after the UN General Assembly session kicked off. A nine-member committee, appointed annually, assess the credentials of all UN members around October-November before submitting a report to General Assembly for final approval.Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, China, Namibia, Russia, Sierra Leone, Sweden and the United States have been named for this year’s UN committee that will assess the credentials. The committee usually operates by consensus, reported Reuters, setting up for a potential showdown if the Taliban put forward their own man for the seat of permanent representative at the UN.Also Read | Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani punched Taliban's Mullah Baradar before shootout in Kabul palace: ReportIsaczai, however, will remain in the New York seat until a decision is made, reported Reuters citing General Assembly rules.

Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’||The ministry of virtue and vice is not new for the Taliban as they had this ministry when they ruled in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Now they have not only brought it back but have replaced the ministry of women affairs with the ministry of virtue and vice, a Reuters report said. Workers have put up signboards of the ministry outside the department which used to be the ministry of women affairs.A sign for the building was covered by a replacement in a mixture of Dari and Arabic, reading "Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" on Friday, according to photographs and Reuters witnesses.While this happened on Friday, female employees of the ministry of women affairs were not allowed to enter the building on Thursday, reports said.What is vice and virtue ministry?This Taliban ministry was abolished after the US occupied Afghanistan. Bringing back the ministry was not surprising as the Taliban maintained that their governance will be based on Sharia law, though they promised women rights and press freedom. The aim of this ministry is to serve Islam. So, the ministry will decide and deliver punishments for what they consider as a crime. According to reports, the ministry will cust off the hands of the thieves while the punishment for illegal intercourse will be stoning.What will happen to women ministry?The ministry had no place in the earlier Taliban regime. The interim Cabinet has no women member in it, which makes it clear that there will be no ministry of women's affairs in Afghanistan. The ministry was created in 2001 and Delbar Nazari was the last minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-had-women-ministry-taliban-replace-it-with-vice-and-virtue-101631887569231.html
17-09-2021||World||Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani punched Taliban's Mullah Baradar before shootout in Kabul palace: Report||A prominent leader of the Haqqani Network punched Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Taliban co-founder and current deputy prime minister of the so-called Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan, which led to a shootout during a meeting at the presidential place in Kabul early September, according to a Bloomberg report. Baradar has earlier headed the Taliban’s political office in Doha to lead the peace talks with the United States after the Trump administration facilitated his release from a Pakistan prison.Western countries have opted for a wait-and-watch policy in recognising the Taliban government and have repeatedly called on the Sunni Pashtun group to include non-Taliban leaders and ethnic minorities. The Taliban co-founder was at the presidential place to discuss the structure of the government as he pushed for an “inclusive” cabinet that would have been more acceptable to the international community, as per multiple reports.Amid the heated discussion, Khalil ul Rahman Haqqani, a minister and senior leader of the Haqqani Network, rose from his chair began punching Baradar, reported Bloomberg citing people familiar with the development. The situation quickly escalated and their bodyguards opened fire on each other, killing and wounding a number of them, the report claimed.The shootout at the presidential palace triggered rumours about Baradar’s death. But the Taliban leader, according to Bloomberg, wasn’t injured and left for Kandahar to speak to the group’s Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has not been seen in public for a long time. Since then, members of the Taliban have repeatedly rejected the reports of a clash even as Mullah Baradar got sidelined in the Taliban setup and a lesser-known Mullah Mohammad Hassan was appointed as the acting prime minister in the interim government.Baradar even appeared on state-run television to deny the reports of his death or injury.“Praise be to God, I am safe and sound,” he said. “Another statement made by the media that we have internal disputes is also completely not true.”The cabinet has no one from outside the Taliban, with members of the Haqqani family receiving four positions. The Taliban and Haqqani groups merged around 2016. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the US-designated terrorist, was appointed acting interior minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalilurrahman-haqqani-punched-taliban-s-mullah-baradar-before-shootout-in-kabul-palace-report-101631881918511.html

Earth’s protective ozone layer depletes and forms a hole over the South pole every Spring due to the human-made chemicals.The atmospheric ozone absorbs the harmful portion of rays coming from the Sun to preserve life on the planet. The ozone hole located over regions with populations put them at risk of being exposed to unhealthy levels of ultraviolet radiation. CAMS constantly monitors the ozone layer to track the annual chemical destruction of ozone that leads to the formation of the hole.The ozone depletion at the start of this season was similar to that of last year’s but grew considerably in the last two weeks, becoming larger than 75% of ozone holes at that stage in the season since 1979. Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the CAMS, said in a statement that the ozone hole may continue to grow slightly over the next two or three weeks.“This year, the ozone hole developed as expected at the start of the season. It seems pretty similar to last year's, which also wasn't really exceptional until early September, but then turned into one of the largest and longest-lasting ozone holes in our data record later in the season,” Peuch said.“Now our forecasts show that this year´s hole has evolved into a rather larger than usual one,” he added.In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed which led to a ban on a group of chemicals called halocarbons that contain bromine which has high ozone-depleting potential (ODP). A number of commonly used chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been to be extremely damaging to the ozone layer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hole-in-ozone-layer-over-southern-hemisphere-larger-than-antarctica-scientists-say-101631880824413.html

Panjshir is the only province in Afghanistan which the Taliban have not been able to fully capture, though they claimed the same. The Northern Resistance Front claimed the fighting is still on and Ahmad Massoud is also seeking the help of the United States through a lobbyist in Washington.While reports claimed that Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, the two leaders of teh Pajnhsir Resistance, are still in the valley, the villages of the province now lie deserted with mostly old men and livestock left behind, news agency AFP reported as it took a tour in the province. VIDEO: Ghost towns and old men in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley.Fighters in Panjshir vowed to battle the Taliban to the last man, but nearly two weeks after the hardline Islamists celebrated victory, parts of the rugged valley lie empty and abandoned pic.twitter.com/LLXCI489O9'Taliban do not want people to leave'Shops are closed and most of the provinces are under Taliban control who do not want residents to leave the valley so that they can have a human shield.Why are people leaving the only one Taliban-free area of the country?

"Their fighting was very weak. They could not resist us. They were defeated with the grace of God. All of their communication was taken out, and they surrendered to us.

The withdrawal of foreign troops has opened a new page in its history. But Afghanistan still faces many daunting challenges, and it needs the support and assistance of the international community, particularly countries in our region,” Xi Jinping said.“We SCO member states need to step up coordination, make full use of platforms such as the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and facilitate a smooth transition in Afghanistan,” he said.“We (the SCO) need to encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework, adopt prudent and moderate domestic and foreign policies, resolutely fight all forms of terrorism, live in amity with its neighbours and truly embark on a path of peace, stability and development,” Xi Jinping said in his speech.In the context of not interfering in another country’s domestic affairs, Xi said external forces should never be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of countries under any pretext.“We must never allow any external interference in the domestic affairs of countries in our region under whatever pretext. In short, we should keep the future of our countries’ development and progress firmly in our own hands,” he said.Without naming the US or any western country, Xi Jinping said: “We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions. We should support each other in steadily advancing important political agenda including domestic elections.”On the issue of terrorism, Xi Jinping said the SCO needs to uphold “common security”.“Faced with complex and fluid security dynamics in the region, we need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and take tough actions against terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement,” Xi Jinping said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sco-countries-should-help-afghanistan-xi-jinping-101631876244626.html

US president Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new security pact on Wednesday under which America and Britain will provide Australia with the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Announcing the deal, Morrison said that Australia intends to build the submarines in Adelaide in close cooperation with the UK and the US.“But let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability. And we will continue to meet all our nuclear non-proliferation obligations,” Morrison added.The surprise announcement, however, didn’t go down well with France which will reportedly lose nearly $100 billion deal to build diesel submarines for Australia. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed “total incomprehension” at the announcement of the initiative, calling it a “stab in the back”.“It looks a lot like what Trump did,” he said.China has also reacted sharply to the new defence deal which is seen as a move to counter Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing that the Aukus treaty "seriously undermines regional peace and stability, intensifies the arms race, and harms international non-proliferation efforts.""This proves once again that these countries are using nuclear exports as a tool for geopolitical games,” he said.China is among the six countries to have nuclear-powered submarines as it continues to expand its fleet to assert its power in the Indo-Pacific. On the other hand, the United States has more nuclear submarines than all the other five countries combined, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Here’s the list of countries with nuclear-powered submarines:The latest deal will make Australia the seventh nation to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aukus-which-countries-have-nuclear-powered-submarines-101631871464236.html

The two diplomats met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan on Thursday.Wang Yi said both countries need to work together, maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of incidents.S Jaishankar said India-China ties were “indispensable” and that New Delhi doesn’t believe in a “clash of civilisations”.The two diplomats last met in July during an SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Dushanbe.Wang, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement issued on Friday, said, “In the previous period, the communication between the diplomatic and military departments of the two countries was serious and effective, and the border situation between the two countries has generally developed in the direction of ease.“It is hoped that the Indian side will meet the Chinese side halfway, promoting the continued stability of the [border] situation, and gradually shift from emergency response to normalised management.”China and India should “work together to maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of border incidents”, he said.The talks at the SCO summit in Dushanbe took place in the backdrop of the India-China border tensions, which despite the withdrawal of frontline forces from Pangong Lake and Gogra areas, continue to linger.Both sides still have tens of thousands of troops deployed on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as part of a stand-off that began in May last year.“It is necessary to consolidate the results of the disengagement of frontline forces and strictly abide by the agreements and consensus reached between the two countries. [China and India should] work together to maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of border incidents,” Wang Yi said.The senior Chinese diplomat said both countries should adhere to the consensus “that they do not pose a threat to each other” and push cooperation back on track.The Chinese statement quoted S Jaishankar as saying that India and China have made progress in handling the border situation, while there were still some unresolved issues.“The Indian side is willing to work with China to abide by the bilateral agreement, promote the next round of the military commander-level meeting to achieve positive results, and earnestly maintain peace in the border area,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying.“The Indian side does not believe in the clash of civilisations and believes that it is very important for Asian countries to maintain unity. To achieve that, India-China cooperation is indispensable,” the Indian minister said.S Jaishankar said India is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China within the framework of the Brics and the SCO to jointly respond to global challenges such as combating terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-should-focus-on-normalised-management-of-border-wang-yi-at-sco-101631871314992.html

In a weekly press briefing, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad termed Blinken's statement as "surprise," Pakistan's daily, Dawn reported. Ahmad also noted that Pakistan's positive role in the Afghan peace process and said that his country’s continued support for an inclusive political settlement had been "duly acknowledged", including by the US state department. He also highlighted Pakistan's role in the facilitation of the multinational evacuation effort from Afghanistan.“We are going to be looking at in the days and weeks ahead, the role that Pakistan has played over the last 20 years, but also the role that we would want to see it playing in the coming years,” Ahmad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.This comes after Blinken told the Congress that the US will be looking at ties with Pakistan in the coming weeks to formulate the role America wants Islamabad to play in the future of Afghanistan. Blinken also sent an assertive message to Pakistan telling it to "line up" with the broad majority of nations to force the Taliban regime to uphold the basic rights of Afghan people, including women and children. Blinken also alleged that Pakistan has "harboured" members of the Taliban including the terrorists from the proscribed Haqqani network.Since the fall of Kabul last month, Pakistan has come under scrutiny and criticism over its alleged role in enabling the hardliner Taliban in Afghanistan. The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Pakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and other outfits in the region. The country is also accused of supporting the group and giving shelter to several wanted terrorists.Pakistan's intelligence chief Faiz Hameed visited the Afghan capital while the insurgents' leaders were in the process of forming their government. During the visit, Hameed was briefed by his country's ambassador about the escalating situation in Kabul. According to reports, he also met with Taliban officials during the visit.On September 7, hundreds of Afghan men and women held a demonstration against Pakistan and its alleged interference in Afghanistan's affairs. During the march, the protesters also shouted slogans like "Long live the resistance," and "Death to Pakistan."According to reports, at least three rallies were also held across Kabul in a show of resistance against the Taliban, known for their brutal and radical justice system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surprised-pakistan-after-blinken-says-us-reassessing-ties-with-islamabad-101631865356316.html

17-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Liberal Party candidate halts campaign over sexual assault allegation||In a setback to Liberals’ federal elections campaign, one of its candidates from Toronto was asked to “pause campaigning” as the party investigated an allegation of sexual assault against him.That revelation came in a report from the daily Toronto Star on Thursday night. It reported that Kevin Vuong, the party nominee from the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Spadina - Fort York was charged with sexual assault by an unidentified woman in 2019.According to the Star, Vuong “unequivocally” denied the charge and described them as “false”. However, he added, “I will be taking some time with my family.”Vuong actually faced the charge in court but it was withdrawn in November 2019. However, in an interview with the daily, the alleged victim said the incident occurred in April that year but she “didn’t have the energy” to undergo a trial in this regard. The alleged victim said she only became aware that Vuong was running as a candidate for the federal elections due on September 20 when she saw his picture on election signage after returning to Toronto recently.This is the second time allegations of sexual harassment have rocked the Liberal Party campaign. On September 4, after facing allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staffers, Indo-Canadian MP Raj Saini announced that he had decided to end his run for re-election from Kitchener Centre.Since nominations for the elections were closed at the time, his exit left the party without a candidate in the riding. Saini had also described the allegations he faced as “unequivocally false” adding that he had “never acted inappropriately towards staff, volunteers or constituents.”While Vuong’s fate as a candidate is unclear, his potential departure may leave the Liberals minus a seat that it currently holds in the House of Commons. Vuong was nominated after incumbent Adam Vaughan didn’t seek re-election.According to his campaign website, Vuong, who is of Vietnamese origin and the son of refugees from the Vietnam War, “co-founded TakeCare Supply, which rapidly developed Canada’s first evidence-based reusable mask” after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-liberal-party-candidate-halts-campaign-over-sexual-assault-allegation-101631860214053.html

Grandi has said that even before the Taliban took over last month, more than 18 million Afghans, or about half the population, required humanitarian aid. More than 3.5 million Afghans were already displaced in a country that is battling drought and the Covid-19 pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bats-for-taliban-says-should-be-given-time-to-run-afghanistan-101631859274063.html
17-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Barack Obama backs Justin Trudeau||Justin Trudeau’s electoral campaign on Thursday received an unexpected boost from his friend and former US president Barack Obama who backed him for another term. Former US president Barack Obama tweeted, “Wishing my friend Justin Trudeau the best in Canada’s upcoming election. Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values, and I’m proud of the work we did together.” That boost came as Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau’s central theme for the 2021 federal elections of focusing on mandating vaccinations received more support as two holdout Western provinces Alberta and Saskatchewan announced plans for introducing vaccine passports. As cases in those provinces surged during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, those developments will only provide momentum to the campaign of the incumbent Prime Minister to return to power in Ottawa, though the likelihood is he will again command a minority government.Across the country, daily cases rose by 3,957, to a total of 1,563,383. Alberta alone contributed 1,718 new cases. Starting September 20, the province will require those seeking to enter non-essential businesses, like restaurants and gyms, to provide proof of at least a dose of a vaccine, rising to both does on October 25.Alberta has been among the provinces opposing mandates in the past and Justin Trudeau immediately jumped into the conversation, tying principal rival Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. “Just a few days ago, Mr O’Toole was still applauding Kenney for his management of the pandemic. That’s at the heart of the choice Canadians need to make in this election,” Justin Trudeau said during a campaign stop in Montreal. Speaking in French, he added, “He’s not the right leader to put an end to this pandemic. Do we stand up even stronger in our fight against this pandemic, or do we give in to anti-vaxxers in the Conservative Party and go ahead with half-measures?” according to the outlet CBC News.Erin O’Toole has opposed mandates on the public service and on travelling domestically by air or train. Erin O’Toole and Jason Kenney were colleagues in the cabinet of former prime Minister Stephen Harper.But the platform of Trudeau’s management of Covid-19 has strengthened and is now the main issue of concern for Canadians ahead of voting on Monday. It has drowned out other issues like the economy, even though Statistics Canada reported this week that inflation was at a three-decade peak in the country. While Erin O’Toole is favoured in various surveys on fiscal matters, Justin Trudeau scores high on the pandemic, and the latter issue could prove decisive.But the Liberal Party is still not close to majority territory. According to the CBC Poll Tracker, it has 31.7% vote share translating to 150 seats, while the Conservatives are at 31.2% and 120 seats.In 2019, the ruling party garnered 157 seats, 13 short of the majority mark in the House of Commons while the Conservatives had 121.The poll tracker gave Justin Trudeau just a 12% chance of getting a majority with the likelihood of another minority at 59%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-barack-obama-backs-justin-trudeau-101631856553988.html
17-09-2021||World||IMF head, accused of influencing report in China's favour, risks undermined authority||Kristalina Georgieva risks seeing her authority as head of the International Monetary Fund undermined just weeks before an annual meeting of global finance chiefs, after being accused of influencing a report in China’s favor when she worked at the World Bank.Georgieva on Thursday said that she “fundamentally” disagreed with the finding -- by an outside law firm engaged by the World Bank -- that she had applied pressure on the bank’s staff to boost China’s ranking in an economic report. She informed the IMF board of the allegations on Thursday and will be addressing the fund’s staff Friday, according to people familiar with the matter.The substance of the charge -- putting “undue pressure” on World Bank staff to adjust the rating in the “Doing Business” report when she served as the chief executive officer – was the latest in a series of scandals that have plagued the troubled report in recent years. So beleaguered, subjective, and controversial is the methodology for the report, which measures the ease and transparency of operating in an economy, that the World Bank announced it will stop producing it.But for Georgieva, 68, the scrutiny may only be starting.The ranking that she is accused of pressuring staff to improve is that of China, a magnet for criticism in Washington over everything from trade to geopolitics. The US Treasury sees the accusations as serious and is “analyzing the report,” the department said; the US holds veto power over major IMF and World Bank decisions. Republican lawmakers could use the issue to renew criticism of an expansion in IMF resources under Georgieva’s leadership.‘Pretty Damning’Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow and World Bank watcher at the Center for Global Development, a think-tank, said the report could end up affecting her relationship with IMF members.“The IMF is in charge of ensuring the integrity of international macroeconomic statistics and holding countries to account for the integrity of their data,” Sandefur said in an interview. “This report just has Georgieva red-handed actively involved in the manipulation of data for geopolitical purposes. That seems pretty damning.”The episode offers a rare window into how China has exerted influence on the leaders of international financial institutions in recent years, and how reactive those senior officials have been to sensibilities in Beijing.The World Bank-commissioned report, penned by lawyers at WilmerHale, goes out of its way to exonerate China from having done anything wrong. “To be clear our review should not be read to imply that there was any inappropriate conduct on behalf of any Chinese or other government officials,” they wrote.China EngagementGeorgieva was serving as the bank’s CEO under Jim Yong Kim, who was nominated by President Barack Obama and spent much of his tenure as president of the World Bank conducting geopolitics, often by necessity. He worked hard to build a relationship with both China and the rival to his own institution that it had established -- the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Kim’s current employer, an investment fund called Global Infrastructure Partners, didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday’s report.The politics have only become more difficult as China has grown increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping and as the relationship between Washington and Beijing has grown tenser on a number of fronts, including trade and economics.Paul Romer, the Nobel winner who was the World Bank’s chief economist until he left in early 2018 -- after falling out with Kim and Georgieva -- said in an interview that China had often applied pressure on bank staff to alter draft reports. It was his parting criticism of the “Doing Business” process, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, that led to the investigation into the report and the politics surrounding it.Read More: World Bank Corrects Country Rankings After Probe of Altered DataChina’s position in the 2018 report, released in October 2017, should have been seven places lower -- at No. 85 rather than 78 -- the World Bank said in a review released last December. Kim and Georgieva had influenced a reworking of the rating, WillmerHale found.“You couldn’t have engineered a more embarrassing collection of facts for Kristalina vis-a-vis critics of the fund on Capitol Hill,” said Sandefur.IMF IntegrityGeorgieva, the first head of the IMF to hail from an emerging market -- Bulgaria -- has been overseeing a historic expansion in the reserve assets of IMF members, of $650 billion, meant to help countries deal with mounting debt and the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Republican lawmakers have criticized the move in part as a reward to undemocratic nations, including China. GOP Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky in a statement late Thursday called the report “alarming” and urged the Treasury to “evaluate” Georgieva’s actions in the run-up to the allocation of that money, known as special drawing rights, in light of the report’s findings. “Ensuring integrity at the IMF is essential,” Barr said.According to the report and one person familiar with the events, Georgieva took charge of what was seen within the bank as an unusual intervention on China’s behalf. In the past, senior staff had done their best not to intervene with the team overseeing the “Doing Business” report for fear of violating internal rules, the person familiar with what happened said.Premier’s GrumbleIt also came at a time of intense sensitivity in China about the “Doing Business” rankings. Earlier that year Li Keqiang, the premier, had grumbled about China’s poor showing, triggering a surge in domestic efforts to improve its performance. Those efforts were too late to affect the 2018 standings, though they later paid off. In the 2020 rankings, China finished 31st, ahead of France.The issue was raised at least twice in dinners Kim had with senior Chinese officials during visits that year, according to the person familiar with the events. They also were raised by Chinese officials with Georgieva during a visit she made as part of the China Development Forum.On the World Bank’s side, they also came as Kim and Georgieva were engaged in delicate negotiations with China, the US, and other members to raise the bank’s capital. In the end, China accepted both a smaller shareholding in the bank than it sought and higher interest rates on bank loans it received as part of a plan to defuse opposition from the Trump administration.The episode detailed in the report highlighted an inherent tension in leading the Washington-based IMF and World Bank, Romer said. Both are institutions where the leaders have to be shrewd diplomats to both wins and keep their jobs -- which increasingly means securing the approval of Beijing as well as Washington.‘Worth Reading’Yet those necessary politics can be at odds with their missions to be scrupulously independent keepers of important data and analysis. That means the latest episode will have a cost to the credibility of not just the World Bank but also the IMF, Romer said.By tradition under an unwritten transatlantic agreement, Europe has selected the managing directors of the IMF while the US chooses presidents of the World Bank. Georgieva is the second woman to have run the IMF, following current European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Attention on the WilmerHale report is unlikely to go away quickly, according to longtime observers of the fund’s politics.“The full report is worth reading, it’s quite something,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, wrote on Twitter. “Some remarkable actions” by Georgieva, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-head-accused-of-influencing-report-in-china-s-favour-risks-undermined-authority-101631848354168.html
17-09-2021||World||‘Making Taliban great again’: Biden portrayed as terrorist on US billboards||Weeks after the US completed its withdrawal of troops from war-torn Afghanistan, ending nearly 20 years of combat, a bunch of billboards have now popped up across Pennsylvania – portraying US president Joe Biden as a Taliban terrorist and displaying the slogan “Making the Taliban great again”. According to reports, the billboard ads were commissioned by former Pennsylvania senator Scott Wagner, who rented out a dozen billboards across highways at a cost of about $15,000 to display a message that reflected his anger over the US response to the Afghanistan situation.Also Read | Afghanistan on brink of collapse, Taliban fighters surviving on donation: Report“What do you say to those veterans [who fought in the Afghanistan war]?” Wagner told the York Daily Record, reflecting on the pullout of US troops in Afghanistan. “It's like Vietnam, even worse.”A billboard has popped up along I-83 in York County, Pennsylvania, showing President Joe Biden in a military outfit with the phrase “Making the Taliban Great Again.” Here's who put it up. https://t.co/C3rBY1B33M pic.twitter.com/krhceWrh4xFormer Pennsylvania State Senator @realScottWagner Scott Wagner paid for a billboard in York, Pennsylvania that depicts President Biden in Afghan garb holding an RPG, with the heading, “Making the Taliban great again!” pic.twitter.com/fhZzFFzSi6The York Daily Record reports that the former senator met a number of veterans, who served the United States in its longest war in Afghanistan, over the years. Wagner said many of these soldiers sacrificed their entire beings – limbs and psyche – for the cause, adding that he is not shy of mocking the recent “chaotic” withdrawal in such a ‘provocative’ manner.The phrase “Making the Taliban great again” is a play on former US president Donald Trump's now-infamous election campaign slogan and a rallying cry for his supporters – “Make America Great Again”. The image with Joe Biden dressed in Taliban garb and holding a rocket launcher is meant to blame the US president for the messy situation that has developed in Afghanistan following the exit of the United States and its allies from the war-torn land.The former Pennsylvania senator, however, clarified that he is no Trump supporter, and would have similarly dissed the former US president had he pulled out of Afghanistan. “If Trump had done the same thing, he'd be looking the same way,” said Wagner, bluntly.It has been a month since the Afghan capital of Kabul fell to the Taliban, following the lightning-fast offensive which won the group control of the state machinery in the war-torn land. Afghanistan watchers and political commentators across the world were stunned by the Taliban blitzkrieg, which coincided with the withdrawal of the United States and allied troops from the country at the end of a nearly 20-year war. The militants made rapid territorial gains in a little over three months' time, as they captured one provincial capital after another; eventually, Kabul fell to the offensive on August 15, 2021.Also Read | Frozen economy, confined rights: 10 changes in Afghanistan in 30 days of Taliban ruleThe sheer tempo of the Taliban takeover surprised many in the international community, and the aftermath reflected widespread domestic and global ramifications regarding human rights and concerns regarding the proliferation of terrorism.

17-09-2021||World||Covid-19: As UK prepares to vaccinate kids, a study looks into mixed dosage||A British study will look into the immune responses of children to mixed schedules of different Covid-19 vaccines as officials try to determine the best approach to second doses in adolescents given a small risk of heart inflammation.Children aged 12-15 in Britain will be vaccinated from next week, while those aged 16-17 have been eligible for shots since August.However, while the children will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, officials have said that advice about second doses will be given at a later date, while more data is gathered.Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) initially declined to recommend shots for all 12- to 15-year-olds, citing uncertainty over the long-term impact of myocarditis, a rare side effect of mRNA-based vaccines such as Pfizer's. The heart condition typically resolves itself with mild short-term consequences, health experts have said.Hong Kong has advised children only get one shot, owing to similar concerns over heart inflammation.The study, called Com-COV3, will test different vaccine schedules in 12- to 16-year-olds, looking at the immune responses and milder side effects."The concern here is about the risks of myocarditis, particularly with the second dose with Pfizer vaccine in young men," the trial's lead researcher, Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told reporters."This will provide the JCVI with information crucial to informing their advice about immunising teenagers in the UK," he said.The trial will give all participants a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That will be followed eight weeks later by either a second full dose or a half dose of the Pfizer shot, a full dose of Novavax's vaccine, or a half dose of Moderna's shot.The trial is recruiting 360 volunteers, not large enough to directly assess the myocarditis risk of the different combinations, which Snape said was 1 in 15,000 after two doses of the Pfizer shot in young men.But, he added, it "would be reassuring to see if there was a lower inflammatory response after one of these changes compared to Pfizer (followed by) Pfizer," and that it might be "reasonable to infer that the risks of myocarditis might be lower" in such an instance.Snape is running another arm of the trial in adults, giving mixed vaccine schedules both four and 12 weeks apart, and comparing the responses. He said the results of that would be coming "very shortly".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-as-uk-prepares-to-vaccinate-kids-a-study-looks-into-mixed-dosage-101631845194218.html

Her groundbreaking research made Michiyo Tsujimura the first woman in Japan to earn a doctorate in agriculture. Tsujimura’s research focused on the health properties of green tea, a widelywor popular drink in today's times.Born in 1888 in what is now Okegawa in Saitama Prefecture of Japan, Tsujimura started her career as an unpaid laboratory assistant at Hokkaido Imperial University. This was at the time when the university did not even accept female students.A few years later, Tsujimura transferred to Tokyo Imperial University and started researching the biochemistry of green tea. She also worked with Dr Umetaro Suzuki famous for his discovery of vitamin B1. Their joint research revealed that green tea contained significant amounts of vitamin C—the first of many yet unknown molecular compounds in green tea that awaited under the microscope.Tsujimura isolated the flavonoid catechin—the bitter ingredient of tea—in 1929 and a year later she extracted tannin in crystal form from green tea. In 1932, her findings on the constituents of green tea, titled "On the Chemical Components of Green Tea", led her to graduate as Japan’s first woman doctor of agriculture from Tokyo Imperial University.In 1949, Tsujimura also made history as an educator and spent long years of her career as a University professor. She was a professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School from 1950 and was the school's first dean of the Faculty of Home Economics.In 1956, Tsujimura was awarded the Japan Prize of Agricultural Science for her green tea research. She was also conferred with the Order of the Precious Crown of the Fourth Class in 1968.Michiyo Tsujimura died in 1969 at the age of 81.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-honours-michiyo-tsujimura-in-today-s-doodle-101631838358959.html
17-09-2021||World||Texas judge quashes US govt bid for earlier hearing on Abortion law||A federal judge in Texas denied a US Justice Department request to move up a hearing on whether the state’s restrictive new abortion law should be put on hold while the government challenges the ban in a lawsuit.The Biden administration had argued that an Oct. 1 hearing on its motion for a temporary restraining order against the law should be moved to Sept. 21 because women are already being put at risk. But US District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin denied the request Thursday.“This case presents complex, important questions of law that merit a full opportunity for the parties to present their positions to the court,” Pitman, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said in a one-paragraph order.The law, which took effect Sept. 1, bans most abortions in Texas after six weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. It also allows members of the public to sue abortion providers suspected of breaking the law and provides for bounties of $10,000 per illegal procedure.After Pitman scheduled the Oct. 1 hearing, the Justice Department filed a motion to expedite the arguments, saying women in Texas couldn’t wait that long to find out if the law would be put on hold during the litigation.“Providers in Texas confirmed that many patients have already been forced to travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to obtain an abortion out of state,” the Justice Department said in its request. “This includes a minor who was raped by a family member and had to travel eight hours from Galveston to Oklahoma in order to obtain an abortion.”Texas lawmakers argue abortions should not be allowed after a fetal heartbeat is detected, while civil rights activist point out that most women do not know there are pregnant until weeks later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-judge-quashes-us-govt-bid-for-earlier-hearing-on-abortion-law-101631833615477.html
17-09-2021||World||IMF chief Georgieva says did not alter World Bank report to appease China||IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday disputed an independent investigation which found that in her previous job at the World Bank, she pressed staff to alter a report to avoid angering China.Based on the findings, the World Bank announced that it was immediately discontinuing its Doing Business report after the investigation found irregularities in the 2018 and 2020 editions.Georgieva, a Bulgarian national who took the helm of the IMF in October 2019, rejected its conclusions regarding her role."I disagree fundamentally with the findings and interpretations of the Investigation of Data Irregularities as it relates to my role in the World Bank's Doing Business report of 2018," she said in a statement.The allegations could damage her reputation, and provide grist for long-time US critics of the multilateral organizations and their treatment of China."These are serious findings," the US Treasury said in a statement, noting that it is "analyzing the report.""Our primary responsibility is to uphold the integrity of international financial institutions," the statement said.Georgieva said she briefed the IMF board on the situation. The board is expected to meet to discuss the issue but it is unclear when.Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development, who has written extensively about the problems with the report's methodology, said, "We need to hear her side of the story, but it doesn't look great right now.""The IMF is in charge of monitoring the integrity of macroeconomic and financial data internationally, and for the head of the IMF to have been involved in data manipulation is pretty damning allegation," he told AFP. "That does seem like a real hit on on their credibility."Changing China's rankingThe flagship report ranks countries based on their business regulations and economic reforms, and has caused governments to jockey for a higher spot to attract investors.According to the investigation, Beijing complained about its ranking of 78th on the list in 2017, and the next year's report would have shown Beijing dropping even further.The Washington-based development lender's staff was preparing the 2018 edition while leadership engaged in sensitive negotiations to increase its lending capital, which hinged on an agreement with China and the United States.In the final weeks before the report was released at the end of October 2017, the World Bank's then-president Jim Kim and Georgieva, at the time the bank's CEO, asked staff to look into updating the methodology in regard to China, according to the investigation by law firm WilmerHale.Kim discussed the rankings with senior Chinese officials who were dismayed by the country's ranking, and his aides raised the issue of how to improve it, according to the summary of the probe, released by the World Bank.It is considered one of Kim's signature achievements that he shepherded a deal for a $13 billion increase in World Bank resources.The bargain required support from the US president at the time Donald Trump, who opposed concessional lending to China, and from Beijing, which agreed to pay more for loans.Amid the pressure from upper management, staff changed some of the input data, which boosted China's ranking in 2018 by seven places to 78 -- the same as it was the previous year, according to the investigation that analyzed 80,000 documents and interviewed more than three dozen current and former employees of the lender.'For multilateralism'Georgieva chastised a World Bank senior official for "mishandling the Bank's relationship with China and failing to appreciate the importance of the Doing Business report to the country," the report said.After the changes were made, she thanked him for "doing his part for multilateralism."Georgieva later visited the home of the manager in charge of the report to retrieve a copy, and thanked them for helping to "resolve the problem."Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize winner who served as the World Bank's chief economist at the time, resigned in January 2018 after telling a reporter that the methodology for the ranking had been changed in a way that could give the impression political considerations affected the results.At the time, the World Bank strenuously denied any political influence over the rankings.The investigation also found "improper changes" in the 2020 report affecting the rankings of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.Nadia Daar, head of Oxfam International's Washington DC Office, applauded the decision to scrap the report, saying the index "encouraged governments to adopt destructive policies that worsen inequality."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-chief-georgieva-says-did-not-alter-world-bank-report-to-appease-china-101631833359700.html
17-09-2021||World||Gabby Petito's disappearance grips US; search intensifies||Police video shows a Florida woman who disappeared during a cross-country journey in a converted camper van had an emotional fight with her boyfriend in a Utah tourist town before she vanished.The video released by the Moab Police Department shows that an officer pulled over the van on Aug. 12 after it was seen speeding and hit a curb near the entrance to Arches National Park.Inside was Brian Laundrie, 23, and his 22-year-old girlfriend, Gabrielle “Gabby” Petito, who was reported missing by her family a month later and is now the subject of a nationwide search joined by the FBI.Police in North Port, Florida, where the couple lived, say Laundrie is a “person of interest" in her case. He's not been charged, but he's also not cooperating.North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison publicly vented his frustration over his lack of help on Wednesday, pleading for Laundrie's lawyer to arrange a conversation. “Two people left on a trip and one person returned!” the chief's tweet said.The body camera video shows Petito visibly upset when an officer approached them.“We’ve just been fighting this morning. Some personal issues,” she tells him, adding that she suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder that affects her behavior.“Some days, I have really bad OCD, and I was just cleaning and straightening up and I was apologizing to him saying that I’m so mean because sometimes I have OCD and get frustrated,” she said.Laundrie says on the video the couple got into a minor scuffle that began when he climbed into the van with dirty feet, and said he didn't want to pursue a domestic violence charge against Petito, who officers decided was the aggressor.“I’m not going to pursue anything because she is my fiancée and I love her. It was just a squabble. Sorry it had to get so public,” Laundrie says.Ultimately Moab police decided not file any charges and instead separated the couple for the night, with Laundrie checking into a motel and Petito remaining with the converted sleeper van.Petito and Laundrie started their drive across the US in July from New York's Long Island, where both grew up. They intended to reach Oregon by Halloween according to their social media accounts, but Petito vanished after her last known contact with family in late August from Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, authorities said.Laundrie drove the Ford Transit van back to Florida on Sept. 1 alone, police said. Petito's family filed a missing persons report last Saturday with police in Suffolk County, New York.Petito's parents released a letter through their attorney on Thursday to Laundrie's parents, asking them to help investigators locate Petito, despite their instinct to protect their son.“We believe you know the location of where Brian left Gabby,” the letter said. “We beg you to tell us. As a parent, how could you let us go through this pain and not help us? As a parent, how could you put Gabby’s younger brothers and sisters through this?”Laundrie's attorney, Steven Bertolino, said the Laundrie family is hoping for Petito's safe return, but he's asked them not to speak with investigators."I can’t speculate as to why he’s not talking, but he has the pieces to the puzzle that we need to find Gabby,” Garrison said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Garrison said at a news conference Thursday that the investigation remains a missing persons case, not a murder probe, and that no intensive searches have begun because it's unclear exactly where authorities might look.“We're still trying to nail down geographic areas,” the chief said. “There's a lot of information we are going through. Our focus is to find Gabby.”The missing woman's father, Joe Petito, also appeared at the news conference to urge anyone with knowledge about his daughter to come forward.“What I want from everybody here is help. Whatever you can do to make sure my daughter comes home, I’m asking you to help. Nothing else matters right now,” Joe Petito said.Authorities are also looking for any possible connection between Petito's disappearance and the still-unsolved slaying of two women who were fatally shot at a campsite near Moab.Their bodies were found Aug. 18, six days after the incident between Laundrie and Petito. The two women, Kylen Schulte, 24, and Crystal Turner, 38, had told friends they feared a “creepy man” they had seen nearby might harm them.“They're looking into that potential connection,” said Joshua Taylor, public information officer for North Port police. “I have not heard of any information that links these two cases together. I understand the timing is suspicious. You never know. I'm not going to say we've ruled it out.”Petito and Laundrie were childhood sweethearts on Long Island before moving in 2019 to live with his parents in North Port, about 34 miles (54 kilometers) south of Sarasota.An eight-minute YouTube video titled “Van Life: Beginning our Van Life Journey” features happy and romantic scenes from the couple’s trip.Petito is white, 5-foot-5 (1.6 meters) and about 110 pounds (50 kilograms), with blonde hair and blue eyes, police said. She has several tattoos including one on a forearm that reads, “let it be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gabby-petito-s-disappearance-grips-us-search-intensifies-101631832983878.html

After his one year in office, party members are keen for a fresh face the carry them to victory in general elections expected within two months.The popular Kono, whose resume is studded with jobs including the foreign and defence portfolios, faces off against former foreign minister Fumio Kishida https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-vaccines-minister-kono-favoured-next-pm-opinion-polls-2021-09-13, Sanae Takaichi, who held the internal affairs ministry post, and Seiko Noda, a former minister for gender equality.Unlike in last year's race, grassroots LDP members will join lawmakers in casting ballots.The media-savvy, US-educated Kono, at 58 on the younger side for a Japanese premier, is widely seen as the frontrunner due to his popularity with the public, who regularly choose him as their favourite for prime minister. Investors have also recently warmed to Kono at Kishida's expense.His chances were bolstered this week when LDP heavyweight Shigeru Ishiba, who is popular with the party rank and file and had been considering his own candidacy, threw his support behind Kono.But Kono has a reputation as a maverick, and elders in the faction-ridden LDP may favour the soft-spoken Kishida, 64, who hails from one of the party's move dovish factions, due to perceptions he may be better than Kono at building consensus.Takaichi, 60, who is aiming to become Japan's first female premier, is a disciple of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, and a member of the LDP's most conservative wing.Noda, 60, who joined the race on Thursday after winning the support of the required 20 lawmakers to throw her hat in the ring, is seen as a long shot. But she but could have an outsized impact on the race by making it harder for one candidate to win a majority in the first round.On economic policy, where Japan is struggling to recover from successive waves of the coronavirus, Kono wants any further stimulus to prioritise renewable energy and expansion of 5G networks, while Kishida says Japan should strive for a new form of capitalism to reduce income disparity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taro-kono-seen-as-top-contender-as-japan-pm-race-set-to-begin-101631832448761.html
