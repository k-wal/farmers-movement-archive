Dr Fauci answers||Amid reports that complications could make the US government miss the September 20 date to start delivering Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, White House chief medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said that he believes the delivery can start for American citizens who were inoculated with Pfizer jabs, while those who were administered Moderna doses may need to wait for a couple more weeks.Speaking at CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, the US government’s top infectious disease expert said that it is still the President Joe Biden administration’s plan “in some respects” to commence the third doses the week of September 20, pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The administration hoped to start rolling out both the Pfizer and Moderna booster shots from the stipulated date, but Dr Fauci stated that it’s “conceivable” that for Moderna’s jabs, there might be “at most a couple of weeks, a few weeks delay, if any” – while the firm gives additional data to the FDA on the booster’s efficacy.Also Read | 3 Covid-19 vaccine doses may now become routine, enhance immunity: FauciIn a recent report by the Associated Press, one official said that Moderna produced inadequate data for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to give a go-ahead to the third dose of its coronavirus vaccine. Meanwhile, the FDA’s request for additional data from Moderna can delay the delivery of its booster jabs to October.Pfizer, however, is further along in the review process, with an FDA panel review on its booster jabs scheduled on September 17.Notably, Biden announced last month that his administration was preparing to inoculate boosters to provide better protection against coronavirus, pending approval from the CDC and the FDA. He added that Americans should consider getting themselves jabbed eight months after their second shot.On the matter of the delay in meeting the September 20 deadline, Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Kalin said on Sunday that no US citizen will get boosters “until the FDA says they’re approved,” adding that the administration will be ready to go once the “science says go.”(With inputs from AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-moderna-miss-sept-20-target-of-us-covid-booster-jabs-dr-fauci-answers-101630863974439.html

Dear scholars, if this situation continues, the country will turn into an ethnicity-based and region-based conflict," said Abdul Qader Qanet, a religious scholar."You negotiated with the US behind closed doors for two years.

"We call our brothers in arms to join the people."As the defence ministry said security forces loyal to Conde had repulsed the attack and were restoring order, people emerged onto the streets during the afternoon to celebrate the uprising's apparent success.A Reuters witness saw pick-up trucks and military vehicles accompanied by motorcyclists and cheering onlookers. "Guinea is free! Bravo," a woman shouted from her balcony.The Guinean government has drastically increased and multiplied taxes in recent weeks to replenish state coffers. The price of fuel has increased by 20%, causing frustration among many Guineans.Videos shared on social media had earlier shown military vehicles patrolling Conakry's streets and one military source said the only bridge connecting the mainland to the Kaloum neighbourhood, where the palace and most government ministries are located, had been sealed off.Guinea has seen sustained economic growth during Conde's decade in power thanks to its bauxite, iron ore, gold and diamond wealth, but few of its citizens have seen the benefits.Critics say the government has used restrictive criminal laws to discourage dissent, while ethnic divisions and endemic graft have sharpened political rivalries."While the president was proclaiming everywhere that he wanted to govern differently by annihilating corruption, the embezzlement of public funds increased. The new rich were taunting us," Alassane Diallo, a resident of Conakry, told Reuters."It is all this that made it easier for the military." (Reporting by Saliou Samb and Bate Felix; Writing by Hereward Holland and John Stonestreet; Editing by Frances Kerry and John Stonestreet)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soldiers-stage-uprising-in-guinea-claim-they-ve-taken-over-government-101630860442090.html

"The NRF in principle agree to solve the current problems and put an immediate end to the fighting and continue negotiations. To reach a lasting peace, the NRF is ready to stop fighting on condition that Taliban also stop their attacks and military movements on Panjshir and Andarab," Massoud said in a Facebook post.Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said on Twitter the police headquarters and district centre of Rukhah, adjacent to the provincial capital Bazarak, had fallen, and opposition forces had suffered numerous casualties, with large numbers of prisoners and captured vehicles, weapons and ammunition.Amrullah Saleh asks UN to step in, prevent Taliban onslaught in PanjshirA number of religious scholars at a gathering in Kabul on Sunday asked the Taliban and the Resistance Front to halt the current conflict, calling it an illegitimate war in the country, Tolo News reported. The struggle over Panjshir has escalated in the last few days as the Taliban are all set to announce their government in teh country. Former Afghanistan vice president Amrullah Saleh on Sunday wrote a letter to the United Nations highlighting the large-scale humanitarian crisis in Panjshir province. The Taliban, he alleged, blocked all humanitarian services in the valley, snapped telecommunication. "if no attention is paid to this situation, a full-scale human rights and humanitarian catastrophe including starvation and mass killing, even genocide of these people are in the making," Saleh wrote.Taliban infighting over Panjshir?Amid reports of Mullah Baradar and the Haqqani network not agreeing on several issues, some reports claimed that one of the issues of disagreement is the Panjshir situation.

05-09-2021||World||Mullah Baradar, Haqqani fought over disagreement on Panjshir situation: Report||Gunfire heard in Kabul on Friday night was actually a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders - group co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Afghan Taliban leader, Anas Haqqani, according to some accounts.The incident took place over an alleged disagreement among the Taliban leaders on how to resolve the Panjshir situation. The National Resistance Front (NRF) of Afghanistan has been putting up a stiff fight against the Taliban who wants to take control over the last bastion in the country, which is now under its rule.The information about Friday's reported gunfight was shared through the unverified Twitter handle of Panjshir Observer, which describes itself as an independent news outlet covering Afghanistan and Panjshir."Gunfire last night in Kabul was a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders. Forces loyal to Anas Haqqani and Mullah Baradar fought over a disagreement on how to resolve the #Panjshir situation. Mullah Baradar was reportedly injured and is receiving treatment in Pakistan," tweeted Panjshir Observer on Saturday.As per another unverified Twitter handle of Northern Alliance, Mullah Baradar urged his Taliban forces not to fight the Panjshir resistance forces."Baradar urged his Taliban not to fight the Panjshirs and recalled them to Kabul, Mullah Baradar himself was badly wounded he was taken to Pakistan for treatment. The media that covered that Panjshir fell, shame on you and you have no honour!" tweeted Northern Alliance.The account also lambasted other media platforms for promoting Taliban propaganda related to Panjshir."I wish you a good night! We have successfully defended more than 1200 Taliban casualties. Due to the fact, there was a conflict between Anas Haqqani and Mullah Baradar and there was a shootout between Taliban leaders in Kabul, the Taliban propaganda deceived everyone so that the media attention was on the Panjshir and did not cover the shootout of Taliban leaders. Now the spirit of the Taliban is suppressed in the Panjshir, their leaders are fighting among themselves for power," tweeted Northern Alliance.Panjshir is the stronghold of the National Resistance Front, led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of late ex-Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, and ex-Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who had declared himself caretaker president.The Taliban, which captured Kabul on August 15, has been delaying the announcement of the government formation in Afghanistan over the past few days.While the group has not issued a statement over it yet, reports have emerged claiming that the government formation has been delayed due to differences between the Taliban and the Haqqani network over power-sharing.Baradar, the top Taliban leader who is set to head the new Afghan regime was injured during the clash and is currently getting treated in Pakistan, according to reports.The gunfight on Friday signals a rift in the Taliban. Earlier, Haibatullah Akhundzada was signalled to be the Islamic Emirate's supreme leader based in Kandahar, but the Haqqani and many other Taliban factions simply do not accept him as their leader.Moreover, Pakistan intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed arrived in Kabul on Saturday leading a delegation of Pakistani officials. Hameed's emergency visit affirms that the Taliban are merely an ISI puppet.Pakistan and its notorious intelligence agency have been accused of supporting the Taliban in taking over Afghanistan.Experts believe that Pakistan has been a key player in removing the elected Afghan government from power and establishing the Taliban as a decisive power in Afghanistan. Recently, a UN Monitoring report has said that a significant part of the leadership of Al-Qaida resides in Afghanistan and Pakistan border region.Former Afghan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh has asserted that the Taliban are being micromanaged by Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency--the ISI, adding that Islamabad is in charge of the war-ravaged country effectively as a colonial power.

The Green Visa holders can sponsor their parents and children up to the age of 25 on their permits. The steps are being taken to attract talent and boost growth.The UAE government will allow people who lost their jobs to remain in the UAE for up to 6 months which is an incentive as most visas are tied to employment contacts. It has allowed hiring of temporary workers above the age of 15 in a bid to loosen the job market.Foreign residents form 80% of the population of the UAE and are intrinsic to the economy of the country for the past few decades. Foreign nationals work in the private sector and contribute to the economy by buying property or by shopping in some of the largest malls in the world.These oil-rich countries have resisted offering permanent residency to foreigners. These governments also did not offer citizenship to millions of foreign workers in order to safeguard generous privileges enjoyed by the citizens of this country.The gulf-economies started preparing for a post-fossil fuel world following the 2014 oil-price slump by enticing wealthy people to stay. This trend was reinforced during the Covid-19 pandemic as the government took steps to ensure people who lost their jobs could remain.

Before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, a Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, which created distress among the Uyghurs in Afghanistan, news agency ANI reported citing a report by CNN. In that meeting, Wang Yi had urged the Taliban to crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group that is believed to be fuelling unrest in China’s Xinjiang province while operating from Afghanistan.The Uyghur community feels that the Taliban could send members of the community to China in a bid to curry favour with Beijing. The news agency in its report cited that Uyghurs who escaped persecution in China and entered Afghanistan 45 years ago are now worried about getting deported to China.Many Uyghurs hold Afghan citizenship but despite that their identification cards still identify them as Chinese refugees including those who are second-generation Uyghurs living in Afghanistan, according to the report by news agency CNN.The US and several other nations continue to raise a concern about the persecution of Uyghurs in China in Xinjiang province. Human rights experts believe that 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities were passed through a network of detention centres across the region. The detainees who went to the centres claim that they were subjected to political indoctrination, forced labour, torture and sexual abuse.Uyghur refugees say that no countries are ready to take them as issuing of passports have also been halted. “They don't give passports for free, and we can't afford it. But now they have stopped issuing the passports anyway,” a member of the community told CNN.Uyghurs are also considered outsiders in Afghanistan and have not found any takers to help them out of this situation.China denies allegations of human rights violation and genocide against Uyghurs. It says that members of the Uyghur community are sent to ‘vocational training centres’ in an attempt to stop them from being radicalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warming-relations-between-china-taliban-sparks-fear-among-uyghurs-report-101630857728675.html

This image is viral||A purported photo of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's Pakistani passport has resurfaced on social media at a time the Taliban were about to announce their new government under the possible leadership of Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar. Hindustan Times did not authenticate the image going viral on social media. However, there are old reports claiming that Mullah Baradar indeed is the owner of the Pakistani passport.An old report of Afghanistan's Khama Press claimed that not only a passport, but Mullah Baradar also holds Pakistan's National identity card. A former official of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security reportedly confirmed that Pakistan had issued these documents to Mullah Baradar under the fake name of Muhammad Arif Agha. The documents were reportedly issued to Mullah Baradar in Karachi city of Pakistan on 7th of July 2014, the report said. No comments.

Earlier, the Taliban ordered that women will be allowed access to higher education, but there will be no provision of co-education and male teachers will not be allowed to teach female students. In the recent order, it has been mentioned that old men of good character can teach female students if there are not enough female teachers in universities.The new order does not have any mention of burqa which covers the entire body, but the niqab effectively covers most of the face, AFP reported adding that burqas and niqabs are making a comeback in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover."Universities are required to recruit female teachers for female students based on their facilities," the decree said, adding that men and women should use separate entrances and exits.The new diktat has also said that women will have to end their lesson five minutes earlier than men so that there is no scope of mingling after the class.The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan put Afghanistan women in uncertainty as women saw dark days in the former regime of the Taliban between 1996 and 2000. The Taliban have promised an accommodative stance for women and said that women will have their rights under the Taliban rule as permitted by Sharia law.However, there is likely to be no participation of women in the government that the Taliban are yet to announce. For the past few days, women are protesting in Herat and Kabul demanding inclusion in the government. In such a protest in Kabul on Saturday, the Taliban sprayed tear gas to stop the protesters from marching towards the President's Palace. Many women, including artistes, journalists have left the country fearing persecution by the Taliban.  Earlier, the Taliban leadership appealed to the women to stay at home as the Taliban fighters in control of the security of Afghanistan were not trained to respect women, Taliban spokesperson had said.

Smart/business shoes are expected to be worn. Casual shoes and trainers are not appropriate,” it said, adding that men are “encouraged to wear a tie” and jackets “must be worn.”The updated norms further stated that it is “privilege” to serve as an MP and the “dress, language and conduct should reflect this.”Apart from tightening the dress code, Hoyle has also clamped down on rowdiness in the House of Commons. According to the new rules, MPs cannot sing and chant – which are both banned in the chamber. The parliamentarians cannot clap as well as the rules state that it “eats into the time available for debate.”Furthermore, the MPs have also been told to pay attention during a debate and not read books or newspapers or “obviously devote…to…phone or other electronic device.”In December last year, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was called out during a virtual Brexit discussion of the House of Commons by Hoyle for not adhering to the dress code. Hunt was reportedly not wearing a tie and his top shirt button was also undone.Hoyle’s views on the strict dress code are in contrast with his predecessor John Bercow’s last set of norms wherein business clothing was merely a recommendation. Bercow had also said that there was “no exact dress code.”(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-jeans-sleeveless-tops-new-dress-code-for-mps-ahead-of-uk-house-of-commons-101630850521567.html

It was not possible to confirm the report, which was echoed on other Taliban Twitter accounts.Earlier on Sunday Fahim Dashti, spokesman for the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), which groups opposition forces, said the Taliban "propaganda machine" was trying to spread distracting messages."The resistance forces are ready to continue their defence against any form of aggression," he said.On Saturday, Italian aid group Emergency said Taliban fighters had reached the trauma hospital it operates in Anabah district, within the Panjshir valley.Taliban officials have said previously their forces had secured full control of Panjshir but fighting has been continuing for days, with each side saying it had inflicted large numbers of casualties.Ahmad Massoud, leader of the NRFA, has pledged to continue resisting the offensive and has called for international support.Panjshir, a rugged mountainous valley north of Kabul still littered with the wreckage of destroyed Soviet tanks, has proved very difficult to overcome in the past. Under Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, it resisted both the invading Soviet army and the previous Taliban government.On Sunday, Massoud said hundreds of Taliban fighters had surrendered to NRFA forces, which included remnants of regular Afghan army and special forces units as well as local militia fighters. It was not possible to confirm that independently.The Panjshir fighting has been the most prominent example of resistance to the Taliban, whose forces swept into Kabul on Aug. 15 as the Western-backed government collapsed and President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.But small individual protests for women's rights or in defence of the green, red and black tricolour flag of Afghanistan have also been held in different cities.Massoud originally called for a negotiated settlement with the Taliban and several attempts at talks were held but they eventually broke down, with each side blaming the other for their failure. (Writing by James Mackenzie; editing by Philippa Fletcher)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-entered-capital-of-resistance-holdout-panjshir-report-101630850000022.html

Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin has said that the visit, which was an 'emergency' trip to discuss the evolving situation in Afghanistan proves that the Taliban are merely an ISI puppet. Coinciding the visit, the Taliban delayed the announcement of their government. It is believed that ISI chief Faiz Hameed rushed to Kabul to broker peace between Mullah Baradar and the Haqqani network. The photo of Faiz Hameed after reaching Kabul and his interaction with media have been shared on social media indicating that it was no secret visit."According to Afghan sources, Hameed rushed to Kabul after a clash between Baradar and Haqqani-supported groups in which Baradar sustained injuries. The Haqqani and many other Taliban factions simply do not accept Haibatullah as their leader," Michael Rubin said."The visits of the director-general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are usually kept under wraps but it wasn’t the case with his trip to Kabul," Pakistan's Tribune reported.Who is ISI chief Faiz Hameed?Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed is a three-star ranking general in the Pakistan Army. In 2019, he was appointed as the director-general of Inter-Services Intelligence. Before Faiz Hameed, Lieutenant General Asim Muneer was the ISI chief. His appointment grabbed attention as Muneer was replaced within eight months.Faiz Hameed is from the Baloch Regiment and before becoming the ISI chief was in charge of the internal security wing at the ISI.Faiz Hameed was reportedly accused by former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif of forcing politicians to join Imran Khan's PTI before Pakistan's general elections in 2018.Reports said the ISI chief met top Afghan leaders and also some foreign envoys in Kabul. He is meeting and working with Pakistan's ambassador Mansoor Ahmed Khan and his team on issues of repatriation and transit through Pakistan and the border situation, Geo News reported.ISI chief to mediate?Reports claimed that the visit is to mediate among various factions of the Taliban as they are not being able to come to a consensus. "We understand from Taliban sources that he is here to mediate the Taliban. They have not yet managed to form a government. We understand that's because of all the different factions from different parts of the country. They can't agree. And he is here to try and sort it out between them. In the end, they are politicians like anywhere in the world.

05-09-2021||World||Two Indian-origin people die in flash floods in US: Report||At least two people of Indian-origin died during flash floods triggered by Hurricane Ida in New Jersey, news agency PTI reported quoting local news agencies. Hurricane Ida, according to weather experts, was the second-most destructive hurricane to hit New Jersey after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Hurricane Ida transformed into a post-tropical cyclone on September 1. It caused the deaths of 65 people in the US with most deaths reported from New Jersey, New York and Louisiana, after making a landfall in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on August 29.Malathi Kanche, 46, a software designer and Danush Reddy, 31, were swept away by flash floods caused by Hurricane Ida. Kanche was with her 15-year-old daughter on Wednesday when her vehicle halted in waist-deep flood water near Bridgewater in New Jersey, news agency PTI reported citing a report by the New York Times. She and her daughter held onto a tree as floodwaters pulled them but the tree fell, pulling Kanche in the torrent, their family friend Mansi Mago told the news agency. Kanche was earlier put on the list of ‘missing persons’ and the police confirmed her death on Friday.Reddy was stranded in the flood in South Plainfield, New Jersey and fell near a 36-inch-wide sewer pipe after losing his balance. Officials said Reddy’s body was pulled into the drain pipe and was later found miles away.Hurricane Ida caused damage to civic infrastructure as it caused flash floods in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Louisiana. Official figures say that Ida caused damages worth $50 billion dollars. Experts say that such severe floods, like the one caused after Hurricane Ida, which are caused once in a century, could become an annual occurrence if steps are not taken to address global warming and other effects of climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-origin-people-die-in-flash-floods-in-us-report-101630839852433.html

With the battle for Panjshir going on, reports of Taliban-Haqqani power tussle has also surfaced, indicating that the Taliban's rise to power will not be as smooth as it was thought seeing its lightning advances in Afghanistan. Also Read | 'Destroyed photos of my wife, daughters': Amrullah Saleh recounts how he left KabulReports said about 600 Taliban have been killed in Panjshir while more than 1,000 Taliban have been captured. This comes after the Taliban claimed victory over Panjshir amid reports of massive bloodbath in the valley. A Taliban source said fighting was continuing in Panjshir but the advance had been slowed by landmines placed on the road to the capital Bazarak and the provincial governor's compound, reported Al Jazeera."I think there's at least a very good probability of a broader civil war," said Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in his assessment.The Panjshir leaders have been reaching out to the international bodies highlighting the humanitarian crisis created by the Taliban.Mark Milley also commented on theUS's exit and the unexpected fall of the Afghan army and he said that the collapse of the Afghan army happened at a much faster rate than was expected by anybody."The collapse of the Afghan army happened at a much faster rate and [was] very unexpected by pretty much everybody," General Mark Milley told Fox in an interview.

He said body parts were found at a distance from the security post after the bombing.Akram said some of the wounded were in critical condition and the death toll could rise.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the morning attack but Baluch separatist groups have claimed similar assaults on security forces. The banned Baluch Liberation Army and Baluch Liberation Front have been engaged in a low-level insurgency for nearly two decades calling for independence for the gas and mineral rich province. Islamic militants also have a presence in the region.Baluchistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is a key province in southwest Pakistan, where China has been working on projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The projects, including road construction, power plants and agricultural development, have cost billions of dollars.China has in recent years also played a key role in developing the deep-water port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. But there have been attacks on Pakistanis and Chinese working on the economic corridor projects.A suicide bomber last month detonated his explosives near a vehicle carrying Chinese workers, killing two Pakistani children playing by the roadside and wounding a Chinese national and two other Pakistanis in the port city of Gwadar.Suspected separatists also last month hurled a hand grenade at a store selling national flags in Quetta, killing one man and wounding four others who were buying flags to celebrate Pakistan's Independence Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-killed-in-suicide-bombing-near-pakistan-s-quetta-police-101630825914322.html
05-09-2021||World||Canada: Facing sexual harassment charges, Liberal Party candidate withdraws||After facing allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staffers, an Indo-Canadian MP from the ruling Liberal Party has withdrawn from the Federal elections scheduled for September 20.Raj Saini, the incumbent member of the House of Commons from Kitchener Centre, made the announcement in a statement released on Saturday just a day after he was defended by Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Since nominations for the elections closed last Monday, Saini’s exit will leave the party without a candidate in the riding, as constituencies are called in Canada. The ruling party is already trailing the principal opposition Conservatives in voter preference across a range of fresh surveys. That agency, along with others, places the Conservatives at least 2% ahead in national vote share.In fact, according to the poll tracker 338 Canada, the Conservatives led by Erin O’Toole are now in a position to garner the highest number of seats, at 143, with the Liberals at 132 in the 338-seat House of Commons. Referring to the stories of alleged harassment and inappropriate acts, first broken by the outlet CBC News, Saini said, “The statements are unequivocally false. I have never acted inappropriately towards staff, volunteers or constituents.”He said he was “very proud” of his work for the riding, but “continuing my campaign no longer serves the best interests of my family, staff members, campaign team, and constituents”.Trudeau had earlier said a rigorous process had been followed with regard to the allegations against Saini, before he was cleared to contest the 2021 elections. Saini represented the riding since 2015.Saini, who has roots in Himachal Pradesh, added, “For everyone’s health and safety, I have taken the painful decision to end my campaign for the 44th Parliament.”However, he also said he is contemplating further action in this regard, saying, “I will be focusing all my attention and efforts to challenge these defamatory false accusations and am in the process of consulting legal counsel to review all options.”On Saturday, the ruling party also said it was removing Saini as a candidate as a review process was initiated on Friday “after new information was directly provided to the Liberal Party of Canada. Mr Saini will no longer be a Liberal candidate”.According to a report from the outlet CBC News, multiple sources “described four different cases where Saini allegedly made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate comments.” Saini denied the accusations to CBC.It also reported that a former staffer filed a complaint related to alleged “unwelcome advances and harassing behaviour” with the Canadian Human Rights Commission last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-facing-sexual-harassment-charges-liberal-party-candidate-withdraws-101630818635514.html
05-09-2021||World||Haqqani and Baradar fight it out for power in Kabul||There is confusion over government formation in Kabul with Haqqani Network leadership at odds with Mullah Baradar over the formation of an inclusive transitional government as committed to the international community during the Doha peace talks.While Baradar wants elements from the minority communities to be included in the government, the Haqqani’s lead by Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin and his terrorist brood do not want to share power with anyone. With the tacit backing of mentor and promoter Pakistan, the Haqqanis are in favour of a pure Taliban government based on medieval theocracy. “The HQN has told Baradar to back off as they won Kabul and have dominant control of the Afghan capital. Mullah Yaqoob is still in Kandahar and there is utter confusion over government formation with ultra-conservative traditional Taliban elements who do not want to give up filial ties with Al Qaeda coming to the fore,” said a Kabul watcher.Also read | The inside story of the ISI-Taliban nexusThe chief promoter of Taliban, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, Director General of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), is still in Kabul trying to broker a settlement between the warring factions in favour of the Haqqani Network. The ISI has used Haqqani Network to target Indian Embassy in Kabul in the past and for steering the Sunni Pashtun force in a direction aligned to Pakistan. Another reason for Gen Hameed to be in Kabul is to monitor the Taliban operations against the Resistance Force led by Commander Amrullah Saleh in Panjshir Valley. Unconfirmed reports indicate the induction of Pakistani Army regulars in mufti for the anti-resistance operations in the Panjshir Valley. With China and Russia with the Taliban, the Panjshir resistance is fighting an uphill battle without international support as all the bordering Central Asian Republics are suing for peace with the Sunni Islamist as directed by Moscow. While the European Union is most unhappy with the turn of events and in Pakistan, the 27 member union has no stomach for a fight, while the UK is riding on Islamabad for engaging the Taliban. And the US has no play in the stabilisation of Afghanistan except that it wants the Doha process to be honoured as brokered by their much-discredited envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.Also read | Why is ISI chief in Kabul? Afghan politician says 'to stop Mullah Baradar'Clearly, the tussle for power in Kabul will yield towards the gun as the HQN leadership has told the Doha interlocutors that they won Kabul through force and are not really interested in any legitimacy from the international community with China on its side. An HQN controlled Taliban government in Kabul also suits the Pakistan Army as it will not only give Rawalpindi strategic depth against India but also strong leverage with the tired international community.

05-09-2021||World||New Zealand tried to deport attacker for years after he arrived as refugee||New Zealand had tried for years to deport the knife-wielding militant who wounded seven people at a mall in Auckland last week, the government said after it released more details on the attacker following the lifting of a court suppression order.Court documents made public on Sunday identified the attacker as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, an ethnic Tamil Muslim from Sri Lanka. He had arrived in New Zealand 10 years ago on a student visa seeking refugee status, which was granted in 2013.Police were following Samsudeen and shot him dead about a minute after he launched his attack on Friday after picking up a knife from a supermarket display. He had been convicted and imprisoned for about three years before being released in July.Samsudeen's family issued a statement to the New Zealand media describing their shock at the "terrible event".Samsudeen was inspired by the Islamic State militant group and was being monitored constantly but he could not be kept in prison by law any longer, the government has said.He came to the attention of the police and security services in 2016 after he expressed sympathy on Facebook for militant attacks, violent war-related videos and comments advocating violent extremism.It was subsequently discovered that his refugee status was fraudulently obtained and the government moved to cancel his visa and issued deportation notices.But Samsudeen appealed against the deportation, and since he was in prison, his appeal could not proceed until his criminal trial ended in May this year.The attack has led to questions about a loophole in counter-terrorism laws that allowed Samsudeen to remain free despite authorities being aware of the threat he posed.The government has promised to tighten the law, in particular to criminalise planning a militant attack."We will continue to review our immigration laws alongside the terrorist suppression law and I'm sure if there are ways we can improve it, we will," Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told a news conference.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on Saturday that unsuccessful attempts to deport Samsudeen was a "frustrating process" for the government.Of the seven people wounded in the attack three are in critical condition. One person has been released from hospital.Samsudeen's family said in the statement they were heartbroken."We hope to find out with you all, what happened in Aathil's case and what we all could have done to prevent this," the family said in the statement, released by his brother Aroos.The family said Samsudeen was suffering from some mental health problems and his condition got worse over the past 10 years as he spent more time in prison and dealing with court cases."He wanted to share the sufferings and injustices. He saw himself as someone fighting those injustices," the family said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-tried-to-deport-attacker-for-years-after-he-arrived-as-refugee-101630810469324.html

Ebonies and rosewoods threatened by logging were among trees put on the list for the first time this year.The IUCN also expressed concern for sharks and rays, which are faring less well than tuna as 37% of sharks and rays now face extinction compared with 33% of amphibians, 26% of mammals and 12% of birds.But the Red List also highlights the potential for restoration, with four commercially-fished tuna species pulling back from a slide towards extinction after a decade of efforts to curb overexploitation. The Atlantic bluefin tuna leapt from “endangered” across three categories to the safe zone of “least concern” from 2011.The IUCN Red List Unit reassesses hundreds of species each year. Of the 138,374 species the group tracks, more than 38,000 are threatened with extinction. Efforts to halt extensive declines in numbers and diversity of animals and plants have largely failed.In 2019 the UN’s biodiversity experts warned that a million species are on the brink of extinction - raising the spectre that the planet is on the verge of its sixth mass extinction event in 500 million years.“The red list status shows that we’re on the cusp of the sixth extinction event,” the IUCN’s Head of Red List Unit Craig Hilton-Taylor told AFP.“If the trends carry on going upward at that rate, we’ll be facing a major crisis soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-of-138-000-assessed-species-now-face-extinction-conservation-body-101630787097827.html
05-09-2021||World||New Zealand reports first Covid death in over 6 months||New Zealand reported its first coronavirus death in more than six months on Saturday, while the number of new cases continued to trend downward. Health authorities said the woman who died was in her 90s and had underlying health problems.Authorities reported 20 new community cases, all in the largest city of Auckland.New Zealand remains in lockdown as it tries to eliminate an outbreak of the Delta variant that began last month. The country has reported just 27 coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began. In Australia, the most populous state of New South Wales reported a record 1,533 new daily coronavirus cases.S Korea reports Mu casesThree cases of the Mu variant were identified in South Korea from those who visited Mexico, the US and Colombia, according to a statement from Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency. Authorities will strengthen monitoring of the variant, it said.Children were much more likely to be hospitalised as the Delta variant became widespread, two studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Friday found. But children did not appear to contract more serious illness. The share of hospitalised young people who had indications of more serious illness remained similar to earlier in the year and in 2020, the studies found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-reports-first-covid-death-in-over-6-months-101630786814344.html
05-09-2021||World||Taliban forces use tear gas, gunfire to end women’s rally||Taliban special forces in camouflage fired their weapons into the air on Saturday, bringing an abrupt and frightening end to the latest protest march in the capital by Afghan women demanding equal rights.The women’s march - the second in as many days in Kabul - began peacefully. Demonstrators laid a wreath outside Afghanistan’s defence ministry to honour Afghan soldiers who died fighting the Taliban. “We are here to gain human rights in Afghanistan,” said 20-year-old protester Maryam Naiby.As the protesters’ shouts grew louder, several Taliban officials waded into the crowd to ask what they wanted to say.Flanked by fellow demonstrators, Sudaba Kabiri, a 24-year-old university student, told the Taliban interlocutor that Islam’s Prophet gave women rights and they wanted theirs. The Taliban official promised women would be given their rights. But as the demonstrators reached the presidential palace, a dozen Taliban special forces ran into the crowd, firing in the air and sending demonstrators fleeing.Footage showed women confronted by armed militants covering their mouths and coughing, and one demonstrator said the fighters had used tear gas and tasers against the participants. “They also hit women on the head with a gun magazine, and the women became bloody,” said a demonstrator.Google locks Afghan govt’s email accountsGoogle has temporarily locked down an unspecified number of Afghan government email accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter, as fears grow over the digital paper trail left by former officials and their international partners.One former government employee said the Taliban are seeking to acquire former officials’ emails. The employee said that the Taliban has asked him to preserve the data held on the servers of the ministry he used to work for.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-forces-use-tear-gas-gunfire-to-end-women-s-rally-101630786035414.html
05-09-2021||World||Battle for last Afghan stronghold still on||Taliban and opposition forces were fighting on Saturday for control of the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, the last province in Afghanistan holding out against the hardline Islamist group, according to reports.Taliban sources said on Friday the group’s fighters had taken the valley, although the opposition denied it had fallen.The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, which groups opposition forces loyal to local leader Ahmad Massoud, said Taliban forces reached the Darband heights on the border between Kapisa province and Panjshir but were pushed back.“The defence of the stronghold of Afghanistan is unbreakable,” Front spokesman Fahim Dashty said in a tweet.In a Facebook post, Massoud insisted his forces would resist and said Panjshir “continues to stand strongly in the fight”.A Taliban source said fighting was continuing in Panjshir but the advance was slowed by landmines placed on the road to the capital Bazarak and the provincial governor’s compound.Unconfirmed reports in the local media said that at least 17 people were killed and 41 injured in the celebratory gunfire all over Kabul on Friday as news spread of the Taliban’s takeover of Panjshir. The Emergency Hospital in Kabul said two people were killed and 20 wounded by the salvos.Pak spy chief in KabulPakistan’s spy chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed flew into Kabul on Saturday, sources in both capitals said.It was not clear what his agenda was, but a senior official in Pakistan had said earlier in the week that Hameed, who heads the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, could help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military.Washington has accused Pakistan and the ISI of backing the Taliban in the group’s two-decade fight against the US-backed government in Kabul. Islamabad has denied the charges.New government to be announced next weekThe Taliban source also said the announcement of a new government would be pushed back to the next week.Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, reported by some Taliban sources to be in line to lead the new government, said in remarks on Qatar’s Al Jazeera channel that the new administration “will include all factions of the Afghan people”.Meanwhile, Qatar’s ambassador to Afghanistan said a technical team was able to reopen Kabul airport to receive aid, according to Al Jazeera news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battle-for-last-afghan-stronghold-still-on-101630785706517.html
05-09-2021||World||Surplus Covid-19 vaccines with rich nations to hit 1.2 billion doses||Western countries and Japan together have roughly 500 million doses of coronavirus vaccines that can be immediately redistributed to poorer nations and, by the end of 2021, this surplus stock will balloon to 1.2 billion, according to a new analysis of global vaccine utilisation and supply set to be released next week.The assessment, by science analytics company Airfinity, quantifies for the first time the stocks – available today and expected supply – that can be shared by high income countries without jeopardising their own vaccination campaigns.These doses can greatly address a huge inequity in supply: University of Oxford’s Our World in Data estimates that as on September 2, a mere 1.8% of the population in low-income countries received at least one dose. In high-income countries, this proportion is 64%.The new findings on surpluses are based on the analysis of supplies to the US, the UK, the European Union, Canada and Japan and their vaccination rates, and assume that these countries will keep giving doses to eligible populations (in most cases, everyone above the age of 12) with booster shots six months later.“The world has reached a tipping point when it comes to vaccine availability and production. For large Western countries, the challenge is no longer supply, but demand. The global supply chain is successfully increasing production and our detailed forecast shows that high income countries can have confidence that there is plenty of vaccine coming and this should reduce the need for stockpiling,” said Airfinity’s co-founder and CEO Rasmus Bech Hansen in an email to HT.“How these stocks are distributed, where they go and whether they are resold or donated is ultimately a political decision. With these numbers, I believe the world has a better basis for making these critical allocation decisions and avoid wasted doses,” Hansen added.In addition to worsening socioeconomic inequality between the Global North and South, this disparity threatens to drag on the pandemic. Experts see continued risk of the Sars-CoV-2 mutating if it keeps spreading in vulnerable populations.In terms of supplies, the report notes that production has scaled up rapidly. “Manufactures are currently producing 1.5 billion doses per month, and this is expected to continue growing,” the company said in its assessment.If the doses of World Health Organization-approved vaccines produced in China are considered, the number available for donation rises to 1.6 billion by the end of this year. To put this into perspective, these many doses are enough to fully vaccinate over 70% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa, where, at present, less than 3% of the people have been immunised. This region has till now received only 60 million doses, according to Unicef’s Covid-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard’s latest update on August 20.To be sure, the surpluses in the Airfinity report include some doses already pledged.For instance, G7 countries and EU have pledged 1 billion doses for donation by June 2022. Of this, Airfinity’s assessment found 13% has been delivered.The report estimates that 11.3 billion doses are required to vaccinate the world’s population and forecasts output to reach that by the end of this year itself. Last month, the total number of Covid-19 vaccines produced in the world surpassed 6 billion.Airfinity added that the report has been endorsed by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), a Geneva-headquartered trade association that represents pharmaceutical firms around the world.The forecast adds that redistribution plans need to take into account logistical challenges since most of the surplus doses — 69% — will be mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. Both need to be kept frozen.“Forecasted supply is calculated from purchased doses only and excludes any call option (i.e. the option to expand the deal),” the report says, and adds that it assumes no vaccine facility pauses production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surplus-covid-19-vaccines-with-rich-nations-to-hit-1-2-billion-doses-101630784951884.html
