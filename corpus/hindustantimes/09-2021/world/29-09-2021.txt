I’m happy to look at a trillion-dollar target for the next 10 years between the US and India. I’m happy to engage with the US, and look for expanding our economic partnership.”India-US trade is up against another ambitious target, one that was fixed by President Joe Bidden when he was vice-president in the administration of President Barack Obama. In a speech at the Bombay Stock Exchange during his 2012 India visit, Biden had suggested a “five-fold” increase in the volume of the bilateral trade, which had then stood at $100 billion.Piyush Goyal on Wednesday also expressed frustration with the failure of the two countries to conclude a trade agreement after numerous rounds of discussions most of which happened on his watch, specially over 2019 and 2020. “We had actually concluded discussions maybe three or four times, but would always get stuck somewhere in the red tape and for a change,” the minister said, adding, “India was not responsible.”India and the United States were expected to sign an interim trade agreement - leaving a comprehensive trade agreement for a later date - during former President Donald Trump’s visit to India in February 2020. But the two sides failed to conclude talks in time for the visit and vowed to come up with something later in the year, which never happened as the US went into elections and Trump lost.Piyush Goyal had said at the time a deal was just a few “phone calls away” to reflect how close the two sides were to an agreement. Indians have blamed the US side for failure by the two sides to get a deal saying American negotiators kept changing the goalpost constantly, making fresh and additional demands.Trade talks have remained stalled since then. Goyal and his US counterpart Katherine Tai have spoken but there have been no discussions about a trade agreement.The two sides decided to start talking during the first bilateral summit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden here in Washington DC last week. “They looked forward to reconvening the India-US Trade Policy Forum before the end of 2021, to enhance the bilateral trade relationship by addressing trade concerns, identifying specific areas for increased engagement and developing an ambitious, shared vision for the future of the trade relationship,” said the joint statement issued by the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/piyush-goyal-moots-1-trillion-target-for-india-us-trade-101632939203121.html

Here we have everything detailed, even if the victim, who was unconscious during the rapes, doesn't remember anything," said police commissioner Jeremie Bosse Platiere."It's also unusual because of how long they were carried out (from 2010 to 2020) and the number of offenders," he said, adding that the husband had filmed all the rapes.The woman, who is also in her sixties, only discovered the assaults when alerted by police, he added.The videos were found on the husband's computer along with messages posted on casual sex meeting sites, inviting people to take advantage of his wife while she was knocked out by anti-anxiety drugs.Those accused of rape range in age from 24 to 71."He (the husband) would put her on the bed naked and warm up the room so she wouldn't wake up. The individuals would then tiptoe in and whisper, and if the victim moved at all they would leave," Bosse Platiere said.The husband and 32 other men are in custody and nine more are being questioned, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-man-jailed-for-drugging-wife-and-getting-her-raped-over-10-years-101632937276524.html

The Taliban came to power for the second time in Afghanistan on August 15. They have announced a Cabinet but it was not yet clear what rights they will give to the women and the media until the Taliban started to spell out the terms and conditions of the news government that awaits international recognition.The Taliban's acting justice minister issued a statement on Tuesday saying they would adopt the 1964 constitution, which was drafted by Afghans who were educated abroad. This constitution is the most ambitious one among the four constitutions that the country had. Mohammad Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan, commissioned for drafting the constitution.What 1964 constitution means for Afghanistan. All you need to know> The constitution created two houses of Afghanistan Parliament. The lower house members were to be elected.> The constitution maintained a gap between the Cabinet from Parliament. Cabinet was supposed to exercise the monarch's powers, while legislators were prohibited from holding ministerial posts.> Women had the right to vote in the 1964 constitution.> The constitution also gave freedom of religion as it said non-Muslim citizens were free to perform their religious rituals as determined by the laws.> The constitution said education is the right of every Afghan and shall be provided free of charge.> The constitution laid rules for a centralised administration, divided into a number of administrative units, headed by the ministers.> The king, which might be applicable for Taliban supremo, held the supreme command of everything, from declaring war to sign international treaties.The constitution was in force between 1964 and 1973, which is often referred to as Afghanistan's golden age. It was then annulled by a coup. After the US invasion in 2001, a new constitution was drafted, which the Taliban have rejected claiming that it has western influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-there-in-1964-s-monarchy-constitution-that-taliban-plan-to-adopt-101632934277381.html

The Kremlin said that the decision by YouTube to suspend RT's German channel was a breach of Russian law, according to several news reports.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called YouTube's action as "censorship" and also said that the Russian laws were "grossly violated" by the suspension. "There are signs that the laws of the Russian Federation have been violated, and violated very grossly. This is associated with censorship and with obstruction to the dissemination of information in the media," news agency AFP quoted him as saying. "We should not rule out the possibility of taking measures to force this platform to comply with our laws. There must be zero tolerance for such violations," he added.Also read | YouTube expands policy to crack down on anti-vaccine contentThe Kremlin's comments came after YouTube on Tuesday suspended two channels of RT German, alleging that the channel uploaded content which violated the platform's guidelines on Covid-19 misinformation. It was suspended from uploading any new content, however, RT tried to circumvent this restriction by using another YouTube channel, an action because of which both channels were terminated, YouTube had said. "During this suspension, RT DE tried to circumvent this restriction by using another YouTube channel to upload its videos," the Associated Press quoted YouTube as saying.Following the termination, RT's chief editor Margarita Simonyan wrote on the Russian messaging platform Telegram, calling the move a "true media war by Germany on Russia. "I'm looking forward to my native state banning Deutsche Welle and other German media in Russia without delay, as well as close the offices of ARD and ZDF," the Associated Press quoted Simonyan as saying.Also, Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor said that it has written a letter to Google, which owns YouTube, demanding that the restrictions on the two channels be lifted, according to a news report by AFP. It has also said that YouTube could be provided a warning and the access to the platform could be partially or fully restricted if it ignored the warnings.Meanwhile, the German government has said that it was not involved in the actions taken by YouTube. "It is a decision by YouTube, based on rules created by YouTube, it is not a measure (taken by) the German government or other official organizations," Reuters quoted German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert as saying.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-of-blocking-youtube-over-platform-s-suspension-of-rt-tv-s-german-channel-101632933236605.html

Faafoi said the majority of applications will be granted within a year of the category opening in December.The 2021 Resident Visa will be available to most work-related visa holders and their immediate family members.Immigration New Zealand estimates eligible visa holders will include over 5,000 health and aged care workers, around 9,000 primary industry workers, and more than 800 teachers. There are also around 15,000 construction and 12,000 manufacturing workers on relevant visa types, some of whom will be eligible for the one-off pathway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-offers-one-off-resident-visa-to-165-000-migrants-101632932522204.html
29-09-2021||World||YouTube expands policy to crack down on anti-vaccine content||YouTube on Wednesday announced its new policy on medical misinformation, saying it will remove videos that falsely claim approved vaccines are dangerous and cause chronic health effects. Google’s video-sharing company said that the false claims about vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) “spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general.”“Today, we're expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO,” YouTube said in a statement.In the initial days of the Covid vaccine development, YouTube was inundated with conspiracy theory videos, one of them even claiming that Microsoft’s Bill Gates was planning to track everyone through a substance mixed with vaccines. Gates had then called it a “bad combination of pandemic and social media.”YouTube said the new policy would target the content falsely claiming that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer or infertility, or that “substances in vaccines can track those who receive them.” It further stated that policies would not only cover specific routine immunizations but also apply to general statements about vaccines.“[O]ur new guidance on vaccine side effects maps to public vaccine resources provided by health authorities and backed by medical consensus. These policy changes will go into effect today, and as with any significant update, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up enforcement,” the company said.YouTube will continue to allow content about “vaccine policies, new vaccine trials, and historical vaccine successes or failures" on the video-sharing platform.“Working closely with health authorities, we looked to balance our commitment to an open platform with the need to remove egregious harmful content,” the company added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-expands-policy-to-crack-down-on-anti-vaccine-content-101632930516938.html
29-09-2021||World||US senators introduced bill on Taliban. Stocks in Pakistan plummeted a day after||A bill introduced in US Senate seeking sanctions on the Afghan Taliban and the foreign governments that support the outfit appeared to have given investors in Pakistan cold feet as the stocks fell nearly 3% and the rupee dropped to a record low on Wednesday. More than 20 Senate Republicans introduced legislation titled ‘Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act’ aimed at tackling the situation in the wake of chaotic US withdrawal from the war-torn country.The bill sets out provisions for establishing a state department task force, counterterrorism strategy for Afghanistan, review of foreign assistance to countries supporting the Taliban and imposition of sanctions on the Islamist fundamentalists and their supporters.If the bill gets support from both Houses and is signed into law, the US president will have the power to impose sanctions on individuals who provide military, training or logistical support to the Taliban or provide safe haven to their fighters.Under the legislation, the US secretary of state will have the power to suspend all forms of foreign assistance to the countries or organisations found providing any form of material support to the Taliban, except some activities to support humanitarian projects, democracy-building in Afghanistan, education among others."Our legislation would help hold the Administration accountable and prioritize the complete evacuation of Americans, SIVs, and refugees,” said Senator Susan Collins regarding the legislation introduced by Senator Jim Risch.“Additionally, it would impose sanctions on the Taliban and its supporters, sending a clear message that the United States denounces the Taliban's human rights abuses and terrorism," she added.Pakistan has long been accused of providing assistance to the Afghan Taliban in their attempt to topple the democratically elected government in Afghanistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan spy chief was in Kabul before the announcement of the interim Taliban government, which many experts suggested that Islamabad was trying to sideline Mullah Baradar and help the Haqqani Network get the major share of the power pie in Afghanistan.A day after the legislation was introduced in US Senate, the benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange index decline as much as 2.9% before making a recovery. Analysts have said that the historic low of the Pakistani rupee, 170.27 against the dollar, was also weighed down by high demand for the greenback and the situation in Afghanistan, reported Reuters."Dollar parity is consistently rising as demand for the dollar is high due to the current account deficit, and the Afghan situation is also adding pressure," Reuters quoted Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company Pvt Ltd., as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-introduced-bill-on-taliban-stocks-in-pakistan-plummeted-a-day-after-101632918151809.html

Now, urban neighborhoods are being blacked out, triggering pleas on social media for the government to solve the problem.China’s power consumption is growing at almost double its usual rate, while the ruling Communist Party is trying to reduce energy intensity, or the amount used per unit of economic output.The power cuts come as global leaders prepare to attend a UN environmental conference by video link on October 12-13 in the southwestern city of Kunming. That increases pressure on President Xi Jinping’s government, as the meeting’s host, to show it is sticking to emissions and energy efficiency targets.The cuts are “largely driven by energy consumption control measures, with power shortages affecting another few provinces,” Lara Dong of IHS Markit said in an email.“This is in line with China’s decarbonization ambitions,” she said.The Cabinet’s planning agency warned in August that 20 regions had exceeded energy use and pollution targets after manufacturing rebounded from the pandemic. The government has ambitious plans to make the economy cleaner and more energy-efficient, so failing to meet those targets can be a career-ending blunder.The power cuts “could be more disruptive than previous shortages,” Bank of America said in a report. Due to shortages in some areas, it said, "a relaxation of the government’s energy consumption goals may not immediately alleviate the power crunch.”China is one of the world’s biggest emitters of climate-changing industrial gases and consumes more energy per unit of economic output than developed countries. Given its huge population, on a per capita basis it ranks much lower.China also is preparing for the Winter Olympics in the capital, Beijing, and the nearby city of Shijiazhuang in February, a period when it will want clear blue skies.Officials in Jiangsu province, a manufacturing hub northwest of Shanghai, told state media some cities there have used up 90% of this year's quota for power use. The officials of the provincial planning agency were cited as saying individual city governments had to decide how to meet their targets.The government of Guangdong province, China's biggest manufacturing center, has cited both official energy use limits and low water levels in hydropower reservoirs that provide a big share of its electricity.In Liaoning province, where Shenyang is the capital, the government said in a statement Sunday that power demand hit a record high in the first eight months of the year. It said Liaoning has suffered shortages since then due to a decline in wind power and other sources.The government of neighboring Jilin province blamed a shortage of coal. It said in a statement Monday its governor would visit miners in nearby Inner Mongolia to line up additional supplies.Some advance warnings of power cuts to residents in Shenyang and other cities cited a need to ration power but didn't say why.Li, the noodle restaurant owner, showed a reporter a notice circulated on social media that said power would be out in his neighborhood from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.Shopkeeper Yang Chang had a generator running on the sidewalk to keep freezers full of meat cold.“As long as there is electricity we can sell things, unlike restaurants that need water,” said Yang. Yang didn’t know or care what the reason for the power outage was but said, “it’s understandable.”“I was born in the ’90s. When I was little, electricity wasn’t stable,” said Yang. “Although we are having difficulties, the government will find a solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flashlights-generators-how-chinese-are-coping-amid-power-cuts-in-country-101632916323670.html
29-09-2021||World||Analysing North Korean missile test: What it means for the region||North Korea test-fired a newly developed hypersonic missile earlier this week, state news media KCNA reported on Wednesday, joining a race headed by major military powers to deploy the advanced weapons system.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not inspect the launch of Hwasong-8, according to a report from the hermit kingdom. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a picture of the weapon - with a set of guidance fins at the base of its nose cone - ascending into the morning sky."In the first test-launch, national defence scientists confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile," the report said.What are hypersonic missiles?Hypersonic weapons are considered the next generation of arms that aim to rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.Unlike ballistic missiles that fly into outer space before returning on steep trajectories, hypersonic weapons fly towards targets at lower altitudes and can achieve more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 km per hour.The development of the weapons system increases North Korea's defence capabilities, KCNA said, describing the hypersonic missile as "strategic weapon".How advanced is North Korea's missile?The North's hypersonic missile is at an early stage of development judged by detected velocity and other data, and would take a "considerable period of time" until it could be deployed in combat, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Wednesday.The official Korean Central News Agency said that the missile met key technical requirements, including launch stability and the maneuverability and flight characteristics of the "detached hypersonic gliding warhead".What does this missile launch mean for North Korea?The test could mean the North is entering an accelerating race to deploy the weapon now involving the United States, Russia and China.KCNA described the new missile as an important addition to the country's "strategic" weaponry, implying that the system is being developed to deliver nuclear weapons.However, experts say the missile test was likely a failure. "The North's HGV technology is not comparable to those of the US, Russia or China and for now seems to aim for short-range that can target South Korea or Japan," Chang Young-keun, a missile specialist at the Korea Aerospace University, told news agency Reuters.Regional ramificationsBoth Koreas are building up their weapons capabilities in what could become an arms race on the divided peninsula, with ramifications for neighbouring Japan, China and the wider region.The nuclear-armed North, which invaded the South in 1950, is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, and earlier this month said it had tested a long-range cruise missile.Developing the hypersonic missile was one of five "top priority" tasks in the five-year plan for strategic weapons, KCNA said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysing-north-korean-missile-test-what-it-means-for-the-region-101632900818202.html
29-09-2021||World||Wary of China, US and EU forge alliance on technology||The chip crisis turned dire when the coronavirus hit. As demand for electronics was skyrocketing in the spring of 2020, manufacturers warned they were running short of semiconductors — key components needed to make devices from smartphones to cars.They had good reasons: In the following months, the shortage forced factories to shut down assembly lines. Tech companies postponed product launches. Computers were delivered months too late.Worried about the fallout, politicians from Washington DC to Berlin called up chip-manufacturing countries and asked them to help prioritize orders from their countries.But there was only so much they could do: The chips, which are made by just a handful of firms, are notoriously hard to produce. And there just were not enough for everyone.'A US-EU partnership'A year and a half later, the shortage persists — curtailing, for example, the production of new cars.That is why manufacturing more chips in Europe and the US will be high up on the agenda when top US and EU officials gather on Wednesday in Pittsburgh for the first meeting of the "EU-US Trade and Technology Council" (TTC)."We commit to building a US-EU partnership ... to design and produce the most powerful and resource-efficient semiconductors," the White House said in a statement.Other discussions at the TTC will be about coming up with principles for artificial intelligence technology; how to boost cybersecurity in an increasingly unstable digital world; and how to push joint technology standards on the international stage.The meeting will be co-chaired by the EU's digital chief Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, as well as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and Trade Representative Katherine Tai.Far from seeing eye to eyeThe chip crisis was an eye-opening moment for policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, illustrating how important access to technology has become for maintaining geopolitical dominance, according to conversations with US and EU officials involved in preparing the TTC meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.But finding common ground during the two-day meeting will not be easy.Not only was the event overshadowed by news that the US had quietly negotiated a security agreement with Australia and the UK, wrecking a multi-billion-euro French submarine deal.The US and the EU have been at loggerheads over how to regulate new technology for years.While Brussels is pushing for tough rules, arguing they are needed to protect the fundamental rights of Europeans, Washington has mostly advocated a market-driven, hands-off approach, warning that too many rules could hamper innovation.Finding a middle ground would help both sides, said Marietje Schaake, the policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center."If the US and the EU worked together better, that would actually be a pretty strong combination — it would bring the geopolitical strength from the US to the EU, and it would bring the rights-and-freedoms strength from the EU to the US," said Schaake, who served as a member of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2019."But it does require political agreement — and so far, there has not been a great meeting of the minds."A 'New Cold War'?The elephant in the negotiation room is how to deal with China.In recent years, China's tech companies have grown into some of the biggest in the world. This has raised concerns in the US that Beijing could soon dominate certain sensitive technologies and use that as a strategic advantage — and it has prompted some observers to speak of a "New Cold War."The Biden administration, encouraged by widespread support for a tough stance on Beijing back home, has painted the new TTC as a platform where the US and the EU can combine their economic and political might to counter China's ambitions.EU officials, meanwhile, have been eager to stress that the new alliance should primarily be about working together, rather than targeting one particular country. The bloc has so far taken a less confrontational course on Beijing, not least because some of its 27 member countries have close economic ties with China and remain divided over how to deal with the country.But Beijing's increasingly authoritarian leadership style has officials in Washington and Brussels alarmed, said Stormy-Annika Mildner, the executive director of think tank Aspen Institute Germany."Both sides feel a greater threat from China, and a greater need to work together," Mildner said, adding that this could set the TTC apart from previous trans-Atlantic efforts kicked off under George W. Bush or Barack Obama, which all started with similarly grand ambitions for trans-Atlantic cooperation — but eventually led nowhere."The world around us is just completely different from back then," Mildner said, "And China is one key reason for that."How much can governments really do?One of the areas where both sides hope to close ranks is that of producing semiconductors. Manufacturing the tiny chips is extremely complicated. It includes hundreds of steps, takes months to complete, and requires factories worth billions.China has declared it a top national priority to soon run that entire production process on its own territory — something no country can currently do.That is one of the reasons why US and European officials have been watching warily that Chinese-owned firms have been buying chip companies around the world.At the TTC, officials will speak about how to deal with foreign investment in the semiconductors industry. They will also discuss how to coordinate their own plans for how the EU and the US can become less dependent on global supply chains.And the US and EU should think about how to better collaborate in the research and development of new technology, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, a semiconductor expert at think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung.Kleinhans cautioned that when it comes to tackling the global chip crisis, there is only so much governments can do."Yes, public money, if spent properly, can help with building new production capacities," he said.But Kleinhans added that more is needed to tackle the current shortage — such as making global supply chains more transparent or giving a halt to rising raw material prices that have exacerbated the crisis."That's something only companies can do," he said. "And that's why no one truly knows when we'll be out of this crisis."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wary-of-china-us-and-eu-forge-alliance-on-technology-101632900403191.html
29-09-2021||World||Elon Musk, world's richest man, wants to send ‘No 2’ statue to Jeff Bezos: Report||Elon Musk on Monday once again reclaimed the title of the world's richest man as he made new records for himself – becoming only the third person in history to amass a net worth of $200 billion, according to Forbes magazine. In the process, Musk crossed Amazon founder and fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, who earlier enjoyed his stint as the richest man in the world. The celebratory rivalry between the two entrepreneurs is well-known, as in a seeming acknowledgment of this strife – Elon Musk took a fresh dig at Jeff Bezos.According to the Forbes report, Elon Musk sent a ‘short email’, joking that he was now going to deliver a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to the Amazon founder, apparently mocking the fact that the latter had to settle for the number 2 position in the list of richest men.“I’m sending a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to Jeffrey B., along with a silver medal,” Musk wrote in a short email, as per the magazine.Musk and Bezos have been engaged in a well-known feud over entrepreneurial ambitions for a long time now, but conflict recently peaked since both of them have their eyes on the race to outer space and innovations in the automobile sector – including self-driving cars.This would hardly be the first time that Musk has taken a crack at Bezos. He has already called his rival a “copycat” twice (both times using the emoji of a cat) – once when Bezos' Amazon announced plans to launch internet-beaming satellites in competition with Musk’s SpaceX, and then again when Amazon acquired self-driving car company Zoox to take on Musk's Tesla.Back in August last year, Jeff Bezos became the first person in history to amass a fortune worth $200 billion. But later in the year, stocks for Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla rallied by a humongous 720%, and both of the billionaires were soon trading barbs as equals. Elon Musk eventually crossed Jeff Bezos in the rankings, once briefly in January this year, and then again on Monday when his net worth was estimated to be around $200.7 billion. Bezos is currently second on the list, with a net worth of $192.5 billion, while French art collector and investor Bernard Arnault is third with a net worth of $174 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-world-s-richest-man-wants-to-send-no-2-statue-to-jeff-bezos-report-101632897030169.html
29-09-2021||World||Japan’s ruling party picks Fumio Kishida as leader, set to be next prime minister||Fumio Kishida is set to become Japan’s prime minister after the ex-foreign minister overcame popular reformer, Taro Kono, to win the leadership of the country’s ruling party. Kishida, 64, was expected to be appointed Monday to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, putting him in charge of the world’s third-largest economy as it seeks to rebound from a virus emergency. The self-effacing former banker from Hiroshima has promised tens of trillions of yen in spending and pledged to steer away from “neoliberal” economic policies in a bid to bolster the middle class.Kishida’s victory caps an unpredictable Liberal Democratic Party election, in which two of the four candidates were female and most of the party’s largest factions allowed their members a free vote. Although Kono and Kishida were nearly tied on the first ballot, Kishida’s stronger support among members of parliament pushed him over the top in the second round after Sanae Takaichi and Seiko Noda -- both former internal affairs ministers -- were eliminated.In the end, Kishida got 257 votes, compared with Kono’s 170. Japanese markets, which closed just before the final result was announced, pared some losses, with Topix Index and Nikkei 225 both down 2.1%The LDP, which has been in power for all but about four years since 1955, will use its majority in parliament to formally install him as premier in a special session. Still, Kishida, who acknowledged during his campaign that some see him as boring, will face an immediate test of his broader appeal in a general election that he must hold by November.Long seen as a dove on foreign policy for his opposition to nuclear weapons and efforts to resolve a painful decades-old dispute over Japan’s past militarism in the Korean Peninsula, Kishida showed a harder edge in his campaign for the leadership. He has expressed the need to deal “firmly” with the stability of the Taiwan Strait and said that Japan’s defense spending will probably continue to rise.The next prime minister must lead the LDP into a national election within weeks, and lay out policies for tackling long-running issues such as the dwindling population. The new cabinet will also be tasked with figuring out how to tackle sour relations with China, the country’s biggest trading partner, without distancing Japan from its only military ally, the US.Suga, who abandoned a plan to run for re-election after his support rates plummeted to record lows amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic, was seen as a liability for his party heading into the election expected next month.The country’s vaccination program got off to a slow start, and efforts to provide financial support to individuals were seen as inefficient. Nonetheless, the death toll in Japan is far lower than that seen in other wealthy nations, while restrictions on daily life have been relatively light.In one of his final acts as premier, Suga on Tuesday decided to lift a virus state of emergency at the end of September as new Covid-19 infections recede, easing restrictions that have dragged on the economy and limited operations at bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-party-picks-fumio-kishida-as-leader-set-to-be-next-prime-minister-101632895898793.html
29-09-2021||World||Who will be Japan's next prime minister?||Japan's minister for vaccines and reform, Taro Kono, is way ahead of his rivals for the job as head of the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) when party members and its elected politicians vote on Wednesday, according to opinion polls.Despite that popularity, analysts believe that quietly agreed pacts and promises between the party's rival factions will ensure a different outcome.The election of the party leader was forced upon the LDP by the recent announcement by deeply unpopular Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga that he would not stand for reelection after just a year in the job.Whoever wins the party leadership vote will also assume the post of prime minister, at least until a general election is held later in the year, with early November the most likely date.Kono, who has previously served as defense and foreign minister and has established a reputation as a blunt-speaking politician who gets things done, had the support of about 45% of the general public in a poll conducted over the weekend and, more importantly, more than 47% of party members with a vote.Support of party membersIn contrast, former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida had 22% of rank-and-file party members on his side, while 16% were backing Sanae Takaichi — an ardent nationalist who revels in the reputation of Japan's "Iron Lady" — and a mere 3% were supporting Seiko Noda, the party's acting secretary-general.Political analysts say that an unprecedented two women running for the post of prime minister is a generally positive development for Japanese politics — which has never seen a woman in the top position — but the sense is that a party as deeply conservative as the LDP is not yet ready for a female leader.That will whittle the choices down to the two male candidates, Kono and Kishida. And even though Kono has, on paper, double the support of his rival, the party's two-stage voting system means that he is likely to miss out."I do not expect a clear winner to emerge from the first round of voting, so the candidates will be reduced to two and I see it as a duel between Kono and Kishida," said Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Tokyo's Sophia University."And even though Kono is clearly the most popular with party members and the general public, the second round of voting is only for politicians, and I expect the factions who previously supported Takaichi or Noda to switch to Kishida," he told DW. "At this stage, I would be very surprised if Fumio Kishida does not win."Different interests behind the scenesKishida's victory is being managed by the "old guard" — such as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and present Finance Minister Taro Aso — who wield vast amounts of behind-the-scenes power, despite efforts by some to modernize the institution. And they see Kono as too middle-of-the-road — or even progressive — in many of his policies."The old guard wants to keep everything as it is, and Kono is seen as part of a younger generation of politicians who would like to change the party," Nakano said."They want Kishida to take over because he would be an easier puppet for them to control," he claimed.Kishida and Abe both entered politics at the same time, after the 1993 election, and have remained close throughout their careers, he said, pointing to Kishida's "unfailing loyalty" when Abe was prime minister.Kono, on the other hand, has a very different personality and "would be far more difficult to control," he added.Perception of politics as a 'man's job'Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, agreed that while a woman is unlikely to win the party election, the positive showing of Takaichi has been "surprising.""Many analysts did not expect her to remain this competitive so late in the race, but it looks as if she has managed to stand out with policies that have the support of the far right of the party," she said.Those policies include support for Japan developing nuclear submarines, expanded military spending, greater resources devoted to protecting outlying Japanese territory from foreign claims — notably from China — and reiterating "family values" policies that resonate with conservatives, such as opposing proposals for women to be permitted to retain their maiden name after marriage.Ultimately, however, the perception that politics is a "man's job" among the vast majority of party members and politicians means that Takaichi will not win the vote — although her candidacy may well serve to pave the way for more women to stand at all levels of politics across the country, Murakami said.And with the general election coming hard on the heels of the party leadership vote, the expert said the new leader will have little time to get their vision for the nation across to the public. Yet the new leader will have the huge advantage of not being outgoing Prime Minister Suga.Day-to-day concerns"For ordinary people, the biggest day-to-day concern is still the coronavirus pandemic and the employment and broader economic problems that it has caused over the last 18 months or so," she said.With Suga's popularity collapsing from more than 60% when he first took office in September last year to below 30% in the most recent polls, the incoming LDP leader can expect a substantial "new leader" bump at the ballot box in November."Whoever comes in is going to be a big change and the party should no longer have to worry about being badly damaged in the upcoming election," she said. "If the new leader can get across his hopes and expectations and have a bit more charisma in front of the public, then the LDP should easily be able to win the most seats."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-will-be-japan-s-next-prime-minister-101632893980858.html

29-09-2021||World||Jeans could get costly after cotton prices reach a decade high||Cotton futures raced past $1 a pound for the first time in nearly a decade as adverse weather and shipping snags threaten supplies, driving up costs for clothing around the world. Crops in several key-growing countries are seeing problems, from rain-drenched fields in the U.S. to bollworm-infested ones in India. At the same time, cotton buyers need more of the fiber. Mexico and China are buying record amounts. Also causing trouble for supplies are high freight rates and geopolitics, with international backlash about labor violations in Xinjiang, China’s biggest producing region. The U.S. banned imports earlier this year. All of this is coming together to drive up prices, which means the cost of making clothing will be on the rise. That will squeeze margins for apparel makers like Levi Strauss & Co., and result in inflation for everything from T-shirts to jeans if retailers try to pass on the expense to consumers.  In New York, the contract for December delivery climbed as much as 3.6% to $1.0155 a pound, the highest since November 2011. The price has surged 28% this year. Gains are being intensified by traders rushing to cover short positions.    With cotton projected to see a second year of global supply deficits, traders are focusing on an updated figure for the shortfall that is due this week from researcher Cotlook. While the spike to $1 is psychologicallly significant, the rally likely won’t surpass the $2 level reached in 2011, said Louis Rose, a director of research for Rose Commodity Group in Tennessee. “Ten years prior, China was virtually out of cotton -- not so this time,” said Rose, who previously worked for Cargill Inc.  The fundamentals aren’t in place for a doubling in cotton prices, said John Robinson, an economist at Texas A&M’s AgriLife Extension in College Station. While supply chain disruptions are hurting cotton, U.S. production fears are overhyped, he said. “Since Friday this run-up has been from speculator buying, and that can turn around as fast as it started,” he said.  (Updates with analyst comments.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City.Customs then changed the clearance to Dulles International Airport outside Washington before denying the plane landing rights anywhere in the United States, he said."I have a big, beautiful, giant, humongous Boeing 787 that I can see parked in front of us," he said. "I have crew. I have food."Stern said intermediaries in Kabul had obtained permission from the Taliban-run Afghan Civil Aviation Authority for the groups to send a charter flight to retrieve the passengers from Kabul airport.(Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Scott Malone and Stephen Coates)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bars-flight-from-landing-with-americans-from-kabul-report-101632889315577.html

Terming the US move a breach of national security, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid asked all the nations to act in accordance with mutual obligations.Mujahid also stated that acting on obligations would prevent negative consequences. "We call on all countries, especially the United States, to act in accordance with mutual obligations ... to prevent any negative consequences," he said in a tweet, according to Sputnik.The Pentagon had last month said that it will continue to conduct drone strikes against the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and other terrorist groups operating within the South Asian nation. "We have the capability from an over the horizon perspective of ensuring our national security interests are protected and defended," said press secretary of Pentagon John Kirby, according to Fox News. "And what I would tell you, without getting into hypotheticals or speculating about future operations, we're going to continue to maintain those capabilities and use them if and when we need to," Kirby added.The Taliban took control of Afghanistan last month and announced its interim government earlier in September. The US troops left Afghanistan on August 31 under the previously agreed Doha deal with the Taliban last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ask-us-not-to-operate-drones-over-afghan-airspace-report-101632884965495.html
29-09-2021||World||Japan's ruling party to pick new leader who is set to become next prime minister||Japan's ruling party picks its new leader on Wednesday, with a mild-mannered former foreign minister and the Twitter-savvy vaccine chief leading the race to become the country's next prime minister. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is going to the polls with prime minister Yoshihide Suga opting not to stand, ending his tenure as premier after just a year in the role.Whoever wins will be approved as prime minister by parliament within days, and will then contest general elections in which the LDP is expected to retain power.The race to become the next leader of the world's third-largest economy is unusually tight this time around, in part because most of the party's powerful factions are not backing a candidate and their members will vote freely.Four politicians are in the running, two men and two women, another unusual turn of events in a country that has never had a woman prime minister and has few prominent women political figures.The race is expected to come down to former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who lost out to Suga last year, and vaccine rollout chief Taro Kono, one of Japan's most recognisable politicians.Their competitors, hawkish right-winger Sanae Takaichi and feminist former gender equality minister Seiko Noda, are not expected to advance beyond a first-round vote.The initial vote on Wednesday afternoon will involve 382 LDP lawmakers and an equal number of rank-and-file party members.But if no candidate secures a majority, the top two will advance to an immediate second round involving 382 lawmakers and one party representative from each of Japan's 47 regions.Kono vs KishidaAdministrative reform minister Kono is the favourite with the public, reflecting in part his strong name recognition.A former defence and foreign minister, he has been considered a likely candidate for the top job for years.He favours a direct communication style that breaks from the cautious approach often preferred by Japanese politicians and engages freely with the more than two million people who follow his Japanese Twitter account.But he has also been described as abrasive and criticised for blocking people on Twitter and over allegations in tabloid reports that he bullied bureaucrats.His main rival is Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister and LDP policy chief who has pledged more pandemic stimulus if elected.Kishida has sought to capitalise on public discontent over Suga's response to the pandemic, which has seen his government's approval ratings slump to record lows.He has emphasised his skill as a listener and invited citizens to share their requests and proposals with him, even toting a suggestion box and notebook to scribble ideas at events.The son of a Hiroshima family of politicians, Kishida unsuccessfully ran for the leadership against Suga last year and said the experience had made him more forceful and determined.Whoever wins the race will face a plethora of challenges, from driving a post-pandemic economic recovery to confronting threats from North Korea and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-party-to-pick-new-leader-who-is-set-to-become-next-prime-minister-101632882745835.html

The report was based on a study of more than 22,000 people who signed up to a vaccine safety smartphone app and who received a booster shot between August 12 and September 19.During this time, third doses were authorised for people who are immunocompromised but not the wider population. "The frequency and type of side effects were similar to those seen after the second vaccine doses, and were mostly mild or moderate and short lived," CDC director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing, reports AFP.Reported side effects include injection site pain (in 71 per cent of the participants), fatigue (56 per cent), and headache (43 per cent). Some 28 per cent reported being unable to perform normal daily activities, usually the next day. Medical care was sought by around two per cent of participants and 0.1 per cent were hospitalized.A subset of almost 21,700 who received the same mRNA vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) for all three of their doses was further analyzed. Among those who received Moderna, reaction such as arm pain was reported to be slightly more common after the third dose compared to the second. Systemic reactions which occurred outside the injection site were slightly less frequent after the third dose compared to the second.The same pattern occurred for Pfizer and in both the cases the first shots resulted in significantly less frequent side effects, compared to shots two and three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/side-effects-after-covid-19-booster-dose-similar-to-2nd-shot-says-us-study-101632879922498.html
29-09-2021||World||Top US military officials advised keeping troops in Afghanistan, warned Biden against withdrawal||Top military officials of the United States, while testifying before a high-level Senate committee on Tuesday, revealed that they had recommended US president Joe Biden to keep some 2,500 American troops standing by on the ground in Afghanistan and also expressed concerns over the fact that the Taliban had not completely severed its ties with the al Qaeda terror outfit. The development comes after White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden had received “split” advice from top-level leaders on what to do with the situation in Afghanistan, which the United States invaded 20 years ago after the al Qaeda conducted the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.Also Read | Need to fully examine Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan: US General Mark MilleyGeneral Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of the US Central Command; and defense secretary Lloyd Austin were grilled for nearly six hours by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the chaotic evacuation from Kabul airport.General Milley and General McKenzie testified before the Senate committee that they had personally recommended some 2,500 troops remain on the ground in Afghanistan.Milley also claimed that the United States' withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan amid the Taliban offensive had ‘damaged’ American credibility.“I think our credibility with allies and partners around the world and with adversaries is being intensely reviewed by them to see which way this is going to go and I think ‘damage’ is one word that could be used, yes,” he said, adding that the Taliban “was and remains a terrorist organisation and they still have not broken ties with the al Qaeda,” which plotted the September 11, 2001 attacks from Afghanistan.Also Read | Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawal“It remains to be seen whether or not the Taliban can consolidate power or if the country will fracture into further civil war,” he said. “But we must continue to protect the American people from terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan.”US president Joe Biden had in April ordered a complete pullout of US forces from the war-torn land of Afghanistan by August 31, making the decision to end a 20-year-war. Although he was following through with an agreement reached with the Taliban by former president Donald Trump, Biden was heavily criticised for the decision back home. A national poll conducted soon after the Taliban takeover of Kabul showed that Biden approval ratings as president, which fell to 43 per cent, were at an all-time low. The majority of Americans disapproved of the way Biden handled foreign policy, while a large section of the populace also termed the United States' role in Afghanistan a “failure”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-military-officials-advised-keeping-troops-in-afghanistan-warned-biden-against-withdrawal-101632875435774.html
29-09-2021||World||France moves against 'radical' Muslim groups, centres: Minister||France is moving to shut six mosques and break up several associations suspected of producing radical Islamic propaganda, Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin said on Tuesday.A third of the 89 places of worship "suspected of being radical" and flagged by the intelligence services had been checked since November 2020, he told Le Figaro newspaper.Of those, action to shut down six -- in five different departments across France -- had been launched, he said.The authorities would also request the dissolution of the Islamist publishers Nawa and the Black African Defence League (LDNA).Nawa, based in the southern French town of Ariege, "incites the extermination of the Jews and legitimises the stoning of homosexuals", Darmanin said.The LDNA, the organisers of a protest against police violence in front of the US embassy in Paris in June last year, "calls for hate and discrimination", he said."In the coming year, 10 other associations are going to be the object of a dissolution procedure, four them next month," he said.Last week, the Council of State, France's highest administrative court, approved the government's move to dissolve the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) and Baraka City.The government acted after the October 2020 murder of teacher Samuel Paty.Paty was targeted following an online campaign against him for having shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo during a civics class.Darmanin also said he had called on regional prefects to refuse any residence permits to imam's sent by a foreign country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-moves-against-radical-muslim-groups-centres-minister-101632875708544.html
29-09-2021||World||Maryland newspaper gunman gets more than 5 life prison terms||Selene San Felice said she often questioned how or why she survived the shooting that left five others dead at a Maryland newspaper. Montana Winters Geimer described the grievous loss she and the community suffered when her mother, longtime local journalist Wendi Winters, was killed in the attack.San Felice and Winters Geimer were among several survivors and relatives of victims of the June 2018 killings at the Capital Gazette newspaper who testified in court Tuesday before a judge sentenced the shooter to more than five life terms without the possibility of parole.“We lost the storyteller of our family, and as a community we lost the storyteller for everyone that is an Annapolitan,” Winters Geimer said.Judy Hiaasen spoke of how difficult it was to even talk about the loss of her younger brother, Rob Hiaasen, who was an editor and columnist at the paper. She described his ability to keep memories of their mother and father alive. Now, she said, “That story has been taken from me.”“My little brother was slaughtered, and the impact of that loss is indescribable,” she said. “It is unique, and it is never-ending.”Anne Arundel Circuit Court Judge Michael Wachs described shooter Jarrod Ramos' actions as a “cold-blooded, calculated attack on the innocent employees of a small-town newspaper.” Ramos used a shotgun to kill his victims.“The impact of this case is just simply immense,” Wachs said. “To say that the defendant exhibited a callous and complete disregard for the sanctity of human life is simply a huge understatement.”Wachs gave Ramos an additional 345 years to underscore the fact that he would never be released from prison. And he ordered another life sentence for the attempted murder of photographer Paul Gillespie, who had previously testified that Ramos barely missed him with a shotgun blast as he ran out of the newsroom.While Gillespie said he didn’t believe there could have been a better outcome at the sentencing hearing, he doubted a full sense of closure would ever be possible after losing his five colleagues.“I was almost killed myself,” Gillespie said outside the courthouse. “It’s something that haunts me every day.”In July, a jury took less than two hours to reject arguments from Ramos' lawyers during a 12-day trial that he was not criminally responsible due to mental illness for killing Winters, Hiaasen, John McNamara, Gerald Fischman and Rebecca Smith.Ramos had pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible to all 23 counts against him in 2019, using Maryland’s version of an insanity defense. The case was delayed several times before and during the coronavirus pandemic.“The judge was crystal clear that Jarrod Ramos should never be allowed to walk out of prison — ever," Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said of the sentence handed out Tuesday.San Felice, who watched one of her colleagues get shot and survived one of the deadliest attacks on a newsroom in US history by hiding under her desk, testified that she and other survivors were determined to “press on” and not let the traumatic attack stop them.“Remember this,” she said, as Ramos sat on the other side of the courtroom. “You cannot kill the truth.”Ramos declined to make a statement in court when asked by his attorney, Katy O’Donnell.Prosecutors said Ramos, 41, acted out of revenge against the newspaper after it published a story about his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of harassing a former high school classmate in 2011. Prosecutors said his long, meticulous planning for the attack — which included preparations for his arrest and long incarceration — proved he understood the criminality of his actions.They also highlighted how Ramos called 911 from the newsroom after the shooting, identified himself as the gunman and said he surrendered — evidence, they said, that he clearly understood the criminality of his actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryland-newspaper-gunman-gets-more-than-5-life-prison-terms-101632873290098.html
29-09-2021||World||US senators warn Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro on democracy||Top senators from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party warned Tuesday that the US relationship with Brazil would be at risk if President Jair Bolsonaro does not respect democratic norms in October 2022 elections.The far-right leader, one of the leading international allies of Donald Trump, has warned that Brazil could see scenes reminiscent of the January 6 mob violence in Washington by supporters of the former US president's false claims of election fraud.In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, four Democratic senators said that disruption in Brazil's democracy "would jeopardize the very foundation" of relations between the Western Hemisphere's two most populous nations."We urge you to make clear that the United States supports Brazil's democratic institutions, and that any undemocratic break with the current constitutional order will have serious consequences," said the senators including Dick Durbin, the chamber's number two Democrat, and Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The senators voiced alarm at Bolsonaro's claims without evidence that the voting system is mired in fraud and his suggestions that he would not concede defeat."This type of reckless language is dangerous for any democracy, but it is especially unmerited in a democracy of Brazil's caliber, which for decades has shown itself capable of facilitating peaceful transfers of power."The Biden administration has been low-key in public statements on Bolsonaro, and Blinken met last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Franca.A State Department official said the meeting was largely to encourage the climate-skeptic Bolsonaro to raise ambitions ahead of a high-stakes UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, with Brazil a crucial player for the planet due to the Amazon's role as a carbon sink.Bolsonaro, whose approval rating has tanked in part due to Brazil's severe Covid-19 outbreak, has said he will not stage a coup although some supporters have called on the military to intervene to keep him in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-warn-brazil-s-jair-bolsonaro-on-democracy-101632872973900.html
29-09-2021||World||US general defends calls made to China||General Mark Milley, head of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the two calls that he had made to his Chinese counterparts in the final weeks of the Trump administration were a normal part of his job and were coordinated with the acting defence secretary and other senior officials.There were fears that former president Donald Trump could start a war with China. That was the context of the call in October 2020. Then a second call took place two days after the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters.“I know, I am certain, President Trump did not intend on attacking the Chinese, and it is my directed responsibility to convey presidential orders and intent,” Milley told the Senate armed services committee on Tuesday, referring to a call he had made on October 30, 2020.“My job at that time was to de-escalate,” Milley said, adding that “at secretary of defence [Mark] Esper’s direction, I made a call to General Li on October 30. Eight people sat in the call with me, and I read out the call within about 30 minutes of the call ending”.Milley also told lawmakers at the hearing that there’s a need to “fully examine” the role played by Pakistan in granting sanctuary to Afghan players, echoing US secretary of state Antony Blinken who recently said that ties with Islamabad, a major non-Nato ally (MNNA) of the US, were being reviewed because of its role in Afghanistan.“We need to fully examine the role of Pakistan sanctuary,” Milley said on the US decision to pull out of Afghanistan. The US general brought up Pakistan’s role in the context of factors that turned Afghanistan into America’s longest war.Milley said the Taliban “remains a terrorist organisation” that hasn’t broken ties with Al-Qaeda. He warned that a reconstituted Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan with aspirations to attack the United States was “a very real possibility” - perhaps in as little as a year.He called the 20-year war in Afghanistan a “strategic failure” and said he believes the US should have kept several thousand troops in the country to prevent the Taliban takeover that happened faster than predicted.Also testifying at Tuesday’s hearing was US defence secretary Lloyd Austin. He defended the Afghan evacuation process as “the largest airlift conducted in US history”, but conceded there were problems. “Was it perfect? Of course not.”Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, especially the sanctuary enjoyed on its territory by the Taliban and Haqqani Network operatives, has come under fresh scrutiny. Some lawmakers want Pakistan’s status as an MNNA to be rescinded.A new report by the Congressional Research Service says Pakistan continues to serve as the “base of operation and/or target” of 15 terror groups including the Taliban and the Haqqani Network that are ruling Afghanistan now, and five that have been focused on India.The report warns of “a resurgence of regional terrorism and militancy” in the wake of the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in Kabul, 20 years after they were toppled by a US-led offensive. The India-centred groups on the list are Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which were behind most terror attacks in recent years. The three others are Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, Harakat-ul-Mujahideen and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-fully-examine-pakistan-s-role-in-afghanistan-us-general-mark-milley-101632853569411.html
