All reported 20 positive Covid-19 cases were from Xianyou county, the largest county in Putian.Preliminary analysis of the Covid strain shows the outbreak was triggered by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The new cluster comes weeks after China contained the July wave of the Delta variant that had spread across the country, the worst since the Wuhan outbreak in 2020.The new cases have been linked to a Chinese national who returned from Singapore last month. At least six infections have been traced back to him. Hundreds of contacts including children in an elementary school have been isolated.Six people from two families were first to test positive on Friday, including three children aged between 10 and 12 years.Villages in Xianyou, where confirmed cases were found, have been sealed, a state media report said.The county’s Fengting town has been designated as a Covid-19 high-risk area after new local infections were reported, news agency Xinhua reported.The Covid-19 response headquarters of Xianyou has advised residents to work from home and wear masks on public transportation, and has banned large gatherings.“The operations of the county’s indoor entertainment venues, such as museums and movie theatres, have been suspended. Also, customer flow has been restricted in supermarkets and other essential services providers,” the report said.Putian authorities announced the suspension of inter-city and inter-province bus services until further notice. Cinemas, card rooms, gyms, tourist sites and other facilities in Putian have been shut down. Restaurants and supermarkets have been told to “strictly control” customer numbers and to check for fever.The national health commission (NHC) has deployed a work team to Fujian to guide local epidemic control.“The city government of Putian reported the viral genome sequencing of 19 relevant cases in the outbreak has preliminarily identified the strains as the highly infectious Delta variant,” the Xinhua report added.The mainland on Sunday also reported 26 new imported cases for Saturday, including 11 in Yunnan, six in Guangdong, three in Shanghai, two in Inner Mongolia, and one each in Tianjin, Liaoning, Fujian and Henan.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland stood at 95,199 until Saturday, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636.Meanwhile, China has administered a total of 2.14 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of September 11, data from the NHC showed on Sunday.More than 969 million Chinese people, which is about 69% of the country’s population, were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of September 7, the NHC said last week.China aims to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus disease by the end of this year. China’s top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan told state media in August that the country would need more than 80% of the population to be fully inoculated to achieve that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-outbreak-hits-eastern-china-putian-city-sealed-off-travel-restricted-101631469923179.html

It is the highest diplomatic level delegation to visit the Afghan capital since the Taliban announced their interim Cabinet.Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted Sunday about the high-level delegation, saying it included Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdur Rahman Al-Thani, the deputy prime minister who is also Qatar’s foreign minister.He met with Taliban Prime Minister Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund.

Tehran has agreed to allow the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to install new memory cards into surveillance cameras at its sensitive nuclear sites and continue the recording. The announcement comes after a meeting between IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi and the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) in Tehran.“IAEA's inspectors are permitted to service the identified equipment and replace their storage media which will be kept under the joint IAEA and AEOI seals in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The way and the timing are agreed by the two sides,” Grossi and Eslami said in a joint statement.In 2015, the US, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France entered a deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). But the Donald Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran as a part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. The negotiations over the US and Iran returning to the nuclear deal continue to be stalled in Vienna. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic is enriching small amounts of uranium as the country’s stockpile grows.While Iran has agreed to allow filming the sensitive nuclear sites, it continues to hold all recordings at its sites. In a confidential quarterly report, the UN atomic agency had sounded the alarm bell over Iran's repeated refusal to let inspectors access the monitoring equipment. Eslami said that the memory cards are sealed and kept in Iran “according to the routine.” “New memory cards will be installed in cameras. That is a routine and natural trend in the agency’s monitoring system,” he added.Terming the agreement a “very constructive result”, Grossi said that it has to do with the continuity of the operation of the IAEA’s equipment in Iran. It "is indispensable for us to provide the necessary guarantee and information to the IAEA and to the world that everything is in order.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-memory-cards-but-no-access-to-footage-iran-s-deal-with-un-atomic-agency-101631457466578.html

The same perception helped Zabiuallah stay right under the nose of the US and the Afghan forces in Kabul for years. It is his secret recce that might have given an edge to the Taliban against the Afghanistan army, the Taliban leader has proudly admitted in an exclusive interview with The Express Tribune.“I lived in Kabul for a long time, right under everyone’s noses. I roamed the width and breadth of the country. I also managed to have first-hand access to the frontlines, where the Taliban carried out their actions, and up to date information. It was quite puzzling for our adversaries," Mujahid told.'Pakistan our second home, there is peace in Afghanistan': Taliban spokespersonMujahid told that he escaped so many times from the US and Afghan national forces that they started believing that Zabuillah Mujahid is just a ghost, a made-up character, and not a real person.The 43-year-old Taliban leader said he never left Afghanistan. He had travelled to many places to attend seminaries, even to Pakistan, but never thought of leaving the country forever, despite being under the constant man-hunt of the US and the Afghan forces. The US forces used to pay local people a good amount of money to know about his whereabouts but he somehow managed to escape their radar, the spokesperson added.Recounting his childhood, the spokesperson told The Express Tribune that he was enrolled at a normal school at the very beginning but was soon shifted to a madrassa and was on the path of religious education. He also stayed at Haqqani seminary in Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. He joined the Taliban at the age of 16 years and never saw founder Mullah Umar.About the popular perception about his 'non-existence, he confirmed that Zabiullah is his actual name. "Mujahid, however, is something my seniors in the Tehreek started calling me," he said.After the Taliban captured Kabul, the group attempted to project a moderate image and a press meet was called which was addressed by Zabiuallah. Over time, the group also claimed that the Taliban leaders will not remain in theshadows as they did during the previous regime. Consequently, several leaders came before the press, answered questions and now that the interim cabinet has been formed, the Taliban are looking for international recognition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-right-under-their-nose-in-kabul-taliban-spokesperson-divulges-how-he-fooled-us-afghan-forces-101631451875748.html

Under international law, submarines passing off the coast of another country are required to surface and show a national flag inside territorial waters.Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force sent three reconnaissance aircraft and two destroyers to the area for early warning and information gathering to analyze China’s intentions.A submarine believed to be Chinese also was spotted in the area in June 2020.China has defended its maritime activities and says it has the right to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.Japan, alarmed by China's growing naval activities in the East and South China seas, has been stepping up defense in the country’s southwestern regions and islands north of the disputed islands.Tokyo says it opposes China's unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the region, and regularly protests the Chinese coast guard’s growing presence near the disputed islands. Japanese officials say Chinese vessels routinely violate Japanese territorial waters around the islands, sometimes threatening fishing boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-detects-suspected-china-submarine-near-southern-island-101631436812947.html

According to the Xinhua News Agency, local officials in Putian in eastern China’s Fujian province have said residents must not leave the city without good reason such as seeking medical treatment. They must have proof of a negative coronavirus test within the past 48 hours, the city government announced.China’s National Health Commission sent a special team to Putian after Covid-19 cases were reported, according to broadcaster CGTN. The commission said in a statement on Sunday that China recorded 20 new local cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, all from Fujian and including 19 in Putian. The officials in the province have also found 18 asymptomatic cases, 17 of which were in Putian, according to the statement. The new outbreak in Putian comes less than a month after China quelled its most widespread resurgence of the coronavirus since the initial Wuhan outbreak.The official Global Times newspaper reported that the first Covid-19 cases in Putian were students from Xianyou County, but experts suspect the outbreak might have originated with the father of one student who returned from Singapore on August 4.The traveller, identified by the surname Lin, underwent a 14-day quarantine and nine nucleic acid and serologic tests, all of which were negative, the Global Times said, citing local authorities in Putian. It said he tested positive on Friday.Cinemas, card rooms, gyms, tourist sites and other facilities in Putian were ordered to be closed, the city government announced. Restaurants and supermarkets were told to “strictly control” customer numbers and to check for fever. Schools were ordered to require students to wear masks in class.China has reported 4,636 deaths out of 95,199 confirmed cases of Covid-19.

Now refugees in alien shores far away from their native land, football remains the only constant that these women hold dear to their hearts, and the flash of hope that perhaps, one day, all will be okay.“Football is like food to me,” The New York Times quoted 21-year-old Susan as saying. The former captain of a women's soccer team from Afghanistan has also been the subject of a 2017 documentary – ‘Herat Football Club’. The publication only mentioned the first name of the sportswoman, to protect her identity from potential attack by the Taliban, which have been known to track down their targets.Also Read | No ‘future’ for women under Taliban: Former Afghan football player after fleeingSusan is one of the three members of the Afghan soccer team who arrived in Rome days after the Taliban laid siege to Herat, all thanks to the help provided by two Italian journalists, a Florence-based NGO, several lawmakers, and officials from Italy. Part of a group of 16 who transited from Herat through a tent camp run by the Italian Red Cross, Susan was also accompanied by her coach and her family on the journey. In a series of interviews with the NYT, Susan mentioned that the fear that she might never be able to play football again under the Taliban regime made her feel as though she was “dead”.Read the entire interview and more here.Historically, the Taliban have never been known to be appreciative of women's liberties, but the newly installed regime is looking to forbid women from participating in sports altogether, the conservative outfit's reasoning being that their bodies might be seen. Referring to the sport of cricket, a deputy head of the Taliban's cultural commission told Australian public broadcaster SBS, “It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it.”“Islam and the Islamic Emirate do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed,” he added.Also Read | No one knows what the future of Afghan sports will beThe hardline regime's decisions are betraying the group's former commitments that it would be more open towards accepting women's rights, and a Taliban spokesperson even went as far ahead recently as to proclaim that women cannot even play a role in governing a nation; instead, he said, women in Afghanistan should just “give birth”.Female athletes, who once aspired to compete at the international level, have resorted to hiding or attempting to flee Afghanistan, a grave situation that could threaten the nation's standing in the sports world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-foreign-shores-football-empowers-the-afghan-women-who-escaped-taliban-clutch-101631418545222.html

The IAEA and Iran's envoy to the agency said he would meet the new head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami.Grossi is expected to hold a news conference at Vienna airport around 8:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) after returning later on Sunday, the IAEA said.The IAEA informed member states this week that there had been no progress on two central issues: explaining uranium traces found at several old, undeclared sites and getting urgent access to some monitoring equipment so the agency can continue to keep track of parts of Iran's nuclear programme as provided for by the 2015 deal.Separate, indirect talks between the United States and Iran on both returning to compliance with the deal have been halted since June. Washington and its European allies have been urging hardline president Ebrahim Raisi's administration, which took office in August, to return to the talks.Under the 2015 deal between Iran and major powers, Tehran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, re-introducing painful economic sanctions. Iran responded as of 2019 by breaching many of the deal's core restrictions, like enriching uranium to a higher purity, closer to that suitable for use in nuclear weapons.Western powers must decide whether to push for a resolution criticising Iran and raising pressure on it for stonewalling the IAEA at next week's meeting of the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors. A resolution could jeopardise the resumption of talks on the deal as Tehran bristles at such moves.Countries on the IAEA Board of Governors will be watching Grossi's visit to see whether Iran yields either on granting access to the monitoring equipment to service it or offers the prospect of answers on the uranium particles found at the undeclared former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-nuclear-watchdog-chief-in-iran-set-to-ease-showdown-with-the-west-101631422625263.html

US-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the online activity of jihadist groups, reported that al-Zawahiri spoke on a number of issues, including a raid on a Russian military base, in the new hour-long video released by al Qaeda. Rita Katz, SITE’s director, noted that al-Zawahiri made no mention of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Katz pointed out al-Zawahiri was shown in the video even though reports last November claimed he had died. He last appeared in a video message for the group on the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.In June this year, a United Nations report said that a significant part of the al Qaeda leadership resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region, including al-Zawahiri, who is “probably alive but too frail to be featured in propaganda”. "One member state reports that he is probably alive but too frail to be featured in propaganda,” the UN report said, without identifying the country.“Amid rumors of his death, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri shown in new 60-minute video, this time offering some evidence that he is not dead--particularly, reference to events after December, when rumors of death surfaced. (A speech from March offered no such proof),” Katz said in a series of tweets. “Event Zawahiri referenced was a raid on a Russian military base by the al-Qaeda-aligned Hurras al-Deen in Syria, which it claimed on Jan 1 (after rumors/reporting of his death surfaced in Nov). Also introduces Zawahiri with "May Allah Protect Him”,” she added.

Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, the prime minister of the Taliban interim government, hoisted the banner in a low-key ceremony on Saturday, said Ahmadullah Muttaqi, multimedia branch chief of the group cultural commission.The Taliban announced an interim government earlier this week and the all-male, all-Taliban government was met with disappointment by the international community which had hoped the hardline Islamist group would keep an earlier promise of an inclusive cabinet. The Taliban formed the interim "Islamic Emirate" and named hardliners in its new government, who oversaw the 20-year fight against the US-led military coalition, and it was dominated by members of the group's old guard, with no women.Also watch | Why Taliban cancelled oath-taking ceremony of its government on 9/11 anniversary

12-09-2021||World||FBI releases newly declassified record on September 11 attacks||The FBI late Saturday released a newly declassified 16-page document related to logistical support provided to two of the Saudi hijackers in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The document describes contacts the hijackers had with Saudi associates in the US but offers no evidence the Saudi government was complicit in the plot.The document, released on the 20th anniversary of the attacks, is the first investigative record to be disclosed since President Joe Biden ordered a declassification review of materials that for years have remained out of public view.Biden had encountered pressure in recent weeks from victims' families, who have long sought the records as they pursue a lawsuit in New York alleging that senior Saudi officials were complicit in the attacks.The Saudi government has long denied any involvement. The Saudi Embassy in Washington said Wednesday that it supported the full declassification of all records as a way to “end the baseless allegations against the Kingdom once and for all.”The embassy said that any allegation that Saudi Arabia was complicit was “categorically false.”Biden last week ordered the Justice Department and other agencies to conduct a declassification review of investigative documents and release what they can over the next six months. The 16 pages were released on Saturday night, hours after Biden attended September 11 memorial events in New York, Pennsylvania and northern Virginia.Victims' relatives had earlier objected to Biden's presence at ceremonial events as long as the documents remained classified.The heavily redacted record released Saturday describes a 2015 interview with a person who was applying for US citizenship and years earlier had repeated contacts with Saudi nationals who investigators said provided “significant logistical support” to several of the hijackers.The documents are being released at a politically delicate time for the US and Saudi Arabia, two nations that have forged a strategic -- if difficult -- alliance, particularly on counterterrorism matters. The Biden administration in February released an intelligence assessment implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the 2018 killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi but drew criticism from Democrats for avoiding a direct punishment of the crown prince himself.Regarding September 11, there has been speculation of official involvement since shortly after the attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis. Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida at the time, was from a prominent family in the kingdom.The US investigated some Saudi diplomats and others with Saudi government ties who knew hijackers after they arrived in the US, according to documents that have already been declassified.Still, the 9/11 Commission report found “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded” the attacks that al-Qaida masterminded. But the commission also noted “the likelihood” that Saudi government-sponsored charities did.Particular scrutiny has centered on the first two hijackers to arrive in the US, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. In February 2000, shortly after their arrival in southern California, they encountered at a halal restaurant a Saudi national named Omar al-Bayoumi who helped them find and lease an apartment in San Diego, had ties to the Saudi government and had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.

12-09-2021||World||She was one of the last US Marines killed in Afghanistan. Now brought home, 20 years after 9/11||US Marine Sergeant Johanny Rosario returned to her hometown in Massachusetts in a casket on Saturday, one of the last American soldiers killed in Afghanistan during a war set in motion exactly two decades ago by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.Several hundred people gathered near the Farrah Funeral Home in Lawrence, Mass., where Rosario's remains arrived in a black hearse with a police motorcycle escort. Marines in dress uniform carried the casket into the funeral home, as veterans in the crowd, some of whom had not worn a uniform in years, snapped to attention."We came out because she is a hero to us," said Mary Beth Chosse, who waited for several hours with her 12-year-old son, Gavin. Chosse's older son is a Marine on active duty. "Sergeant Rosario's sacrifice and bravery should always be remembered."Rosario, 25, was among 13 US service members killed last month in a suicide bombing outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan's capital Kabul. She was helping to screen evacuees at a checkpoint at the airport's Abbey Gate when the bomb ripped through a crowd.About 7,100 US military personnel have been killed in conflicts tied to the Sept. 11 attacks, with about 2,500 of those deaths happening in Afghanistan, according to the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute. The financial cost of those conflicts runs to nearly $6 trillion, according to the project.Like many Americans, Sheila Arias, 41, remembers Sept. 11, 2001, in vivid detail. She was at a hair salon in Lawrence when she watched the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center collapse after al Qaeda hijackers seized control of two airplanes and crashed them into the buildings. Hijacked airplanes would also crash into the Pentagon outside Washington and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.Arias soon after enlisted in the US Army, leaving a comfortable, steady job as a clerk in Lawrence's water department to join the military effort to root out al Qaeda."There was no question that I had to serve," Arias said. "I'm sure Johanny Rosario felt the same way."‘Always remember her name’Rosario, who was 5-years-old when the attacks occurred, would begin her service years later when the United States was already deeply involved in Afghanistan.Shortly after graduating from high school in 2014, she enlisted and landed with the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.Eventually, she would become a supply chief, a role usually held by a more senior noncommissioned officer, according to the Marines, and volunteered to be a member of the female engagement team to interact with Afghan women, barred by local custom from talking to male strangers.Just three months before her death, she was recognized with an award for her attention to detail and expertise in tracking and reconciling some $400,000 worth of open supply requisitions.On Saturday, a group of her friends from Lawrence High School huddled near the steps of the funeral home. Wearing black face masks, they spoke of Rosario's desire to serve her country, take college courses and financially support her family.One of the women, who like the others declined to give her name, cradled a framed picture of Rosario in a formal gown."I can't talk. I would just cry," the woman said.Like many residents in Lawrence, a working-class city about 30 miles (48 km) north of Boston with a strong Hispanic community, Rosario's roots extend to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, said William Lantigua, a former mayor of the city who knows her family.Rosario is survived by her mother and a younger sister.On Saturday, Maria Ogando joined the crowd gathered to pay tribute to Rosario after driving an hour from Worcester, Massachusetts with her family. Her daughter, 9-year-old Kayla, wore a T-shirt with Rosario's full name on the back."She is a hero and it is very sad for me to see her pass away," Kayla said. "But I will always remember her name and what she did for our country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-was-one-of-the-last-us-marines-killed-in-afghanistan-now-brought-home-20-years-after-911-101631410023009.html

"But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit.""And it is our continuing duty to confront them," he added.Bush's speech at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, came eight months after violent insurrectionists breached the US Capitol on January 6, CNM reported.The former Republican President has been outspoken about condemning the violent mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day."This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic -- not our democratic republic," he said in a statement at the time, adding that he was "appalled by the reckless behaviour of some political leaders since the election."His remarks come on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack, which left nearly 3,000 people dead.Meanwhile, a moment of silence was observed on Saturday at a memorial in Lower Manhattan to mark the 9/11 terror attack.US President Joe Biden was joined by former President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in Lower Manhattan for the ceremony at the National September 11th Memorial, CNN reported.Family members of the victims read the names of all their relatives at the National September 11th Memorial to honour them.Last year, the annual name-reading ceremony was altered due to the coronavirus pandemic, with prerecorded names played over speakers to avoid contact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-former-president-bush-calls-on-americans-to-confront-violent-extremists-101631411192321.html

Fars reported on Saturday that rumours about Massoud, the son of late former Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, leaving Afghanistan for Turkey or any other place are false and the resistance leader is said to be in a safe place.The Taliban have said that they have captured the Afghan province of Panjshir, the last resistance stronghold in the country, a claim denied by the National Resistance Front (NRF) led by Massoud and former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has declared himself caretaker president. Panjshir was the last Afghan province holding out against the Taliban who swept to power last month and have now declared an interim government. The NRF said that the resistance forces are present at all strategic positions across the valley to continue the fight."In recent days, the Taliban entered Panjshir and now 70 per cent of the main streets and passages are under their control, but the valleys of Panjshir are still under the complete control of the popular forces," Qassem Mohammadi, who is said to be close to Massaoud, was quoted as saying by Fars.Also read | 'His body should rot': Taliban after killing Amrullah Saleh's brotherAhmad Massoud last Monday called for a "national uprising" against the Taliban in an audio message sent to media. “Wherever you are, inside or outside, I call on you to begin a national uprising for the dignity, freedom and prosperity of our country," Ahmad Massoud said, according to Al Jazeera.Last Wednesday, the ousted Afghan government's ambassador to Tajikistan said Ahmad Shah Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have not fled Afghanistan and their resistance forces are still fighting the Taliban. Zahir Aghbar, envoy to Dushanbe under the government of ousted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, said he was in regular contact with Saleh and that the resistance leaders were out of general communication for security reasons.Also read | Pak NSA wants world to engage with Taliban, warns about ‘cost' of abandonment"Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have not fled to Tajikistan.

He will also meet private sector leaders to discuss efforts to raise global climate ambition and speed India's clean energy transition, the US state department said in a statement on Saturday.During Kerry's visit, India and the US will launch the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (CAFMD). This is one of the two main tracks of the US-India Agenda 2030 Partnership that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April this year.The state department statement said that Kerry's visit will bolster the US bilateral and multilateral climate efforts ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held from October 31 to November 12, 2021, in Glasgow, United Kingdom.On August 24, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav called Kerry, during which both sides agreed that India and the US will engage for a constructive engagement under the India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership.Last month, PM Modi announced the India-US climate and clean energy partnership to help mobilise investments and enable green collaborations. "As a climate-responsible developing country, India welcomes partners to create templates of sustainable development in India. These can also help other developing countries, who need affordable access to green finance and clean technologies," PM Modi said at the virtual Leaders' Summit on Climate hosted by the US in August.The US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership expects bilateral cooperation on strong actions in the current decade to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As a part of the Paris Agreement, India plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35 per cent from its 2005 levels by 2030 and have 40 per cent of its total installed power generation capacity from renewables by 2030, reports news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-climate-envoy-john-kerry-in-india-for-3-days-clean-energy-transition-in-agenda-101631405465899.html
12-09-2021||World||UAE lifts restrictions on entry of fully vaccinated residents from India, other countries from today||The UAE will lift its restrictions on entry for fully vaccinated residents from Sunday. On Friday, the United Arab Emirates said that it will allow the return of those vaccinated fully with WHO-approved Covid-19 jabs and holding valid residence visas from 15 nations previously on the suspended list, including India. Passengers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, South Africa, Nigeria, and Afghanistan can now enter the UAE.The decision to lift the travel ban comes as Dubai is preparing to open the Expo 2020 world fair on October 1 after a year-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) in a tweet shared an official statement and said that those who can return also include those who stayed abroad for over six months."UAE allows return of fully vaccinated (WHO-approved vaccines) holders of valid residence visa, including those who stayed abroad for over six months, starting from September 12, 2021," the statement reads.Last week, the UAE announced to resume tourist visas for fully vaccinated travelers. This came as the daily number of Covid-19 positive cases continued to drop in the nation, having gone lower than 1,000 since last week, reports AFP.Here's what is required for arrival:1. The NCEMA said that passengers can apply via the website of the Federal Authority For Identity and Citizenship (ICA) and complete the vaccination application in order to get the necessary approval in addition to presenting the approved vaccination certification upon departure for the UAE.2. The passengers are also required to present a negative PCR test result done within 48 hours before the departure at an approved lab that has a QR code. However, children under 16 years are exempted from these procedures, it said.3. Travelers who wish to receive the benefits provided to individuals vaccinated in the UAE, like visiting malls and public spaces in Abu Dhabi, can register their vaccination via the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship platform or Al Hosn application.4. All other previously announced precautionary measures for unvaccinated people coming from those nations remain in place, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-lifts-restrictions-on-entry-of-fully-vaccinated-residents-from-india-other-countries-from-today-101631403520693.html

At 10.03am, they remembered the fourth plane to crash in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers fought the hijackers. At 10.28am, it was when the North Tower started falling.Bruce Springsteen sang I’ll See You in My Dreams in New York, while, smaller ceremonies took place across the country.US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden were joined at the New York memorial service by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and their first ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama respectively. Heart-wrenching commemorations also took place at the Pentagon and Shanksville, where former president George W Bush, who was president at the time of the attacks and subsequently launched the Afghanistan war said the unity America showed following the attacks “seems distant” today.Ahead of Saturday’s commemorations, Biden said in a six-minute message from the White House on Friday calling for “national unity”. “In the days that followed September 11, 2001, we saw heroism everywhere. We also saw something all too rare: national unity,” he said in the video message.“Unity is what makes us who we are, America at its best,” Biden said. “To me, that’s the central lesson of September 11th.”Biden then flew to Shanksville, Pennsylvania where he was to lay a wreath. He was slated later on Saturday to return to the Washington area to visit the Pentagon, the symbol of US military might that was pierced by another of the planes that were used as missiles that day.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20th-anniversary-of-9-11-six-moments-of-silence-reflection-101631401294302.html
12-09-2021||World||In Kabul airstrike, US hit aid worker not IS fighters||A video analysis shows the US may have mistakenly targeted an aid worker rather than Islamic State fighters in its final strike in Afghanistan which killed 10 civilians, The New York Times said on Friday.The Pentagon has said it disrupted a new attack planned by the Islamic State extremist group through a Reaper drone strike on August 29 - the day before US troops ended their 20-year mission and following a devastating attack outside the Kabul airport that killed more than a 100 people.But Kabul resident Aimal Ahmadi earlier told AFP that the strike killed 10 civilians including his small daughter, nephews, nieces and his brother Ezmarai Ahmadi, who was driving the car that was struck after he parked.The New York Times, analysing security camera footage, said the US military may have been seeing the slain Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water, which was in short supply after the collapse of the Western-backed government, and picking up a laptop for his boss.Ezmarai Ahmadi was an electrical engineer for the California-based aid and lobbying group Nutrition and Education International and himself was among thousands of Afghans who had applied for resettlement in the United States, relatives said.US officials say that a larger blast took place after the drone strike, showing that there were explosives in the vehicle.But the New York Times investigation said there was no evidence of a second explosion, with only one dent on a nearby gate and no clear signs of an additional blast such as blown-out walls. Commenting on the report, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that US Central Command “continues to assess” the strike but that “no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties”.“As Chairman (Mark) Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport,” Kirby said, referring to the top US general.The New York Times noted that a rocket attack the following morning, claimed by the Islamic State group, was carried out from a Toyota Corolla similar to Ahmadi’s.‘Taliban’s victory might embolden other groups’The Taliban’s victory might embolden other groups in different parts of the world, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned, expressing worry over global terrorism.He also asserted that dialogue with the militant group is “absolutely essential” as the UN wants the country to play a “constructive role” in international relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-kabul-airstrike-us-hit-aid-worker-not-is-fighters-101631401242918.html
12-09-2021||World||On 9/11 anniversary, Afghans blame departed US forces for their woes||War-weary residents of Kabul expressed anger and feelings of betrayal by the United States on Saturday, as the world marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that prompted a US invasion of Afghanistan and the toppling of its Taliban rulers.After a two-decade occupation, US forces abruptly pulled out of Afghanistan last month, triggering the collapse of its Western-backed government and the Taliban’s dramatic return to power.“The misfortunes we are currently experiencing are because of America,” said Abdul Waris, a Kabul resident. Some of the mostly young men who spoke to Reuters complained that US forces had not tried to help the Afghan people.“After the September 11 events took place, the Americans were in our country for 20 years for their own benefit,” said Jalil Ahmad.“They took the benefits they had in mind for 20 years while we did not get any benefit from them. They have left the country in a state of confusion.”Bearded Taliban fighters with guns slung over their shoulders were visible around the capital but the mood was quiet and calm following the dramatic changes of recent weeks.“Now there is security and security is good... May God give the Taliban more strength to maintain this (calm) forever,” said resident Gul Agha Laghmni.US forces toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks because they had provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. Since returning to power last month, the Taliban have appointed an acting cabinet including several former militants held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay.There were relatively few women on the streets of Kabul on Saturday, and all those who were out had their heads covered - a fact welcomed by residents such as Shah Raoof.“In the presence of America, there was a lot of commotion in our country. Women were unveiled,” he said.“The majority of our youth fled, a number were martyred and a number of others were afflicted by America through war and misery.”Taliban flag flies at presidential palaceThe Taliban flag waved over the Afghan presidential palace the same day the US and the world marked the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.The Taliban flag was raised on Friday and could be seen waving over the presidential palace in Kabul on Saturday. The militant group also painted their white backdrop flag on the wall of the US embassy building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-9-11-anniversary-afghans-blame-departed-us-forces-for-their-woes-101631401215703.html
