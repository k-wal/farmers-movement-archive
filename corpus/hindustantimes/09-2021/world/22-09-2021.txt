Yue reiterated China’s policy of not interfering in Afghanistan’s internal affairs to the Afghan side.Afghanistan should reach an open and inclusive political arrangement, implement moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, completely cut ties with various terror organisations, and get along with neighbouring countries, Yue conveyed to the Taliban leadership, Zhao said.The Taliban leadership emphasised that it attach great importance to the relations between Afghanistan and China, Russia and Pakistan. The three countries are playing a constructive and responsible role in consolidating peace and stability in Afghanistan, the Taliban said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-pak-chinese-russian-envoys-hold-talks-with-taliban-in-kabul-101632335378653.html

Macron and Biden will meet in Europe at the end of October."The two leaders agreed that the situation would have benefited from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners," the statement said. "President Biden conveyed his ongoing commitment in that regard."Washington also committed to boosting support for counter-terrorism missions led by European nations in Africa's Sahel region, Macron's office said.The United States "recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to NATO," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-to-send-envoy-back-to-us-france-says-after-biden-call-101632331341122.html

Researchers say lettuce, spinach can replace the traditional mRNA shots||It’s the end of 2021, which means more than two years of the world combatting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. While several anti-Covid vaccines have come up and vaccination is underway across the globe, they come with their set of challenges.Aimed at addressing such challenges, scientists of the University of California, Riverside are currently studying the possibility of transforming edible plants into mRNA (Messenger RNA) technology vaccines against Covid-19.According to a press release issued by the university, mRNA vaccines come with the mandate of being kept in a cold environment for their stability to be maintained during transport and storage. Coronavirus vaccines based on this technology, including Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, function by teaching the human body cells to identify and safeguard the system against infectious ailments.What plants are the scientists using?The UC Riverside scientists of this project aim to eradicate the mandate of keeping vaccines in cold conditions – as required by mRNA vaccines. The team is focusing on projecting three vital matters – first “DNA containing the mRNA vaccines can be successfully delivered into the part of plant cells;” second, edible plants can produce adequate mRNA just like a traditional jab; and third, determining the accurate dosage of the plant-based vaccines.“Ideally, a single plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person,” Associate professor in UC Riverside’s department of botany and plant sciences, and the head of the research, Juan Pablo Giraldo said.He is working with scientists from UC San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania.Also Read | India to not buy Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 vaccines as local production jumps: ReportGiraldo explained that the team is testing the plant-based vaccine approach with spinach and lettuce, with a long-term agenda of people growing these plants in their gardens. “Farmers could also eventually grow entire fields of it,” he added in the release.How are the scientists working?The primary element in this research, said Giraldo, is chloroplast – the small organs in plant cells that transform sunlight into energy for the plant to use. Giraldo explained that chloroplasts are “tiny, solar-powered factories” that produce sugar and other molecules.“They’re also an untapped source for making desirable molecules,” he added.Earlier, the lead researcher had shown, the release noted, that it’s possible for chloroplasts to express genes that are not a natural part of the plant. Giraldo and his colleagues did this independent research by sending foreign genetic material into plant cells inside a protective gear."Our idea is to repurpose naturally occurring nanoparticles, namely plant viruses, for gene delivery to plants," Nicole Steinmetz, a UC San Diego professor of nanoengineering said. "Some engineering goes into this to make the nanoparticles go to the chloroplasts and also to render them non-infectious toward the plants,” she was quoted as saying in the release.Why are the scientists working to produce plant-based mRNA vaccines?Giraldo said that having the opportunity to work towards creating edible plant-based mRNA vaccines is the “culmination of a dream.” He added that the goal behind his work in nanotechnology was to create “new technology solutions” not just for food but also for high-value products like pharmaceuticals.The lead researcher is separately co-leading another project pertaining to nanomaterials for delivering nitrogen – a fertiliser, directly to chloroplasts that are the most significant ingredient for plants to function. For this project, Giraldo and his team has received a grant of $1.6 million from the National Science Foundation to develop a targeted nitrogen delivery technology.“I’m very excited about all of this research,” Giraldo said, adding that he thinks it could have an enormous effect on the lives of people.Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation has also given a grant of $500,000 to Giraldo and his team for the plant-based mRNA vaccine manufacture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-researchers-studying-if-lettuce-spinach-can-be-turned-into-covid-vaccines-101632330028954.html
22-09-2021||World||Kabul's ‘ex-mayor’ comes to office every day; says he's not helping Taliban, can't escape duty||As the Taliban government in Afghanistan reportedly sacked the last remaining minister Waheed Majroh of the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government, 66-year-old Daoud Sultanzoy, the ‘former mayor' of Kabul, is counting his days in the office. Kabul has already got a new administrator, Taliban leader Hamdullah Nomani, but Daoud Sultanzoy remains the mayor as the post has not officially gone to Nomani. Sultanzoy is coming to the office every day and both Sultanzoy and Nomani are sharing the office space. A former US citizen, Daoud Sultanzoy was born in Kabul and fought against the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. A pilot by profession trained in the US, Daoud Sultanzoy returned to Afghanistan after 9/11 to help the post-Taliban government.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he shared about his peculiar situation in the Kabul administration. He was contacted a day after Kabul fell on August 15 by the Taliban who assured him of his security and his resumption of work soon after Kabul fell ensured that municipal works like trash collection, sanitisation go on uninterrupted. “This is a responsibility that you cannot throw away frivolously because you just say, ‘Oh, I don’t like these people’", he said adding that he is not involved in politics at all. "I am here because I am responsible to the people of Kabul, and I’ve decided to stick to it," he told WSJ.No country should ask us to form 'inclusive govt' in Afghanistan, says Taliban"The mayor’s unusual and precarious position exposes the complexities of Afghanistan’s transitional period, as well as the Taliban’s attempts to move from a brutal rural insurgency to a government that can manage a country of 40 million and run its modern cities such as Kabul, home to one in eight Afghans," the Wall Street Journal article commented.To contest in the 2014 presidential election, Daoud Sultanzoy relinquished his US passport though his wife, crowned Miss Afghanistan in 1972, and his children are in the US. They are very supportive of the decision that he took, Sultanzoy said.“I am not helping. I was assigned to serve this city, and I am still serving this city,” he said noting how he perceived a change in the Taliban. "I find them more tolerant. I am not saying I’ve met everybody, I am sure there are other elements. But the ones I have met are very polite, very understanding," he said.Kabul's new administrator Hamdullah Nomani told WSJ the leadership likes Daoud Sultanzoy and the political issues are not being considered. “Anyone who has served honestly and has a good record, and that includes the mayor, the deputy mayor and other directors, they are all our friends, we have not brought any change to these positions,” Nomani told.The Kabul municipality has recently asked its male workers to rejoin duties while the Taliban have asked the female workers to stay home.  The decision is of the Taliban leadership and Sultanzoy looks after day-to-day activities. For the last three months, Sultanzoy has not received any salary, first because the Ashraf  Ghani government delayed payment and now as the Taliban do not have funds to pay salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabuls-ex-mayor-come-to-office-every-day-says-he-s-not-helping-taliban-can-t-escape-duty-101632327561654.html
22-09-2021||World||'This is our homeland': Women plead for basic rights in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan||As the Taliban increasingly excludes women from public life in Afghanistan, some are determined to speak out despite the threat of retribution from the hardline Islamist group.The Taliban were notorious for their brutally oppressive rule from 1996 to 2001, when women were banned from going to school or work and only allowed to leave the house with a male chaperone.They have promised to change, saying they would respect women's rights within the framework of Islamic sharia law, but many remain sceptical.In Kabul -- the city that has seen the most change over the past 20 years -- some young women, such as activist Shaqaiq Hakimi, refuse to be forced into exile by a return to Taliban rule."I want to fight and regain the rights that they took from us. We don't need to go to another country. This is our homeland," she told AFP."If we are not forced to leave, then we won't go anywhere."The Taliban claim that blocks on women returning to work or girls going to secondary school will be lifted once new systems are established.But this is an echo of the early days of the last regime, which never allowed women to return.NGO worker Farkhunda Zahidbaig, 21, described how Taliban fighters entered her office to tell management that women employees should leave."After this, our boss made the decision that the rest of us shouldn't come to the office," she said."Women want to have a profession, but... they can't continue in their jobs. The Taliban have taken away their freedom to work."- 'We're afraid' -Shabana, who asked to not be identified, is fearful she will never find a job again.This would leave the 26-year-old unable to provide for loved ones."I am very worried because I was the sole breadwinner of the family," said the former employee of a Swedish organisation.Gains for women under the Western-backed government were largely confined to cities in the conservative country, but the Taliban have faced international censure for incrementally stripping them away.In the face of that criticism, the group pledged Tuesday to allow girls to return to school "as soon as possible" but did not provide a timeframe.Their all-male government has also shut down the former administration's ministry of women's affairs and replaced it with one that earned notoriety during their first stint in power for enforcing religious doctrine.On top of the pressures of unemployment, women now fear going outside alone."We're afraid that if we go out the Taliban might whip us or hit us," said Shabana, who was travelling around Kabul with her father."We can't even go to the bazaar alone."Hakimi said she would wait to see if the Taliban fulfil their promise to allow all Afghans to go back to work or school."I hope that they do just that."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-our-homeland-women-plead-for-basic-rights-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101632300918895.html

Washington-based Freedom House has published a report titled "Freedom on the Net 2021: The Global Drive to Control Big Tech" which claimed global internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive year.Myanmar, Belarus, and Uganda witnessed the greatest deteriorations in internet freedom amid electoral and constitutional crises. Myanmar reported a massive 14-point decline, the largest since the group started the documentation project. Myanmar’s military recently captured power in a coup and frequently shut down the internet to crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.On the other hand, Iceland, Canada and Germany were among the top 10 countries with greater internet freedom.The report has measured the level of internet freedom for 70 countries and assigns them numerical scores ranging from 100 (the freest nation) to zero (the least free). The report determines the level of internet freedom by examining three broad categories: obstacles to access; limits on content; and violations of user rights.Also Read: RTI filed on government use of 'facial recognition' in airports, Covid-19 vaccinationCountries with scores between 70 to 100 are designated as ‘Free’ on internet freedom status while those with points between 40 to 69 are designated as ‘Partly-free’. Countries scoring less than 39 are designated as ‘Not free’.China remained the world’s worst abuser of internet freedom for the seventh consecutive year and failed to score a single point in the ‘violation of user rights’ category. “The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is tightening its control over the state bureaucracy, the media, online speech, religious groups, universities, businesses, and civil society associations, and it has undermined its own already modest rule-of-law reforms,” the report says.Here’s the list of the top 10 countries with the highest level of internet freedom:Here’s the list of the top 10 countries with the lowest level of internet freedom:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-worst-abuser-of-internet-freedom-pakistan-in-top-10-report-101632324135388.html

The official also said that at some point, almost all children between 12 and 15 years of age would get infected by Covid-19 without vaccinations.“There is definitely substantial transmission happening in this age group. In fact, the age group we're talking about is the one in which the highest rate of transmission is currently occurring, as far as we can tell,” news agency Reuters quoted England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty as saying earlier in the day. The official made the remarks during a session with British lawmakers on the decision to administer Covid-19 vaccine to children in the 12 to 15 age group.Also read | ‘Looking at it urgently,’ says UK envoy on vaccine certification for IndiaComments from Whitty came two days after the UK expanded the scope of its vaccination program on Monday to include school children from 12 to 15 years of age. Earlier on September 14, UK’s top medical officers had recommended a single dose of the vaccine to all children in the age group to avoid disruption to their education. “I have accepted the recommendation from the Chief Medical Officers to expand vaccination to those aged 12 to 15 - protecting young people from catching Covid-19, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom,” UK health minister Sajid Javid had said following the recommendation.Meanwhile, Whitty said that while the vaccination programme is expected to cause some disruption to the schools, it would outweigh the disruptions that would be caused if the children were to be infected by Covid-19.“The great majority of children who have not currently had COVID are going to get it at some point,” he said. “It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk,” he further said.All children in the age group would be inoculated with one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine while the government is undecided on the second dose. However, vulnerable children in the age group were already eligible for the shots under the country’s vaccination program.Along with vaccinating school children, the UK has also planned to roll out booster doses for people above 50 years of age and those with weakened immune systems to check the transmission of the disease during the winters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-top-medical-official-warns-of-substantial-transmission-of-covid-19-among-children-101632323108541.html

This comes as the Pakistan Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the world should give more time to the Taliban. In an interview with the BBC, the Pakistan PM said the idea that women should not be educated is just not Islamic. "I think they will allow women to go to schools. It has nothing to do with religion," Imran Khan said.The Taliban have recently asked male students to join schools but said nothing about girl students, though universities have resumed classes for female students. The Taliban have dissolved the ministry for women and replaced it with their notorious 'vice and virtue' ministry, despite the commitment they made to uphold women's rights.Imran Khan says world should give Taliban more time, US misunderstood HaqqanisThe full Cabinet has also been announced with no woman minister which shows how the Taliban went back on their promise of giving equal rights to women.In an earlier interview with CNN, which was Imran Khan's first international interview after the Taliban takeover, Khan said Afghanistan's women are strong and they can assert their rights. It is wrong to think that they can be helped from outside, he had added.On Pakistan recognising the Taliban government, Imran Khan said that Pakistan will not take the decision individually. The decision will be taken only after consulting with other neighbours. "All neighbours will get together and see how they progress. Whether to recognise them or not will be a collective decision," Imran Khan said.Sooner or later, Afghanistan will have a civil war of the Taliban do not include all factions in the governance, Imran Khan said. "That would mean an unstable, chaotic, Afghanistan and an ideal place for terrorists. That is a worry," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-stopping-women-from-accessing-education-unislamic-101632320003294.html

22-09-2021||World||Hong Kong slyly tweaks language of security law, puts media at greater risk||Months after China imposed the draconian national security law on Hong Kong, the administration of the semi-autonomous region has quietly hardened the language of the terms of violations that were already vague. The city’s administration is now even planning to introduce new laws under Hong Kong’s Basic Law that will pave way for easily cracking down on dissenting voices. The proposals include ‘Fake news’ legislation, anti-doxxing law, and anti-sanctions law among others.Reports suggest that Hong Kong authorities, who were initially using the phrase “actions that “endanger national security", have quietly started using the term “contrary to the interests of national security”. While the phrase “endanger national security” appears more than 30 times in the national security law, "contrary to” has not been mentioned in the original legislation.The Hong Kong government has proposed ‘Fake news’ legislation months after officials and lawmakers started using the term ‘fake news’ in their press statements and in speeches. But they have not outlined any exact provisions for the law. The Asia Internet Coalition has even warned that tech giants may stop offering their services in the semi-autonomous region if anti-doxxing laws were used to target their employees.Article 7 of the Hong Kong Basic Law still requires the local government to pass its own law. The newly proposed Article 23 can do away with this obligation. China is also planning to extend the anti-sanctions law to Hong Kong. The law allows Beijing to deny visas, deport, or seize assets of those involved in formulating or complying with sanctions against China.These minor changes could provide greater ammunition to the government for harassing businesses and citizens as it increases compliance risk for companies operating from what is touted as global financial capital. The broadening of the language of terms of violations put more companies and people at the risk of being accused of security violations.Several pro-democracy activists, including Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, were arrested last year days after the implementation of the controversial law. The international community, especially the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, has often termed the legislation contrary to China's international obligations under the principles of the legally binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-slyly-tweaks-language-of-security-law-puts-media-at-greater-risk-101632308406740.html

Unless urgent action is taken, the country faces an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. Our visit allowed us to witness the immediate needs of the Afghan people first-hand and meet with stakeholders to define ways to urgently scale up our health response,” it added.Cuts in donor support to Sehetmandi health projectNoting that the lack of donor support to the country’s largest health project Sehetmandi, the WHO chief said that thousands of health facilities have been left without funding for medical supplies and salaries for health staff. Also, many such facilities have either shut down or reduced operations.Also read | WHO chief thanks Mansukh Mandaviya for resuming vaccine exports to COVAX pool“Only 17% of all Sehatmandi health facilities are now fully functional. This breakdown in health services is having a rippling effect on the availability of basic and essential health care, as well as on emergency response, polio eradication, and Covid-19 vaccination efforts,” the statement showed.Response to Covid-19 pandemic droppedThe WHO further said that nine out of the 37 Covid-19 hospitals in the country have closed and surveillance, testing and vaccinations against the disease have dropped.“In recent weeks, vaccination rates have decreased rapidly while 1.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in the country remain unused,” it said. It also called for swift action to achieve the national target of immunizing at least 20% of the population by the end of 2021.Polio remains endemicIn its statement, the WHO also said that Afghanistan remains one of two countries where polio is endemic. While there were 56 cases of wild poliovirus reported in 2020, this year only one such case has been reported.“There has never been a better time to eradicate polio. However, the polio programme will struggle to respond if the basic immunization infrastructure begins to collapse around it,” the WHO noted.It also offered to begin a country-wide, house-to-house polio vaccination campaign and also include measles and Covid-19 vaccinations in an integrated campaign, along with its partners.Assuring its investment in the health education of girls and women, the WHO said it would continue to support an extensive trauma programme including supplies for 130 hospitals and 67 blood banks in the country.Following the Taliban takeover, several news reports emerged of the militant group shutting healthcare facilities. In one instance, the Taliban banned the administration of Covid-19 jabs in Paktia province, earlier in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-brink-of-collapse-who-on-health-system-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-calls-for-urgent-action-101632307129750.html

This comes as a departure from the previous occasions when Pakistan denied the permission of President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Modi at least thrice following India's abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.A high-level delegation including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and top government officials are accompanying PM Modi to the US. Islamabad also denied permission when PM Modi was visiting the US and Germany and President Kovind was visiting Iceland.According to government sources quoted by ANI, India had sought permission from Pakistan regarding the usage of Pakistan's airspace for Prime Minister Modi's flight to the US, for which a nod was given by Islamabad. This comes after India permitted Pakistan PM Imran Khan's flight to use India's airspace when he was travelling to Sri Lanka.When did this airspace 'ban' come into force?In 2019, Pakistan had issued a statement refusing to allow PM Modi's flight "in view of the situation in (Jammu and) Kashmir and India's attitude, oppression and barbarity...and the violation of rights in the region"."We have decided not to give permission to the Indian prime minister and we have conveyed this decision to the Indian High Commission," Pakistan foreign ministry had said in a statement in 2019.After that, India registered a protest against Pakistan with International Civil Aviation Organisation on the denial.PM Modi's plane also decided to avoid Afghanistan airspace as the country had closed its airspace for any commercial use.In a statement just before leaving for the US, Modi said he will conclude his visit with an address at the United Nations General Assembly focusing on the pressing global challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic, the need to combat terrorism, climate change and other important issues. "I will be visiting the USA from 22-25 September 2021 at the invitation of His Excellency President Joe Biden of the United States of America. During my visit, I will review the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with President Biden and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest," the prime minister said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-pm-modi-s-flight-to-use-its-airspace-101632304546889.html

A security source told reporters unidentified gunmen opened fire at a checkpoint at Ghawchak district in Jalalabad from a rickshaw, killing all three bystanders. While confirming the attack, a Taliban official, however, denied any casualty of members of the outfit. It said all the three killed were civilians.Jalalabad province has been the main operating base for the Islamic State’s (IS) Afghanistan chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), for years during the Afghan government’s rule. The outfit has, however, not yet claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s attack.IS-K was behind the attack on Kabul airport about a month ago which killed more than 100 people, besides several other minors attacks over past few weeks.The IS-K and Talibans are both Sunni groups but they differ on critical issues of religion which leads to severe fighting between the two. The IS-K also carried out weekend attacks against the Taliban in Jalalabad via its propaganda arm Amaq. The group claimed responsibility for "three separate bomb attacks" targeting three "Taliban vehicles" in Jalalabad on Saturday, and another "bomb attack" Sunday on "a Taliban vehicle".The attack on Hamid Karzai International airport was perpetrated as strategic strikes against both the US and the Taliban, the American government told New York Times. US President Joe Biden cited IS-K and not Taliban as the reason for sticking to the original evacuation date for American troops from Afghan soil.“Everyday we say there is a new day that we know ISIS-K is going to target the airport and attack Americans as well as allies and innocent civilians,” Biden said during a press briefing in the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-taliban-fighters-among-three-killed-in-jalalabad-attack-report-101632300628931.html

22-09-2021||World||Myanmar town bordering India sees exodus as thousands flee fighting||Most of the population of a Myanmar town near the Indian border have fled after buildings were set ablaze by artillery amid fighting between militia forces opposed to military rule and the army, according to residents and media reports.About 10,000 people normally live in Thantlang in Chin State, but most had left to seek shelter in surrounding areas including some in India, a community leader said.Myanmar has been in turmoil since a government led by pro-democracy veteran Aung San Suu Kyi was toppled on Feb. 1, sparking nationwide anger, strikes, protests, and the emergence of anti-junta militia.During fighting between militia forces and the army last weekend, about 20 homes were set ablaze, with photographs on social media showing buildings engulfed in flames.Soldiers shot dead a Christian pastor who tried to extinguish a blaze, the Myanmar Now news portal reported, although state media disputed the report.The Global New Light of Myanmar said the death of the pastor was being investigated and that soldiers had been ambushed by about 100 "terrorists" and both sides exchanged fire.Militia fighters had overrun an army base earlier in September and the military responded with air strikes, said Salai Thang, a community leader, who said four civilians had been killed and 15 wounded in recent weeks.The Chin Defence Force, a militia opposed to the military, said in a statement 30 soldiers had been killed.Reuters could not independently confirm any of the claims and a military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.A relative of the dead pastor told Reuters that most people had fled the town, although a handful of households remained including about 20 children in an orphanage run by the pastor."The murder of a Baptist minister and bombing of homes in Thantlang, Chin State are the latest examples of the living hell being delivered daily by junta forces against the people of Myanmar," Thomas Andrews, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said in a message on Twitter this week.There has been an upsurge in bloodshed in areas like Chin State after the National Unity Government, a shadow underground administration set up by opponents of the military, declared an uprising on Sept. 7 and called on the new militia, known as People's Defence Forces (PDF), to target the junta and its assets.The attempts by the PDFs to take on the well-equipped army have often resulted in civilians being caught in cross fire and forced to flee.Community leader Salai Thang said he was deeply concerned about the displaced people who were sheltering in nearby villages and some in India's Mizoram state."Those refugees are now badly struggling for food and shelter," he said by telephone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-town-bordering-india-sees-exodus-as-thousands-flee-fighting-101632294971393.html
22-09-2021||World||Turkey to become last G-20 nation to ratify Paris climate accords||Turkey, the only G-20 country that’s not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, is preparing to seek parliamentary approval for the accord next month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday.Erdogan announced the decision in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a move that would end a years-long struggle over absolute emissions reduction targets.Turkey’s change of heart follows assurances from the UK, the host of the COP26 international climate change meeting, that ratification of the accord would not in itself require new financial contributions from Turkey or force it to make specific binding emission cuts or enact specific domestic policies. “That would be for Turkey to decide and we would want to work with Turkey to ensure these were realistic but ambitious,” state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Nick Bridge, the UK’s special envoy for climate change, as saying after a virtual meeting with Turkish officials in May. “We are one of the first countries to sign the Paris Climate Agreement. However, we have not yet put this agreement into effect due to the unfairness of obligations,” Erdogan told the UN before announcing Turkey’s decision. “We plan to submit the Paris Climate Agreement for the approval of our parliament next month, in line with the constructive steps to be taken and within the framework of our national contribution statement.”Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has a commanding a majority in the parliament together with its nationalist ally and is aiming to ratify the agreement before the COP26 meeting, which will run from October 31 to November 12 in Glasgow. “We envisage the ratification phase of the carbon-neutral targeted agreement, before the United Nations climate change conference, which will be held in Glasgow,” Erdogan said.As of now, Turkey is one of six signatory states that have not ratified the agreement also including Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, according to the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-to-become-last-g-20-nation-to-ratify-paris-climate-accords-101632292979033.html
22-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Jagmeet Singh’s NDP wins 25 seats, well short of expectations||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s clarion call to voters to avoid opting for smaller parties in the 2021 Canada elections - in what is called split-voting - seems to have dealt Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party (NDP) a blow. Tipped to win about 40 seats in the September 20 snap polls, the NDP settled for 25 – going up marginally from the 24 it had won in 2019. Jagmeet Singh and his NDP clearly failed to live up to their expectations in the just concluded Canada elections despite recording 17.7% of the vote share.The NDP will, however, return to its status of putting pressure on PM Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party to deliver on issues that the NDP pursues as the fourth largest party in the 338-seat House of Commons.Days before the Canada elections, Justin Trudeau and his main rival Erin O’Toole of the Conservative Party had both urged voters across the country to avoid backing smaller parties. Justin Trudeau and his Liberals won the election, but yet again settled for a minority government.Jagmeet Singh addressed a post-election press conference in Vancouver on Tuesday and said the NDP was “proud” of its electoral performance. “Despite our number, we were the most successful opposition party in the last parliament, and this parliament looks pretty much the same,” he said, according to CTV News.Jagmeet Singh said he had spoken to Justin Trudeau on Monday night and pointed that “we’ll not hesitate to provide support to get things done, and he knows my priorities”.However, the NDP was still unable to even become the third-largest party in the House of Commons. Just like it had done in 2019, the Bloc Quebecois won more seats this time as well, getting 34. That gives Justin Trudeau options in terms of turning to another party for support to pass key legislation.There was no immediate question of a leadership shake-up within the NDP even though the party failed to get near its 2015 seat share of 44.At different points during the campaign period for the 2021 Canada elections, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP was tipped to secure 20% vote share translating to 40 or more seats, according to surveys, but was unable to touch those figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-jagmeet-singh-s-ndp-wins-25-seats-well-short-of-expectations-101632292414962.html
22-09-2021||World||With eye on climate change, Xi Jinping makes new pledge at UNGA||With an eye on climate change, China will no longer build coal-power plants abroad, President Xi Jinping said early on Wednesday at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), reiterating his pledge that Beijing will seek to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and eventually achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.During his video address to the UNGA, Xi Jinping said Beijing, instead of building coal plants overseas, will support developing countries in the transition to green and low-carbon energy as part of the global effort to tackle climate change. The Chinese president did not share details on how China would go about implementing the policy but, if put in place, it would restrict financing of coal plants in developing countries, which largely depend on coal to meet their power needs.“China will strive to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals. China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” Xi said at the UNGA.“We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve green recovery and development,” the Chinese president said.Xi’s announcement at the UNGA followed similar moves by South Korea and Japan earlier this year, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US climate change envoy John Kerry have urged China to follow the lead of its Asian counterparts, Reuters reported.Kerry, who was in China earlier this month for climate change talks, welcomed Xi’s announcement, calling it a “great contribution” and a good beginning to efforts needed to achieve success at the October 31-November 12 COP26 UN conference in Glasgow, Scotland.“We’ve been talking to China for quite some period of time about this. And I’m absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision,” Kerry said.Belinda Schape of climate think tank E3G tweeted that China still hosts more than 50% of the world’s coal fleet, so Beijing still needs to “lend credibility” to its domestic climate targets and unveil a clear timeline for phasing coal out at home.China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, accounting for 28% of global emissions.According to a report published in late 2020, China cannot build more coal-fired power plants after 2020 as planned if it wants to honour its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060, keeping in mind climate change.The Chinese government’s plans to build more coal-fired power plants “contradicts” its carbon neutral targets, Draworld Environment Research Centre of Beijing and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland said in the 2020 report.The report pointed out that China has around 130GW redundant coal power capacity among the total coal-fired capacity of more than 1,000GW. “However, power industry players have advocated for an expansion to 1,300GW or even higher by 2030,” it said.QUAD, AUKUS, AFGHANISTANXi Jinping said in his UNGA remarks there was a need to “reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games,” a veiled reference to the US-led Quad forum of Australia, India and Japan seen as a means of pushing back against China’s rise.The Quad will have its first in-person meeting of the leaders of the member states in Washington on Friday.China had last week warned of an intensified arms race in the region after the US, Britain and Australia announced a new Indo-Pacific security alliance, dubbed Aukus, which will provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines.“Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm,” Xi Jinping told the UNGA, in what was possibly a reference to the situation in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of US troops.“Differences and problems among countries, hardly avoidable, need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect,” he said.“One country’s success does not have to mean another country’s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. We need to pursue dialogue and inclusiveness over confrontation and exclusion,” the Chinese president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-eye-on-climate-change-xi-jinping-makes-new-pledge-at-unga-101632290074580.html
22-09-2021||World||Covid-19: Direct passenger flights from India to Canada may resume on Sept 27||Direct flights from India to Canada may resume on September 27, but there’s a catch. The ongoing flight ban, in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic, would be lifted only on the basis of the results of Covid-19 tests conducted on arrival in Canada on passengers travelling from New Delhi on three flights on Wednesday.As a “first step”, Transport Canada said, all passengers on the three Air Canada flights from New Delhi on Wednesday will be tested for Covid-19 on arrival “to ensure that the new measures are working”.The India-to-Canada direct flight ban, which expired on September 21, has been extended by Transport Canada until the end of September 26.If a high number of positive Covid-19 results are found, the planned lifting of the flight ban on September 27 will be reconsidered. “Border and public health measures also remain subject to change as the epidemiological situation evolves,” Transport Canada said.Canada had banned direct flights from India in April as the Delta-driven second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic raged across the country.Also, there are additional conditions that will have to be fulfilled by travellers from India once the flight ban is lifted. Passengers will have to take a molecular test for Covid-19 from the Canada-approved Genestrings lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, and will only be allowed to board if the result is negative. That test will have to be taken “within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their direct flight to Canada”. Covid-19 tests from any other lab in India will not be recognised for travel to Canada.“We continue to remain engaged with our Canadian partners and to emphasise the importance of early resumption of normal air mobility,” India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, told HT.Meanwhile, rules for travellers from India via a third country remain the same. They will have to obtain a valid negative test result conducted within 72 hours of boarding a flight headed for a Canadian destination at the place of departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-direct-passenger-flights-from-india-to-canada-may-resume-on-sept-27-101632287794274.html

The city also ordered businesses like mahjong parlors, cinemas and gyms to shut. City authorities say residents must display a negative virus test to be able to leave for only essential travel.

The new Taliban regime is yet to be officially recognised by most nations, including India which has raised questions on the non-inclusive nature of its government. A number of its top ministers are blacklisted by the United Nations.The Saarc is a regional intergovernmental organisation of South Asian countries -- India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan was the latest entrant to the bloc in 2007.Pakistan is said to have initially agreed to an empty chair as a representative of the war-torn nation, but was not willing to let any official from the previous Ashraf Ghani-led government take part in the meeting. It had then proposed that a Taliban member may take part in the event that was scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York this week. Soon after, disagreement cropped up and the meeting of the bloc was eventually called off. Nepal was scheduled to host the talks.An official letter sent by the Saarc secretariat to the foreign ministries of the eight countries on Tuesday said it had received a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence from Nepal’s foreign ministry that stated the informal meeting of foreign ministers, which was to be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 25, “will not take place” because of the “lack of concurrence from all member states”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-wanted-taliban-to-represent-afghanistan-in-saarc-meeting-report-101632283752032.html

A new fissure has now emerged north of the original eruption site. At least 200 people were forced to flee their homes on Tuesday as a new fissure emerged in the erupting volcano on Spain's Canary Islands.The volcano on the island of La Palma erupted on Sunday after a week of seismic activity that progressed to a 3.8 magnitude quake.The new vent is 900 meters (3,000 feet) north of the Cumbre Vieja national park, where the volcano first erupted. It emerged after a 4.1 magnitude earthquake late Monday, the Involcan volcanology institute said.What has been the damage so far?Rivers of lava, as much as 6 meters high, rolled down hillsides, burning and crushing everything in their path and affecting nearly 400 farms.By Tuesday, lava had covered 103 hectares (about 260 acres) of terrain, according to the European Union's Earth Observation Program, Copernicus.So far, about 6,000 people on La Palma have been evacuated, and 183 houses have been damaged, government spokeswoman Isabel Rodriguez said after a Cabinet meeting in Madrid.No casualties have been reported.When will lava reach the sea?Molten lava was expected to reach the sea by Monday, but its speed has slowed down. By Tuesday morning, the white-hot mass of molten rock, with a temperature of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,830 degrees Fahrenheit), had still not reached the western coast.Volcanologist Stavros Meletlidis said it was not clear when it would reach the sea because its speed was "very variable.""It can accelerate very quickly, especially when the topography changes ... or it can stop on a plain for several hours. You have to see how both the main flow and the secondary flow are developing," he said.Experts warn that, when lava reaches the sea, it will generate clouds of toxic gas.How has the government reacted?Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the crisis management on La Palma "does not end when the lava reaches the sea.""It will end when we rebuild all the damage caused by the eruption of the volcano," Sanchez said, pledging to stand with those affected.Authorities are seeking financial aid from the EU to help rebuild, said Angel Victor Torres, the head of the Canary Islands regional government.Torres said the damage already amounted to more than €400 million ($470 million), qualifying the region for emergency EU aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canary-islands-volcano-new-vent-opens-more-people-flee-101632280213541.html

China demanded last month that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador in Beijing and said it would recall its envoy to Vilnius after Taiwan announced that its mission in Lithuania would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office.Taiwanese missions in Europe and the United States use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding a reference to the island itself, which China claims as its own territory. US president Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to Lithuania's prime minister Ingrida Simonyte last week and stressed support for her country in the face of pressure from China.The National Cyber Centre's report also said the Xiaomi phone was sending encrypted phone usage data to a server in Singapore. A security flaw was also found in the P40 5G phone by China's Huawei but none was found in the phone of another Chinese maker, OnePlus, it said. Huawei's representative in the Baltics told the BNS news wire its phones do not send user's data externally.The report said the list of terms that could be censored by the Xiaomi phone's system apps, including the default internet browser, currently includes 449 terms in Chinese and is continuously updated."This is important not only to Lithuania but to all countries which use Xiaomi equipment," the Centre said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-rid-of-chinese-phones-as-fast-as-possible-lithuania-on-censorship-concern-101632277026579.html

Travellers who are unable to meet these requirements will be denied boarding.This comes on a day when three flights from India are scheduled to land in Canada. Transport Canada said that all the passengers on these flights will be tested for Covid-19 upon arrival to ensure that the new measures are working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-ban-on-commercial-and-private-passenger-flights-from-india-101632275585977.html
22-09-2021||World||Taliban name UN envoy, ask to address United Nations General Assembly||The Taliban, the new rulers of the war-torn land of Afghanistan, have now demanded representation at this week's United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session, thereby challenging the credentials of the pre-existing envoy of the country. The Taliban have named a new UN permanent representative – Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, once a spokesperson for the insurgents during peace negotiations in Qatar. The move is expected to trigger a diplomatic battle between Afghanistan's former UN envoy and the Taliban rulers over the high-level meeting of the international body.The world is watching closely every single move of the new rulers of Afghanistan before coming to a decision regarding recognition of the newfound regime. While the global community is in no hurry to do so, the question now facing the United Nations is a crucial one – should the Taliban be provided with a platform at the global stage to put forward their views? And if so, to what extent should the said platform allow or curb the expressions of the insurgents?Also Read | At UNGA, Biden says ‘future’ belongs to those who allow people to ‘breathe free’The way the world leaders choose to approach this question, experts believe, may define the molding conflict between the former UN envoy of Afghanistan and the new representative put forward for the global stage by the country's Islamist rulers.According to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, secretary-general Antonio Guterres received a communique on September 15 from the currently accredited Afghan ambassador, Ghulam Isaczai, with the list of Afghanistan's delegation for the assembly's 76th annual session. Five days later, Guterres received another communication with the letterhead “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” signed by “Ameer Khan Muttaqi” as “Minister of Foreign Affairs,” requesting participation in the UN gathering of world leaders.In this new communique, the Taliban claimed that Isaczai no longer represents Afghanistan since former president Ashraf Ghani was “ousted” as of August 15 this year and that countries across the world “no longer recognise him as president”. In light of these developments, the Taliban said they are nominating Mohammad Suhail Shaheen as the new permanent UN representative.Also Read | No respect: Afghan rights commission says Taliban using its cars, computers, other assetsHowever, it is not yet known if the UN credentials committee is going to legitimise this request. An official from the panel told the Associated Press under strict condition of anonymity that the UN committee “would take some time to deliberate”, suggesting the Taliban's envoy would not be able to speak at the General Assembly at this session at least during the high-level leaders' week. Senior officials of the US state department said they were aware of the Taliban's request, but could not predict how the panel might rule.Afghanistan is scheduled to give the last speech on the final day of the high-level meeting on September 27. It wasn't clear who would speak if the committee met and the Taliban were given Afghanistan's seat.In cases of disputes over seats at the United Nations, the official protocol says that the General Assembly's nine-member credentials committee must meet to make a decision. Both the aforementioned letters have been sent to the committee after consultations with General Assembly president Abdulla Shahid's office, the international body said. The committee's members are the United States, Russia, China, Bahama, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-name-un-envoy-ask-to-address-united-nations-general-assembly-101632270110101.html

The aim of the summit is to rally world leaders, philanthropists, civil society, NGOs, and industry “to align on a common vision to end Covid-19 together” by the end of 2022.The White House further said that “this meeting is about expanding and enhancing our shared efforts to defeat Covid-19, building out from previous gatherings of world leaders and ministers in fora like the G7, G20, and Act Accelerator”. The United States will “be asking participants to commit to a higher level of ambition by expanding reach in four broad avenues," it added.These four avenues are: enhancing equitable access to vaccines and getting shots in arms; solving oxygen crisis; making tests, PPEs, therapeutics more easily available, and establishing sustainable health security financing by tracking progress and supporting each other in fulfilling our commitments.Biden has been pushing for vaccination both domestically and globally and urging people to do their part so the pandemic can end once and for all. “We have the tools to put this pandemic behind us, but we all have to do our part. If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated. And if you’ve gotten vaccinated, reach out to family and friends who haven’t. Let’s finish this once and for all,” he tweeted on September 20.

All the windows, the glass, was shaking -- like a wave of shaking," he told AFP."I have never experienced that before. It was a little bit scary."Sizable earthquakes are unusual in Australia's populated southeast."It was quite violent but everyone was kind of in shock," Melbourne cafe worker Parker Mayo, 30, told AFP.Bricks and rubble lay on the ground outside Betty's Burgers in Melbourne, with large sheets of metal hanging off the restaurant awning.The restaurant said in a Facebook post that everyone was safe: "We were fortunate that nobody was in the restaurant at the time."'Very disturbing event'At around just under magnitude six this was "the biggest event in south-east Australia for a long time" Mike Sandiford, a geologist at the University of Melbourne told AFP."We had some very big ones at magnitude six in the late 1800s, though precise magnitudes are not well known."A quake of this size is expected every "10-20 years in south-east Australia, the last was Thorpdale in 2012" he said. "This is significantly bigger."Sandiford said Australians should expect "many hundreds of aftershocks, most below human sensitivity threshold, but probably a dozen or more that will be felt at least nearby."The quake "would have caused many billions of dollars in damage had it been under Melbourne," he added.Geosciences Australia said an aftershock measuring 4.0 struck shortly after the initial temblor.The mayor of Mansfield, near the quake epicentre, said there was no damage in the small town but it had taken residents by surprise."I was sitting down at work at my desk and I needed to run outside. It took me a while to work out what it was," Mark Holcombe told public broadcaster ABC."We don't have earthquakes that I am aware of -- none of the locals I spoke to this morning had that experience with earthquakes here before -- so it is one right out of the left field."Emergency services said they had received calls for help as far away as Dubbo, about 700 kilometres from the quake epicentre, with fire and rescue crews dispatched to help.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking from New York, said there were no initial reports of injuries."It can be a very, very disturbing event for an earthquake of this nature," he said. "They are very rare events in Australia."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-of-magnitude-5-6-strikes-near-melbourne-australia-gfz-101632267146464.html
22-09-2021||World||World is facing a dead end: UN chief||United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is hurtling towards ecological destruction, sounding a bleak opening tone to the annual UN General Assembly meeting in New York.Speaking a day after convening world leaders to ratchet up climate commitments, Guterres said on Tuesday that the “climate alarm bells” are “ringing at fever pitch”. Calling current global efforts insufficient, he forecast a “hellscape of temperature rises” if emissions aren’t cut more than currently planned.“We are weeks away from the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow, but seemingly light years away from reaching our targets,” Guterres told world leaders at the hybrid event where leaders including US President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are speaking in person but others will appear by video. “We must get serious. And we must act fast.”There were also hints of optimism on the climate front. Speaking on the sidelines of an event on the subject at the UN on Monday, US climate envoy John Kerry expressed confidence that world leaders will meet a target of raising $100 billion in climate aid to developing nations before the UK hosts two weeks of climate talks - known as COP26 - in Glasgow, Scotland, beginning on October 31.“I think we’re going to get it done by COP,” Kerry told reporters. “The US will do its part,” he said. “I’m not hoping. I’m telling you to stay tuned to the president’s speech.”Guterres also decried the global vaccine inequity that has left rich countries with surplus doses and considering booster shots even as developing nations have barely started vaccinating their populations.“This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity. We passed the science test. But we are getting an ‘F’ in Ethics,” the UN chief said.Reviewing the mistrust and lack of unity that he says have undermined global efforts to address Covid-19 and climate, Guterres said, “Instead of the path of solidarity, we are on a dead end to destruction.” While millions around the world go hungry, Guterres said, they see “billionaires joyriding to space”.‘Recipe for trouble’The United Nations chief urged the United States and China to engage in dialogue, warning of an increasingly divided world. “I fear our world is creeping towards two different sets of economic, trade, financial and technology rules, two divergent approaches in the development of artificial intelligence - and ultimately two different military and geopolitical strategies,” Guterres said.“This is a recipe for trouble. It would be far less predictable than the Cold War. To restore trust and inspire hope, we need cooperation,” he said.“We need dialogue. We need understanding.”The summit featured the first speech to the world body by US President Joe Biden, who has described a rising and authoritarian China as the paramount challenge of the 21st century.Chinese President Xi Jinping is also set to address the United Nations but by video in light of Covid restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-is-facing-a-dead-end-un-chief-101632248980152.html
