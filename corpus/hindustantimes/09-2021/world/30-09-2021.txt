Also, the report said that Facebook has played down such negative effects of its photo and video sharing platform Instagram on young users. The report also cited a slide from one of Facebook’s internal presentations which said, “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.”Also read | ‘Instagram Kids’: Facebook pauses project after criticismHowever, Facebook has already responded to the report and has denied it. “It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is “toxic” for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced,” a statement from Facebook’s head of research Pratiti Raychoudhury said.Meanwhile, Davis told the US Senate that the company conducts such research to proactively identify areas of improvement for the platform. “We conduct this research, to make our platform better, to minimise the bad and maximise the good and to proactively identify where we can improve,” the BBC quoted her as saying.“We want our platforms to be a place for meaningful interactions with friends and family and we cannot achieve that goal if people do not feel safe,” she further said.However, Richard Blumenthal, US Senator from the Democratic Party, said that the company chose the growth of its product over the well-being of its users, the BBC report showed. Also he said that Facebook was not holding itself accountable and questioned how the platform could be trusted.Among the major impacts following the criticism due to the WSJ report, the company had earlier in the week announced that it is pausing its plan to develop a version of Instagram, popularly known as Instagram Kids, for children under the age of 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-official-defends-platform-s-policies-for-young-users-amid-criticism-over-inaction-on-research-101633021238393.html

Anaamullah Samangai, a member of the Cultural Commission of the Information and Culture Ministry, said their efforts are useless, reported Tolo News."Now there is and will be no opportunity for such opportunistic people to deceive the international community from the address of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan," said Samangani.The Afghanistan embassy in Switzerland issued a statement claiming that the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the only legitimate government of Afghanistan elected by the votes of people, reports said. "After the escape of Ashraf Ghani and his rupture with the Afghan politics, his first vice-president (Amrullah Saleh) will be leading the country," the statement said.Based on the historic responsibility of the Afghan government and after consulting with the elders of the country, the government in exile has been announced, the statement said, adding that the three powers of the government namely executive, judicial, and legislative will be activated soon. It also announced its support to the Panjshir resistance front- the anti-Taliban front led by Ahmad Masoud- and has added that all the embassies and consulates of Afghanistan will be functional as normal, ANI reported. The statement has also called on all "friendly" and "partner" countries to maintain relations with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and to avoid granting legitimacy to the Taliban.Where are Panjshir leaders? Reports said Amrullah Saleh, Ahmed Massoud have been given protection in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital.

Thank you.” For those not familiar with okonomiyaki, it’s a savory pancake filled with cabbage that’s cooked on a griddle, with various extras like meat and fish and topped with sauce. A variation of the dish is a regional specialty in Osaka and is considered a soul food for Hiroshima, Kishida’s constituency. He is by no means a prominent voice among politicians on Twitter, with just around 180,000 followers. That’s a long way behind the 2.4 million followers of Taro Kono, the avid Twitter and Instagram user he beat to the top job. Kishida will have to tread carefully as he learns how to operate social media platforms. An Instagram photo of his wife cooking him dinner during last year’s LDP leadership election, when he lost to outgoing prime minister Yoshihide Suga, was met with a backlash for coming across as sexist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-new-pm-s-okonomiyaki-photo-gives-his-twitter-profile-a-boost-101633017505359.html

It took two BRICS countries, India and South Africa, to argue for a TRIPS waiver for vaccines in the WTO”, he said. Misri was referring to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).In a landmark move, India and South Africa in October last year had asked the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to allow all countries to choose to neither grant nor enforce patents and other intellectual property related to Covid-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other technologies for the duration of the pandemic, until global herd immunity is achieved.The proposal has gained momentum and 63 countries have co-sponsored the draft as of May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-bank-an-act-of-great-foresight-says-indian-envoy-to-china-101633014690364.html
30-09-2021||World||US lost the Afghan war, Kabul collapse rooted in Doha accord, say top US generals||Top US generals told lawmakers at a congressional hearing that America lost the Afghanistan war and that it was caused by miscalculations spanning several administrations and the August collapse of the erstwhile government in Kabul could be traced to the 2020 agreement with the Taliban.“It wasn’t lost in the last 20 days or even 20 months. There’s a cumulative effect to a series of strategic decisions that go way back,” chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley told the armed services committee of the House of Representatives, on Wednesday.“Strategically, the war is lost - the enemy is in Kabul,” he went to say, referring to the Taliban taking power in Kabul.General Milley cited several reasons that he said needed to be looked at such as the decision to shift forces from Afghanistan for the war in Iraq and the failure to “effectively deal with Pakistan”, where many of figures sought by US-led coalition forces sound shelter. General Milley had spoken of the Pakistan’s sanctuaries also at an Afghanistan hearing in the US senate, and called for a need to review Islamabad’s behaviour. Secretary of state Antony Blinken had earlier said ties with Pakistan were under review because of its duplicitous role in Afghanistan, where, he added, it had been “hedging its bets”.General Frank McKenzie, the head of the US Central Command that ran the war in Afghanistan, told lawmakers that the rapid collapse of President Ashraf Ghani’s government in Kabul, which had caught the US completely unprepared, could be traced to the agreement that the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban in Doha in February 2020.“The signing of the Doha agreement had a really pernicious effect on the government of Afghanistan and on its military - psychological more than anything else, but we set a date certain for when we were going to leave and when they could expect all assistance to end,” General McKenzie said.The Trump administration had kept the Ashraf Ghani government completely out of the agreement, which had set a timeline for the US and international forces to leave Afghanistan by May 1 of 2021, based on some conditions, which the generals also told the lawmakers, were largely not unfulfilled with one exception that the Taliban will not attack US or coalition forces.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin testified alongside Milley and Mckenzie and generally agreed with the generals’ assessments of the way the Afghanistan war unfolded over 20 days and how it ended. The three officials had earlier told the US senate that they had recommended to the president that the US should retain 2,5000 personnel in Afghanistan, contradicting Biden, who had claimed he did not get that advice.Mckenzie further said that cutting troops to below 2,500 “was the other, sort of, nail in the coffin”. “It has been my position in my judgement, that if we went below an advisory level of 2,500, I believe that the government of Afghanistan would likely collapse and that the military would follow; one might go before the other but I believe that was going to be the inevitable result of drawing down to zero and I’ve expressed that opinion writing for quite a while now,” said the top US general for the Afghanistan war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lost-the-afghan-war-kabul-collapse-rooted-in-doha-accord-say-top-us-generals-101633013670659.html
30-09-2021||World||Taliban shut escape routes as citizens desperately flee Afghanistan||Thousands of Afghans trying to escape the misery at home have flocked to their country's southern border with Pakistan, but their attempts to get across have been stopped by the Taliban.Zakariullah, sitting on a dirt road in the trading town of Spin Boldak only a few hundred metres from Pakistan, says he has been turned back more than half a dozen times, sometimes violently."They say only people from the area with papers," Zakariullah, a 25-year-old farmer and father of three, told AFP on the weekend."We want to cross the border to work there because there are no jobs here."The new Taliban rulers insist Afghans need to stay and rebuild their conflict-ravaged country."They tell people 'It's your country. You should not leave'," said 25-year-old Rahmadin Wardak, who was also trying to flee.On the other side, their Pakistani counterparts in Chaman were also stopping those attempting to cross."Every day, 8,000 to 9,000 people try to cross the border without having the necessary papers, and are turned back," one Taliban border guard, Mullah Maulvi Haqyar, told AFP.Maulvi Noor Mohammad Saeed, a Taliban official in Kandahar province, confirmed the authorities were asking "people and families to not leave the country"."Doing that, you lose respect for your Afghan culture," he told AFP.Sticks and pipesAt the border, only day labourers and traders -- all young men wearing traditional flat pakol hats and sweating under the weight of their goods -- were allowed to cram into a narrow corridor topped with barbed wire that led to the next checkpoint.A second corridor for other travellers lay mostly empty, with a few exceptions including elderly men and women loaded onto wheelbarrows seeking urgent healthcare in Pakistan.But scores of Afghans are eager to leave a country on the verge of economic collapse since the Islamists seized power in mid-August and foreign aid money dried up.Jobs have vanished while farmers are struggling with the impact of a drought.The United Nations has warned a third of the population is facing the threat of famine.Zakariullah, whose farmland was 600 kilometres in Kabul province, said he now hoped to find work in Pakistan. He would then send for his wife and children to join him.But, like many others at the border crossing, the journey to Spin Boldak has stripped away his meagre savings.Mohammed Arif said he left his home in Nangarhar in the east because he had "no money, no food to feed my eight children".Commotion erupted outside the border office as hundreds pleaded with the Taliban to let them through, during a visit by AFP on the weekend.Guards wielding sticks and pipes tried to control the frenzied scene as a crush of people pushed to get across to sell their possessions -- and keep hunger at bay for a few more hours.None of them made it.Critical situationBefore the Covid pandemic and recent upheavals, the border was mostly open, with few restrictions for the tens of thousands who crossed daily.But when the Taliban seized Spin Boldak early on in their dizzying offensive, Pakistan shut the gates and left huge crowds of stranded travellers to amass on both sides.The crossing reopened when the hardline group ousted the US-backed government and assumed power in mid-August.More Afghans arrived, fearing the Taliban would return to their brutal rule in the 1990s."At first, lots of people could cross," said Sami Ul Haq, who monitors the crossing point for the UN refugee agency UNHCR. "Before we had up to 24,000 people coming a day."There were few restrictions at the crossing during the last two weeks of August, but then the Taliban and Pakistanis clamped down.And on Thursday, the Taliban said they were shuttering the gates completely in protest against Pakistan -- which has repeatedly said it would not accept Afghan refugees -- accusing officials of creating hurdles for Afghans with the right papers.The UNHCR has meanwhile not reported huge movements of people towards the borders.With the war over, some Afghan refugees living in Pakistan have even returned.But the agency last month said it was preparing contingency plans for up to 500,000 rushing into neighbouring countries by the end of the year."We need to prepare in case any change inside the country could trigger a massive displacement," Bertrand Blanc, a UNHCR senior emergency officer, told AFP in Islamabad."For the moment, we are in a wait and see situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-shuts-escape-routes-as-citizens-desperately-flee-afghanistan-101633010799489.html
30-09-2021||World||China grapples with worst power outages in decades||China on Thursday continued to grapple with its worst power outages in decades with several provinces ordering industries to cut down or even shut production and urging millions of residents to use electricity judiciously.A number of provinces and regions including Liaoning and Jilin in northeast China, the trading powerhouse Guangdong in the south and Zhejiang in the east have been in the grip of power shortage for weeks now.Central authorities are scrambling to deliver more coal to power plants to restore supply as three provinces in the northeast Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Jilin, the worst hit and home to nearly 100 million people, face long hours of power cuts.A state media report quoted the China National Coal Association and China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association as pointing out a tightening trend in coal supplies nationwide, and said that the prospect of ensuring ample supplies for the upcoming winter season, when coal demand peaks, is not optimistic. The widespread outages have triggered speculation about disruption of the global supply chain and even a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy, official news agency, Xinhua said in a comment piece on Thursday.China’s state planner on Wednesday ordered railway companies and provincial authorities to rush coal supplies to regions grappling with unprecedented power cuts, which have hit industrial production and forced residents to switch on mobile phones and light candles to go about their daily chores.“In the central province of Hunan, some building façade lighting and billboards are being turned off during peak hours. In the southern trade hub of Guangdong, some factories have been ordered to shut down for up to a week,” news website, Caixin reported.In Shenzhen, the power supply bureau urged the general public to use electricity scientifically, save electricity, and set the air-conditioning temperature above 26°C.Power shortage in industrial hubs in China is not rare but the ongoing crunch has also hit millions of households.The reasons behind the crisis are continuing shortage of coal, rising coal prices and efforts made by local governments to curtail industrial energy use and meet carbon reduction targets.“Actually, structural and cyclical factors explain the power crunch. As insiders have pointed out, power demand surged quickly after the developed coastal areas of China saw strong recovery momentum,” the Xinhua comment piece said on Thursday.Data from the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) showed that in the first six months, total electricity consumption increased 15.83% from the same period a year ago.“In addition, coal-fired power producers suffered losses due to an overwhelming rise in the cost of coal. The prices of thermal coal have hit a record high,” it said.“A key factor behind the rapid growth of electricity consumption in China is the post-pandemic economic recovery,” the Caixin report said.In turn, the crunch is cutting down production, driving industrial production costs and disrupting the global supply in the world’s second largest economy.Many Chinese factories have cut output or have halted production entirely with industry insiders telling state media that the situation could worsen as the winter season draws near.“A textile factory based in East China’s Jiangsu Province received a notice from local authorities about power cuts on September 21. It won’t have power again until October 7 or even later,” the Global Times reported earlier this week.China’s top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has taken measures to ensure that coal supply to major power plants are guaranteed through long-term contract with coal mines.“The National Energy Administration has sent work teams to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Hunan to arrange for increasing coal and natural gas supply,” the Xinhua report said.China will make the public’s basic power needs the top priority of its power-supply work, ensuring that households stay safe and warm throughout this winter, the NDRC said.“Each railway company should strengthen coal transportation to power houses (utilities) with inventory of less than seven days and launch the emergency supply mechanism in a timely manner,” said the NDRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-grapples-with-worst-power-outages-in-decades-101633003709449.html
30-09-2021||World||British police officer Wayne Couzens sentenced to whole-life jail term for kidnap, rape, murder||A British police officer who falsely arrested a woman for breaking coronavirus restrictions, then kidnapped, raped and murdered her, was given a rare whole-life jail term on Thursday.Judge Adrian Fulford told Wayne Couzens, 48, his offences were "grotesque", after he snatched Sarah Everard off the streets of south London in March this year.Everard's disappearance sparked one of Britain's most high-profile missing persons investigations and protests calling for better safety for women in public spaces.But there has been widespread horror and revulsion at the involvement of a police officer, who exploited lockdown restrictions and abused his position of trust to kill.Couzens, who served with the elite diplomatic protection unit of London's Metropolitan Police, admitted kidnapping, rape and murder at a hearing in July and was sacked.Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, in central London, Fulford called Couzens' actions "devastating, tragic and wholly brutal" and said his victim was "wholly blameless".Couzens, who will die in jail, becomes the latest of only 60 criminals who will never be considered for release."The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious ideological cause," Fulford said.Everard's family was in court to see her killer jailed. On Wednesday, they gave emotional statements describing the harrowing impact of her death."No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us," her father, Jeremy, told Couzens.The high-profile case refocused attention on how the police handle complaints of violence against women and girls in Britain.Questions have been raised about why previous complaints of indecent exposure against Couzens, said to have been a user of sex workers and violent pornography, were not dealt with.The leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, a former chief prosecutor for England and Wales, said legislation needed to be tightened.He also called for a review of how Couzens was able to "slip through the net", despite a series of "warning signs".Starmer's Labour colleague, Harriet Harman, a former women's minister, called for the resignation of Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick."Women must be able to trust the police not fear them. Women's confidence in police will have been shattered," she said in a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel and the Met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-police-officer-given-whole-life-jail-term-for-kidnap-rape-murder-101633002603116.html
30-09-2021||World||China-based infra bank lends $356mn for Chennai Metro rail system||The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has approved a $356.67mn loan to India for the expansion of the Chennai Metro rail system as part of efforts to expand green public rail transport options in the country.The project involves the construction of an environment-friendly new corridor in Chennai’s metro network as part of Chennai Metro Rail Phase 2, the AIIB said in a statement on Thursday.China and India are the top two shareholders in the 103-member bank, which was set up in 2016 at Beijing’s initiative, and seen as its answer to an international finance system dominated by western countries.The Chennai project is the latest in the transport sector-related loans from the multilateral banking institute.“It (the project) will span from Lighthouse in the east to Poonamalee Bypass in the west to ensure seamless multimodal transport across Chennai by providing integrated access to suburban rail, bus stations and the city’s main airport,” the AIIB statement said, adding that the project will be implemented by the Chennai Metro Rail Limited.In addition, the project is expected to address traffic bottlenecks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing public urban transport options.“This project is aligned with AIIB’s mandate to support high-quality and sustainable infrastructure. The improvement and integration of the transport sector in Chennai will further promote trade and economic growth,” DJ Pandian, AIIB vice president, investment operations, was quoted as saying in the statement.The project also aims to ensure safer mode of public transport for women in Chennai.“With this project, female passengers would have access to a safer and convenient mode of public transportation with knock-on effects such as increased opportunities to participate in school, work, and social activities,” the AIIB statement said.The residential and commercial establishments along the new corridor will also benefit from enhanced accessibility and connectivity as well as increased economic opportunities, the statement said.In addition to solar panels installed on the roofs of the elevated stations, the project will have dedicated spaces for bicycles and green vehicles, and signage to raise environmental awareness, the AIIB statement said, adding that the project also integrates climate change resilience features to reduce its vulnerability to climate-related events.Since the founding of the bank, New Delhi has emerged as the top borrower with the AIIB having approved 28 projects in India with a total amount of $6.7 billion.Energy and transport sectors in India have received the highest amount of AIIB’s financing.Earlier this year, AIIB president, Jin Liqun said that the AIIB kept lending to India despite domestic pressure during the border dispute between India and China is proof that the institution is not simply a tool for China’s strategic interests.“Bilateral conflicts between member states should not concern a multilateral institution,” he was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.“We cannot keep talking about international standards and best practices in normal times, but change when encountering difficulties,” Jin said in his speech.“Once trust is broken, it is very difficult to restore your reputation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinabased-infra-bank-lends-356mn-for-chennai-metro-rail-system-101633003049362.html
30-09-2021||World||China drafts new data security laws, defines 'ordinary' versus 'core' data||China published new draft measures on Thursday aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered "core" and "important" data.China implemented the Data Security Law on Sept. 1. which requires all companies in China to classify the data they handle into several categories and governs how such data is stored and transferred to other parties.But lawyers have criticised its ambiguities including its lack of definitions for data.Thursday's draft measures describe in detail three categories of data - ordinary data, important data, and core data.The authorities describe ordinary data as data with a minimal ability to impact society at large, or that will affect a small number of individuals or enterprises.Important data is defined as data that poses a threat to China's national and economic interests or impact the rights of individuals and organizations, and has an "obvious cascading effect" across a range of industries and enterprises.Core data, meanwhile, is defined as data that poses a "serious threat" to China's national and economic interests. Disruption of important data could cause "major damage," leading to "large-scale shutdowns," or "large-scale network and service paralysis."The regulator adds that organizations may "self-assess" the security of ordinary data, but must conduct annual assessments at least once each year.Organizations must also receive approval for cross-border transfer of core data and important data via a special mechanism, the rules state.Data policy has become one of several areas regulators have targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on industry that has unfolded throughout the past year. China's data security law builds on the 2017 cybersecurity law, which marked the first major set of rules governing the storage and transfer of data of Chinese origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drafts-new-data-security-laws-defines-ordinary-versus-core-data-101632998325823.html
30-09-2021||World||Former France prez Sarkozy convicted for illegally financing 2012 election bid||Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid by a Paris court on Thursday.It was the second guilty verdict this year for Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives despite falling from grace over his legal woes.The court was yet to say what sentence he would receive.Prosecutors were seeking a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the 66-year old former president. He is in any case unlikely to go to jail immediately as he would be expected to appeal the sentence.His conservative party, the prosecutors said, spent nearly double the 22.5 million euros (currently $19.2 million) allowed under electoral law on extravagant campaign rallies and then hired a friendly public relations agency to hide the cost.Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing. He told the court in June that he had not been involved in the logistics of his campaign for a second term as president nor in how money was spent during the election run-up.But the court said that Sarkozy was made aware of the overspending, that he did not act on it, and that it was not necessary for him to approve each individual spending to be responsible.Sarkozy was found guilty in a separate trial in March of trying to bribe a judge and peddle influence in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry. He also denied any wrongdoing in that case.The former president was sentenced to three years in jail in that trial - two of which were suspended - but has not actually spent time in prison yet, while his appeal is pending.($1 = 1.1714 euros)(Reporting by Tangi Salaun and Ingrid Melander, Editing by Timothy Heritage)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-france-prez-sarkozy-convicted-for-illegally-financing-2012-election-bid-101632994182847.html
30-09-2021||World||US Congress moves to avert partial government shutdown||Congress is moving to avert one crisis while putting off another with the Senate poised to approve legislation that would fund the federal government into early December.The House is expected to approve the measure following the Senate vote Thursday, preventing a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Friday.Democrats were forced to remove a suspension of the federal government's borrowing limit from the bill at the insistence of Republicans. If the debt limit isn't raised by Oct. 18, the country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession, says Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Republicans say Democrats have the votes to raise the debt ceiling on their own, and Republican leader Mitch McConnell is insisting that they do so.But the most immediate priority facing Congress is to keep the government running once the current fiscal year ends at midnight Thursday. The bill's expected approval will buy lawmakers more time to craft the spending bills that will fund federal agencies and the programs they administer.Meanwhile, Democrats are struggling over how to get President Joe Biden's top domestic priorities over the finish line. Those include a bipartisan infrastructure bill that contains $550 billion in new spending for roads, bridges, broadband and other priorities, as well as a $3.5 trillion slate of social, health and environmental programs.“With so many critical issues to address, the last thing the American people need right now is a government shutdown," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Schumer said the stopgap spending legislation will also provide aid for those reeling from Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters as well as funding to support Afghanistan evacuees from the 20-year war between the U.S. and the Taliban.Action in the final hours to avoid a partial government shutdown has become almost routine, with lawmakers usually able to fashion a compromise. The funding bill was slowed this time by disagreement over allowing the government to take on more debt so that it could continue to meet its financial obligations. Currently the borrowing cap is set at $28.4 trillion.The U.S. has never defaulted on its debts in the modern era, and historically both parties have voted to raise the limit. Democrats joined the Republican Senate majority in doing so three times during Donald Trump’s presidency. This time Democrats wanted to take care of both priorities in one bill, but Senate Republicans blocked that effort Monday.Raising or suspending the debt limit allows the federal government to pay obligations already incurred. It does not authorize new spending. McConnell has argued that Democrats should pass a debt limit extension with the same budgetary tools they are using to try to pass a $3.5 trillion effort to expand social safety net programs and tackle climate change.“There is no tradition of doing this on a bipartisan basis. Sometimes we have and sometimes we haven’t,” McConnell told reporters about past debt ceiling increases.House Democrats complained about the steps they were being forced to take as they approved a standalone bill late Wednesday that would suspend the debt ceiling until December 2022. That bill now heads to the Senate, where it is almost certain to be blocked by a Republican filibuster.“You are more interested in punishing Democrats than preserving our credit and that is something I’m having a real tough time getting my head around,” House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told Republicans. “The idea of not paying bills just because we don’t like (Biden’s) policies is the wrong way to go.”But Republicans were undaunted. They argued that Democrats have chosen to ram through their political priorities on their own, and thus are responsible for raising the debt limit on their own.“So long as the Democratic majority continues to insist on spending money hand over fist, Republicans will refuse to help them lift the debt ceiling," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.McGovern said Republicans ballooned the debt under Trump and now are washing their hands of the consequences.“Republicans have now rediscovered the issue of the debt," McGovern said. "Where the hell were you the last four years?"The Treasury has taken steps to preserve cash, but once it runs out, it will be forced to rely on incoming revenue to pay its obligations. That would likely mean delays in payments to Social Security recipients, veterans and government workers, including military personnel. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, projects that the federal government would be unable to meet about 40% of payments due in the several weeks that follow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-moves-to-avert-partial-government-shutdown-101632987850488.html

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny agreed with a petition from Spears saying that the arrangement “reflects a toxic environment”.Page Six quoted a source as saying that Britney was in "shock" and "at loss of words" but jumping with joy after the verdict. "She hasn't felt joy like this in 13 years," the report further said quoting the insider.Judge Penny agreed with a petition from Britney and her attorney that James Spears needs to give up his role as conservator. The decision comes months after the Britney Spears pleaded for her father's removal in dramatic court hearings, saying, “I want my life back.”“The current situation is untenable,” the judge said after hearing arguments from both sides.Britney Spears was not present at the hearing and did not participate in any way. Her father connected remotely but did not speak during the proceedings.With no objections to ending the conservatorship, Penny is likely to terminate it at a November 12 hearing, restoring the singer's life and money choices to her after years of increasingly vocal calls to #FreeBritney that she eventually joined.John Zabel, an accountant, has been appointed in James Spears' place and will be the temporary conservator until December 31.James sought the conservatorship in 2008 and had been its primary controller and biggest champion. He reversed course in recent weeks, asking the judge to end the conservatorship immediately, arguing that would render his removal pointless.The conservatorship was established when Britney Spears began to have public mental struggles as hordes of paparazzi aggressively followed her everywhere and she lost custody of her children.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britney-spears-father-suspended-from-conservatorship-singer-burst-into-tears-101632987774440.html
30-09-2021||World||Leading Rohingya activist killed in Bangladesh||One of the most well-known community leaders to have voiced the suffering of Rohingya refugees on the world stage was shot and killed in a refugee camp in southern Bangladesh on Wednesday, a United Nations spokesperson said. Mohibullah was in his late 40s. He was a teacher and an ardent advocate for the welfare of the Rohingya community who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017. More than 700,000 people were forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh then.Most of them live together in a town called Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement. Instances of violence have become increasingly rampant in the amps, with armed men often jostling for influence, kidnapping critics, and warning women against breaking conservative Islamic norms.Rafiqul Islam, a deputy police superintendent at Cox's Bazar, confirmed the news of the shooting to Reuters news agency as well. However, details about the incident are not fully clear yet.A ‘beacon of hope’Mohibullah established the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, a group that tirelessly worked to highlight the plight of refugees living in camps.The group made its name by documenting the atrocities that were meted out to the community during the military crackdown. The UN had said that the crackdown of 2017 was carried out with genocidal intent.Mohibullah went from hut to hut to build a tally of killings, rape, and arson that he shared with international investigators. His organization also worked to give Rohingya people a voice of their own.He had told the UN Human Rights Council in 2019 that he wanted the Rohingya to be a part of the decisions that were being taken for them. He had also met former US President Donald Trump at the White House in 2019, where he spoke of the suffering of his community.Given his advocacy, Mohibullah also became the target of other hardliners who threatened to kill him."If I die, I'm fine. I will give my life," he told Reuters news agency in 2019.People mourn his deathA spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the agency was "deeply saddened" by the killing of the activist."We are continuous contact with law enforcement authorities in charge of maintaining peace and security in the camps," a UNHCR spokesperson said.Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights, said Mohibullah's death not only undermined the struggle of the Rohingya community for greater rights, "but also their efforts to safely return to their homes in Myanmar."She said he was a "vital voice" for the community who had suffered "unimaginable loss and pain when they arrived as refugees in Bangladesh."Aung Kyaw Moe, a Rohingya civil society activist and an adviser to Myanmar's National Unity Government, the parallel civilian government established after February's coup, said Mohibullah knew there was always a threat to doing the work he did. But despite that, knew that "if he is not doing the work he is doing, no one else would."Organizations like the Amnesty International had raised concerns about violence in the camp in 2020, saying that authorities ought to take necessary action to protect refugees or there would be a serious risk of further bloodshed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-rohingya-activist-killed-in-bangladesh-101632979271450.html
30-09-2021||World||Overseas spectators banned from attending Beijing winter Olympics in 2022||Overseas fans have been banned from attending the Beijing 2022 winter Olympics while all unvaccinated athletes will be quarantined for 21 days ahead of the games, scheduled to begin on February 4.Tickets for the games will only be sold to mainland residents, which means domestic spectators will be allowed to watch the games following the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which was mostly played out in empty stadiums.All domestic and international Games participants and workforce will be tested daily for Covid-19, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in a presentation on Wednesday.The winter multi-sport event, being held in China for the first time, is scheduled to take place from February 4-20 in Beijing and towns in the neighbouring Hebei province.Beijing will be the first capital to hold both the Winter and Summer Olympics, which was held in the Chinese capital in August, 2008.The IOC, while acknowledging the disappointment among international fans unable to attend the games, welcomed the decision to have Chinese spectators after the Tokyo 2020 summer Olympics in July were held with empty stadiums due to Covid-19 precautions.The presentation by China laid down the anti-Covid-19 protocols to be implemented ahead of the games. “All athletes and games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter a closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing,” the Xinhua news agency quoted the organising committee as saying in the presentation.“All vaccines recognised by World Health Organization or related international organisations, or approved officially by countries or regions concerned will be accepted. Athletes who can provide a justified medical exemption will have their cases considered,” the committee said.“All domestic and international Games participants and workforce in the closed-loop management system will be subject to daily testing,” it said.“As for the audience, Beijing 2022 organisers made it clear that tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in China’s mainland who meet the requirements of Covid-19 countermeasures,” the organising committee added.According to the rules, from 23 January until the end of the Paralympics, a closed-loop management system will be implemented to ensure the safe delivery of the Games. “This closed-loop management system will cover all Games-related areas, including arrival and departure, transport, accommodation, catering, competitions, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Within the closed loop, participants will be allowed to move only between Games-related venues for training, competitions, and work. A dedicated Games transport system will be put in place,” the committee said.The 12 competition venues have been completed while other facilities are scheduled to be finished by October.A 34-strong delegation from the Beijing organising committee for the 2022 Games was sent to Tokyo to hear from Japanese counterparts how to stage such an event during a pandemic, a state media report said earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overseas-spectators-banned-from-attending-beijing-winter-olympics-in-2022-101632979467649.html
30-09-2021||World||International Translation Day: History and significance of September 30||September 30 is celebrated globally as International Translation Day by the International Federation of Translators (FIT) in honour of translation professionals. The said date was chosen because it coincides with the day of the feast of St. Jerome, who translated the Bible, and is considered as the patron saint of translators. Though FIT, since its establishment in 1953, has been observing this day, the first formal celebrations of the global translation day took place only in 1991. However, it was on May 24, 2017, when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), through resolution 71/288, officially recognised September 30 as the date to celebrate International Translation Day. Total 11 countries were signatories to the draft resolution: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, Qatar, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam.United Nations describes International Translation Day as an “opportunity to pay tribute to the work of language professionals,” which, according to the world body, plays an important role in “bringing nations together, facilitating dialogue, understanding and cooperation, contributing to development and strengthening world peace and security.” Every year, since 2005, it invites all its employees, accredited permanent missions staff and students from partner universities to participate in the UN St. Jerome Translation contest.The competition rewards best translation works in languages such as Arabian, English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish and German.Multilingualism, the UN says, is one of its "core values." The organisation employs hundreds of language staff at its offices across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-translation-day-history-and-significance-of-september-30-101632976401312.html
30-09-2021||World||World Maritime Day 2021: Tributes pour in for seafarers who kept supply lines running amid Covid-19||World Maritime Day 2021 is being observed across the globe on September 30 in a tribute to the professionalism and sacrifice of the two million seafarers who served the world's merchant navy fleet even amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic situation. During these dire times – shipping played a major role in transporting vital medical supplies, food, and other basic goods that are significant for Covid-19 response and recovery. However, according to the United Nations, the seafarers themselves sacrificed aplenty – being stranded at sea for days as their contracts kept on being extended by many months. The 2021 theme for the ‘World Maritime Day’ respects the sacrifice made by the navy men: ‘Seafarers at the core of shipping's future.’World Maritime Day 2021: ThemeThe theme for the 2021 World Maritime Day is ‘seafarers at the core of shipping’s future.’ According to the United Nations, this year's theme “reflects a clear need to raise awareness of seafarersʹ crucial role in world trade and increase their visibility.” The world has seen how the seafarers have dedicated their valuable time during the Covid-19 period to ensure that the global supply chains keep functioning to deliver vital goods throughout the pandemic. “This could not happen without the professionalism and dedication of the world’s seafarers,” the UN has observed.World Maritime Day 2021 will highlight the work of seafarers at the heart of the maritime industry, while also promote activities that delve into specific topics relevant to the role of the seafarer in safety, maritime security, environmental protection, and seafarersʹ well-being; and the future of seafaring against a backdrop of increased digitalization and automation.World Maritime Day 2021: SignificanceAccording to the United Nations, the international shipping industry consists more than 80 per cent of the aggregate global trade among people and communities across the world. “Shipping is the most efficient and cost-effective method of international transportation for most goods; it provides a dependable, low-cost means of transporting goods globally, facilitating commerce and helping to create prosperity among nations and peoples,” it said.A safe and secure, as well as efficient, shipping industry is the backbone of successful maritime trade for any country and the globe as a whole. It is also capable of containing pollution to a minimum, and is an essential component of any programme for or future sustainable green economic growth in a sustainable manner.The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is looking to put more stress on the promotion of sustainable shipping and maritime development in the coming years. World Maritime Day 2021: HistoryThe need for an international day for the maritime industry came with the establishment of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a specialised agency for the purpose. In 1948, the United Nations passed a resolution at an international conference in Geneva to establish the IMO for maintaining a comprehensive and regulatory framework for shipping. In 1982, the international maritime organization (IMO) took the name Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO).The main objective of the IMO is to focus on areas such as safety, environmental issues, legal issues, technical cooperation, maritime safety and maritime efficiency. World Maritime Day was celebrated for the first time on March 17, 1978.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-maritime-day-2021-tributes-pour-in-for-seafarers-who-kept-supply-lines-running-amid-covid19-101632975710320.html
30-09-2021||World||China's factory activity is now at its lowest since February last year||Chinese factory activity contracted in September to the lowest level since February 2020, when coronavirus lockdowns crippled the economy, official data showed Thursday, as the country faces waves of power outages and fears over instability in the real estate sector.The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- a key gauge of manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy -- slipped to 49.6 from 50.1 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said.Any figure below the 50-point mark represents contraction, while above it indicates growth.It is the first time China's PMI has contracted since February last year when the domestic economy was battered by prolonged factory shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Factory suspensions and power blackouts have already affected at least 17 provinces in recent months -- a situation further exacerbated by tight coal supply leading to sky-high prices.The power cuts and local government restrictions on factories to cut energy use have led some major banks to lower their annual GDP forecast for China, with supply chains for international firms such as Apple and Tesla impacted.NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI fell below the threshold due to "the relatively low prosperity of energy-intensive industries".The figure was slightly below the forecast of Bloomberg analysts, who expected a small rebound after successful containment of coronavirus outbreaks.While China's economy has largely bounced back from the initial blow of the pandemic, multiple outbreaks in recent months hit domestic tourism and manufacturing as wide swathes of the country were locked down.As a result, China's non-manufacturing PMI -- which measures activity in construction and services -- contracted in August for the first time since the pandemic began, but recovered in September to 53.2 from 47.5 last month.Default fears around Chinese property giant Evergrande -- bogged down in a $300 billion debt quagmire -- has hit consumer confidence, as the government tries to stop financial risk from spilling over into the rest of the property sector.Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said that the weak PMI would serve as an "alarm" for the government."Economic growth in Q4 will likely slow further without a change of government policies, and the pace of slowdown may pick up," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-factory-activity-is-now-at-its-lowest-since-february-last-year-101632973305314.html
30-09-2021||World||Myanmar may spiral into a ‘catastrophe’, UN calls for urgent action||The United Nations chief is urging unified regional and international action to prevent the crisis in Myanmar from becoming a large-scale conflict and multi-faceted “catastrophe” in the heart of Southeast Asia and beyond. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned in a report to the UN General Assembly circulated Wednesday that the opportunity to prevent the army from entrenching its rule could be narrowing and said it is urgent that regional and international countries help put Myanmar back on the path to democratic reform.When Myanmar's army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, it claimed with scant evidence that the general election her party won last November in a landslide was marred by widespread fraud. The takeover almost immediately sparked widespread street protests that security forces tried to crush. The pushback has left more than 1,100 people dead, according to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and right groups.The United Nations has supported a five-point plan adopted by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, that calls for stopping violence, constructive dialogue, the appointment of an ASEAN special envoy as a mediator and humanitarian aid. It took until early August for ASEAN to pick Brunei's Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof as their special envoy, and he is reportedly still negotiating with the military on the terms of a visit.In the report, Guterres welcomed Yusof's appointment, called for “timely and comprehensive implementation of the five-point consensus to facilitate a peaceful solution,” and strongly encouraged ASEAN to work with the UN special envoy.His urgent call for a united international and regional response indicates that with ASEAN's slow movement, Guterres feels it is time for broader international action as well.“The risk of a large-scale armed conflict requires a collective approach to prevent a multi-dimensional catastrophe in the heart of Southeast Asia and beyond,” the secretary-general said. “Grave humanitarian implications, including rapidly deteriorating food security, an increase in mass displacements and a weakened public health system compounded by a new wave of COVID-19 infections require a coordinated approach in complementarity with regional actors.”He said it is imperative to restore Myanmar's constitutional order and uphold the results of the November 2020 election. He suggested neighbouring countries could leverage their influence over the military to have it “respect the will of the people and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country and region.”Guterres said the international and regional effort must be accompanied by the immediate release of Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government officials as well as immediate humanitarian access and aid, especially to vulnerable communities, including some 600,000 Rohingya Muslims still in northern Rakhine state and the more than 700,000 who fled a 2017 military crackdown and are now in camps in neighboring Bangladesh.The report, covering the period from mid-August 2020 to mid-August 2021, said that since the military takeover, security forces have engaged in wide-ranging “brutal repression,” especially of those protesting Suu Kyi's ouster, sparked a political crisis with wide implications for the region, and carried out serious human rights violations.“Those expressing opposition to the military and joining democratic movements, as well as their relatives and associates, have been subject to arbitrary killings and detentions, disappearances, night raids, intimidation, and torture,” Guterres said. “There have also been numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by the security forces.”Between February 1 and late July, he said, “there have been at least 150 instances in which security forces reportedly used lethal force against unarmed protesters.”Guterres said students and education staff have been primary targets of repression, pointing to reports by the Myanmar Teachers' Federation that at least 70 students and five teachers have been killed by security forces, that 775 students and 76 teachers have been detained, and that more than 125,000 teachers and 13,000 school staff in higher education institutions have been suspended or dismissed.The secretary-general said there have also been numerous reports of violence targeting security forces as well as killings of individuals suspected of collaborating with the military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-may-spiral-into-a-catastrophe-un-calls-for-urgent-action-101632971200720.html
30-09-2021||World||Kim Jong Un's sister gets a post on top North Korean body||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister has been appointed to the country's top government body, the official KCNA news agency reported Thursday. Kim Yo Jong, a key adviser to her brother, was promoted to a position on the State Affairs Commission, amid a raft of changes approved by the Supreme People's Assembly, the rubber-stamp parliament.No fewer than nine members of the commission were dismissed, including one of its vice-presidents, Pak Pong Ju, and diplomat Choe Son Hui, a rare senior woman in the North's hierarchy who has played a key role in negotiations with the United States.The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried portraits of the eight new appointees on Thursday, Kim Yo Jong standing out among them both for her youth and as the only woman.She has often been seen in close proximity to her brother – with whom she went to school in Switzerland -- including at his summits with then-US president Donald Trump and the South's leader Moon Jae-in.Her exact political role has long been the subject of speculation – as has the possibility that she might one day succeed her brother, a transition that would give the socially conservative North its first female leader.She has at times made vitriolic denunciations of Washington or Seoul in statements carried by state media, particularly ahead of the North blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border that the South had built and paid for.Her relatively junior position as a vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party gave those declarations an element of ambiguity, and in some cases, she specifically said she was speaking in a personal capacity.Her official rank has risen and fallen over time, but her new SAC position is by far the most senior post she has held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-gets-a-post-on-top-north-korean-body-101632969470344.html
30-09-2021||World||China's Covid-19 vaccine sales drop as nations switch to mRNA shots||In the early days of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Chinese shots saved countless lives. They kick-started inoculation programs across Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, while richer countries hoarded scarce mRNA shots from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. But many governments that once relied on vaccines from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. or Sinopharm Group Co Ltd. are now turning to options from the US and Europe instead, as concerns mount about Chinese vaccines’ efficacy against the delta strain and the Western stranglehold on mRNA supplies grows looser. That preference may already be showing up in China’s customs data, where exports of human vaccines dropped 21% in August to $1.96 billion from $2.48 billion in July, after rising steadily since Dec. 2020.“Basically people took what they could get” when Covid vaccines first became available, said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong who has edited several books on foreign policy and public health.“But as this has gone on, general populations -- rather than just medical practitioners -- have become more educated about the differences,” he said. “They have realized that not all vaccines are equal in terms of protection.”This shift played out during Thailand’s deadly outbreak earlier this year. As cases surged and Southeast Asia emerged as the new epicenter of the pandemic, the nation desperately tried to purchase vaccines. Only one supplier came through in time: China’s Sinovac.The shots allowed the country of 70 million to begin its inoculation campaign earlier than hoped, but Thailand soon confronted a challenge now faced by lawmakers across the developing world.The efficacy of China’s inactivated vaccines ranges from about 50% to 80% in clinical trials. But they are less potent than mRNA vaccines and questions are mounting about their effectiveness against the highly transmissible delta variant. As a result, the Thai government became the first in the world to offer an AstraZeneca Plc shot to people who had already received a jab or even two of Sinovac. While it is not an mRNA, Thai studies showed the Cambridge, U.K.-based company’s viral vector vaccine is potent as a booster to the Chinese shot, and that Pfizer’s dose was found to be even more effective.But many Thais soon expressed a strong preference for Western shots -- even protesting to demand them -- and the country’s opposition began lambasting the government for its reliance on China. Thailand halted orders of Sinovac and began buying more Western vaccines.“I’m not anti-Sinovac,” said Chaowat Sittisak, a 29-year-old teacher in northern Thailand who got the first dose of Sinovac but ordered a second Moderna shot from a private hospital. “If the world only had one vaccine and it’s Sinovac, I’d get it. But we have so many other choices. And I want whatever is best.”Many governments that once relied on Chinese shots are now ordering or seeking donations of mRNA vaccines instead. The swing away from China is likely to accelerate as U.S. President Joe Biden promises to donate 1.1 billion mRNA shots, Europe pledges hundreds of millions of vaccines and India prepares to once again export AstraZeneca vaccines after curtailing shipments following its deadly second wave. In addition to availability and efficacy, freedom of movement may also be motivating the shift: Recipients of Chinese vaccines can’t travel to some locations, such as Singapore.Vaccine ExportsIn a written reply to Bloomberg, Sinovac said its CoronaVac shot has been effective at preventing hospitalization, intensive care admissions, and deaths throughout the pandemic. A spokesperson said some countries first rolled out Sinovac to the elderly, who are more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19, while younger populations received different vaccines later, “and this should be factored in the evaluation of CoronaVac’s effectiveness.”Many countries, including Thailand, have “purchased vaccines from multiple suppliers in order to maximize the number of doses available for their population,” the company said.As things stand, the list of places shifting away from Chinese vaccines -- or augmenting them with Western boosters -- includes Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. In China’s own territory of Hong Kong, which has long offered residents a choice between BioNTech and Sinovac, health officials are now testing whether the Chinese shot will perform better when paired with a western booster.While Sinovac allowed Thailand to start its rollout earlier than planned, the 6 million doses arriving in October will be the last shipment. In 2022, at least three-quarters of the government’s orders will also come from Astra and Pfizer.Moves like Thailand’s represent a blow to China’s vaccine diplomacy ambitions. Nevertheless, governments face a tricky balance between wanting to protect the public and maintaining good relations with China. The Thai Health Ministry has been careful to say that while it has no plans to order more Sinovac, it isn’t suggesting the shots aren’t effective.  Chinese firms have exported some 884 million doses of their homegrown vaccines via mostly bilateral deals with places like Brazil and Indonesia. This week Chile started giving Sinovac shots to children as young as six, a strong endorsement of a shot that’s formed the backbone of their rollout. And there are still many parts of the world drastically short of vaccines. Some African nations, for instance, have barely started their inoculation drives after struggling to procure shots. Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Kenya are all rolling out Chinese vaccines, and Beijing is a key supplier to the World Health Organization-backed Covax facility aimed at getting vaccines to the developing world. President Xi Jinping has pledged to export 2 billion doses this year, matching commitments by the Group of Seven nations.Various studies conducted around the world have shown the jabs to be effective at preventing serious illness and death. Yet China’s pharmaceutical firms -- which were initially less forthcoming than western companies in releasing clinical trial data -- have not released similarly conclusive studies that inactivated vaccines are effective against delta.Over the coming year, policymakers may well continue turning away from the older technology of the inactivated Chinese vaccines, says Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, who published a recent study in the Lancet showing the Pfizer vaccine generated 10 times more antibodies than Sinovac.“If you’ve got some vaccines that are more effective than others, and the cost is roughly the same, then you’re going to get a better bang for the buck if you choose the more effective vaccines,” Cowling said. “But I still think that the supplies are limited, so it may not be as easy as saying, ‘We just want to order the Moderna vaccine,’ or whatever.”‘Better Alternatives’In Thailand, the opposition Move Forward party is now calling on the government to reveal the percentage of people who have only received the Sinovac shots.“The government already knows that studies and research show inactivated virus vaccines are less effective against virus mutations when compared to mRNA-based vaccines,” said Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, an opposition lawmaker and a key critic of the government’s vaccine policies. “We should know the vaccination rate that excludes all two-dose Sinovac shots because the immunity may not be enough anymore. Any regions that are ready can then reopen.”Thailand’s health ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.Chaowat, the teacher, said he felt pressured to take the Sinovac shot because of his job but is hoping to get a Moderna shot in a month or two.“The government is turning away from Sinovac because they have to push through with their reopening plan and they want to reduce vaccine hesitancy among people who don’t want Sinovac,” he said. “They’re turning to better alternatives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-sales-drop-as-nations-switch-to-mrna-shots-101632967331867.html
30-09-2021||World||Chinese switch to flashlights, generators amid power cuts||China’s state planner on Wednesday ordered railway companies and provincial authorities to rush coal supplies to regions grappling with unprecedented power cuts, which have hit industrial production and forced residents to switch on mobile phones and light candles to go about their daily chores.Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning are the three worst hit provinces in northeast China facing sudden power blackouts, lasting for hours.The crippling power pinch has also spread to several other provinces, local media reported.“In the central province of Hunan, some building facade lighting and billboards are being turned off during peak hours. In the southern trade hub of Guangdong, some factories have been ordered to shut down for up to a week,” news website Caixin reported.Power shortage in industrial hubs in China is not rare but the ongoing crunch has also hit millions of households.“People ate breakfast by flashlight and shopkeepers used portable generators Wednesday as power cuts imposed to meet official conservation goals disrupted manufacturing and daily life,” the Associated Press said in a report from Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province in northeast China.The power cuts are being attributed to continuing shortage of coal, rising coal prices and efforts made by local governments to curtail industrial energy use and meet carbon reduction targets.“The industrial demand for electricity is increasing fast. The price of coal has soared.
