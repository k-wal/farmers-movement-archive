The Islamist group also blocked roads leading to the valley, news agency ANI reported citing Afghan media outlet Tolo News.Panjshir remains the only province out of Taliban’s reach.“They have cut off telecommunication services in Panjshir for the past two days. The people are facing challenges in this regard and cannot get in touch with their relatives living in other parts of the country,” a resident of the province said.People living in Kabul also told Tolo News that they were unable to reach out to their relatives and friends living in the region. “All my relatives and friends are in Panjshir. Unfortunately, on one hand, the road to Panjshir is closed and on the other hand, the communication networks are not working,” a Kabul resident said. The blockage of roads has also led to rise in prices of food in the valley.The developments came two days after the Taliban attacked an outpost in Panjshir. Panjshir lies in the Hindu Kush mountains, approximately 145km north of Kabul. The Taliban is yet unable to take this major holdout of resistance despite taking over Afghanistan in a matter of weeks.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-snaps-internet-services-in-panjshir-101630520549163.html

These include journalists, women’s rights activists, former officials and extremely vulnerable individuals.However, defence secretary Ben Wallace said as many as 1,100 Afghans who were entitled to come to the UK, were left behind.Meanwhile, current and former officials have hit out at the UK government and suggested that many more could have been rescued from Afghanistan in recent months.But Dominic Raab defended the government’s approach and insisted that Britain had prepared for all eventualities ahead of the Taliban August takeover and will continue to try helping people flee the new regime in Kabul.“We started planning in June for the contingency of an evacuation and the full drawdown of the embassy,” Raab said as he was being accused by the opposition leaders for failing to cut short a vacation in Greece as the Taliban rapidly advanced to take over Afghanistan. The foreign secretary only came back to London after Kabul fell into the hands of the Islamic Emirate on August 15.Ahead of his visit to neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Raab also said the Foreign Office is dispatching 15-person “rapid deployment teams” to continue with the evacuation efforts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominic-raab-heads-to-afghanistan-s-neighbours-to-hold-talks-on-evacuations-101630516711297.html

He thought it was Merkel's||Pope Francis has criticized the West's two-decade-long involvement in Afghanistan as an outsider's attempt to impose democracy — although he did it by citing Russian President Vladimir Putin while thinking he was quoting German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Asked during a radio interview aired Wednesday about the new political map taking shape in Afghanistan after the United States and its allies withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country following 20 years of war, the pope said he would answer with a quote that he attributed to Merkel, whom he described as “one of the world's greatest political figures.”“It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from outside and building democracy in other countries, ignoring the traditions of the peoples," the pope said, using his own translation into Spanish.But the words were spoken last month by Putin in the presence of Merkel, during her visit to Moscow.During the meeting on Aug. 20, Putin scathingly criticized the West over Afghanistan, saying that the Taliban’s rapid sweep over the country has shown the futility of Western attempts to enforce its own vision of democracy. At a news conference with Putin, Merkel conceded that the operation had failed in delivering a clear future for Afghans."We did not want to force any system on Afghanistan,” Merkel told reporters. “But we saw that millions of girls were glad to go to school and that women could participate. There are many in Afghanistan who are very, very unhappy about developments now.”Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, refused to comment directly on the pope's comments when asked on Wednesday, but he added that Merkel's position on Afghanistan was well known and repeated during a recent speech to the German parliament.The goal of no international terror attacks from Afghanistan since the military operation started in 2001 “was achieved,” Merkel told German lawmakers on Aug. 25: "That was a concrete contribution to the safety of our country.”Although she acknowledged that the West's goals may have been too ambitious and cultural differences and corruption may have been underestimated, she also said that the mission in Afghanistan “wasn’t futile” for the country’s population, as it helped reduce child mortality, deliver drinking water and electricity to a majority of Afghans and protected rule of law and the basic rights of women and others.Merkel said the analysis of what went wrong would take time and each international mission would need to be assessed on its own, but she added that “we must not and won’t forget Afghanistan, because even if it doesn’t look like it in this bitter hour I’m convinced that no violence and no ideology will stop people’s urge toward freedom, justice and peace forever.”The Vatican didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the pope's interview with Spain's Cadena COPE, which took place Friday at his residence. The radio station owned by Spain's Catholic bishops' conference aired the talk on Wednesday and said that its content had been vetted by the pope himself.Francis also said that “not all eventualities were taken into account” in the departure of Western allies from Afghanistan.“I don’t know whether there will be a review or not (about what happened during the withdrawal), but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new (Afghan) authorities,” said the pope. “I say deceit or a lot of naivety.”He said he believed that the Vatican’s top diplomat was offering to engage in Afghanistan to make sure that locals don’t suffer and called for Christians across the world to engage in “prayer, penance and fasting” in the face of events in Afghanistan.In the interview, Pope Francis addressed direct questions about his health for the first time since he underwent bowel surgery in early July.He said his body is adjusting well to the removal of part of his colon and that he can now eat whatever he wants and leads “a totally normal life.”He said that he expected his trip to Slovakia and Hungary between Sept. 12-15 would be as busy as previous ones. He also has an upcoming tour taking him to Cyprus, Greece and Malta.The pope also said he was expecting to appear and speak at the U.N.-sponsored COP26 climate talks in November in Glasgow, Scotland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-uses-putin-s-words-to-chide-west-s-afghan-war-he-thought-it-was-merkels-101630516853702.html

The findings on Wednesday were the result of an investigation by domestic distributor Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, the ministry said in a statement."Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk," Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement.The use of three lots of Moderna vaccines was suspended on Thursday after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but two others were suspended as a precaution as they all came from the same manufacturing line of Spanish pharmaceutical company Rovi , which bottles Moderna vaccines.The most probable cause of the contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Takeda said, citing a joint investigation with Moderna and Rovi. The material was confirmed to be grade 316 stainless steel.The three suspended lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue and Rovi has taken corrective measures, the statement said.Use of other doses of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off when needles are incorrectly inserted.The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots.The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated. Takeda said there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine."The relationship is currently considered to be coincidental," the company said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stainless-steel-particles-found-in-suspended-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-japan-101630511400222.html
01-09-2021||World||Taliban affiliate Al Qaeda calls for liberation of Kashmir as part of global jihad||The Narendra Modi government has noted with concern the statement issued by Taliban affiliate Al Qaeda on Tuesday praising the Sunni Pashtun US-designated terrorist group for humiliating and defeating American forces and then expelling them from Afghanistan and virtually exhorting the Islamist forces to launch global jihad to liberate Palestine, Islamic Magreb, Somalia, Yemen and Kashmir from the enemies of Islam. The Al Qaeda statement came on the day the senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Stanakzai assured the Indian envoy to Qatar that no anti-India activity would be allowed in Afghanistan.While US President Joe Biden claimed victory in Afghanistan after what he called decimating of Al Qaeda and killing of their leader Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda statement shows the group is alive and kicking in Afghanistan as it sought the allegiance of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akundzada and previous two Ameer-ul-Momeen of the Islamist group including Mullah Omar. Just as the Taliban have never raised the issue of Kashmir, they have also never criticised the Al Qaeda group. The statement reveals that the so-called liberation of Afghanistan was the first step and a precursor to global jihad by the Islamist group. It is quite evident that the capture of Kabul by the Taliban has made the group a rallying point for all jihadists in the world.On Tuesday, Al Qaeda called on the Taliban to "liberate" Kashmir, Palestine, Yemen and other "Islamic lands" just as they liberated Afghanistan from the US occupation. In a message congratulating the Taliban, the terrorist group said that the victory of insurgents in Afghanistan demonstrated what the Islamic nation is capable of, adding that “jihad is the only way” towards “victory and empowerment”."It is time for you to prepare for the next stage of the struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation," al Qaeda said, asserting that the victory of the Taliban is a prelude to the “liberation” of the rest of the Islamic nations.Also Read | Taliban discuss Kabul airport ops in official meet with Dutch delegates in DohaThe terrorist group, co-founded by Osama bin Laden in 1988, claimed that the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has humiliated the United States and tarnished its global reputation. Calling Afghanistan a “graveyard of empires and an impregnable fortress of Islam”, al Qaeda said that the war-torn country has “successfully defeated and expelled” an invading imperialist power twice within a span of fewer than two centuries. The group extended its congratulations to Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.“On this historic occasion, we would like to offer our congratulations to the leadership of Islamic Emirate, specifically to the Leader of the Believers, Hibbatullah Akhundzada,” it said.The Taliban has repeatedly assured other countries, including India and the US, that they won’t allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil against them. In the peace deal signed between the US and Taliban which led to the foreign troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Islamist fundamentalists have specifically pledged to prevent al Qaeda and other terrorist networks from using Afghan soil.“It is time for you to prepare for the next stage of the struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation. With the help of Allah, this historic victory will open the way for the Muslim masses to achieve liberation from the despotic rule of tyrants who have been imposed by the West on the Islamic world,” al Qaeda made the clarion call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-affiliate-al-qaeda-calls-for-liberation-of-kashmir-as-part-of-global-jihad-101630507902807.html

Both the vaccines follow a two-dose regimen and are based on the mRNA technology. Further, the people who have so far been immunised with the single-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine will also be receiving a Pfizer shot as a booster at least four weeks after the first vaccination, the Associated Press reported.Also read | Do Covid-19 vaccine boosters help? This Israeli study has answersMeanwhile, the booster campaign also began in nursing homes across the country on September 12, the Associated Press also reported, citing the country’s health ministry. Close to 18 million people would be eligible to receive booster doses. France became the first major European nation to begin inoculating its citizens with booster doses, with several other countries in Europe to follow.Earlier on August 24, the French National Authority for Health (HAS), announced its recommendations regarding the booster programme. It also said that the fourth wave of Covid-19 was proceeding in the country and was driven by the Delta variant. “HAS considers that there is no sufficient argument, till date, to preferentially recommend one vaccine over the other for the booster dose, and that the two available mRNA vaccines are very effective against severe forms of Covid-19, including those related to the Delta variant,” it said in a statement.The booster programme in France begins as 70% of the adult population have been fully vaccinated in the European Union. Data from the Covid-19 vaccine dashboard of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showed that as of September 1, 76.3% of the French population have been inoculated with at least one dose of the vaccine while 61.8% have been fully vaccinated.Notably, the World Health Organization has previously expressed their concerns about booster programmes in countries that have sufficient vaccine arsenal while some countries have not even delivered first doses to their population. Several WHO experts have earlier expressed concerns about equitable distribution of vaccines globally and also said that the present data does not show that a booster shot was needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-begins-administering-covid-19-boosters-for-65-people-with-underlying-health-conditions-101630508496382.html

It was India's first officially acknowledged contact with the Taliban since its formation in 90s.During the meeting, India raised the issues of safe return of its citizens still stranded in Afghanistan and concerns about Afghan soil being used for anti-India activities and terrorism. Stankezai reported assured the Indian ambassador that these issues would be "positively addressed".ALSO READ | India should play a constructive role in Afghanistan: Pak ambassador to ChinaOn the other hand, the negotiations between the Taliban and the leaders of the resistance against the Islamist outfit and tribal elders in Panjshir have come a cropper.

The commission added that additional funds could be made available.The EU is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis caused by the Syrian war when more than a million migrants entered the bloc. The EU will focus on development aid, including support for refugees in Afghanistan’s neighbors like Pakistan and Tajikistan to prevent migration flows from reaching the EU, according to the note. “The EU will engage and strengthen its support to third countries, in particular the neighboring and transit countries, hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees,” according to a statement after a Tuesday emergency meeting of EU home affairs ministers in Brussels. “The EU will also cooperate with those countries to prevent illegal migration from the region.”An email seeking comment from the commission wasn’t immediately returned. ‘Strategic Mistake’Support for refugees is a fraught topic in the bloc, with several member states firmly opposed to accepting any migrants. Janez Jansa, prime minister of Slovenia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, said on Twitter last month that Europe shouldn’t open any humanitarian migration corridors for Afghanistan to avoid the “strategic mistake” of 2015. Even though about 500,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan this year, flows of people into neighboring countries have been muted, according to the note, which added there had been no significant movements toward the EU. The EU has currently suspended development aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of the country but has earmarked about 1 billion euros under its current budget, according to the note. These funds would be conditional on a number of factors, including allowing safe passages, the respect of human rights, fighting terrorism and the creation of an inclusive government, the note said.The number of those fleeing Afghanistan is expected to rise, according to the note, with officials agreeing on the need for security checks and to address the risk of irregular migration and human smuggling. Officials also highlighted the risks posed by Afghanistan becoming a haven for terrorists, the dangers posed by the large amounts of weapons left behind by the US and the Taliban becoming an inspiration for extremist movements and disinformation, including in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-mulls-plan-to-spend-300-million-euros-to-resettle-30-000-afghan-refugees-101630501146192.html

The Northern Alliance, a coalition of ethnic Uzbek and Tajik forces concentrated in Panjshir Valley, has vowed to continue fighting the Taliban.Ahmad Massoud, son of the slain hero of the anti-Soviet resistance Ahmad Shah Massoud, has been leading the anti-Taliban coalition in Panjshir. Amrullah Saleh, the first vice president of the ousted Afghan government, has backed the coalition in their fight against the Taliban.The senior Taliban official blamed the leaders of Panjshir for the failed negotiations, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don't want the problems to be solved peacefully."Now it is up to you to talk to them," Muttaqi said in a message to the people of Panjshir. "Those who want to fight, tell them it is enough."Watch: Taliban men killed by Panjshir Resistance fightersReports suggest that the Taliban fighters attacked the valley from two fronts as soon as the last US soldiers boarded their flight out of Afghanistan to end the decades-long war.Fahim Dashti, an official of the National Resistance Front comprising anti-Taliban militia fighters and former Afghan security forces, said that the Taliban perhaps wanted to "try their luck.""By the grace of God, luck wasn't on their side," Dashti said in a video posted by Voice of America's Dari language service.The mountain valley, which begins around 80 kilometres north of the capital Kabul, stood strong against the Taliban rule from 1996-2001 before the US-led foreign troops invaded Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/those-who-want-to-fight-taliban-s-message-to-panjshir-leaders-after-talks-fail-101630496689639.html

Study explains||The Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) and Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis (Tdap) vaccines, which are given to children, are likely to give increased protection against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study has claimed. It also said that these vaccines have been associated with reduction in severity of the disease.While the MMR vaccine is given during early childhood, and Tdap preventive is administered every 10 years.The study has been carried out by the researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US. They said that these vaccines are designed to induce a strong and long-lasting immune response through the creation of memory T-cells and B-cells.These cells are capable of responding to protein targets called antigens present in other disease causing microbes, including the viral antigens in Sars-CoV-2, the researchers further said.The study has been published in the journal Med.The researchers conducted laboratory-based analyses using sensitive, new techniques to detect and characterise T-cell responses to antigens.They applied these techniques to measure the response of T-cells isolated from the blood of Covid-19 convalescent patients and those vaccinated against the disease to antigens from Sars-CoV-2 and the MMR and Tdap vaccines."The researchers observed an association where individuals with Covid-19 who had either MMR or Tdap vaccines had a much lower frequency of going to the intensive care unit or dying," said study co-author Andrew Lichtman.Those who had previously been vaccinated for MMR had a 38 per cent decrease in hospitalisation and a 32 per cent decrease in ICU admission or death, while patients previously vaccinated for Tdap had 23 per cent and 20 per cent decreased rates, according to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-can-routine-measles-and-tetanus-vaccination-prevent-covid-19-study-explains-101630496523401.html

China and Afghanistan are friendly countries. China does not want to harm Afghanistan, and Afghanistan does not want to harm China. The two countries always support each other,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Wang was responding to a question about reports that the Taliban will announce a new government on Friday. “The Afghan people, having suffered so much, are now standing at a new starting point for national peace and reconstruction. The international community is closely following developments including the formation of a new government in Afghanistan.”Wang added that China hopes that all parties in Afghanistan will build an open and inclusive political structure, adopt moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, and make a clean break with all terrorist groups and live in good terms with other countries, especially its neighbours.“China will as always pursue a friendly policy towards the entire Afghan people, respect Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and will not interfere in the country’s internal affairs,” Wang added.“The US forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan. But the murder of civilians by the US forces and their allies over the past 20 years must be investigated thoroughly and the killers must be brought to justice,” Wang said.Separately, in an interview to Chinese national broadcaster’s English channel, CGTN, the Taliban has said it is looking forward to developing a strong relationship with China. “China is a very important and strong country in our neighbourhood, and we have had very positive and good relations with China in the past,” Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the group, said.“We want to make these relations even stronger and want to improve the level of mutual trust,” Mujahid said, adding that Beijing can support Afghanistan in the economic sector. “We want them to boost exports to our country and help us in the development of our country.

It has been carried out by researchers in Brazil and published in the scientific journal Molecules.The researchers said that a molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the coronavirus' ability to multiply by 75 per cent. They arrived at the figure by conducting tests on monkeys.Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesised in the laboratory, said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study, in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary.The scientists called it a possible first step toward a drug to combat the virus causing Covid-19. They hope to test the substance in human cells but have not given any timeline.This is yet another experiment to find a way to stop Covid-19 from spreading, especially in the wake of reports from many countries that the effect of currently available vaccines is beginning to fade.Reserarchers in Britain released a study last week, which said that protection against Covid-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months.The effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine after the second dose fell from 88 per cent to 74 per cent, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE Covid study showed.For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77 per cent to 67 per cent after four to five months.Britain and other European nations are planning for a Covid-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-viper-s-venom-can-stops-covid-19-from-multiplying-claim-scientists-101630488455000.html

The presenter of the show, Yves de Mbella, has been suspended, the channel said.The prime-time show was broadcast on Monday where de Mbella asked his guest to demonstrate how he raped women using a female mannequin.At one point, a laughing de Mbella even helped the guest adjust the mannequin and asked him how he chose his victims, whether he preferred them "slim or fat" and whether the victims "enjoyed it".The man was later asked to give women advice to avoid being raped.The segment was swiftly condemned on social media platforms in Ivory Coast and across West and Central Africa. An online petition was also launched, which has so far received more than 30,000 people who have demanded punishment for the presenter.“Please tell me I’m dreaming,” Priss’K, an Ivorian rapper, wrote on Facebook.The country's independent communications council announced the suspension of de Mbella for 30 days, saying in a statement that the segment used obscene language, condoned rape and attacked the dignity of women.The popular presenter issued an apology in a lengthy Facebook post. "I'm sincerely sorry to have shocked everyone while trying to raise awareness," de Mbella wrote on Facebook. "I made an error.""I'm also sorry for everything that was said or done during that sequence of the programme that hurt," he wrote. "I beg for forgiveness from all victims of rape."The Nouvelle Chaine Ivoirienne (NCI) private television station has cancelled the final episode of this particular show which was scheduled to air on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivory-coast-tv-presenter-asks-guest-to-simulate-rape-suspended-after-outcry-101630484330323.html

"Mr President, we are facing a full-scale invasion, composed of Taliban, full Pakistani planning and logistical support, and at least 10-15,000 international terrorists, predominantly Pakistanis thrown into this, so that dimension needs to be taken account of,' Ghani told Biden, as reported by Reuters. The news agency accessed a transcript of the phone call and authenticated the 14-minute conversation.From the conversation, Reuters deciphered that neither Biden nor Ghani at that time could anticipate the imminent fall of the government as Biden talked about providing close air support to Afghanistan, while Ghani emphasised the need to move with speed.'Best military': What Joe Biden told Ashraf Ghani in their last phone call on July 23Afghanistan government officials, the former vice president Amrullah Saleh etc have been repeatedly pointing to Pakistan's support for the Taliban, which Pakistan ministers have been refuting vehemently.Pakistan featured in the conversation of Ghani and Biden on July 23 as Biden advised Ghani to attempt to change the perception of people by announcing to the world that Afghanistan has a plan to counter the Taliban offensive. To this, Ghani presented the bigger picture to Biden and explained that it was not only Taliban, there was full Pakistani planning and logistical support and around 10 to 15,000 international terrorists, predominantly Pakistanis thrown into this.Within weeks, the Taliban reached Kabul on August 15 prompting a collapse of the Ghani government. A day before, however, Ghani addressed the nation and assured the Afghans that he would mobilise the army, only to leave the country the very next day when the Taliban reached Kabul.On July 23 itself, Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, General Mark Milley and U.S. Central Command commander General Frank McKenzie spoke to Ghani.In July, both Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan PM Imran Khan exchanged barbs at the inaugural ceremony of the Central and South Asia connectivity in Uzbekistan, where Ghani said Pakistan was opening supporting and celebrating the Taliban's advances. "President Ghani, let me just say that the country that will be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan. Pakistan suffered 70,000 casualties in the last 15 years. The last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict," Imran Khan had said in reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-terrorists-coming-to-afghanistan-ghani-informed-biden-on-july-23-101630483729028.html

With the addition of Mu, now there are five variants of interest such as Eta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda and Mu.Here is all you need to know about this new variant1. This variant is scientifically known as B.1.621.2. Mu was first detected in Colombia in January and was classified as a variant of interest in August.3. Mu has mutations that indicate a risk of resistance to vaccines, but further studies are needed for better understanding.4. The variant might have immune escape properties as it has a constellation of mutations.C.1.2 Covid-19 variant: Centre says no cases in India so far, but how deadly is it?5. After Colombia, Mu has been reported in other South American countries and in Europe. Though it is not widespread across the globe, its presence is 39 per cent in Colombia.Apart from this variant, which has already been classified by the WHO, another variant C.1.2 has been detected. This has not been classified as either a variant of interest or a variant of concern, but the WHO said that it is monitoring the variant. None of these variants has been detected in India.Why emerging variants are significant even if they are not widespreadThese new variants are far from what Delta has become. But the emergence of new strains is of much importance to the scientific fraternity as strains are the virus's response to vaccines. Hence, chances are there that new variants may neutralise vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-mu-variant-of-covid-which-is-under-who-monitoring-at-present-101630480659853.html

The reason behind this move, according to a company note, is to keep its employees and their families healthy.According to the memo sent by Nomura to its employees, the rule will come into effect from October. It further said that all smoking rooms managed by the Nomura Group will be closed.Will Nomura punish its employees for smoking?No, according to Nomura's spokesperson Yoshitaka Otsu. The spokesperson told Bloomberg that the move is based on mutual trust.Japanese firms have been discouraging smoking at workplaces for years. And Nomura's move is a part of that. The companies have argued that if employees quit smoking, it will increase their productivity.Will the company monitor the employees?The answer to this again is no, according to Otsu. Since the move is based on trust, Nomura said it doesn't want to keep an eye on its employees.Nomura is introducing the measures to create a favorable working environment, prevent secondhand smoking and promote employee health, it had said in a separate statement last week.Smoking and work from homeThe National Cancer Centre in Japan carried out a survey in March this year, which revealed that cigarette consumption has increased in the island nation since the work from home culture began.The survey results showed that 2 in 10 smokers have a higher intake than earlier, because there are no restrictions at home.Nomura's targetNomura is seeking to reduce the smoking rate among its employees in Japan to 12% by 2025, compared with 20% in March 2020, according to its website. The brokerage has been providing financial aid to help workers quit since 2017.Other companies which have adopted similar strategySnacks manufacturer Calbee Inc. in 2018 prohibited smoking during working hours because the health of its employees and their family was “essential” for a company to grow.Food producer Ajinomoto Co. instituted a no-smoking-while-working policy in 2019, which also applies to staff working remotely.SoftBank Group Corp.’s telecom unit introduced a similar rule in April last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nomura-asks-employees-not-to-smoke-even-when-working-from-home-here-s-why-101630476245332.html

While some Americans are still in the country and the US authorities are yet to evacuate them along with Afghans who have been working for them, all soldiers have left the country after two decades of war.Here are the latest developments in the Afghanistan crisis since the US completed the withdrawal on Monday.Taliban meeting in KandaharTaliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid on Tuesday informed that leadership have been holding meetings in Kandahar province to discuss Afghanistan's political, security and social issues, now that it is under their control. "The leadership council has also discussed issues around forming the new government and its cabinet and has taken some decisions on providing services to the people," Tolo News reported citing Mujahid's tweets.India holds first formal meeting with Taliban leadersIndian envoy in Qatar Deepak Mittal met the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office to discuss regional security, the foreign ministry confirmed in a statement on Tuesday. The meeting was at the request of the Taliban and was the first between officials from both sides since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August 15.Kabul mayor imposes Sharia law in KabulNewly appointed Kabul mayor Hamdullah Nomani, who is also the head of the Taliban's municipality commission, enforced Sharia law throughout the capital of Kabul. In an interview with a local media report, Nomani stated that from now on corrupt individuals will be dealt with in accordance with Sharia law.Taliban take control of Kabul airportWith the exit of the US troops, the Taliban are in possession of Hamid Karzai International airport in Kabul. The symbolism of the airport was underlined Tuesday when the Taliban's top spokesman stood on its runway and declared victory over the United States. But what happens next remains unclear. Attacks in the past week have shown the airport is a target for terrorists, so security is the primary concern.Biden defends exit from AfghanistanUnder backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan, US President Joe Biden defended his handling of the withdrawal in the first statement since the process was completed on Monday. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” he said. “It was time to end this war,” he added later in his speech, pounding his fist on the lectern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-us-troops-leave-kabul-here-s-what-the-taliban-are-up-to-5-developments-101630474797778.html
01-09-2021||World||Yaqoob and Haqqani factions fight over Taliban government||Hectic negotiations are reported between Taliban leadership and the Haqqani Network over government formation in Afghanistan with Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the supreme leader of the Sunni Pashtun outfit, expected to be in Kabul where the ruling Cabinet could be announced as early as this evening or by tomorrow. A slightly indisposed Akhundzada is presently in Sunni Pashtun bastion of Kandahar.Also Read | Haqqani network is the sword arm of Taliban with Pakistan the common parentEven though the Taliban leadership is projecting a united front to the world, multiple fractures are being exposed within the UN designated terrorist group with Mullah Yaqoob, son of first Emir-ul-Momeen Mullha Omar, wanting to bring military elements into the Cabinet rather than political elements being pushed by Mullah Barader, the co-founder of the Sunni Islamist group. Reports from Kabul indicate that Mullah Yaqoob, who is also the head of military commission and deputy leader, has openly told that those living in luxury of Doha cannot dictate terms to those involved in askari jihad against the US led occupation forces. Mullah Barader and Sher Mohammed Stanekzai ran the Taliban’s political office from Doha and negotiated with US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad with Pakistan and UK brass involved in the exercise.There are several fault lines visible within the Taliban with tension between Mullah Yaqoob and the Haqqani terror empire controlling Kabul at present. There is friction between non-Pashtun Taliban and Kandahar faction just as there are differences between the Pashtun and non-Pashtun tribes. With everyone fighting for their piece of cake in the Afghan government, there is concern within Taliban leadership about the differences coming out in the open and triggering violence with each group fighting the other as in the mujahideen days of the 1990s. With US leaving behind more than USD 85 billion of weaponry in Afghanistan, there is enough ammunition with each faction to fight the other for at least a decade. Already, the minority Shia Hazaras of Central Afghanistan are up in arms with Taliban executing some 14 members of the community in Khadir district of Daykundi province.Also Read | 'Full independence', 'historic moments': Taliban after US troops leaveHowever, the biggest worry within the Sunni medieval theocracy are the differences between the Taliban under Yaqoob and the HQN under Sirajuddin Haqqani and could lead to pro-Afghanistan and pro-Pak factions within the ruling regime. While the Taliban leadership exercises its judgement rather than blindly take orders from the Pakistani deep state, the HQN network is a family run terror factory aided and abetted by the Pakistani ISI operating through retired army officers with jihadist inclinations. With the west turning its back on Afghanistan for time to come, Russia and China only interested in firewalling the bordering Central Asian Republics and Xinjiang province from the spread of jihad from Emirates of Afghanistan, Kabul will go dark for the world till the next major terror attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yaqoob-and-haqqani-factions-fight-over-taliban-government-101630474732128.html
01-09-2021||World||Canada: Liberal Party MP denies sexual harassment allegations||A sitting Indo-Canadian MP, part of Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau’s caucus, is facing charges of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff members over the past six years but remains a candidate as the September 20 Federal elections approach.Raj Saini, who has roots in Himachal Pradesh, has been the MP for the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Kitchener Centre in the province of Ontario since 2015.According to a report from the outlet CBC News, multiple sources “described four different cases where Saini allegedly made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate comments”. Saini denied the accusations to CBC News.It also reported that a former staffer filed a complaint related to alleged “unwelcome advances and harassing behaviour” with the Canadian Human Rights Commission last year.In a statement issued by his office, Saini denied the allegations, saying, “I have never acted inappropriately towards staff or constituents.”Saini also stated that he was made aware of one allegation last year and “insisted an independent third-party review of my office take place through the House of Commons. The outcome of that review, which was completed in June 2020, found that nothing arose regarding concerns of harassment in the office.”Asked about these developments while campaigning on Tuesday, his party leader Trudeau defended Saini, “I know Mr Saini has shared the details of all the processes that have been undertaken in his office because it’s really important that we respond to any concerns and issues brought up.”Trudeau has maintained his party has a zero tolerance policy towards matters of this nature. On Tuesday, he said, “We’ll continue to insist that everyone deserves to have a safe workplace.”CBC reported that the complaints against Saini date back to a party holiday gathering in December 2015 at a downtown Ottawa convention centre. The outlet said that four female staffers had complained about inappropriate acts then, and also named former MP Marwan Tabbara. The latter faced an internal party investigation and contested the 2019 Federal elections but was removed from the caucus after charges in a different case in 2020.Saini, however, has denied any wrongdoing, as he said, “Protecting my staff and ensuring they are respected is not something I take lightly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-liberal-party-mp-denies-sexual-harassment-allegations-101630474981152.html
01-09-2021||World||Canada polls: O’Toole posing tough challenge to incumbent Trudeau||While incumbent Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is an international political celebrity, the opponent who is threatening to displace him, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, remains largely unknown, even within Canada.However, as his party gains ground on the ruling Liberal Party, even leading in some polls to bag a large share of seats in the Federal elections scheduled for September 20, his profile has risen. More importantly for the relationship between Ottawa and New Delhi, which has suffered under Trudeau, O’Toole has a pro-India agenda as part of his platform.Born in Montreal, the 48-year-old is behind a party platform calling for Canada to join the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), the bloc that includes India, the United States, Japan and Australia. In contrast, the Canadian government has yet to present an updated Indo-Pacific policy that has been expected for months. O’Toole also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force for 12 years and was first elected to the House of Commons in 2012.Similarly, as negotiations for a free trade pact as well as an investment treaty with India haven’t progressed very far, O’Toole has promised to “pursue” these objectives. Both pacts were first proposed under the government of former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, Trudeau’s predecessor, and O’Toole had served as a veterans affairs minister in his cabinet.That theme appeared in an op-ed O’Toole wrote for the Canadian daily, National Post, in March, in which he noted, “Canada needs an economic future that reduces our dependence on China’s industry and marketplace. We can only accomplish that by deepening ties with the world’s largest democracy, India.”When Trudeau first became Prime Minister in 2015, the mandate letters for his finance minister as well as International Trade Minister included a focus on improving trade ties with India, but that has not come to fruition over the past six years. O’Toole, in the oped, said, “India is Canada’s tenth largest trading partner, but it has the potential to become our second. India’s economic transformation is under way, and it is one that should not only be applauded but supported.”It’s still a difficult path for O’Toole to get the top job as Trudeau’s Liberals remain favourites to win the maximum seats and form another minority government, though the Conservatives have closed the gap over the past ten days. O’Toole became the leader of his party in an upset win over former attorney general Peter McKay in the leadership race last year, and the question will be whether he can repeat that feat again as an underdog in the Federal polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-o-toole-posing-tough-challenge-to-incumbent-trudeau-101630473717058.html
01-09-2021||World||Biden defends decision to end ‘forever’ Afghan war||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday defended his decisions to end the war in Afghanistan and the evacuation operations forcefully in remarks from the White House that he was not going to “extend the forever war, and I was not extending the forever exit”.The US president called the operation that airlifted 120,000 Americans, allies and Afghan partners an “extraordinary success”.Biden also defended the exit date of August 31 saying it was not an “arbitrary deadline” but it was “designed to save American lives”.The last American military aircraft involved in the evacuation operation left the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul at 11.59pm local time on Monday with Major Gen Chris Donahue, commander of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division, the last US personnel to leave Afghan soil.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said, speaking from the Dining Room in an address to the nation.The American president defended his decisions to end the war, wrap up the evacuation operation before his self-imposed deadline of August 31 and pushed back against those who have argued that the US could have stayed longer in Afghanistan and the airlift could not have started earlier or have been more orderly.The American president reiterated that the decision to end the military operations at Kabul airport was based on “unanimous recommendation” of his civilian and military advisers, the secretary of state, the secretary of defence, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and all the service chiefs.Biden called the evacuation an “extraordinary success” saying “no country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country, as we have done”.To those who have argued the evacuation should have started earlier, in June of July, and in a more orderly manner, he said, that there still would have been a “rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the government, and it still would have been a very difficult and dangerous mission”.Biden said when he decided in April to end the Afghanistan war, the assumption was that the Afghan military that had been trained and equipped by the United States would put up a fight and there. “The assumption that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown turned out not to be accurate.”On the question of the US staying indefinitely, as some of his critics have argued for, he said he had only two options: accept the deal made by Trump and extend the timeline from May 1 to get more people out or “send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war”.Biden said staying in Afghanistan longer served no national interest, because of the goal of going there had been achieved a decade ago with the killing of Osama bin Laden and decimation of Al-Qaeda. The US had stayed there for another decade and it was time to end the war.Biden maintained the US will remain focused on combating terrorism, but it does not have to fight a ground war to do it. Using over-the-horizon capabilities, terrorists can be struck anywhere in without “American boots on the ground - or very few, if needed”.And to the Islamic State-Khorasan, which has claimed responsibility for the Kabul airport bombing that killed 170 Afghans and 13 US troops, Biden said: “We are not done with you yet.”The US killed two IS-K “planners” and “facilitators” in a drone strike in Nangarhar province and one suspected suicide bomber headed for the airport in another strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-defends-decision-to-end-forever-afghan-war-101630471438038.html
01-09-2021||World||'Best military': What Joe Biden told Ashraf Ghani in their last phone call on July 23||US President Joe Biden and former Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani spoke for the last time on July 23, weeks before the fall of Kabul on August 15, which saw Ghani leaving the country leading to an irrevocable fall of his government. According to Reuters, the last call between the duo lasted for roughly 14 minutes and they discussed military aid, political strategy etc. But none of them spoke anything about the possibility of the entire country falling to the Taliban, the news agency, which went through the transcript of the conversation, said."Reuters reviewed a transcript of the presidential phone call and has listened to the audio to authenticate the conversation. The materials were provided on condition of anonymity by a source who was not authorized to distribute it," the news agency said.Biden told Ghani that the US will provide close-air support if Ghani spells out a plan against the Taliban offensive. Biden also advised Ghani to get buy-in from powerful Afghans for a military strategy going forward, and then to put a “warrior” in charge of the effort, a possible reference to defence minister General Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Biden said he is not a "military guy" and hence can't advise Ghani on military strategy, but he advised him to work on improving Afghanistan's perception in front of the world.Also Read | 'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in AfghanistanIf Afghan politicians address a press conference at that time when the Taliban was escalating its advance and was capturing one district after another, then it might change the perception, Biden said.Did Biden praise the Afghan army?According to the report, Biden lauded Afghan armed forces and said, "You clearly have the best military". “You have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well," Biden told Ghani in the 14-minute phone call. “You have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well," Biden said to Ghani.“We are going to continue to fight hard, diplomatically, politically, economically, to make sure your government not only survives but is sustained and grows,” said Biden.The White House Tuesday declined to comment on the call, Reuters reported.The revelation comes at a time when the United States is putting the blame squarely on Afghan soldiers for losing the fight. Even in his latest statement, issued after the complete withdrawal of the US troops from Kabul, Biden said the US was ready to fight when the Afghanistan government failed its people.Full Pakistani planning: What did Ghani tell BidenAshraf Ghani told Biden that Afghanistan was facing a full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not the only ones attacking. Ghani reportedly said that apart from the Taliban, there was full Pakistani planning and logistical support, and 10-15,000 international terrorists." I just spoke again to Dr Abdullah earlier, he went to negotiate with the Taliban, the Taliban showed no inclination. We can get to peace only if we rebalance the military situation. And I can assure you… I have been to four of our key cities, I’m constantly travelling with the vice president and others, we will be able to rally. Your assurance of support goes a very long way to enable us, to really mobilize in earnest," Ghani said.'Karzai would not be helpful': Biden, Ghani disagreeBiden's advice for perception improvement included bringing together former president Hamid Karzai, former vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum. But Ghani was not on board with the proposal. “He is contrary, and time is of the essence, we cannot bring every single individual … We have tried for months with President Karzai.

If Pakistan's "military strategy" was somehow responsible factor in the defeat of the 300,000-strong Afghan army, whom the US had trained for so many years, then the US assessment that the Afghan army lost morale does not hold water, the ambassador wrote. The fall of Kabul proved the futility of the investment of the United States in the country, if anything, he wrote.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan invited global criticism after he said that the Taliban are not a military outfit that his army (in Pakistan) can hunt them down. After the fall of Kabul, Pakistani ministers also spoke to their counterparts in other countries on the issue of supporting Afghanistan at this crucial juncture.Islamabad 'fears' rise in violence along Afghan-Pak border, here's whyCongressman Michael G Waltz mentioned the Pak-Taliban conduit and sought the US sanction of Pakistan. "...I ask that your administration also consider sanctioning Pakistan unless they change course and make greater efforts to prevent the Taliban from using their border region to regroup between firefights," Waltz had written to Biden in August.My letter to Representative Waltz, responding to his observations on Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan. @PakinUSA @ForeignOfficePk @michaelgwaltz pic.twitter.com/tk6YEEM0dxAsad Majeed Khan's reply has come in this background where he, in turn, blamed the US for the fall of Kabul."The contention that Pakistan's military strategy was somehow the decisive factor in the defeat of the 300,000-strong Afghan National Defence and Security Forces-- trained and equipped at the cost of at least $83 billion to the American taxpayer-- does not square with the US government's assessment about the issued of low morale, desertions and ghost soldiers that had long plagues the ANDSF," he wrote.Pakistan has been consistently saying that it has no favourites in Afghanistan and would work with any government in the country. Pakistan has also joined the United States, China, Russia is "explicitly opposing any effort to impose a government by force" in Kabul, Khan wrote in his scathing letter."The swift collapse of the Afghan government has, if anything, proven the futility of investing more effort and money into finding a military solution to a political problem," Khan wrote.Khan wrote that though Afghanistan's fall was sudden and shocking, it was not surprising at all as the Afghan government had been steadily losing territory for years. "..demoralised soldiers do not fight for a corrupt, kleptocratic leadership that will bolt at the first hint of trouble," Khan said adding that Pakistan has its embassy functioning in Kabul and it will keep its doors and borders open to the Afghan people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-fell-because-of-kleptocratic-leadership-stop-blaming-us-pakistan-envoy-writes-to-us-congressman-101630466328618.html

"My fellow Americans, the war in Afghanistan is now over," Biden said at the White House. "I'm the fourth president who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war.

01-09-2021||World||Dozens of dogs left at Kabul airport; 'Not ours,' says Pentagon||After reports claimed that dozens of dogs have been left by the US forces at the mercy of the Taliban, waiting to be slaughtered, the Pentagon called those reports 'erroneous' and said that the US military did not leave any dog in the airport and the photos and videos that are doing the rounds on social media are not those of the military, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby tweeted.The reports emerged after an image of dogs inside cages in front of a demilitarised helicopter went viral on social media. The Pentagon claimed that those dogs did not belong to the US military. Kabul Small Animal Rescue was in the custody of those dogs, Kirby said.To correct erroneous reports, the U.S. Military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, including the reported military working dogs. Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care."To correct erroneous reports, the U.S. Military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, including the reported military working dogs. Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care," Kirby said.Kabul Small Animal Rescue is an animal rights organisation operating in Afghanistan for the past year. It had initially planned to evacuate some animals but was forced to leave their cages at the airport as dogs were not allowed on military aircraft and private charter aircraft were not allowed into Kabul.“We are heartbroken that the aircraft we secured to transport the rescued dogs of Kabul Small Animal Rescue out of Afghanistan were not ultimately allowed to take the animals and their caretakers safely out of the country,” said Lori Kalef, director of Programs at SPCA International.So the dogs under their custody had to be released into the airport which turned them into homeless strays, a statement from the KSAR said. It also said that the NGO will return to the airport when it is safe and will re-rescue the animals.People for the ethical treatment of animals (Peta) started a petition based on reports and said: "...dozens of US military working dogs, numerous animal companions belonging to evacuated Americans, and more than 100 dogs previously rescued from the streets of Afghanistan along with an unknown number of rescued cats and the humans caring for these animals were left behind in Afghanistan after the last US plane left Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul." The statement also added that Peta was trying to verify these reports."Red tape and catastrophes have apparently wrecked every attempt to secure a flight out for these animals and their caretakers. While the cats and staff are reportedly safe for the time being, many dogs—including a pug belonging to an American Embassy worker—may have been let loose to fend for themselves on and around airport grounds. These animals and the humans who have been caring for them desperately need you to speak up!" the animal rights group said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-dogs-left-at-kabul-airport-not-ours-says-pentagon-101630462845286.html
01-09-2021||World||Will continue drone strikes in Afghanistan 'if and when needed': Pentagon||A day after the last remaining troops of the United States left Afghanistan, the Pentagon on Tuesday said that it will continue to conduct drone strikes against the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and other terrorist groups operating within the South Asian nation. The ISIS-K is the same group that carried out an attack on Kabul airport last week killing at least 169 Afghans and 13 US service members.Following the attack, the US also retaliated with drone strikes against an ISIS-K planner, a facilitator and a suspected suicide car bomber."We have the capability from an over the horizon perspective of ensuring our national security interests are protected and defended," said the press secretary of Pentagon, John Kirby according to Fox News. "And what I would tell you, without getting into hypotheticals or speculating about future operations, we're going to continue to maintain those capabilities and use them if and when we need to," Kirby added.The longest war of America ended late on Monday after the US withdrew the last remaining troops from Afghanistan. The chaotic exit led to Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan and pushed the war-torn country back to where it was in 2001. Though international affairs observers are sceptical about the Taliban, infamous for their treatment of women and girls, as well as a brutal justice system, the group has repeatedly promised to have a more tolerant and moderate regime this time.On Tuesday, Taliban leaders walked across the runway of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport after the last American planes left Afghanistan. They also fired celebratory shots in the air and called it a "major victory." "This victory belongs to us all," Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said, adding, "the world should have learned their lesson and this is the enjoyable moment of victory."In a speech on Tuesday, President Joe Biden reiterated the US' stand against the ISIS-K group. "To ISIS-K we are not done with you yet," Biden said, adding that "to those who wish America harm, we will hunt you down and you will pay the ultimate price."Defending a decision that drew sharp criticism and scrutiny for its execution, Biden also said the real decision in Afghanistan was "between leaving and escalating," framing his choice to withdraw troops as the only option aside from surging more forces to the country. "I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit," he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-continue-drone-strikes-in-afghanistan-if-and-when-needed-pentagon-101630460094669.html
01-09-2021||World||'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in Afghanistan||In his first address after the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan, US President Joe Biden said that this was the 'right, wise and the best' decision for America'. Blaming Donald Trump for an agreement with the Taliban, Biden said that when he came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling of contesting nearly half of the country. "The previous administration’s agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1st deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn’t attack any American forces, but if we stayed, all bets were off," he said.The president touched upon several issues relating to the US, Afghanistan, ISIS in his speech:'Afghan forces did not hold on'"...We were ready when the Afghan Security Forces — after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own — did not hold on as long as anyone expected. We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to US personnel and our Allies," Biden said blaming the failure of the Afghan forces.US does not take the Taliban by their word"The Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans. We don’t take them by their word alone but by their actions, and we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met," Biden said adding that leaving on August 31 was not due to any arbitrary deadline but to save American lives.Trump released top Taliban commanders"My predecessor, the former President, signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May the 1st, just months after I was inaugurated. It included no requirement that the Taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the Afghan government, but it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the Taliban’s top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan," Biden said.Not against threats of 2001, but against 2021 threatsDefending the decision of leaving Afghanistan since the national interest of the United States, Biden said that the US now can't afford to address the threats it used to face in 2001. "This is a new world. The terror threat has metastasized across the world, well beyond Afghanistan. We face threats from al-Shabaab in Somalia; al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula; and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia," he said.Watch | Warning for ISIS-K, message for Americans: Joe Biden after US troops leave AfghanistanNot done with the ISIS-K yet"We will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries. We just don’t need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what’s called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground — or very few, if needed. We’ve shown that capacity just in the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our servicemembers and dozens of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet," Biden said.'Maybe it’s because my deceased son, BeauBiden remembered his son Beau Biden who served in Iraq for a full year as he said he was committed to stopping the war. Beu died in 2015 at the age of 46 from brain cancer. "I don’t think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 per cent of this country who put that uniform on, who are willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. Maybe it’s because my deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq for a full year, before that. Well, maybe it’s because of what I’ve seen over the years as senator, vice president, and president traveling these countries," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maybe-it-s-because-my-deceased-son-biden-on-ending-war-in-afghanistan-101630458705066.html
01-09-2021||World||Islamabad 'fears' rise in violence along Afghan-Pak border, here's why||There is growing concern among Pakistani officials about security in neighbouring Afghanistan, as the Taliban tries to form a government and stabilise the country following the departure of the US and other foreign forces.Islamabad is particularly worried about militant fighters from a separate, Pakistani Taliban group crossing from Afghanistan and launching lethal attacks on its territory. Thousands of Pakistanis have been killed in jihadist violence in the last two decades.Underlining the security threat within Afghanistan, in the last few days, a suicide bombing claimed by an Afghan offshoot of Islamic State outside Kabul airport killed more than 100 people, including 13 US troops.A rocket attack on the airport followed, and on Sunday militant gunfire from across the border in Afghanistan killed two Pakistani soldiers."The next two to three months are critical," a senior Pakistani official said, adding that Islamabad feared a rise in militant attacks along the Afghan-Pakistan border, as the Taliban tried to fill a vacuum left by the collapse of Afghan forces and the Western-backed administration."We (the international community) have to assist the Taliban in reorganising their army in order for them to control their territory," the source added, referring to the threat posed by resurgent rival militant groups including Islamic State.US officials have repeatedly accused Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taliban, which fought in a civil war in the mid-1990s before seizing power in 1996.Islamabad, one of the few capitals to recognise the Taliban government that was toppled in 2001, denies the charge.Pakistan's government has said that its influence over the movement has waned, particularly since the Taliban grew in confidence once Washington announced the date for the complete withdrawal of US and other foreign troops.The official, who has direct knowledge of the country's security decisions, said Pakistan planned to send security and intelligence officials, possibly even the head of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, to Kabul to help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military.An Afghan Taliban spokesperson did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on security relations with Pakistan.Pakistan expects Taliban cooperationThough recognition of a new Taliban government was not immediately on the table, the official said, the world should not abandon Afghanistan."Whether we recognise the Taliban government or not, stability in Afghanistan is very important."The official warned that Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), a loosely affiliated offshoot of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, was actively looking to launch attacks and recruit new fighters.Left unhindered, it would almost certainly grow from relatively small numbers currently.The United States recently launched two drone strikes targeting ISIS-K militants, including one in Kabul and one near the eastern border with Pakistan.The strikes followed a pledge by President Joe Biden that the United States would hunt down the militants behind the recent suicide bombing.The Taliban criticised the strikes as a "clear attack on Afghan territory".Pakistan, whose armed forces also possess unmanned drones as well as conventional aircraft, will avoid intervening directly in Afghanistan if at all possible, said the official.The Afghan Taliban have reassured their neighbour that they will not allow their territory to be used by anyone planning attacks on Pakistan or any other country.But Islamabad expected the Afghan Taliban to hand over militants planning attacks against Pakistan, the official added, or at least force them from their mutual border, where Pakistani troops have been on high alert in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamabad-fears-rise-in-violence-along-afghan-pak-border-here-s-why-101630458612771.html

Reports said that the video surfaced on Monday just after the US troops left the country and went viral for two reasons. First, the Taliban are not believed to have trained pilots. So any flying video from Kandahar is creating interest on social media. Second, a man was seen 'hanging' from the helicopter. Republican senator Ted Cruz shared the video and slammed Joe Biden's 'Afghanistan catastrophe', claiming that the Taliban hanged a man from an American Blackhawk helicopter.Afghan pilot flying this is someone I have known over the years. He was trained in the US and UAE, he confirmed to me that he flew the Blackhawk helicopter. Taliban fighter seen here was trying to install Taliban flag from air but it didn’t work in the end. https://t.co/wnF8ep1zElAfter the video went viral, some social media accounts claimed that it was not what it looked like as the man seen dangling from the helicopter was actually a Taliban fighter who was trying to install a Taliban flag from the air. The Blackhawk was also being flown by an Afghan pilot, training in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, and not a Taliban. Asvaka news agency also posted the same video claiming that the Black Hawk was seen over the Kandahar governor office. Reports claimed that the man was actually trying to install a flag on the governor's office, from the air. But it did not work in the end.It turns out the post I shared w/ a video of Taliban “hanging a man” from a helicopter may be inaccurate. So I deleted the tweet. What remains accurate is:- The Taliban are brutal terrorists.- We left them millions in US military equipment, including Black Hawk helicopters. https://t.co/zOvNM5UXUWReuters Factchack claimed that a closer shot of the video shows that the "man is alive, despite the contrary claims".Following this, Ted Cruz deleted his former tweet and wrote, "It turns out the post I shared w/ a video of Taliban “hanging a man” from a helicopter may be inaccurate.

01-09-2021||World||Joe Biden says he did not want to extend the ‘forever war’ or ‘forever exit’||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Tuesday defended his decision to end the war in Afghanistan and the evacuation operations saying forcefully in remarks from the White House that he was not going to “extend the forever war, and I was not extending the forever exit”.The US President also called the operation that airlifted 120,000 of Americans, allies and Afghan partners an “extraordinary success”.Biden also defended the exit date of August 31, saying it was not fixed arbitrarily and that it was designed to save lives.The last American military aircraft involved in the evacuation left the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul at 11:59 pm local time, with Major General Chris Donahue, commander of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division, the last US personnel to leave Afghan soil. It marked the conclusion of the US’ military mission in Afghanistan, ending its longest war and bringing down the curtain on a 20-year-old sketchy campaign that ended with a frantic last-minute rush of evacuations and a suicide bombing that killed 13 Americans and 170 Afghans.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said, adding, “I take responsibility for the decision.”The US President reiterated that the decision to end the military operations at Kabul airport was based on “unanimous recommendation” of his civilian and military advisors, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the service chiefs.Calling the evacuation an “extraordinary success” the US President said no country has done anything like this ever. “No country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country, as we have done,” he said.To those who have argued the evacuation should have started earlier and in a more orderly manner, he said, “I respectfully disagree.” There would still have been a crush as the airport and a breakdown in confidence in the government would have followed, it “still would have been very difficult and dangerous mission”.Biden said when he decided in April to end the Afghanistan war, the assumption was that the Afghan military that had been trained and equipped by the United States would put up a fight and there. “That assumption that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown turned out not to be accurate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-did-not-want-to-extend-the-forever-war-or-forever-exit-101630447134834.html
01-09-2021||World||Joe Biden defends timing of Afghan exit, says it saved US lives||President Joe Biden defended his handling of the US exit from Afghanistan, praising as historic a weeks-long evacuation of more than 100,000 people and rejecting criticism that the withdrawal was mishandled.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” he said. “It was time to end this war,” he added later in his speech, pounding his fist on the lectern. Republicans have said Biden should have extended an Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw until every American was removed from the country. About 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan, according to the State Department, and the president said his decision was not “arbitrary.”The deadline “was designed to save American lives,” he said. The US would have risked additional casualties in renewed combat with the Taliban had its forces remained, he said.He described the US airlift from Kabul’s airport over the last month as unprecedented. More than 117,000 people were removed, including about 6,000 Americans.“No nation, no nation has ever done anything like it in all the history,” he said.Biden’s political opponents have criticised the president’s withdrawal strategy, saying the US should have begun removing people from the country earlier and should have operated more forcefully within Kabul -- actions the president maintains would have risked combat with Taliban forces and further American casualties.“I believe there should be accountability for what I see as the biggest failure in American government on a military stage in my lifetime,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.The president’s critics have also argued that by leaving, Biden has increased the likelihood the country would once again become a breeding ground for international terrorism as the Taliban struggle to unify disparate factions and keep the economy afloat.But Biden again described himself as bound by an agreement his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, struck with the Taliban last year to withdraw from the country. While some critics have said Biden could have abandoned or substantially renegotiated the deal, and Trump and his allies have tried to recast the agreement as conditional, the president insisted any major change would have led to fresh violence.“We were left with a simple decision: Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration and leave Afghanistan or say we weren’t leaving and commit another tens of thousands more troops going back to war,” he said. “That was the choice, the real choice, between leaving or escalating.”Biden promised during his campaign that he would withdraw the US from Afghanistan, a position broadly supported among the American public prior to the evacuation effort, polls showed. Though Republicans have criticized the execution of the withdrawal, Trump sought to leave even faster, striking a deal with the Taliban in his final year in office to exit the country by May 1 of this year.But a Reuters/Ipsos poll published Monday showed that less than 40% approved of Biden’s handling of the withdrawal and that three-quarters of Americans wanted US forces to remain until every American civilian was evacuated.For years, US politicians and military leaders have described the Afghanistan government and army as more stable and capable than they proved during the Taliban takeover. In his speech, Biden suggested that Americans had been misled.“It was time to be honest with the American people again,” Biden said. “We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-defends-timing-of-afghan-exit-saying-it-saved-us-lives-101630441134726.html
