This is designed to limit campaigning too early.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tedros-poised-for-re-election-at-who-as-support-grows-diplomats-say-101632420230180.html

Now, they are the target||The Kabul airport blast in August and the subsequent explosions in many places in Afghanistan prove that the Islamic State is using the Taliban's tactic to attack the new government in Afghanistan. A Reuters report analysed the recent attacks and said that though the Taliban are underplaying the threat from the ISIS-Khorasan, the danger is real.The report said that the attackers used the same tactic the Taliban once used - pasting sticky bombs to the underside of the cars. This was the Taliban's operation style and using this they attacked officials and civil society figures."We are worried about these sticky bombs that once we used to apply to target our enemies in Kabul. We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully," one of the Taliban intelligence officials told Reuters.While the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan has apparently bolstered groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, ISIS-K is now a threat to the Taliban government.The Taliban have claimed to have killed three ISIS-K men on Wednesday night but according to intelligence officials Reuters spoke to, the group is still capable of striking an attack.The ISIS-K first emerged in late 2014 and then declined around 2018 as they were targetted by both the Taliban and the US forces. According to analysts, ISIS-K has a strength of under 2,000 fighters and it draws many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or Pakistan's TTP. The release of the prisoners by the Taliban, after it captured Afghanistan strengthened the organisation to some extent, though its fund has dried up. While there are visible signs of resentment in the Taliban amid reports of clashes between the Taliban and the Haqqani, teh ISIS-K has the chance of gaining new members, the report said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-once-used-sticky-bombs-to-attack-now-they-are-the-target-101632413404351.html

Meade base north of Washington Thursday was just an exercise, with no casualties as originally reported, a base official said.Andrew Arconti, chief of plans and operations at the base, told AFP that the ostensible incident was a planned exercise for such emergencies, after another official had confirmed the incident to AFP."The reports of a shooting at Fort Meade are false. This was a planned exercise," the base said in a subsequent statement.Initially, various base officials had confirmed to US media that there had been an "active shooter" who had been "contained."The initial reports drew attention because Ft. Meade, in Maryland, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Washington, is home to the government's largest and most secretive signals intelligence agency, the National Security Agency, as well as the US Cyber Command, which conducts offensive and defensive cyber operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/official-says-shooting-at-at-us-army-base-was-an-exercise-no-casualties-101632415300766.html
23-09-2021||World||Indian PM Narendra Modi meets CEOs of American firms||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened his three-day visit to the United States on Thursday with back-to-back meetings with CEOs of five top American companies - from IT sector to finance to defence to renewable energy - that are looking to either bring new investments into India or expand their existing presence.Two of these CEOs are of Indian descent: Vivek Lall of the defence giant General Atomics and Shantanu Narayen of Adobe.“We talked about an incredible opportunity to advance the industry not only domestically in India but India as an export(er) of technology, everything about the digital transformation, enabled by 5G combined with the design in India,” Cristiano Amon, CEO of IT giant Qualcomm, said after the meeting. “We talked about semiconductors which is kind of an important, I think, topic of conversation. And, we talked about the opportunity to continue to build an incredible mobile ecosystem that is developing in India.”As a newcomer to the field of semiconductor, India has been aggressively wooing manufacturers to set up shop there. Securing semiconductor supply-chain is expected to be a key issue for discussion on Friday at the first in-person summit of the Quad leader US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four leaders are expected to agree to work together to secure the semiconductor supply chain. The US and Japan are the world’s top makers of semiconductors along with China, Taiwan and South Korea.Other CEOs who met Narendra Modi were Mark Widmar of First Solar, which is a manufacturer of solar panels; Stephen A Schwarzman of Blackstone, a global investment management company.Mark Widmar said after the meeting that India has struck “really strong balance between industrial policy as well as trade policy” which makes it an ideal opportunity for companies like First Solar to establish manufacturing in India”.Discussions with Narayen, an Indian-American, focused ‘on leveraging technology to provide smart education to youngsters and enhance research”, the prime minister’s office wrote in a tweet, adding, “They also discussed the vibrant start-up sector in India, powered by the Indian youth.”Previewing these meeting a source said on Wednesday that these “are CEOs that represent very large corporate interests, companies that have a particular expertise that’ve invested in India and have the potential to invest significantly in India.”The meeting with Lall is specially noteworthy in view of 30 Predator MQ-9 unarmed drones made by General Atomics that Indian plans to acquire, in addition to the two already in service with the Indian Navy.Vivek Lall said he had an “outstanding” meeting with the prime minister and welcomed recent policy changes in India’s drones policy as “very laudable policy prescriptions and reforms” that “catalyse a lot of interest and investments in India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-pm-narendra-modi-meets-ceos-of-american-firms-101632413758333.html
23-09-2021||World||Taliban Cabinet has no 'actual' power and that's why they are fighting: Report||Amid reports that Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was physically attacked by Haqqani leader Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, following which several speculations over the present condition of the Taliban leader, reports suggest that the divisions among the Taliban are deeper than what appears to be. While the Taliban and the Haqqanis are on two separate camps, there is a division between the hardliners and the moderate Taliban leaders and a division between Taliban fighters and Taliban politicians, Al Jazeera reported.Quoting analysts, the report said that the present Cabinet does not have actual power. The real power lies among a secretive shura in Kandahar where Taliban chief and government head Hibatulah Akhundzada is based. Several Taliban leaders are unhappy with their positions in the administration, the report said.Hardline versus moderate facesLeaders like Mullah Baradar, Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai are the moderate faces of the Taliban, while Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, son of Taliban founder Mullah Muhammad Omar, is one of the hardliners. The Cabinet that the Taliban have finally announced is inclusive at its best as no further accommodation is possible, the report said quoting experts.Fighters versus politiciansThe report said that Taliban fighters are after the spoils of the war while the Taliban leadership is trying to allay the fears of the people. “Sources speaking to Al Jazeera said as with other Afghan governments, the divisions among the Taliban fall along personality lines. But unlike previous administrations, the Taliban does not just suffer from overly ambitious members or opposing political views, its split is much more fundamental,” the report said. While the new leadership is torn in all these divisions, Mullah Baradar has disappeared from the public view amid reports that he had been killed. To refute those reports, the Taliban released his video where he was seen reading a statement that there was no strife inside the Taliban. Baradar was also photographed attending a meeting with the United Nations officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-cabinet-has-no-actual-power-and-that-s-why-they-are-fighting-report-101632412929817.html
23-09-2021||World||EU demands single charging plug for phones, Apple raises concern||The European Union unveiled plans Thursday to require smartphone makers to adopt a single charging method for mobile devices.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, proposed legislation that would mandate USB-C cables for charging, technology that many device makers have already adopted. The main holdout is Apple, which said it was concerned the new rules would limit innovation, and that would end up hurting consumers. iPhones come with the company’s own Lightning charging port, though the newest models come with cables that can be plugged into a USB-C socket.The push by the EU will certainly be cheered by the millions of people who have rummaged through a drawer full of cables for the right charger. But the EU also wants to cut down on the 11,000 metric tons of electronic waste thrown out every year by Europeans.The commission said the typical person living in the EU owns at least three chargers, and use two regularly, but 38% of people report not being able to charge their phones at least once because they couldn’t find a compatible charger. Some 420 million mobile phones or portable electronic devices were sold in the EU last year.The new rules also call for standardizing fast charging technology and giving consumers the right to choose whether to buy new devices with or without a charger, which the EU estimates will save consumers 250 million euros ($293 million) a year.After attempting for more than a decade to cajole the industry into adopting a common standard - efforts that whittled dozens of different charging plugs down to a handful - the EU’s executive Commission is pushing the issue.“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said. “With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”Companies will get two years to adapt to the new rules once they take effect. The rules would apply only to electronics sold in the European single market's 30 countries, but, like the EU’s strict privacy regulations, they could end up becoming a de facto standard for the rest of the world.Apple said it shared the European Commission's commitment to protecting the environment but questioned whether the proposals would help consumers.“We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” the company said in a statement.Breton denied that the new rules would slow innovation.“If Apple wants to continue to have their own plug, they will have the ability to do it. It’s not against innovation, it’s just to make the lives of our fellow citizens a little bit more easy,” Breton said at a press briefing in Brussels, adding that device makers could still put two different ports on their phones if they want.Under the proposed law, which must still be scrutinized and approved by the European Parliament, phones, tablets, digital cameras, handheld video game consoles, headsets and headphones sold in the European Union would all have to come with USB-C charging ports. Earbuds, smartwatches and fitness trackers aren’t included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-demands-single-charging-plug-for-phones-apple-raises-concern-101632402631278.html

And now there are two sets of representatives of Afghanistan in the United Nations. A diplomatic source told Pakistan newspaper Dawn that the former representative would continue to occupy the mission until "the credential committee takes a decision". On Tuesday, the former representatives even attended the session that US President Joe Biden addressed.The currently accredited ambassador of Afghanistan in the UN is Ghulam Isaczai. On September 15, he sent a letter to the UN saying that his team will represent Afghanistan in the UNGA session.On September 15, Afghanistan's new foreign ministry, now under the control of the Taliban, sent a letter to the UN requesting to participate in the session. Taliban leader Suhail Shaheen was named as the representative.Afghanistan is slated to address the United National General Assembly by September 27 and it is unlikely that a decision will be taken before that on whether the Taliban representative to UN will be accepted. Reports said the United National will not make a decision until and unless the issue of Taliban's recognition is addressed.However, both the letters have been sent to the credential committee of the UN after consultations with General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid of Maldives.So how will the ousted team of Afghanistan speak at the international forum? Reports said there is an option to not allow that team either because giving them a platform might indicate the UN's support to the ousted government.When the Taliban last ruled from 1996 to 2001, the UN refused to recognise their government and instead gave Afghanistan’s seat to the previous government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-not-take-part-in-unga-depite-naming-suhail-shaheen-as-spokesperson-101632401940836.html

23-09-2021||World||‘Frustrated’ US lawmakers walked out of briefing on Afghanistan: Report||Lawmakers reportedly walked out of a “classified briefing” on Afghanistan with members of US president Joe Biden's administration, doing so as their questions went "unanswered." The briefing was held by officials from the State Department, Department for Homeland Security, and Office of the Director of National Security for members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Also Read | It's Indo-Pacific in Quad, Afghanistan a priority in UNGAThe “frustrated” lawmakers belonged to the ruling Democratic party, as well as Biden's predecessor Donald Trump's Republicans, CNN said of Wednesday's interaction, adding that Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the committee, told the channel that “everyone walked out of the meeting.”“I don't think they know all the answers, quite honestly,” McCaul told CNN.The source of “frustration,” according to the lawmakers, is that they don't understand why State Department officials continue to say, both privately and officially, that about 100 more American citizens in Afghanistan wish to be evacuated in the wake of the Taliban's August 15 power grab, but, on the other hand, also say that 75 Americans have been flown out of the war-torn nation in recent weeks.The State Department, however, has described “dynamic situation on the ground” as the reason why a more precise figure cannot be provided. “As a general matter, we do not comment on communications with the Congress, especially those held in a classified setting,” CNN quoted an official as saying.Some Democrats, meanwhile, gave a totally different sequence of events, saying that many members were “satisfied” with the meeting. The reason for leaving the briefing, they said, was that several Republicans were not wearing their Covid-19 face masks.The United States completed its military pullout from Afghanistan on August 30, day before a self-imposed deadline to do so. Though this ended its 20-year-long military presence in that country, president Biden came under fire over its execution, with desperate Afghans thronging Kabul International Airport to leave their homeland for safer destinations.

Using a French-English mix, Johnson asked France to “get a grip” and give allies in the United States and Australia “a break”, even as Paris recalled its ambassadors from the US and Australia, and snubbed Britain.Speaking a day after he met US president Joe Biden in Washington, Johnson told reporters: “I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to 'prenez un grip' (get a grip) about all this, 'Donnez-moi un break' (give me a break) because this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security.”Also Read | Boris Johnson says humanity must ‘grow up’ and face climate changeHe was translating the English phrases ‘get a grip’ and ‘give me a break’ literally into French.Notably, France has been fuming ever since the United States and the United Kingdom made the surprise announcement about the deal to build nuclear submarines for Australia – thus scuppering a previous French deal to sell conventional submarines. Paris called the US-Australian plan, which was launched as part of a new Indo-Pacific security group along with Britain, a stab in the back and also pulled its ambassador from Australia.However, in a move that is expected to simmer down the tensions, US president Joe Biden held a phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron this week – a “friendly” conversation which had the two leaders, according to the White House, vowing to launch “in-depth consultations... for ensuring confidence” and to meet in Europe at the end of October.Also Read | French Prez Macron, upset over AUKUS, dials PM Modi, discusses Indo-PacificHowever, Boris Johnson's recent comments towards France are likely to further fuel Paris' anger, the Reuters news agency reported citing two diplomatic sources, who said that there had already been instructions to limit contacts with Britain in the immediate term.Britain's role in pushing the new partnership appears to have been bigger than initially thought, officials have said, with the deal taking shape during a summit of G7 leaders in Cornwall in June that President Emmanuel Macron also attended.“It’s true that going back on a commitment made and the word he gave is something that Boris Johnson finds hard to see why that would be a problem,” Nathalie Loiseau, former French Europe minister and European lawmaker, said on Twitter. “This is the whole problem, however, when one claims to want an international order based on rules and relationships based on trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/give-me-a-break-says-boris-johnson-as-france-upset-over-submarine-deal-101632383445032.html

23-09-2021||World||US court orders Facebook to release data related to violence against Rohingya in Myanmar||A US federal judge has ordered social media platform Facebook to hand over records related to accounts it had shut down in 2018 and were linked to the anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar, Reuters reported on Thursday.The judge in Washington DC criticised Facebook for failing to hand over critical data to investigators seeking to prosecute the country for international crimes against the Muslim minority Rohingya, rejecting the tech monopoly’s arguments of protecting privacy as “rich with irony”."Facebook taking up the mantle of privacy rights is rich with irony. News sites have entire sections dedicated to Facebook's sordid history of privacy scandals," the judge said in the ruling.Facebook has been refusing to release data on violence against Rohingya, citing a US law which bars electronic communications companies from disclosing user information, but the judge ruled since the accounts were deleted, they would not be covered under the law and not sharing the content would "compound the tragedy that has befallen the Rohingya".The Rohingya, who have been described by United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as "one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world", are one of the many ethnic minorities in Myanmar. Majority of Rohingya Muslims used to reside in Rakhine state prior to their exodus in August of 2017. After the crackdown by the Myanmar military, also known as Tatmadaw, during the rule of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled the country to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh.The Myanmar army was believed to have carried out mass killings and rapes of Rohingya Muslims. A report published by UN investigators in August 2018 found Myanmar's military guilty of carrying out mass killings and rapes with "genocidal intent".Also Read: Myanmar junta leader casts doubt on return of Rohingya refugeesGambia, a small Muslim-majority nation in West Africa, has taken up the cause of violence against Rohingya in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Myanmar of violating the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide, and wants data from Facebook to fight the case.The New York Times published a report in October 2018, unearthing how members of Myanmar military had turned Facebook “into a tool of ethnic cleansing” by putting up fake posts on how Islam was a global threat to Buddhism, and a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man.The report also found that Myanmar military exploited Facebook's wide reach to create a hate campaign against the country's Muslim minority Rohingya population that goes back half a decade. While Facebook did take down these social media accounts run by military personnel in August of 2018 the actual extent of the damage caused by it remains unknown.These posts and accounts which since then have been deleted have been held responsible for turning a majority of the population indifferent to what was inflicted on the Rohingya. In 2018, UN human rights investigators said Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-orders-facebook-to-release-data-related-to-violence-against-rohingya-in-myanmar-101632381105914.html

Happy International Day of Sign Languages!”In the post's caption, Morrison added: “I’d like to say a heartfelt thank you to all our Auslan interpreters for your tireless hard work, stepping up day after day to help keep your fellow Australians informed during this Covid-19 pandemic.”He also thanked the Deaf Society and Deaf Services of Australia for the work they do to help empower with non-verbal communication those who are hearing impaired.While it is unclear how many sign languages currently exist across the world, most countries generally have their own native sign language, and some have more than one. Some of these sign languages, like Auslan, have also obtained legal recognition.This year’s theme for the International Day of Sign Languages, declared by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) - ‘We Sign For Human Rights’ - projects “how each of us – deaf and hearing people around the world – can work together hand in hand to promote the recognition of our right to use sign languages in all areas of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-international-day-of-sign-languages-scott-morrison-uses-auslan-to-send-a-message-101632378970378.html
23-09-2021||World||Not going AUKUS way: India okay with Quad emerging as non-military entity||While India has sought to publicly downplay the impact of the recently launched security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) on the Quad - both of whom are focused on the Indo-Pacific region - it is secretly pleased that the latter group has been “de-securitised” as a result.India has been wary about militarising the Quad - the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - it conducts with Australia, Japan and the United States. AUKUS, with its unabashedly security bearing, has “de-securitised” the Quad, and this “is what we have wanted”, a person familiar with these discussions said on condition of being identified only as a source.“We have no intention of militarising the Quad”, the source added, on the eve of crucial talks Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold with US officials over the next two days. The person insisted that a lot of people have mistakenly tied the Malabar military exercises - which India has hosted and conducted with Japan and the US for years and now Australia - to the Quad as the group’s security and defence aspects.They are “not linked”, said the source.There was some talk in the waning days of the Trump administration of giving the Quad a formal structure, something like an Indo-Pacific version of the Nato military alliance.India has enthusiastically welcomed the non-military and non-security direction the Quad has taken in recent months as it has elevated its exchanges to the summit level, driven by US President Joe Biden, the source said, pointing to the three working groups launched at the virtual summit of the leaders in March: on vaccines, emerging technologies and climate.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join President Joe Biden, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga for the the first in-person summit of the Quad leaders on Friday. Joe Biden, the host, indicated this in his maiden UN General Assembly speech on Tuesday and their talks will be focused on tackling “challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies”.The Indian side is going into the in-person summit with the expectation of building on the initiatives of the March meeting.Modi has a packed calendar of engagement before and after the Quad. On Thursday, his first full day in Washington DC, on his seventh visit to the US as prime minister, his key ceremonial meeting will be with Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to hold the post of the second most powerful political position in the United States.Their discussions could range from the “management of Covid-19 to issues like cooperation in the high-tech sector and the space sector, where the vice-president has an interest and a number of areas including resilient and secure supply chain, which is something of great interest to both sides”, the source said.There is a possibility of an announcement of an India visit by Kamala Harris at some stage. People familiar with the discussions asked to “wait for tomorrow”.The prime minister starts the day with meetings with CEO of some of the America’s top companies in solar power, IT, hedge fund and equity. Meetings with top US CEOs have been a recurring feature of Narendra Modi’s visits to the US. Indian-American Shantanu Narayen, of Adobe will be among them.Narendra Modi will also hold a long-overdue meeting with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose two previously scheduled visits to India were cancelled. Scott Morrison, although, had given Narendra Modi a heads-up on the AUKUS announcement.Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for the last bilateral of the day of Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-going-aukus-way-india-okay-with-quad-emerging-as-non-military-entity-101632378281452.html
23-09-2021||World||Boris Johnson says humanity must ‘grow up’ and face climate change||Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, told world leaders on Wednesday night that humanity must “grow up” and learn to deal with climate change. In his impassioned speech, the British premier compared the collective conscience of humans to an impetuous 16-year-old – a teenager on a bender – and said that it is high time that we stopped trashing the planet. “My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end,” Johnson addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. “We must come together in a collective coming of age.”Boris Johnson's UNGA speech comes ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which he is set to host in six weeks' time. The Wednesday address is meant to be preparation for Johnson's demands to press governments for tougher emissions, cutting targets, and more money to help poor countries clean up their economies.“If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,” he said. “And never mind what that will do to the ice floes.”Johnson said that we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before. “Not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster, but because of us, because of what we are doing now,” he said.The British prime minister said that humanity is behaving like an impetuous 16-year-old, “just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble”.“We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal,” Johnson said, adding that human beings “trash” the environment again and again with the inductive reasoning that we will somehow be getting away with it since we have got by so far.In positive developments with regards to climate change this week, two of the world's biggest economies – China and the United States – have vowed to cut back on carbon and increase funding on climate-conscious projects. While China's president Xi Jinping said that his country will no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad, US president Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid for green growth to poorer nations to $11.4 billion by 2024.The United Kingdom, for its part, has vowed to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050, and Johnson has championed the expansion of renewable energy, saying the UK could become the “Saudi Arabia of wind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-says-humanity-must-grow-up-and-face-climate-change-101632373618896.html
23-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Liberal MP George Chahal likely in trouble for violating rules||Tipped to become a member in Justin Trudeau’s new Cabinet, newly elected Liberal Party MP Harnirjodh Chahal, better known as “George Chahal”, from Canada’s Alberta province is in trouble for allegedly violating election rules.On election night, Liberal candidate George Chahal defeated incumbent Conservative MP Jag Sahota from Calgary-Skyview in Alberta and was immediately tipped for inclusion in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s next Cabinet. The win is important for Liberals as Alberta (34 seats) has always been a Conservative Party bastion. In 2019 elections, Liberals were wiped out and failed to open an account. This year, Conservatives have won 30 seats out of 34, Liberals have won 1 and results are yet to be declared in remaining 3 seats.So, a win for Liberals from Alberta is important to ensure a representation in the Cabinet which was not there in 2019.However, the emergence of footage showing George Chahal removing election material of his opponent may well jeopardise that possibility. George Chahal bested his rival by approximately 3,300 votes with commentators singling him out as a serious candidate for entering the Cabinet.However, constituent Glenn Pennett released security camera footage on Facebook that showed George Chahal personally removing Jag Sahota’s flyer from his doorstep and putting his own campaign material there. That could comprise a contravention of the Canada Elections Act, multiple news outlets reported.Jag Sahota, meanwhile, according to the outlet CBC News, believes that “legal action” is warranted in this matter.The Toronto Sun cited George Chahal’s spokesperson as saying the flyer was removed as it had the wrong polling station mentioned but that has been denied by both Jag Sahota’s campaign as well as Pennett himself. “We had our voting cards from Elections Canada and it was the same address on Sahota’s flyer. But he took it away,” Glenn Pennett told CBC News. “He should be charged because he’s destroying somebody else’s papers. If he’s going to be dishonest, he should resign.”In fact, Pennett said the flyer George Chahal left behind contained the wrong address for his polling station, listing one 18km away.If the matter is investigated, it will be done by the commissioner of Canada Elections.George Chahal was elected to the Calgary City Council in 2017 and this is his debut in national politics. He has a master’s in environmental design from the University of Calgary, and he and his wife Aman, have three daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-s-party-mp-likely-in-trouble-for-violating-election-rules-101632375223517.html
23-09-2021||World||Under Taliban, thriving Afghan music scene heads to silence||A month after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, the music is going quiet.The last time the militant group ruled the country, in the late 1990s, it outright banned music. So far this time, the government set up by the Taliban hasn’t taken that step officially. But already, musicians are afraid a ban will come, and some Taliban fighters on the ground have started enforcing rules on their own, harassing musicians and music venues.Many wedding halls are limiting music at their gatherings. Musicians are afraid to perform. At least one reported that Taliban fighters at one of the many checkpoints around the capital smashed his instrument. Drivers silence their radios whenever they see a Taliban checkpoint.In the alleys of Kharabat, a neighborhood in Kabul’s Old City, families where music is a profession passed through generations are looking for ways to leave the country. The profession was already hit hard by Afghanistan’s foundering economy, along with the coronavirus pandemic, and some families now too fearful to work are selling off furniture to get by.“The current situation is oppressive,” said Muzafar Bakhsh, a 21-year-old who played in a wedding band. His family had just sold off part of its belongings at Kabul’s new flea market, Chaman-e-Hozari. “We keep selling them … so we don’t die of starvation,” said Bakhsh, whose late grandfather was Ustad Rahim Bakhsh, a famous ustad — or maestro — of Afghan classical music.Afghanistan has a strong musical tradition, influenced by Iranian and Indian classical music. It also has a thriving pop music scene, adding electronic instruments and dance beats to more traditional rhythms. Both have flourished in the past 20 years.Asked whether the Taliban government will ban music again, spokesman Bilal Karimi told The Associated Press, “Right now, it is under review and when a final decision is made, the Islamic Emirate will announce it.”But music venues are already feeling the pressure since the Taliban swept into Kabul on Aug. 15.Wedding halls are usually scened to large gatherings with music and dancing, most often segregated between men’s and women’s sections. At three halls visited by the AP, staff said the same thing. Taliban fighters often show up, and although so far they haven’t objected to music, their presence is intimidating. Musicians refuse to show up. In the male sections of weddings, the halls no longer have live music or DJs. In the women’s section — where the Taliban fighters have less access — female DJs sometimes still play.Some karaoke parlors have closed. Others still open face harassment. One parlor visited by the AP stopped karaoke but stayed open, serving waterpipes and playing recorded music. Last week, Taliban fighters showed up, broke an accordion, and tore down signs and stickers referring to music or karaoke. A few days later, they returned and told the customers to leave immediately.Many musicians are applying for visas abroad.In the family home of another ustad in Kharabat, everyone’s go-bag is packed, ready to leave when they can. In one room, a group of musicians was gathered on a recent day, drinking tea and discussing the situation. They shared photos and videos from their performances around the world — Moscow, Baku, New Delhi, Dubai, New York.“Musicians do not belong here anymore. We must leave. The love and affection of the last years are gone,” said a drum player, whose career has spanned 35 years and who is the master of a leading music education center in Kabul. Like many other musicians, he spoke on condition he not be named, fearing reprisals from the Taliban.Another musician in the room said the Taliban broke a keyboard worth $3,000 when they saw it in his car as he crossed through a checkpoint. Others said they were shipping their most valuable instruments outside the country or hiding them. One had dismantled his tabla — a type of drum — and hidden the parts in different locations. Another buried his rebab, a stringed instrument, in his courtyard. Some said they hid instruments behind false walls.One who managed to leave already is Aryana Sayeed, a top female pop star who was also a judge on the TV talent show, “The Voice of Afghanistan.” Already used to death threats by Islamic hard-liners, Sayeed decided to escape the day the Taliban took over Kabul.“I had to survive and be the voice for other women in Afghanistan,” said Sayeed, now in Istanbul. She said she was asking Turkish authorities to help other musicians get out of her homeland. “The Taliban are not friends of Afghanistan, they are our enemies. Only enemies would want to destroy your history and your music,” she said.At the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, most of the classrooms are empty. None of the teachers nor the 350 students have come back since the takeover. The institute was once famous for its inclusiveness and emerged as the face of a new Afghanistan. Now, it is guarded by fighters from the Haqqani network, an ally of the Taliban considered a terrorist group by the United States.Inside the institute, pictures of boys and girls playing hang from the walls, dusty pianos rest inside locked rooms, and some instruments have been stacked in a container on the school’s patio. The fighters guarding the site said they were waiting for orders from the leadership on what to do with them.“We’re not interested in listening to these things,” one fighter said, standing next to a set of dhambouras, a traditional string instrument. “I don’t even know what these items are. Personally, I’ve never listened to them and I’m not interested.”In a classroom at the end of the corridor, a Taliban fighter rested on a mattress listening to a male voice chanting on his cell phone, apparently one of the instrument-less religious anthems common among the group.Back in Kharabat, Mohammed Ibrahim Afzali once ran the family business repairing musical instruments. In mid-August, he put away his tools, broke the instruments left in the workshop, and closed down. Now the 61-year-old sells chips and snacks to help feed his family of 13.“I made this tiny shop. God is merciful, and we will find a piece of bread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-taliban-thriving-afghan-music-scene-heads-to-silence-101632373153210.html

It has so far recorded 4,135 cases, 27 deaths, 3,819 recoveries and 289 active cases. On Wednesday, authorities reported 15 new cases, all found in Auckland.In 2020, the government had managed to eliminate Covid-19 and the country remained largely virus-free until the Delta variant struck last month, leading to the imposition of a nationwide lockdown.According to a report by the New York Times on Monday, under the government's four-tier system of Covid-19 rules, Auckland will now be placed under level 3 lockdown.Under level 3, some businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets are allowed to reopen by using contactless collection methods. People are advised to stay at home and work from home under this level. However, they are allowed to visit supermarkets and some food retailers, banks, pharmacies, petrol stations.The rest of New Zealand has been under a level 2 lockdown for the past two weeks, the New York Times report added.Prime Minister Arden said on Thursday that vaccinations will replace lockdowns as the main tool against Covid-19, allowing authorities to isolate only those who are infected."If that rate (of vaccinations) is high enough then we will be able to move away from lockdowns as a tool," Arden said, adding, the highest possible vaccine rates will give more freedom.New Zealand has seen a sluggish start to its vaccination campaign against Covid-19.At present only 40% of the adult population is fully vaccinated and of this, 75% have received at least one dose. There are over 1.2 million people aged 12 and above who have not even received the first vaccine dose, a report by stuff.co.nz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-lockdown-in-new-zealand-can-be-lifted-if-says-pm-jacinda-ardern-101632368355205.html

Various unilateral sanctions or restrictions on Afghanistan should be lifted as soon as possible,” Wang Yi said.“Afghanistan’s foreign exchange reserves are national assets that should belong to the country’s people and be used by its own people, and not be used as a bargaining chip to exert political pressure on Afghanistan,” he said.Afghanistan’s peaceful reconstruction and medium- and long-term development cannot do without financial support from the international community, the Chinese diplomat said.China, Wang Yi said, calls on G20 members to actively take practical measures to help Afghanistan ease the current liquidity pressure.“International financial institutions should also provide financing support for Afghanistan’s poverty reduction, sustainable development, people’s livelihood, and infrastructure projects,” he said.Wang Yi called on the Group of 20 (G20) to speed up their efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Chinese foreign minister said that the Afghan Taliban has announced the establishment of an interim government, which means that their domestic and foreign policies were still being adjusted and have not yet been fully finalised.He said the international community should support the Afghan people’s wish to independently choose a development path that suits their national conditions.China announced earlier this month that it had decided to urgently provide 200 million yuan ($30.96 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines and other medicines to Afghanistan, including an initial 3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Wang Yi noted.The Chinese diplomat urged “certain countries” that had caused the current difficult situation in Afghanistan to shoulder their responsibilities and make concrete efforts to help the Afghan people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/economic-sanctions-on-afghanistan-must-end-chinese-fm-wang-yi-at-g20-101632370841387.html
23-09-2021||World||'Need to do our part': Joe Biden calls on rich countries to escalate Covid-19 vaccine donations||President Joe Biden called on other countries to help vastly expand production and availability of coronavirus vaccines and treatments in order to end the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden hosted a virtual vaccine summit on Wednesday, coinciding with the United Nations leaders’ meetings in a bid to marshal more aid to developing nations where inoculations, treatments and supplies remain scarce. It also is a bid to counter criticism directed at the US and other wealthy countries that are planning booster shots that would reduce doses available to be shipped elsewhere.The summit highlighted how difficult it will be to attain Biden’s goals. He called for 70% of the world to be vaccinated by this time next year but a report by an anti-poverty group says the world isn’t on pace to hit that target. Biden also called for pledges of a billion more doses, and promised 500 million more doses from the USPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan announced during the summit that his country would provide about 60 million doses “in total,” according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.Biden cast the summit as a starting point, saying leaders would gather again in several months, and advocates have said the US push should be lauded. But the summit’s test will be whether the global response, and donations, will rise after months of vaccine nationalism that has steered doses overwhelmingly to rich nations. “This is a global tragedy,” Biden said. “And we’re not going to solve this crisis with half-measures and middle-of-the-road ambitions. We need to go big and we need to do our part.”The summit’s attendees include the leaders of the UK, Canada, South Africa and Indonesia, private-sector figures and representatives of non-governmental organizations. Biden led one of four sessions, on vaccinating the world, while Vice President Kamala Harris led another. Nearly all of it was held behind closed doors. The White House didn’t release a list of attendees. Biden said the US will buy another 500 million doses of Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE’s vaccine for donation abroad, pushing the total US donation pledge above 1.1 billion doses. The doses will be produced in the US and be shipped through Covax, the global vaccine sharing system, to low-income and lower-middle-income countries, beginning in January and running through next September.Biden also announced $370 million in US funding to help with vaccine administration abroad. “Getting those vaccines into people’s arms may be the hardest logistical challenge we face,” he said. He pledged another $383 million in funding for Gavi, an agency co-leading Covax. Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity before the summit took place, declined to say how much the Pfizer order would cost, but said the contracting process is continuing. The doses will be provided on a not-for-profit basis, they added. Pfizer confirmed the deal in a statement. The company plans to produce them at four plants across the USAn analysis released Wednesday by the ONE Campaign, an antipoverty advocacy group, shows that the world will fall about 1.2 billion people short of Biden’s 70% goal by next September. Biden’s 500-million-dose announcement will make a dent but not bridge the gap.“Everyone is on the hook to agree to a global plan to get 70% of the world vaccinated. This donation gets us closer to that goal, but the US cannot do this alone, other wealthy countries must be bolder and more ambitious,” Tom Hart, ONE’s acting chief executive officer, said in a statement.Biden also called on other countries to increase pledges of shots and to donate them, rather than sell them. “We need other high income countries to deliver on their own ambitious vaccine donations and pledges,” Biden said.Reporters were escorted out of the summit shortly after Biden’s remarks and it wasn’t immediately clear whether any other nation pledged to donate shots. The US released, as part of the summit, a call for a billion more doses to be purchased for or donated to developing nations.The new US commitment is on top of a 500-million-dose donation announced in June at the Group of Seven summit in the UK Distribution of those vaccines began last month. Combined with 130 million doses shipped out so far that had initially been bought for domestic use, the US donation total is now at least 1.13 billion doses, more than double the total delivered domestically.Of those, at least 330 million have been pledged by the end of 2021. The remaining 800 million, including all of Biden’s new pledge, are to be delivered in 2022. This is the first time that the US has set a global vaccination target, though advocates are urging more aggressive ones. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has called for 70% of the world to be vaccinated by the end of June, three months before Biden’s timeline.“In some ways June and September are just too late,” said Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a non-profit group. He gave the US credit for hosting the summit. “We’re so excited that they are taking leadership on this, because there is unfortunately a leadership void, but we needed to get all this done yesterday,” he said. Doctors Without Borders welcomed Biden’s pledge but said it’s not enough to end the pandemic and will arrive too late -- and urged him to donate more excess supply now.“It’s unfathomable that millions more people are going to die waiting for vaccines just because of where they live,” the organization’s director of programs, Carrie Teicher, said in a statement. She added that the US must help bolster global vaccine production.The summit comes as the US prepares to begin giving booster shots to millions of Americans, a step that health advocates warn will divert vaccines and increase inequities among nations.Harris announced that the US would contribute at least $250 million to jump-start a new Global Health Security Financial Intermediary Fund, aimed at funding pandemic preparedness. Biden also set a goal of testing one out of every 1,000 people per day by the end of this year in all countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-do-our-part-joe-biden-calls-on-rich-countries-to-escalate-covid-19-vaccine-donations-101632368034340.html

The delta variant has also become more fit and transmissible over time and is now actively replacing all other Covid-variants in circulation, Van Kerkhove added."Less than one percent each of Alpha, Beta and Gamma are currently circulating. It's really predominantly delta around the world," the health body official said on Wednesday.“Delta has become more fit, it is more transmissible and it is out-competing, it is replacing the other viruses that are circulating," Kerkhove said during a social media interaction.The delta variant has been detected in 185 countries till date. This variant drove the second wave in India and was behind the surge of coronavirus cases in the US.The WHO has downgraded alpha, beta, gamma along with three other variants - eta, iota and kappa - to “variants under monitoring”, indicating that they “no longer pose a major added risk to global public health” as they are being outcompeted by delta."This is really due to changes in circulation and that the variants of interest are just out-competed by the variants of concern. They're just not taking hold," Van Kerkhove added.Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief, also interacted with reporters in a social media session, warning that dip in number of cases is followed by spikes but countries with significant vaccination rate has less to worry about. “It shows us that vaccines work,” he said.The delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first detected in India in late 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-globally-dominant-variant-replacing-other-variants-of-concern-who-101632365656266.html
23-09-2021||World||International Day of Sign Languages today: Theme, history, significance||Every year, September 23 is celebrated as the International Day of Sign Languages. The day supports and protects the linguistic identity of people who are deaf along with other users of sign languages.This year’s theme, declared by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) - ‘We Sign For Human Rights’ - projects “how each of us – deaf and hearing people around the world – can work together hand in hand to promote the recognition of our right to use sign languages in all areas of life.”What are sign languages?Sign languages are the ones that use visual-manual modality to convey the meaning.The United Nations (UN) describes sign languages as full-fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from spoken languages.The convention on the rights of persons with disabilities recognises and promotes the use of sign languages. The convention clarifies that they are equal in status to spoken languages. It also obligates states to facilitate the learning of sign languages and promote the linguistic identity of deaf people.History of International Day of Sign LanguagesAccording to the UN, the International Day of Sign Languages was first celebrated in the year 2018 as part of the International Week of the Deaf. “The choice of 23 September commemorates the date that the WFD was established in 1951,” the UN said in its website.The WFD has said that there are over 70 million deaf people across the globe and 80% of these are from developing countries. Collectively, over 300 different sign languages are used.SignificanceThe International Day of Sign Languages aims to raise awareness about the importance of sign languages. The resolution which established the day recognises the importance of preserving sign languages as a part of linguistic and cultural diversity.Quotes“Human eyes are the sign language of the brain. If you watch them carefully, you can see the truth played out, raw and unguarded”: Tarryn Fisher“I come from a place where you don’t need to talk all the time. There are sign languages you learn”: Warwick Thornton“Sign language is the equal of speech, lending itself equally to the rigorous and the poetic, to philosophical analysis or to making love”: Oliver Sacks“Systems of morals are only a sign-language of the emotions”: Friedrich Nietzsche||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-sign-languages-today-theme-history-significance-101632362265179.html
23-09-2021||World||Apple to give store workers bonuses up to $1,000 next month||Apple Inc. will give store employees as much as $1,000 in one-time bonuses next month, a rare move that follows a tumultuous effort to get its retail operations back on track after pandemic shutdowns. The iPhone maker will give $1,000 to retail staff hired before March 31, while anyone who joined after that date will receive $500, according to people familiar with the situation. New workers for the holiday shopping season will get $200, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The payouts also will go to AppleCare and online sales workers as well. But the good tidings came with a bit of coal. In a separate memo, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook criticized leaks to the press. Key details of Apple’s recent product launch event were reported ahead of time, along with information from a companywide meeting held last week.Cook said he’d heard from many employees who were “incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters,” according to the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.”The memo sparked fresh concerns from some employees who feel that Apple’s policies are too restrictive. It’s also a potential distraction at a time when the company is focused on rolling out new iPhones and other devices. Preorders began for the iPhone 13 last week, and it reaches stores on Friday.The Sept. 14 launch event, which also included the new Apple Watch Series 7 and a redesigned iPad mini, kicked off the company’s holiday season blitz. This Christmas will provide a key test of Apple’s retail operations as the company navigates the waning of the pandemic. The bonuses will be an unusual perk since Apple rarely gives companywide payouts. The last major one was $2,500 worth of restricted stock units in 2018. That bonus followed tax changes allowing Apple to bring back cash from offshore accounts at a lower cost. The new bonuses will be issued via cash in paychecks, rather than as stock units, the people said.A representative for Apple declined to comment. The bonuses were presented to retail workers as a recognition of the difficulty of working through the pandemic. Since Covid-19 struck in 2020, Apple stores around the world closed and reopened multiple times -- and thousands of workers were given online sales roles while physical locations were shuttered. Retail employees were still paid as normal when stores were closed.Apple also is facing a tight market for labor, with employers across the U.S. struggling to attract enough staff. Still, some workers see the bonuses as an acknowledgment of growing unrest among both retail and corporate staff, according to the people. Employees have complained about pay equity and other concerns at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant, with two high-profile cases getting investigated by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board.At the companywide meeting with employees last week, Apple addressed questions about pay equity and a new anti-abortion law in Texas. Apple said it resolves pay gaps when it finds them, and that it was monitoring the situation in Texas to see how it could help.Cook also discussed the recent trial between the company and Epic Games about Apple’s App Store policies and announced new Covid-19 vaccination and testing policies.He followed up this week with the complaints about leaks. “I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked,” Cook said in the memo, which was previously reported by the Verge. “As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it’s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-to-give-store-workers-bonuses-up-to-1-000-next-month-101632362209548.html

On Wednesday, he was also scheduled to attend a meeting of the G-20 foreign ministers on Afghanistan and of the G-4, which is seeking permanent seats for India, Brazil, Japan and Germany on the UNSC.Jaishankar met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-Yong and had wide-ranging conversations on different aspects of the bilateral relationships, including Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy. “Pleased to meet FM Chung Eui-Yong of the Republic of Korea. A wide-ranging conversation on different aspects of our relationship. RoK’s New Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy have strengthened our convergence in the Indo-Pacific,” he tweeted.While interacting with his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio, who is the current G20 chair, Jaishankar discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. “Discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. Look forward to joining him at a discussion on Afghanistan tomorrow,” he tweeted.The Union minister also met with his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto and discussed the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar held a discussion on the Indo-Pacific issues during his meeting with his Chilean counterpart Andres Allamand. “Another perspective on the Indo-Pacific from FM @allamand of Chile.

At that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reiterated India’s support for “independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity” of island nation after a meeting with Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades. Cyprus backs India’s claims to a permanent seat in the UNSC.The long ongoing conflict in Cyprus began in 1974 when Turkey invaded its northern part in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Greek government. India has been advocating a peaceful resolution of the issue in accordance with the UN resolutions.In a 1998 resolution, the United Nations Security Council called upon “all States to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus...”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/respect-un-resolutions-on-cyprus-jaishankar-101632339666850.html

The vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech will be made in the United States and shipped to low and lower middle-income countries starting in January.Bats with Covid-like viruses found in LaosScientists have found another clue to the origin of the Covid-19 virus, with bats living in caves in Laos found to be carrying a similar pathogen that experts suggest could potentially infect humans directly.Researchers from France’s Pasteur Institute and the National University of Laos said their findings showed that viruses genetically close to the SARS-CoV-2 virus “exist in nature” among bat species found in the limestone caves of northern Laos, which neighbours China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-donate-500mn-more-doses-to-other-countries-101632336223376.html
23-09-2021||World||Macron, Biden set to meet to ease tensions||US President Joe Biden said he will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in October, seeking to mend ties after a US nuclear-powered submarine deal with Australia outraged officials in Paris.Biden held a phone call with the French president on Wednesday, the first time the they spoke since the submarine deal was announced last week. In a joint statement, the two countries said Biden and Macron “agreed the situation would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners”.The agreement between the US, Australia and the UK scuttled a previous $66 billion deal for France to build a diesel-powered sub fleet for Australia. French officials complained they were taken by surprise and cut out of talks on a broader defence alliance between the three English-speaking countries.In an unprecedented move, France recalled its ambassador from Washington on Friday in protest. Macron will return the ambassador next week, according to the joint statement.The French also asked that a US and EU summit scheduled for next week be postponed. The fate of that summit wasn’t mentioned in the statement.The White House has said it was Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s obligation to inform France he was ending their deal for diesel-powered subs. Morrison has said he had made concerns about the French subs clear to Macron’s government and that they wouldn’t meet Australia’s future security needs.Biden and Macron will meet in Europe, according to the statement. The US president is scheduled to attend the G20 summit in Rome and the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in October-November.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told France to “get a grip” and give allies in the US and Australia a break over a row about the trilateral nuclear submarine deal that tore up the separate French contract.Speaking a day after he met Biden in Washington, Johnson told reporters, “I think it’s time for some of our dearest friends around the world to ‘prenez un grip’ about all this, ‘donnez-moi un break’, because this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security.” He was translating the English phrases “get a grip” and “give me a break” literally into French.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-biden-set-to-meet-to-ease-tensions-101632336094240.html
23-09-2021||World||Pregnant women with mRNA Covid vaccine jabs pass antibodies to babies: Study||In one of the first studies conducted in the world, it has been found that pregnant women who have been vaccinated with mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots, against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pass high levels of antibodies to their babies.The study revealed that as many as 36 newborns tested at birth had antibodies against Covid-19 after their mothers were vaccinated by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna doses. For the study, antibody levels were measured in the umbilical cord blood of the women whilst they were pregnant to differentiate if the presence was from past infection or vaccines.“We didn’t anticipate that. We expected to see more variability,” NYU Langone Health System obstetrician and co-author of the study, Ashley Roman said.The study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology – Maternal Fetal Medicine, on Wednesday.How will the study help?Data from September 11 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that only 30 per cent of women aged between 18 and 49 are vaccinated against Covid-19 in the US, despite various studies stressing on prenatal vaccine safety.Since the study had a small subjects’ group, the research team is now looking at results from a bigger sample group and the longevity of the immunisation among newborns.“We pushed this data out relatively early because it’s a unique finding and it has important implications for care,” Roman said, adding that as of now the research team urges all expecting mothers to get jabbed for maternal benefits. What did the study find?For the research, the team studied blood from the umbilical cord of 36 pregnant women to specifically look for two elements – first, antibodies to spike protein that appears post-vaccination or contracting Covid-19; and second, antibodies to spike nucleocapsid protein that is solely present after getting coronavirus.Also Read | SC seeks Centre's response on plea seeking priority Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant womenIt was found that a total of 31 samples of pregnant women tested negative for nucleocaspid protein – meaning they developed immunity from vaccination. The remaining five expecting mothers were not tested for the nucleocaspid protein – thus, ceasing the researchers from ascertaining if the antibodies’ presence was from vaccination or infection. What does the CDC say about pregnant women getting jabbed with Covid-19 vaccines?According to the latest findings shared by the CDC, coronavirus vaccines are safe for pregnant and lactating women. The data shows that studies of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines on pregnant animals didn’t find any safety concerns. The US government agency also highlights that Covid-19 vaccines do not cause infection, including in pregnant women and/or their babies. In fact, it says that as per early data, inoculating a pregnant woman with coronavirus vaccine reduces the risk of contracting the infection among them. (With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-women-with-mrna-covid-vaccine-jabs-pass-antibodies-to-babies-study-101632334391279.html
