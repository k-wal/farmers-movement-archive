Addressing a press briefing, Tedros said that 80 per cent of the Covid-19 vaccine doses have gone to the high-and-upper-middle-income nations, while the low-and-lower-middle-income countries are struggling to administer doses to even their high-risk groups and healthcare employees.“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected,” the WHO chief had said.Also Read | These countries to ignore WHO's call for moratorium on Covid booster shotsNevertheless, US President Joe Biden announced last week that the country will commence delivering Pfizer and Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine jabs to its citizens starting September 20. The US authorities said that people who had been inoculated with the vaccine shots would need a booster jab eight months after the second dose.The US health officials had said that the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines against the infection wears off over time, based on findings by recent studies.White House chief medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci also said last week that the three-dose Covid-19 vaccine may become the standard regimen for most people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-stay-silent-who-chief-reiterates-moratorium-on-covid-19-booster-shots-101631123677602.html
08-09-2021||World||Canadian federal polls: What has happened and what is at at stake||Canadians go to the polls on Sept. 20 in an election that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called two years early, seeking to turn public approval for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic into a fresh, four-year mandate.Why now?Since 2019, Trudeau has only commanded a minority in parliament, leaving him dependent on other parties to govern. Trudeau argues the pandemic has changed Canada like World War Two did and Canadians should now choose who they want to make important decisions for decades to come.What has happened?Trudeau has struggled to explain why an early election during a worsening fourth wave of Covid-19 was a good idea. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole consistently accuses the Liberal leader of putting Canadians in harm's way for personal ambition. People also seem to be tiring of Trudeau, who carries the baggage of having governed for six years.Since Trudeau called the election, his hefty opinion poll lead has vanished: surveys point to a tight race in which he could lose to the opposition Conservatives. But steady Conservative gains during the first three weeks seemed to have stopped as Trudeau attacked O'Toole for his opposition to vaccine mandates and his promise - now reversed to legalize some assault weapons the Liberals had banned.What are the main issues?To tackle the pandemic the Liberals ran up a record national debt of C$1 trillion ($785.7 billion) and pushed budget deficits to highs not seen since World War Two. In the campaign they promised another C$78 billion in new spending over five years.O'Toole says he will balance the books within a decade without making cuts.Analysts say financial markets do not appear overly worried about the fiscal implications of either promise although the stocks of bank and insurance firm could suffer after Trudeau promised a new windfall tax on their profits.Vaccine mandatesThe Liberal government has introduced Covid-19 vaccine mandates. During the campaign, Trudeau has been abused and heckled by people opposing the move and says his Conservative rival is taking his cues from the crowds. O'Toole opposes vaccine mandates, including for his own candidates, and says he prefers frequent testing.ChildcareEmployment of women has plummeted thanks to Covid-19. The Liberals are promising to spend up to C$30 billion over five years to set up a long-promised C$10 a day national childcare program. The Conservatives say they will cancel those deals and instead offer tax credits of up to C$6,000 a year to help pay for daycare.Housing affordability Housing prices have soared about 70% since Trudeau took office. He is promising  to build, preserve, or repair 1.4 million homes over the next four years, among other measures. The Conservatives would boost supply by building a million homes over three years and loosening some mortgage requirements.Climate changeForest fires in western Canada and a drought in crop-growing areas are focusing attention on climate change. The Liberals promise more aggressive emissions cuts than the Conservatives, who are major advocates of the oil and gas industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-federal-polls-what-has-happened-and-what-is-at-at-stake-101631122834951.html

After bilateral talks, the two leaders also had a virtual meeting with foreign ministers of several countries and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg."The Taliban seek international legitimacy. Any legitimacy -- any support -- will have to be earned," Blinken said, after the meeting.Blinken told reporters that he discussed with partners how to hold the Taliban to their commitments, DW reported.He also responded to criticism that the US administration was not making enough effort to facilitate further evacuations, vowing to put pressure on the Taliban to start charter flights out of Afghanistan."We are working to do everything in our power to support those flights and to get them off the ground," he said.Also Read | US working with Taliban to enable charter flight ops from Kabul, says BlinkenBlinken said the group was preventing some flights from leaving because some people wanting to fly out did not have the correct documentation.Taliban on Tuesday announced the caretaker government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, naming Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund as interim prime minister and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the group, as his deputy.Mullah Yaqoob, one of the deputy leaders of the Taliban since 2016 and the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, will act as caretaker Defence Minister.

08-09-2021||World||Pak support to Taliban could endanger trade ties with EU: Report||The European Parliament earlier this year called for an ‘immediate reassessment’ of the trade regime between the European Union and Pakistan, according to a report by news agency EUToday. The report said that there were demands for the temporary withdrawal of the generalised system of preferences-Plus (GSP+) status which the European Union granted to Pakistan in 2014. Pakistan in return agreed to implement 27 internationally recognised conventions.During the 3rd biennial assessment of the GSP which was published last year, the report highlighted that Pakistan failed to make meaningful advances in protecting human rights. The report pointed out that this was seen with respect to the nation’s strict blasphemy laws where incarceration rates are high if punished and even if the accused are acquitted most of them are murdered.Pakistan also reconstituted the death penalty which is applicable to cases of blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad or any other religious figure. Earlier this year, an eight-year-old was charged under this law.The GSP+ status allows products to enter the EU market from developing nations without any import duties. This allowed Pakistan’s export to the EU to increase from 4.538 billion euros to 7.492 billion euros, registering an increase of 65%.It also led to Pakistan becoming the second-most important trading partner of the European Union. It also accounted for 14.3% of the total trade Pakistan conducted in 2020 and also of 28% of Pakistan’s total exports.Pakistan’s GSP+ status is also under scrutiny due to its support to the Taliban. Former Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani accused Pakistan of aiding the terrorist group with logistics and ammunition which he said led to the quick downfall of the democratically elected government. Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi proposed that the Taliban leaders who announced an interim government on Tuesday be invited for regional multilateral forums. Qureshi chaired a meet where foreign ministers of China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan - all neighbours of Afghanistan - convened to discuss the latest developments in the country.The European Union also shot a warning to the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan saying that the interim government it announced lacks inclusivity and representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-support-to-taliban-could-endanger-trade-ties-with-eu-report-101631122712316.html
08-09-2021||World||‘Ilegitimate’: Ashraf Ghani’s foreign ministry speaks out against Taliban regime||NEW DELHI: The foreign ministry under Afghanistan’s erstwhile government led by Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday described the Taliban’s interim cabinet as “illegitimate” and said all Afghan foreign missions around the world would continue their duties based on the constitution. The statement, issued in the name of the foreign ministry of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, contended the “so-called Taliban cabinet will result in undermining Afghanistan’s political, ethnic and social diversity, lead to increased tensions and also undermine the prospect of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the country”. In a separate statement, Ghani, who fled Afghanistan after Taliban forces marched into the capital on August 15, explained the reasons for his abrupt departure and sought to dismiss allegations that he had left the country with millions of dollars and other assets. Also Read: ‘Night before Ashraf Ghani fled..’: Blinken reveals his last call with GhaniGhani, who has faced widespread criticism from Afghans and segments of the international community for not standing up to the Taliban, said: “I left at the urging of the palace security who advised me that to remain risked setting off the same horrific street-to-street fighting the city had suffered during the Civil War of the 1990s.” He added, “Leaving Kabul was the most difficult decision of my life, but I believed it was the only way to keep the guns silent and save Kabul and her 6 million citizens. I have devoted 20 years of my life to helping the Afghan people work toward building a democratic, prosperous, and sovereign state – it was never my intent to abandon the people or that vision.” Describing accusations that he fled Afghanistan with a large sum of money as “categorically false”, Ghani said corruption was a “plague” that crippled Afghanistan for decades. “I have publicly declared all of my assets. My wife’s family inheritance has also been disclosed and remains listed in her home country of Lebanon. I welcome an official audit or financial investigation under UN auspices or any other appropriate independent body to prove the veracity of my statements here,” he said. The statement from the Afghan foreign ministry said the Taliban’s interim cabinet “goes against the will of the absolute majority of the people of Afghanistan, international agreements, relevant United Nations Security Council and United Nations Human Rights Council resolutions” and undermines national interests. The Taliban, it said, had “reaffirmed their blatant disregard and violation of the fundamental rights and important role of Afghan women and other segments of the society”. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s tri-coloured is “flying at all Afghan diplomatic missions, and the constitution is main source of legitimacy for upholding national interests, territorial integrity, sovereignty, Islamic values and independence of Afghanistan, it added. Meanwhile, the National Resistance Front (NRF) of Afghanistan, which is led by leaders from Panjshir such as Ahmad Massoud, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the Taliban’s caretaker cabinet was “illegal and a clear sign of the group’s enmity with the Afghan people”. It added, “We call on all Afghan citizens to continue their resistance against the occupation by the Taliban and its terrorist allies.” The NRD contended the “illegitimate regime in Kabul is a threat to stability and security of Afghanistan, the region and the world”. It called on the UN, European Union, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and countries to “hold off recognition of and refrain from diplomatic ties with the Taliban’s regime”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ilegitimate-ashraf-ghani-s-foreign-ministry-speaks-out-against-taliban-regime-101631122842492.html
08-09-2021||World||No water, milk in London: Grocery shelves go empty, Covid is one of the reasons||The British economy has plunged into a major supply chain crisis, with a wide range of businesses suffering shortages for several months in the UK now. The worst hit by this are the grocery stores which are seeing empty shelves for things as basic as water and milk, multiple news agencies have reported. "Last week I ran out of Coca-Cola. I haven't had large bottles of Evian for three weeks," the news agency quoted Satyan Patel, owner of a convenience store, as saying."We had already decided to reduce our stock because of Covid... but now we're finding it hard to get some products as well because they're just not available," Patel said.The coronavirus pandemic severely disrupted the global supply chain, but Britain's exit from the European Union late last year has further exacerbated the problems. The UK withdrew from the European Union in January 2020 after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC).Following the exit, shops in the UK are not getting products delivered to them, as the deal between the country and EU has made it harder to hire EU citizens. This has led to a drastic shortage of lorry drivers. Meanwhile, many people have not yet returned to the UK after going back to their home countries during the Covid-induced lockdown last year.Co-op, a cooperative supermarket group, said it was "impacted by some patchy distribution" to its deliveries but it was working with suppliers to re-stock quickly. The group said it was recruiting 3,000 temporary workers "to keep depots working to capacity and stores stocked as quickly as possible". At another major supermarket in southeast London, water bottles were sparse and milk was missing from shelves.According to recent estimates, the UK currently faces a shortage of about 100,000 lorry drivers, AFP has reported.(With AFP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-water-milk-in-london-grocery-shelves-go-empty-covid-is-one-of-the-reasons-101631121268301.html

What it says, what it doesn’t||New Delhi: The new Taliban setup in Kabul has said it desires healthy relations with all neighbours of Afghanistan based on mutual respect, even while assuring that Afghan soil will not be used against the security of any nation.A statement by the Taliban’s leadership office outlining the policies of the new so-called cabinet announced on Tuesday further said the new regime is “committed to all international laws and treaties, resolutions and commitments that are not in conflict with Islamic law” and Afghanistan’s national values.The statement was signed by the Taliban’s reclusive chief Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has been named the supreme leader with the final control over religious, political and security affairs.“We want strong and healthy relations with our neighbours and all other countries based on mutual respect and interaction. Our relations with those countries will be based on the highest interests and benefits of Afghanistan,” the statement said.Also Read: As it forms the Afghan government, the Taliban relies on old guard, Pashtuns“Our message to our neighbours, the region and the world is that Afghanistan’s soil will not be used against the security of any other country. We assure all that there is no concern from Afghanistan and we expect from them the same,” it added.The statement further assured foreign diplomats, embassies, consulates, humanitarian organisations and investors in Afghanistan that they “will not face any problem”, and that the Taliban was “doing its best for their complete security and safety”.“Their presence is [the] need of our country, so they should carry out their work with a peace of mind,” the statement said.The Taliban setup said it is “committed to all international laws and treaties, resolutions and commitments that are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country’s national values”. It also called on all countries to “value building strong and cordial political, diplomatic and good relations with us and to also cooperate with us”.“We do not want enmity with anyone. Afghanistan is the common home of all. We will respect all their rights and legitimate aspirations and use their potential to rebuild the country,” the statement said.Silent on terror, women rightsExperts, however, noted the statement was silent on an important condition in the peace deal signed by the Taliban and the US in February 2020 – the need for the group to sever its ties with al-Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups. Many of the 33 members of the interim setup, including Akhund, Abdul Ghani Baradar and Sirajuddin Haqqani, are subject to UN sanctions for their links to terrorism.The experts also noted that the statement was largely silent on protecting the rights of women and children and preserving the gains of the past two decades –key demands of the international community.The statement only said the Taliban “will take serious and effective steps towards protecting human rights, the rights of minorities as well as the rights of the underprivileged groups within the framework of the demands of the sacred religion of Islam”.Describing the media as an “important element of the country”, the statement said the Taliban will “work for the freedom, functioning and improvement of the media quality”. It added, “We consider it our duty to take into account the sacred precepts of Islam, the national interests of the country and impartiality in our broadcasts.”The caretaker cabinet will work to uphold Islamic rules and Sharia law while securing Afghanistan’s borders and ensuring lasting peace and development. The statement described education as “one of the most important requirements of the country”, and said the setup will “provide a healthy and safe environment for religious and modem sciences to all countrymen within the framework of Sharia”.In the economic field, the Taliban said it will manage domestic revenues transparently, provide special opportunities to international investment and different sectors of trade, and fight unemployment effectively.The statement said the Taliban values all talented and professional people, such as scholars, doctors, scientists and engineers, and called on people not to leave the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-cabinet-in-afghanistan-sends-first-message-to-world-what-it-says-what-it-doesnt-101631120742270.html

Of these doses, approximately 1.2 billion will be available for the lower income economies participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC),” Gavi, the vaccine alliance, said in a statement on Wednesday.Also read | Study: Antibodies less effective against Delta variant of coronavirusThe body also said that the 1.4 billion doses would be enough to protect 20% of the population, or 40% of all adults, in 92 AMC countries except India. Gavi describes AMC as “the innovative financing instrument that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income economies in the COVAX Facility – enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.”Further, it also pushed the key milestone of two billion doses released for delivery to the first quarter of 2022. It was earlier expected to achieve this milestone by the end of the current year.So far, $10 billion have been raised by the Covax programme and has legal binding commitments for upto 4.5 billion doses of the vaccine. Also, 240 million doses have been delivered via the programme to 139 countries in six months, a statement from Gavi said. However, it also noted that only 20% of the people in low- and middle-income countries have been immunised against Covid-19 in comparison with the 80% population in countries with higher incomes.“Today, COVAX’s ability to protect the most vulnerable people in the world continues to be hampered by export bans, the prioritisation of bilateral deals by manufacturers and countries, ongoing challenges in scaling up production by some key producers, and delays in filing for regulatory approval,” it said, listing the factors affecting the delivery of vaccines across the world.On Wednesday, director-general of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also expressed his concerns about equal distribution of vaccines globally. Earlier the WHO chief called on countries providing booster doses to halt their programme at least until the end of September, now renewing that call until the year end to enable every country to vaccinate at least 40% of its population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-cuts-supply-forecast-for-2021-says-enough-doses-available-to-protect-20-population-in-low-income-economies-101631117114068.html

China is also ready to provide more anti-epidemic and emergency materials to Afghanistan under the China-South Asian Countries Emergency Supplies Reserve, the Xinhua reported.Wang Yi said the “interim” nature of the Taliban government shows that the future of Afghanistan is still faced with uncertainties.He said as neighbours, China and the other five countries have witnessed the consequences of the decades of war on the Afghan people, and have also directly endured the negative influence of the spillover. “No country is more unwilling than we are to see Afghanistan return to war or disaster, and no country is more eager than we are to see it return to peace and development,” Wang Yi said.Noting the situation in Afghanistan is moving from chaos to governance, Wang Yi called on the neighbours to seize the key opportunity, boost communication and coordination, focus on common concerns, and exert more positive influence on the development of the situation while respecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, Xinhua reported.Wang Yi said, as initiators of the problems, the US and its allies should learn the lesson and assume their due responsibility. “They have more of a duty to supply economic, livelihood and humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people than any other country,” he said, adding that they are obliged to help Afghanistan maintain stability and move towards positive development while respecting its sovereignty and independence.The announcement came soon after Xinhua, ran a story headlined, “China welcomes Taliban’s announcement of caretaker government”, quoting foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin.While not directly using the term “welcome”, spokesperson Wang Wenbin had said China attaches importance to the Taliban’s announcement of the formation of a caretaker government in Afghanistan together with some important personnel arrangements. “This has ended the more than three weeks of anarchy in Afghanistan and is a necessary step towards Afghanistan’s restoration of order and post-war reconstruction,” Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Speaking at the online meeting, foreign minister Wang Yi said the US and its allies have more of a duty to supply economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan than any other country.They should help Afghanistan’s positive development while respecting its sovereignty and independence, he said.Wang Yi called on the Taliban to cut ties with all extreme terrorist forces and take measures to crack down on them.“All parties should strengthen intelligence sharing and border control cooperation to catch and eliminate terrorist groups that have sneaked in from Afghanistan,” in order to ensure regional security and stability, Wang Yi was quoted as saying.Wang Yi said that Afghanistan today stands at a crossroads in history and as a neighbour, no country is more reluctant than China to see Afghanistan return to war and disaster. “No country expects peace and development in Afghanistan more than we do,” Wang Yi said.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin was quoted by China’s national broadcaster, CCTV’s English channel, CGTN as saying that the situation in Afghanistan is moving from chaos to governance.Wang Wenbin called on the neighbours to seize the key opportunity, boost communication and coordination, focus on common concerns, and exert more positive influence on the development of the situation while respecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-31mn-aid-for-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101631116062290.html
08-09-2021||World||Where are Afghanistan's soldiers now? Reports say many joined Taliban||Analysing recent images of the Taliban fighters, the UK army has deciphered that some of the techniques that they are using are advanced, mostly used in the UK or the US. This analysis has made them believe that Afghan soldiers, previously trained by the US and the UK are now fighting for the Taliban, at least some of them, reports said, quoting The Times.'An untrained force would normally hold the weapon randomly, but if your hand is behind the pistol grip and your finger is over the trigger guard, then you're not going to have a negligent discharge and no one else is going to fire it either," a UK defence official said to The Times. However, many think that this is wide speculation as the Taliban are also fighters and they must have taught their soldiers how to handle the weapons. The UK ministry of defence said they do not have any evidence to claim that Afghan soldiers have actually joined the Taliban.Not only PM; at least 14 members of Taliban govt are blacklisted by UN: ReportBut even if this is the case, it won't be surprising, analysts told The Times as many of them might have previous ties to the Taliban when the Taliban were in power between 1996 and 2001. Plus, there are concerns of safety for family members which might drive them to join the Taliban.Barbara Kelemen, an intelligence analyst, said they had assessed 'reasonable probability' some Afghan soldiers had defected and switched to the Taliban. "Among reasons that would prompt some soldiers to join the Taliban are their previous ties to the group, economic incentives and even personal or familial safety if they perceived defeat for government forces was likely," she said.Many soldiers are believed to have left the country fearing persecution by the Taliban though they announced amnesty. Many went to Panjshir to join the Resistance Front. Announcing amnesty for all those who had fought against the Taliban, the group had welcomed soldiers, pilots, soon after it captured Kabul. After the withdrawal of foreign troops came to a close and the countries concluded their evacuation process, Taliban fighters were seen taking control of the entire security of the country. The interim government has also been announced by the Taliban on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-are-afghanistan-s-soldiers-now-reports-say-many-joined-taliban-101631113259724.html

She has served as India's Ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2011.

Multiple photographs of Putin at public events dating over several years show Zinichev standing at Putin's shoulder.Zinichev later became deputy head of the Federal Security Service and served briefly as acting regional governor of Kaliningrad. The Kremlin said Putin had offered his condolences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-minister-dies-trying-to-save-filmmaker-during-arctic-exercise-101631108814695.html

Corruption is a plague that has crippled our country for decades and fighting corruption has been a central focus of my efforts as president. I inherited a monster that could not easily or quickly be defeated,” Ashraf Ghani said in the statement.Ghani left the presidential palace in Afghanistan's capital sometime around August 15, when the Taliban fighters were at the gates of Kabul, waiting to lay siege on the city. His whereabouts were unknown till August 18, when the United Arab Emirates released an official statement to announce that it was hosting Ghani and his family on “humanitarian grounds.”ALSO READ | How Afghanistan's president went from hero to villain-in-hidingMedia reports claimed Ghani had left Kabul "with four cars and a helicopter full of cash" and was spotted "everywhere from Tajikistan to Oman to Abu Dhabi."Reacting to the allegations, Ghani said he is open to an official audit or financial investigation under “UN auspices or any other appropriate independent body" to prove the veracity of his statements.“My close aides are ready to submit their finances to public audit, and I would encourage and urge other former senior officials and political figures to do the same," Ghani said.Immediately after Ghani left the country, the Afghan embassy in Tajikistan requested the Interpol to detain the former president Ashraf Ghani for allegedly stealing public wealth. After leaving, Ghani posted on Facebook that he exited the country to avoid bloodshed. However, his escape irked the people of Afghanistan, including his cabinet colleagues, many of whom called it "treason".He said at that time that he was “expelled from Afghanistan” in such a way that he didn't even get the chance to take his “slippers off” his feet and pull on his boots.Ghani said in the latest statement that leaving Kabul was the most difficult decision of his life. “…but I believed it was the only way to keep the guns silent and save Kabul and her 6 million citizens,” Ghani wrote.ALSO READ | Why Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's best academic, failed“I have devoted 20 years of my life to helping the Afghan people work towards building a democratic, prosperous, and sovereign state — it was never my intent to abandon the people or that vision,” he further said.A Fulbright Scholar with a doctorate from Columbia University, the 72-year-old economist assumed the presidency of Afghanistan in September 2014, after taking over from Hamid Karzai, who led Afghanistan after the US-led invasion in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ashraf-ghani-afghanistan-president-taliban-corruption-allegation-kabul-101631107628412.html

NRF says it will declare parallel govt in Afghanistan||A day after the Taliban announced their 33-member cabinet, the anti-Taliban force in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that they will announce a parallel rule against the illegitimate government of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Khaama Press reported. “The resistance front acknowledged that they will establish a transitional democratic and legitimate government which is forged based on the votes of people and is acceptable to the international community," the Resistance Front said in a statement, asking international bodies like the Un, UNHRC, OIC etc to not cooperate with the Taliban."The narrative of a modern Taliban is over... there is no Taliban in favour of an inclusive government. This is going to become a pariah government, an illegitimate government... just look at the number of terrorists in this cabinet. And we expect they are going to reform?" Resistance Front's spokesperson Ali Maisam Nazary said, even as they are losing control of the Panjshir valley. Reports have confirmed that Fahim Dashty, one spokesperson of the Resistance has been killed on Sunday triggering speculations that Panjshir leaders Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have left the country. However, Nazary said to AFP that both of them are in the country and are safe. "The Taliban might control more geography but they lack the legitimacy that the National Resistance Front has. There's a nationwide resistance that is forming," Nazary said.The Taliban now face the critical issue of acknowledgement from other countries. The United States issued a state department expressing concern over the non-inclusive nature of the Cabinet and also the past record of most of the Cabinet members. Most countries are buying time to deliberate the issue. The Taliban are facing a massive uproar from inside the country for leaving out many groups in the cabinet. Taliban spokesperson has said that this is just an interim set-up and more representation will be accommodated in the cabinet, though he has not spoken anything about women representation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-are-massoud-amrullah-saleh-nrf-says-it-will-declare-parallel-govt-101631103530131.html

Germany's Commissioner for Culture reacted.Over 80 prominent figures from the culture sector in Germany signed an open letter to Germany's Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media, Monika Grütters, calling on her to personally support colleagues in Afghanistan — with more than just words."Thousands of Afghan activists, journalists and cultural workers, among them filmmakers, photographers, authors, artists and theater workers have contributed to building Afghan civil society over the past 20 years," the signatories write. "We can't let them down!"In some cases, Afghans have been trained and supported by Western institutions, the letter reads. "Now, after the withdrawal of Western troops and the takeover of the Taliban, the lives of these women and men are in acute danger and are threatened by Islamist repression and terror," reads the letter, which appeared as an advertisement in Tuesday's edition of German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). "Dear Ms Grütters! Make it your business to issue a German protection pledge for this group of people, as well."Support from big namesThe open letter was signed by a number of prominent cultural workers in Germany, including conductor Daniel Barenboim, Berlinale film festival directors Carlo Chatrian and Mariette Rissenbeek, filmmakers Volker Schlöndorff and Wim Wenders, and photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, among others.On Tuesday, the Taliban announced a caretaker government consisting entirely of Taliban members. It also reportedly disbanded the Ministry for Women's Affairs, days after violently clamping down on women-led protests against curbs to their freedom under Taliban rule.Minister of State for Culture Grütters reacted to the letter and the latest developments, stating that the situation in Afghanistan "continues to be dramatic, and the plight of the people is great," as reported by German news agency dpa. She added that the German government is attempting to rescue people by land, in evacuation measures led by the Federal Foreign Office, and the Ministry of Culture is in close contact with its Foreign Office colleagues.Expanding assistanceThe Federal Government is determined to continue evacuating people in need of protection, Grütters said. "After their arrival in Germany, I will personally do my utmost to provide adequate support for the people who have fled," she announced. "To this end, we are making additional financial resources available in order to even more strongly expand assistance offers for refugees in the cultural and media sector, such as Writers in Exile here."Writers in Exile is a program funded by the German government that provides grants and temporary housing to writers who face persecution in their home countries.The letter is hardly the first public call to assist Afghans working in the cultural sphere. At the Venice Film Festival this week, Afghan directors asked the film community for support.Filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, the first female president of the Afghan Film Organization, called on international film organizations, including the European Film Academy, to pressure national governments to create humanitarian corridors to help get artists and others who want to leave out of the country, as well as a guarantee that they will be granted the status of political refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-artists-call-for-support-of-afghan-colleagues-101631100391738.html

What experts say||China, the Taliban's most important partner, has said it sees the setting up of the new government in Afghanistan by the Taliban as an end to the anarchy that has been going on in the country for the past two weeks. China also said it is ready to keep the communication channel with the Taliban open. This warming up comes though China is wary of the Taliban providing support to Uyghur separatists.Taliban, on the other hand, said that they are very appreciative of China's aid and projects. The Taliban consider China as the most important partner, a Taliban spokesperson said.Experts have started reading between the lines and breaking down the driving factors between the Taliban and China being warm to each other from day one.'China's interest in Beld and Road'China does not want any reforms in Afghanistan. Neither do issues like human rights and women's rights are ever China's priority, Chinese dissident Jianli Yang wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Times. "China's own interests must be the starting point for Beijing's review of the ever-changing situation in Afghanistan. China has no interest in reforming Afghanistan, nor does it have the strength to do so," he wrote.China wants to deploy military Bagram airbaseChina is looking to expand its influence in the region by deploying military personnel at Bagram airfield, Paul D Shinkman, writing in US News said. The Chinese military is currently conducting a feasibility study about the effect of sending workers, soldiers and other staff related to its foreign economic investment program known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the coming years to Bagram, according to a source briefed on the study by Chinese military officials, who spoke to US News on the condition of anonymity, said Shinkman.China can also do this through Pakistan. "But if feasible, I am sure they would like to cut out the middleman," Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank, said.What China did in Cambodia and MyanmarThe US News analysis draws a parallel to what China did in other countries as well. "Earlier also China's military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly secured exclusive rights to roughly a third of the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia in recent years through an expansion there it's backed," the report said. Similarly in Myanmar, China radar and other military equipment to the local junta on the Coco Islands, where China reportedly held leasing rights for the last three decades."It has employed similar tactics in neighbouring Pakistan, with which it has bolstered new security and intelligence-sharing arrangement in recent years," the analysis said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-is-china-warming-up-to-the-taliban-what-experts-say-101631098719280.html

China is ready to maintain communication with the leaders of the new government, he added.Asked to comment on the Afghanistan situation during the interview with CGTN, Wang Wenbin reiterated that China, as a responsible major power and a neighbouring country of Afghanistan, has a clear and consistent stance on the issue. “We respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan and uphold the principle of non-interference in the country’s internal affairs.”On questions that the new government officials are all from the Taliban, Wang Wenbin called on the Taliban to consult with all ethnicities and sides to meet the expectations of the Afghan people and the international community. “We have also noted the Afghan Taliban’s promise of ensuring all people benefit from the new government.”After the Taliban took power in August, China had called for an “open and inclusive” government to be established.Elaborating on what China wants from a new Afghanistan under the Taliban, Wang Wenbin said Beijing supports the Afghan people to choose a national development path based on the country’s situation.China, he said, hopes the Taliban-led Afghanistan will build an inclusive political structure, stay committed to a moderate domestic and foreign policy, resolutely crack down on all forms of terrorist forces and get along with other countries, especially its neighbours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-will-maintain-communication-with-taliban-led-afghanistan-govt-101631098702795.html

08-09-2021||World||Hasan Akhund, leader of new Afghanistan govt, is a surprise choice||The Taliban announced on Sept 7, 2021, that Mullah Hasan Akhund has been appointed interim prime minister of Afghanistan. The decision comes more than two weeks after the militant Islamist group seized control of much of the country, including the capital, Kabul. The Conversation asked Ali A Olomi, a historian of the Middle East and Islam at Penn State University, to explain who Mullah Akhund is, and what his appointment may portend for Afghanistan amid concern over human rights in the war-ravaged nation.Who is Mullah Hasan Akhund? Mullah Akhund is a fascinating but relatively enigmatic figure in the Taliban. He has been an influential figure in Afghanistan since the inception of the militant group in the 1990s.But unlike other Taliban leaders from that period, he was not involved in the Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s. While Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar and his deputies fought with the mujahedeen – a loose network of anti-Soviet Afghan fighters – Akhund did not.Instead, he is seen much more as a religious influence in the Taliban. He served on the Taliban’s shura councils, the traditional decision-making body made up of religious scholars and mullahs – an honorific given to those trained in Islamic theology. Akhund is probably best known as one of the architects of the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, the giant cliff statues destroyed by the Taliban in 2001.Initially, Omar had no intention of destroying the statues. But the Taliban founder was angered at seeing conservation money being made available for the UNESCO world heritage site while failing to secure humanitarian aid from the United Nations for Afghanistan. As such, Omar sought out the advice of his shura, and Akhund was part of the council that ordered the destruction of the sixth-century statues.Akhund held a political role in the Taliban government of the 1990s, serving as foreign minister; however, his importance lies more in the development of the group’s religious identity. He, like Mullah Omar, was schooled in a brand of strict Islamist ideology, known as Deobandism.After the Taliban was ousted from Afghanistan in 2001, Akhund remained an influential presence, operating mostly from exile in Pakistan. From there he would give spiritual and religious guidance to the Taliban throughout the 2000s and 2010s. In this role, he provided the ideological justification for the ongoing insurgency against the United States and the U.S.-backed Afghan government.Today, there are broadly two factions in the Taliban – a military wing that carries out the day-to-day campaigns, and a conservative religious elite grounded in Deobandism that acts as its political wing. Mullah Akhund aligns very much with the religious faction of the Taliban.What does his appointment tell us about the Taliban? There appears to be a power struggle behind Akhund’s appointment. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who served as deputy to Omar during the early years of the Taliban before assuming the position of de facto leader after Omar’s death, had been seen by many experts on Afghanistan as a potential head of state. But there is political tension between Baradar and the powerful Haqqani network – a family-based Islamist group that has become the Taliban’s de facto diplomatic arm in recent years and has been successful in gaining support for the group among other local groups.The Haqqanis are among the most militant factions of the Taliban. And recent conciliatory language from Baradar on issues such as women’s rights, working with the international community and amnesty for members of the former government runs counter to the ideology of the Haqqani network.Akhund seems to be a compromise candidate between supporters of Baradar and the Haqqani network. The delay in his appointment – the Taliban repeatedly put off making an announcement – could be an indicator of internal divisions in the Taliban. When the announcement came, it was accompanied by news that Baradar would be his deputy, while two members of the Haqqani network would also serve in the Afghan government.Whether this arrangement is permanent or temporary remains to be seen, but the compromise could be a testing of the waters of the Taliban – to see how effective Akhund is as a unifying figure for the group.What does Akhund’s appointment mean for Afghanistan? Akhund is a conservative, religious scholar whose beliefs include restrictions on women and the denial of civil rights for ethic and religious minorities.His edicts in the 1990s, adopted by the Taliban, included the banning of women’s education, enforcing gender segregation and the adoption of strict religious garb. This could all be an indicator of what is to come. Despite the conciliatory language of the Taliban of late, I believe it is likely that we might see a return to some of the rules in place when the Taliban previously held power, including a ban on women’s education.We have already seen on Sept 5 the Taliban order female university students to wear the abaya. The abaya is similar to a burka, but it differs in that the coverings are nearly always black. The abaya is not Afghan, but a style of dress more common in the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.With this order, I see the Taliban signaling its intention to place Afghanistan within a wider Islamist movement. In the 1990s, the Taliban were very much an insular, nationalist group with the aim of bringing its brand of Islamist rule to Afghanistan. Now, Akhund seems to be looking to position the Taliban alongside international partners – an ambition that can also be seen in the Taliban’s recent diplomatic outreach with the governments of Qatar, the UAE and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-it-forms-the-afghan-government-the-taliban-relies-on-old-guard-pashtuns-101631090781955.html

While Mullah Mohammad Hassan has been named as the prime minister, "specially designated global terrorist" Sirajuddin Haqqani - the leader of the feared Haqqani network - has been named the interior minister.All the top positions in the cabinet were handed to key leaders from the movement and the Haqqani network - the most violent faction of the Taliban known for devastating attacks.Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban founder and late supreme leader Mullah Omar, was named the defence minister.Co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar, who oversaw the signing of the US withdrawal agreement in 2020, was appointed deputy prime minister.None of the government appointees were women.Also Read: US lawmakers say there's nothing ‘more moderate’ about the new Taliban regimeHibatullah Akhundzada, the secretive supreme leader of the Taliban, released a statement saying that the new government would "work hard towards upholding Islamic rules and sharia law".However, analysts said the new lineup indicated little had in fact changed."The new Taliban, same as the old Taliban," tweeted Bill Roggio, managing editor of the US-based Long War Journal."It's not at all inclusive, and that's no surprise whatsoever," said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.The announcement of the cabinet came more than two weeks after the Taliban ousted the civilian government headed by Ashraf Ghani and seized power by force in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-new-education-minister-says-phd-master-s-degree-not-valuable-101631085275474.html
08-09-2021||World||China lashes out after US warship sails past Mischief Reef in South China Sea||China on Wednesday deployed fighter jets and lashed out at the US, calling it the “biggest destroyer of peace” after a frontline American warship sailed past a reef close to the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea (SCS), one of the world’s busiest maritime trade lanes.The US navy’s destroyer USS Benfold sailed past the Mischief Reef, located close to Spratly Islands, known as Nansha in China, on Wednesday, saying it was part of FONOP (Freedom of Navigation Operation).Beijing claims nearly the entire SCS including the Spratly Islands but several of its maritime neighbours including The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei have competing claims over the islands and reefs.In July, 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected China’s “nine-dash line” claim in the South China Sea. The tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the “nine-dash line”.The ring-shaped Mischief Reef is located some 250km from The Philippines coast.It was reported in 2017 that China had built several military installations on the Spratly Islands including on the Mischief Reef to effectively bolster its claim.Warships from the US navy frequently sail near the disputed islands, triggering sharp criticism from China.“On September 8, USS Benfold (DDG 65) asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the Spratly Islands, consistent with international law. This FONOP upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea. USS Benfold demonstrated that Mischief Reef, a low-tide elevation in its natural state, is not entitled to a territorial sea under international law,” Lt Mark Langford, deputy public affairs officer of US 7th Fleet said in a statement.“The US engaged in ‘normal operations’ within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef. Under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, features like Mischief Reef that are submerged at high tide in their naturally formed state are not entitled to a territorial sea. The land reclamation efforts, installations, and structures built on Mischief Reef do not change this characterisation under international law,” it said.By engaging in normal operations within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef, the United States demonstrated that vessels may lawfully exercise high-seas freedoms in those areas, Lt Langford’s statement added.“These missions are rule-of-law based and demonstrate our commitment to upholding the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations.”“Freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea are a part of daily operations of US military forces throughout the region,” the statement said.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) southern theatre command (STC) issued a strong statement against the US warship’s movements in the SCS.The command’s spokesperson, Tian Junli, said the operation was carried out without the approval of the Chinese government.The PLA airforce carried out follow-up surveillance and issued a warning to warship, he said. “The US’s serious violation of China’s sovereignty and security is another ironclad evidence of its aggressive navigation hegemony and militarisation of the South China Sea,” Tian Junli said.He added that facts have repeatedly proved that the US is an out-and-out “South China Sea security risk maker” and the “biggest destroyer” of peace and stability in the SCS.The theater command will “remain on high alert, and take all necessary measures to fulfill its duty of protecting national sovereignty and security, as well as peace and stability in the region,” Tian Junli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lashes-out-after-us-warship-sails-past-mischief-reef-in-south-china-sea-101631081781064.html

As such, a photo that has emerged from one such protest in Kabul – portraying the candid spirit of defiance – has now awed the world, with several calling it an ‘iconic’ photograph that will go down in history.Also Read | Inside look at Taliban all-male cabinet: Minister wanted by FBI, with a bounty on his headThe photograph, clicked by the Reuters news agency, was shared by Afghan journalist Zahra Rahimi, a correspondent for Tolo News.

There was no mention of a ministry for women either, and Taliban spokespersons only said that the matter is under further consideration.Also Read | India, Russia on the same page on Taliban-ruled KabulMeanwhile, as the Taliban transition from militant force to governing power, they face a growing number of protests against their rule, that have emerged across the country over the past week with many Afghans fearful of a repeat of the Taliban's previous brutal and oppressive reign from 1996 to 2001.Hundreds gathered at several rallies in Kabul on Tuesday, where Taliban guards fired shots to disperse the crowds.In Herat, hundreds marched, unfurling banners and waving the Afghan flag - a black, red, and green vertical tricolour with the national emblem overlaid in white - with some chanting "freedom". Later, two bodies were brought to the city's central hospital from the site of the protest, a doctor in Herat told AFP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals."They all have bullet wounds," he said.Demonstrations have also been held in smaller cities in recent days, where women have demanded to be part of a new government.The Taliban, on its part, has warned the public against taking to the streets, adding that journalists should not cover any demonstrations. The group - which executed people in stadiums and chopped the hands of thieves in the 1990s - has said it would not stand for any resistance against its rule. (With inputs from the AFP news agency)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-woman-stands-face-to-face-against-taliban-armed-man-image-called-iconic-101631076002179.html

Last week, he surveyed affected areas of Louisiana, which bore the brunt of the hurricane and he is scheduled to visit California next week.“We got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red; the nation and the world are in peril,” Joe Biden said in Queens, New York, where 8 people had died because of flooding in their basement residences.“They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living it in real time now,” Joe Biden added.As Joe Biden went to point out American communities with 100 million people have been struck by extreme weather conditions - that is one in every three Americans.“I mean, every part of the country - every part of the country is getting hit by extreme weather,” he said at a briefing in New Jersey. “And we’re now living in real time what the country is going to look like. And if we don’t do something - we can’t turn it back very much, but we can prevent it from getting worse.”Hurricane Ida, which struck the US a week ago, has killed at least 60 people in New York, New Jersey and Louisiana and left more than half a million people without electricity in Louisiana. And, over 2 million acres have burnt in California wildfires so far, with more fires in the forecast.“Folks, the evidence is clear: Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here. It’s not going to get any better,” Joe Biden said. “The question - can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse.”The Biden administration has proposed several measures to combat warming in the $2.5 trillion rebuilding plan working it ways through US congress, as part of his “Build Back Better” agenda. His Build Back Better plan, with key investments into fighting climate change and cutting emissions will make “things more resilient”, he said.The US president spoke also of the upcoming UN conference on climate change being held in Glasgow, Scotland in October-November, which he is scheduled to attend as is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The goal is to accelerate action towards achieving targets determined in the Paris Agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-warns-of-code-red-moment-on-climate-101631076020054.html

The US Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 and was centered 17 kilometers (about 10 miles) northeast of Acapulco.“We heard a loud noise from the building, noise from the windows, things fell inside the house, the power went out,” said Sergio Flores, an Acapulco resident reached by phone. “We heard leaking water, the water went out of the pool and you heard people screaming, very nervous people.”All he could do when it started shaking was hug his wife, Flores said. He saw people leaving hotels around the bay and some running into parking decks to remove their cars, fearing a collapse.“We were all worried about some change in the sea, but so far authorities have not said anything about a tsunami alert,” he said.The mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román, said in astatement to the television news outlet Milenio that “there is no really serious situation” so far and no reports of casualties.“There are nervous breakdowns, people are worried because there have been aftershocks,” she said, adding that there are "many gas leaks in many places” as well as some landslides and fallen walls.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said via Twitter that authorities in the four states that most felt the earthquake told him there were no victims or serious damage beyond some collapsed walls and falling rocks.“Fortunately there is no serious damage,” he said. “Fortunately, so far we don’t have information about the loss of any lives.”Mexico’s National Civil Defense said it was conducting reviews in 10 states, but had not received reports of victims nor serious damage.In Mexico City, the ground shook for nearly a minute in some parts of the capital, but the quake was less evident in other parts. Some people evacuated their buildings briefly, but most quickly went back inside on a rainy night.Mexico City authorities said there were no early reports of significant damage in the city, though they said electricity was knocked out in some neighborhoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mighty-earthquake-hits-pacific-town-of-acapulco-mexico-city-feels-the-tremors-101631075504943.html

Here's what he said||Joe Biden, president of the United States of America, said on Tuesday (local time) that China has a “real problem” with the Taliban, and thus he has reason to believe that Beijing will work out “some arrangement” with the new rulers in Afghanistan. When asked about the Taliban getting funding from China, Biden responded by saying that China, not unlike Pakistan, Russia, and Iran, is just trying to “figure out” how best to react to the new government that the militants announced a day ago.“China has a real problem with the Taliban,” Biden told reporters at a press conference held in the White House. “So they're going to try to work out some arrangement with the Taliban, I'm sure.

They're all trying to figure out what do they do now.”Also Read | Taliban and its potential international partners: What’s in it for them?The statement from the US president came on the day that the Taliban announced a new interim government in Afghanistan after weeks of deliberation, unveiling an all-male cabinet that also includes a top official who is on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s ‘most wanted’ list, with a bounty of up to $10 million on his head. Although the United States remains reasonably concerned about the make-up of the new cabinet, it is now known that China is preparing to pitch the new Taliban regime as one of its allies.China, before the fall of Kabul, had already prepared to recognise the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of the war-torn nation. Moreover, just a few weeks before the Ashraf Ghani regime fell, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met the Afghan Taliban political commission Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in a bid to develop 'friendly relations' with the group.Further compounding things, Wang Yi held a phone call with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on August 29, where the former said that the international community should engage with the Taliban and "positively guide" them.Also Read | Inside look at Taliban all-male cabinet: Minister wanted by FBI, with a bounty on his headFor its part, the United States has, along with its Group of Seven allies, agreed to coordinate its response to the Taliban. The White House said that the Biden administration has no current plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments, and foreign currency reserves held by the New York Federal Reserve, which it froze after the Taliban takeover. Western powers say formal recognition of the Taliban government and a resulting flow of economic aid will depend on action to safeguard human rights, the rule of law, and the media.However, political experts say that much of this economic leverage will be lost if China, Russia, or any other nation continues to provide funds to the Taliban.

The recommendation was made after a cabinet meeting, following discussions among Nepal prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, Speaker of House of Representatives Agni Sapkota, CPN (Maoist Center) chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and CPN (Unified Socialist) chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal.Nepal's energy minister Pampha Bhusal, as cited by a news outlet, had said that the cabinet decision recommended to the president that both houses of the federal parliament be summoned at 4 pm on September 8.The last session of the Nepal parliament was prorogued to August 17, a day after which the Deuba government introduced an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act, easing party splits and registration of new parties. With the help of this ordinance, the Madhav Kumar Nepal group had split from the CPN-UML and the Mahhanth Thakur faction had broken away from the Janata Samajbadi Party.Madhav Nepal has registered CPN (Unified Socialist) while Thakur has registered Loktantrik Samajbadi Party.The Election Commission has given until September 7 to those who were elected to provincial and local levels under the UML and the Janata Samajbadi to choose sides–whether they want to stay in the mother parties or the newly registered outfits, the report said.Madhav Nepal, a former prime minister, had gone against the party and supported the then Opposition alliance in its bid to topple the government led by former prime minister K P Sharma Oli. His faction has already made a decision to join the Deuba-led coalition government.The recognition of the Madhav Nepal-led party brings to end a long-standing feud between him and former prime minister Oli in the UML.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-federal-parliament-to-begin-its-new-session-today-101631065082128.html
