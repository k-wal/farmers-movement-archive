Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will head an interagency delegation to the gathering, which follows an initial meeting in July at which little progress was made. The first meeting took place after Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin agreed at a summit in June to restart talks.The State Department said the two side intended “to have a deliberate and robust dialogue that will seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures.” It gave no additional details but said Sherman would travel from Geneva to Bern and then to Uzbekistan and wrap her trip up in nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan.After the first round of talks in July, the US said the discussions with the Russian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov had been “substantive and professional” but had produced little in the way of substantive results except for an agreement to meet again.A senior State Department official who participated in those talks said the U.S. was pleased with the initial exchange and hopeful that it would be the start of a “sustained and productive dialogue” on arms control and other strategic issues.The official told reporters the agenda was not strictly confined to traditional nuclear arms control, but also delved into the use of space and artificial intelligence as well as cyber matters, although the cyber discussion was focused on strategic issues and nuclear weapons and not ransomware or hacking.The official said the Russians, as expected, raised concerns about American missile defenses, and the American side responded with Washington’s usual argument that those systems are not aimed at Russia but rather at threats posed by Iran and North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2nd-round-of-strategic-talks-between-us-russia-to-be-held-this-week-101632763286721.html

Akkash al-Zabin, and top officials, President Nasser and Tunisian Premier Bahi Ladgam received him at the airport.Amman: Jordanian Crown Prince, the Emir Hassan, will act in King Hussein's place during the King’s current visit to Cairo, Radio Amman stated today. The radio said the newly-formed Jordanian Cabinet decided at its first meeting to give priority to re-opening the city’s water and electricity supplies.Military Governor Habes Majali formed a special committee under the Minister of National Economy to channel aid to the wounded.Shelling in Amman Beirut: A Palestinian guerilla spokesman here said Jordanian forces shelled parts of Amman, and the towns of Zarka and Salt early today. The Fatah guerilla spokesman said commandos still controlled the Roman city of Jerash and were "liquidating pockets of Jordanian troops trying to open fire I on civilians." People who arrived in Beirut from Amman aboard a Red Cross plane this morning said there was still some firing going on in the Jordanian Capital. The spokesman accused Jordanian authorities of waging a "war of hunger" against their people by preventing food, water and medical supplies from reaching revolutionary strongholds in Amman. In yet another attack on the Jordanian regime following the ceasefire agreement, they demanded that King Hussein stand trial 'for the annihilation of the human race." The tone of the statement gave little encouragement to observers here who had hoped that an end was in sight to the Jordanian crisis after 10 days of tank, artillery, infantry and air attack. Washington: President Nixon has authorised an initial $5 million relief aid for Jordan and said the United States will replace arms lost by King Hussein's forces. Under-Secretary of State John Irwin announced yesterday that the U.S. embassies in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon had been ordered to make immediate purchases of relief supplies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-sept-28-1975-hussein-arafat-sign-peace-agreement-101632763695585.html
27-09-2021||World||Qatar Airways says it lost $4.1 billion due to Covid-19||Qatar Airways said Monday it received $3 billion in state aid to weather the coronavirus travel downturn and to offset losses it blamed on the cost of grounding aircraft.The airline reported an overall loss of $4.1 billion for the year to March 31, double the figure for the same period the year before.Without the cost of grounding its Airbus A380 and A330 aircraft, Qatar Airways reported an underlying operating loss for the year of $228.3 million compared with $310 million the previous year.The Gulf carrier did report a slight uptick in overall earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in the amount of cargo carried in the last 12=month period.Qatar is among several governments that have stepped in to support their national carriers through the coronavirus shutdown, which has pummelled global travel and the aviation industry.In September 2020 the airline reported it had received $2 billion in state aid after its annual losses exceeded 50 percent of share capital."We adapted our entire commercial operation to respond to ever-evolving travel restrictions and never stopped flying," Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement, calling the last 12-month period "difficult"."While our organisation did not receive any subsidies in the form of salary support or grants, (the Qatari government) did provide an equity injection of 11 billion riyals ($3 billion) to support the business's continuity."Monday's results are the first full year numbers since the United Arab Emirates, a key market for the Gulf carrier, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, ended a boycott of Qatar in place since June 2017.They had accused Doha of links to extremist groups and being too close to Iran, Riyadh's regional arch-rival -- charges Qatar denied -- closing their airspace, borders and markets to Doha until a deal was struck in January.Qatar Airways is the second largest airline in the Middle East after Dubai-based Emirates, operating a fleet of 253 aircraft -- although some remain grounded during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-airways-says-it-lost-4-1-billion-due-to-covid19-101632761884258.html
27-09-2021||World||‘Crossed all red lines’: Bennett vows not to allow Iran acquire a nuclear weapon||Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Monday that Iran had crossed "all red lines" in its nuclear program and vowed that Israel would not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon.In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Bennett said Iran sought to dominate the Middle East under a "nuclear umbrella" and urged a more concerted international effort to halt Iran's nuclear activities.But he also hinted at the potential for Israel to act on its own against Iran, something it has repeatedly threatened in the past."Iran's nuclear program has hit a watershed moment, and so has our tolerance. Words do not stop centrifuges from spinning," Bennett said. "Israel will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon."While there was no immediate response from Iran, Bennett, a far-right politician who opposes Palestinian statehood, drew an angry Palestinian reaction after he failed to mention the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his speech.Bennett, who ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run as prime minister in June, wants US President Joe Biden to harden his stance against Iran, Israel's regional arch-foe. He opposes US efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, abandoned in 2018.Indirect U.S.-Iran talks in Vienna have stalled as Washington awaits the next move by Iran's new hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi.Bennett struck a less combative tone at the United Nations than Netanyahu, who often relied on props to dramatize his accusations against Iran, an approach that critics derided as political stunts.But Bennett has been just as adamant as Netanyahu was in pledging to do whatever is necessary to prevent Iran, which Israel views as an existential threat, from building a nuclear weapon. Iran consistently denies it is seeking a bomb."Iran's nuclear weapons program is at a critical point. All red lines have been crossed, inspections ignored," Bennett said. "They're getting away with it."He called for international action. "If we put our heads to it, if we're serious about stopping it, if we use our resourcefulness, we can prevail," Bennett said.Biden told Bennett in White House talks in August that he was putting "diplomacy first" with Iran but if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options.Bennett also took aim at Raisi, referring to him as the "butcher of Tehran" and accusing him of human rights abuses against his own people over the years. Raisi, a Shi'ite cleric, is under U.S. sanctions over allegations of human rights abuses when he was a judge.Ignores Israeli-Palestinian conflictBennett made not a single direct mention of the Palestinians in his remarks, except to accuse Iran of backing anti-Israel militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.Bennett, who sits atop an ideologically diverse coalition, was formerly the leader of the main settler movement in the occupied West Bank."Deliberately omitting a reference to Palestine reflects his fear of it, and once again proves to the international community that he is not and will not be a partner for Palestinians in the peace and negotiation process," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told Reuters.Biden, in his UN speech last week, declared renewed U.S. support for a two-state solution, after Trump distanced himself from that longstanding tenet of U.S. policy, but said Israel and the Palestinians were a long way from achieving it.Biden’s aides are mindful that US pressure for a resumption of long-dormant peace talks could destabilize the fragile Israeli coalition.Addressing the General Assembly on Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of destroying the two-state solution with actions he said could lead Palestinians to demand equal rights within one binational state comprising Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.Bennett focused instead on Israel’s landmark normalization agreements brokered by the Trump administration last year with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. "More is to come," he said.Israel has trumpeted its new diplomatic relations as helping to forge a regional bulwark against their shared foe, Iran.Palestinian officials said they felt betrayed by their Arab brethren for reaching deals with Israel without first demanding progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crossed-all-red-lines-bennett-vows-not-to-allow-iran-acquire-a-nuclear-weapon-101632761145101.html

South Korean animal protection laws are intended to prevent cruelty but not dog meat consumption itself, according to Yonhap News Agency.The public has turned away from dog meat, with consumption dropping sharply over the past several years. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in dog and cat ownership, especially among younger Koreans who welcome the animals into their homes and see them as family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-president-moon-jae-in-considers-ban-on-dog-meat-consumption-101632749153981.html

The event was scheduled for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT).American health authorities have recommended boosters for three categories of people: those 65 and older, those 18-64 with an underlying medical condition such as diabetes or obesity, and those who are especially exposed to the virus because of their work or where they live.About 60 million people in the United States are eligible for a Pfizer booster shot, Biden said last week.Biden received his first Pfizer dose last December and a second in January, when he was still president-elect.He said people who have received Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccinations could get booster shots once studies have been completed and he expected that all Americans would be eligible "in the near term."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday that data on Moderna and J&J boosters would be evaluated "in the coming weeks."Biden had wanted to launch a mass campaign of Pfizer and Moderna booster shots this week for all Americans.But the move was put on hold by the US health authorities, dividing medical experts and triggering confusion about booster policy.The CDC on Friday overruled its own panel of health experts to back Pfizer booster shots for individuals at high risk of exposure to Covid-19 because of their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shot-white-house-101632756710724.html

Here's what happened||Amid intense speculation surrounding Afghanistan’s representation at the UN General Assembly, diplomats have said that no one from the war-torn country will address the annual session this year, according to news agencies. Ghulam Isaczai, the UN ambassador representing the ousted Afghan government, was due to speak on the final day of the General Assembly session but withdrew his name late on Sunday, news agencies reported."The country withdraws its participation in the general debate," AFP quoted Monica Grayley, a spokesperson for the UNGA president as saying.The withdrawal comes amid competing claims for Afghanistan’s UN seat in New York. Isaczai had earlier written to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urging to allow him to retain his New York seat despite the Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the foreign minister in the Taliban’s interim government had nominated Suhail Shaheen, the spokesperson for the Islamist group, to address the gathering of world leaders.Also Read | ICC prosecutor seeks approval to resume war crimes probe in Afghanistan; focus on Taliban, ISIS-KWhile the rivals fight for accreditation at the UN, the committee that assesses the credentials of all UN members traditionally meets in October or November.

While the company said that it stands by the “need” for the app, the project has been paused to consult with the parents and other stakeholders and explain to them its importance.Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of Instagram made the announcement in a blog post on Monday. “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,” Mosseri said. “This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,” he added.We’re pausing “Instagram Kids”, although we believe building it is the right thing to do. More here: https://t.co/bwCyUn97SoHowever, the company has also assured that it will continue to build parental supervision tools to enable parents to oversee their children’s accounts, especially to teen accounts (aged 13 and above). “These new features, which parents and teens can opt into, will give parents the tools to meaningfully shape their teen's experience. We’ll have more to share on this in the coming months,” Mosseri said.Further, the company also stressed that pausing the programme does not imply that the idea was bad and said that kids are already online.“Critics of “Instagram Kids” will see this as an acknowledgement that the project is a bad idea. That’s not the case. The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today,” Mosseri said.Also read | US court orders Facebook to release data related to violence against RohingyaInstagram KidsKnown commonly as “Instagram Kids”, the project was started to give parents the option of providing their children with a version of Instagram which is designed specifically for them.Mosseri, in his blog post, said that more and more younger children are having access to phones and are downloading apps that are not meant for children under 13. The project, however, could help the parents to supervise and control the experience of their children, he added.Several news reports showed mounting criticism for the project after it was announced back in March this year. In May, a group of bipartisan attorneys in the US wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to abandon the project considering the well-being of children, according to a news report by the Associated Press.Also read | Facebook apologises after AI feature mistakenly labels Black men as ‘primates’‘Instagram toxic for teen girls’The controversy surrounding the issue started with a report in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that claimed Facebook had failed to fix the “ill effects” of the platform which its researchers had identified.The WSJ cited a review of internal company documents, research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management for its report, according to several news agencies.Among major issues, the report said that Facebook played down the negative effects of Instagram on young users, according to a news report by Reuters.

The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced,” the statement showed.The WSJ had reported that a slide from one of Facebook’s internal presentations in 2019, titled ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls’, showed the research about teen girls who experienced the issues.In response, Raychoudhury shared the slide in question and said “While the headline in the internal slide does not explicitly state it, the research shows one in three of those teenage girls who told us they were experiencing body image issues reported that using Instagram made them feel worse — not one in three of all teenage girls.” The statement also said WSJ had not shared the slide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/instagram-kids-facebook-pauses-project-after-criticism-says-will-listen-to-concerns-101632753486941.html
27-09-2021||World||India increasingly important for Germany due to Indo-Pacific role, says envoy||India is an increasingly important partner for Germany because of its strategic role in the Indo-Pacific and the next government in Berlin is expected to continue a policy of working closely with New Delhi, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday.Speaking shortly after the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) claimed victory in Germany’s federal election by securing an edge over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, Lindner said all German political parties have largely similar security, global strategic and environmental interests in which the “importance of India is obvious”.With India set to become the world’s most populous country, major global issues – including global warming, climate change, population growth, vaccines, trade and terrorism – cannot be resolved without India, both at the multilateral and bilateral level, Lindner told a group of journalists.India and the Indo-Pacific may seem far away from Germany, but the region is increasingly taking on a central role in the German government’s vision because of its importance to global trade. Noting that a significant chunk of trade routes used by an export-driven economy such as Germany pass through the Indo-Pacific, Lindner said these routes could be “blocked by turmoil” or affected by states that don’t follow international rules.Germany’s focus on the Indo-Pacific is not a military strategy but part of an overall effort to protect the country’s interests, the ambassador said. As a part of these initiatives, Germany has sent a frigate to the Indo-Pacific, with the warship making stops in several countries.This was done despite some resistance to the move in Germany because of the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific and the frigate will also travel to Mumbai, Lindner said. The enhanced cooperation between the militaries of the two countries has dovetailed with the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific, he added.The two sides have also had a very strong strategic partnership for 12 years and bilateral trade is currently worth more than $20 billion. Some 2,000 German companies have a presence in India with 600,000 jobs and Germany is one of India’s biggest development partners. Germany is also home to about 25,000 Indian students, one of the largest concentrations in Europe.Lindner was confident that the next German chancellor would have enough advisers to help steer relations with India. Relations between France and Germany, which are the “motor of the European Union”, too will be crucial, he said. Responding to questions on the situation in Afghanistan, Lindner said Germany and other countries will have to talk to the Taliban to ensure the preservation of human rights and formation of an inclusive government, to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid, to ensure the evacuation of those who wish to leave, and to prevent any “fostering of terrorism”.“Do we talk to the Taliban? Yes, we do [like others] but not to establish relations, but to get those people out whom we still have there...we still have people there who worked for us,” he said.States will also have to talk to the Taliban to provide immediate relief through the UN and “so that we have some sort of influence” on issues such as human rights, guaranteeing the rights of women and children, inclusiveness of the government, and “no more fostering of terrorism”, he said.Lindner acknowledged that there was a “misjudgement of the Taliban and the velocity of the spread of the Taliban everywhere” by most countries. “No one predicted this outcome, everyone thought it would take longer and there would be more time to get people out,” he said about the fall of Kabul on August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-increasingly-important-for-germany-because-of-role-in-indo-pacific-german-envoy-101632753469356.html
27-09-2021||World||Pumps run dry at British gas stations as shortage of truckers strain supply||Gas station pumps ran dry in major British cities on Monday and vendors rationed sales as a shortage of truckers strained supply chains to breaking point in the world's fifth-largest economy.A dire post-Brexit shortage of lorry drivers revealed as the Covid-19 pandemic eases has sown chaos through British supply chains in everything from food to fuel, raising the spectre of disruptions and price rises in the run up to Christmas.Drivers queued for hours to fill their cars at gas stations that were still serving fuel, albeit often rationed, and there were calls for National Health Service (NHS) workers to be given priority, to keep hospitals open as the pandemic continues."As pumps run dry there is a real risk that NHS staff won't be able to do their jobs, and provide vital services and care to people who urgently need it," said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association's council chair.Pumps across British cities were either closed or had signs saying fuel was unavailable on Monday, Reuters reporters said, with some limiting the amount of fuel each customer could buy.The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent fuel retailers which now account for 65% of all UK forecourts, said members had reported that 50% to 90% of pumps were dry in some areas."We need some calm," Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA, who worked for BP for 30 years, told Reuters. "Please don't panic buy: if people drain the network then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."Royal Dutch Shell said it had seen higher than usual demand for fuel across its British network and that some sites were running low on some grades of fuel.Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was no shortage of fuel, urged people to stop panic buying and said there were no plans to get the army to drive trucks, though the Ministry of Defence would help with trucker testing.Hauliers, gas stations and retailers warned that there were no quick fixes, however, as the shortfall of truck drivers - estimated to be around 100,000 - was so acute, and because transporting fuel demands additional training and licensing.Brexit crunch ?For months, supermarkets, processors and farmers have warned that a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers was straining supply chains to breaking point - making it harder to get goods onto shelves.Amid warnings of a dire winter ahead, some politicians in the European Union linked the supply chain stress to the 2016 Brexit referendum and Britain's subsequent decision to seek a distant relationship with the bloc."The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we tried very hard to convince the British not to leave the Union," said Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor."They decided differently. I hope they will manage the problems coming from that," Scholz said.British ministers have insisted that Brexit is nothing to do with the current trucker shortage, though around 25,000 truckers returned to Europe before Brexit. Britain was also unable to test 40,000 drivers during Covid-19 lockdowns.The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.Edwin Atema, the head of research and enforcement at the Netherlands-based FNV union, told the BBC that EU drivers were unlikely to flock to Britain given the conditions on offer."The EU workers we speak to will not go to the UK for a short-term visa to help UK out of the shit they created themselves," Atema said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pumps-run-dry-at-british-gas-stations-as-shortage-of-truckers-strain-supply-101632747990020.html

Last year, the office of the prosecutor received approval from ICC’s Appeals Chamber to investigate the alleged atrocity crimes in Afghanistan since July 2002 but the investigation was deferred on request of now-ousted Afghanistan’s government.Karim Asad Ahmad Khan QC, a British lawyer and a specialist in international criminal law, commended the Ashraf Ghani-led government for constructive engagement with his office and the efforts aimed at “discharging its Rome Statute obligations.” Referring to the Taliban’s capture of Kabul, Khan said in a statement that the recent development and change in regime represent a significant change of circumstances impacting the “ongoing assessment of the deferral request”.“After reviewing matters carefully, I have reached the conclusion that, at this time, there is no longer the prospect of genuine and effective domestic investigations into Article 5 crimes within Afghanistan. It is this finding that has necessitated the present application,” he stated.The prosecutor said the investigation will focus on crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban and the Khorasan branch of the Islamic State (ISIS-K) given the “limited resource available” to his office and will deprioritise other aspects of this investigation. Khan mentioned the recent suicide attack outside the Hamid Karzai Internation Airport in Kabul that killed dozens of civilians and 13 US soldiers as one of the reasons to prioritise the crimes by ISIS-K for the investigation.“In relation to those aspects of the investigation that have not been prioritised, my Office will remain alive to its evidence preservation responsibilities, to the extent they arise, and promote accountability efforts within the framework of the principle of complementarity,” Khan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/icc-prosecutor-seeks-approval-to-resume-war-crimes-probe-in-afghanistan-focus-on-taliban-isisk-101632741378142.html

I request authorities to punish the perpetrators in the same way as we did with those behind the attack on Quaid-e-Azam residency in Ziarat,” Balochistan’s former home minister and current Senator Sarfraz Bugti tweeted.Bugti was referring to a 121-year-old building, which the Baloch militants blasted and raked with gunfire. Jinnah had spent his last days of life and was later declared a national monument. The building caught fire due to the blast and gunfire, destroying furniture and memorabilia.Balochistan has been witnessing a spate of violence for several years, mostly due to the activities of the Baloch National Army. Recently, the BLA had targeted a motorcade of Chinese engineers at the Gwadar East Bay Expressway project in which two local children were killed and a Chinese national was injured."The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan strongly condemns this act of terrorism, extends its sincere sympathies to the injured of both countries, and expresses its deep condolences to the innocent victims in Pakistan," the embassy said in a statement after the attack.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jinnahs-statue-destroyed-in-blast-in-pakistan-s-balochistan-101632734079831.html

The agreement with federal prosecutors ended an almost three-year extradition battle in Canada as the US sought her prosecution. At the same time, China released Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained on spying charges in what critics in the US and Canada denounced as “hostage diplomacy.” On Monday, Hua asserted that the two cases weren’t connected, saying the Canadians’ release was “totally different.” “It is thanks to the relentless efforts of the party and the government and the full support of all the Chinese people nationwide that Meng Wanzhou is able to come back safe and sound,” Hua said. “This once again proves that Chinese citizens can rely on a strong China under the leadership of the CPC to have their back.”Meng’s return meets one of China’s key demands to improve relations that have soured since a trade war erupted during the Trump administration. The deal comes two weeks after President Joe Biden called Xi in frustration over Beijing’s move to link progress on climate change with other demands, including her release as well as lifting sanctions and removing punitive tariffs.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that Ottawa learned a deal for Meng’s release was likely about two weeks ago.“The fact that a deferred prosecution agreement proposal had been arrived at between the Department of Justice, which operates independently, and Huawei lawyers, and that Meng Wanzhou was ready to sign it and that it seemed acceptable to the Department of Justice, that sort of unlocked the whole process and things happened extremely rapidly after that,” he said.China had insisted the US take the first step to improving ties, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi saying earlier this month that America “should meet China halfway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-case-xi-personally-gave-order-ensured-safe-return-of-meng-says-china-101632733685568.html

The space agency said that the launch is scheduled to take place at 2.11pm EDT (11.41pm IST).The satellite will be launched on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.Nasa said in a release that Landsat-9 will continue the legacy of monitoring Earth's land and coastal regions that began with the first satellite in the series in 1972.Here are the key points about the Landsat-9 launch today:• According to Nasa, Landsat-9 will join its sister satellite, Landsat 8, in orbit in collecting images from across the planet every eight days.• The US Space Force’s Space Launch Delta 30 has predicted a 90 per cent chance of favourable weather conditions for the launch. The primary weather concerns are ground winds.• Landsat-9 will carry two instruments: the Operational Land Imager 2, which collects images of Earth’s landscapes in visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared light, and the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2, which measures the temperature of land surfaces.• Images from Landsat-9 will be added to nearly 50 years of free and publicly available data from the mission - the longest data record of Earth's landscapes taken from space.• The advance equipment onboard Landsat-9 will give a boost to space scientists' ability to measure changes on the global land surface, said Nasa. It will allow the scientists to separate human-induced and natural causes of change on land surface, the agency added.• Two small research satellites will also hitch a ride in the spacecraft's secondary payload adapter.• The Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE) from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Cusp Plasma Imaging Detector (CuPID) from Boston University, are shoebox-sized spacecraft, each measuring approximately 8 inches by 4 inches by 13 inches.• Nasa said that CUTE aims to provide a better understanding of atmospheric loss on all types of planets by measuring atmospheric escape rates from giant exoplanets.• CUTE will target 10 to 12 exoplanets during its eight-month science mission, conducting a survey of heavy elements, such as iron and magnesium, escaping from the atmospheres of the most extreme planets in the galaxy.• CuPID, meanwhile, will study how energy from the Sun is deposited into the Earth’s magnetosphere - a protective bubble around our home planet, the space agency added. This mission could solve long-standing questions on space weather and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, said Nasa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-landsat-9-to-launch-today-with-cute-cupid-missions-10-points-101632730813575.html
27-09-2021||World||Social Democrats narrowly beat Angela Merkel's bloc in German vote||Germany's center-left Social Democrats won the biggest share of the vote in a national election Sunday, narrowly beating outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel 's center-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the long-time leader at the helm of Europe's biggest economy.The Social Democrats' candidate Olaf Scholz, the outgoing vice chancellor and finance minister who pulled his party out of a years-long slump, said the outcome was “a very clear mandate to ensure now that we put together a good, pragmatic government for Germany.”Despite getting its worst-ever result in a federal contest, the Union bloc said it too would reach out to smaller parties to discuss forming a government, while Merkel stays on in a caretaker role until a successor is sworn in.Election officials said early Monday that a count of all 299 constituencies showed the Social Democrats received 25.9% of the vote, ahead of 24.1% for the Union bloc. No winning party in a German national election had previously taken less than 31% of the vote.Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state who outmaneuvered a more popular rival to secure the nomination of Merkel's Union bloc, had struggled to motivate the party's base and suffered a series of missteps.“Of course, this is a loss of votes that isn't pretty,” Laschet said of results that looked set to undercut by some measure the Union's previous worst showing of 31% in 1949. But he added that with Merkel departing after 16 years in power, “no one had an incumbent bonus in this election.”Laschet told supporters that “we will do everything we can to form a government under the Union's leadership, because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernizes our country.”Both Laschet and Scholz will be courting the same two parties: the environmentalist Greens, who were third with 14.8%; and the pro-business Free Democrats, who took 11.5% of the vote.The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither ruled out going the other way.The other option was a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition” of the Union and Social Democrats that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel's 16 years in power, but there was little obvious appetite for that after years of government squabbling.“Everyone thinks that ... this grand coalition' isn't promising for the future, regardless of who is No. 1 and No. 2,” Laschet said. “We need a real new beginning.”The Free Democrats' leader, Christian Lindner, appeared keen to govern, suggesting that his party and the Greens should make the first move.“About 75% of Germans didn't vote for the next chancellor's party,” Lindner said in a post-election debate with all parties' leaders on public broadcaster ZDF. “So it might be advisable ... that the Greens and Free Democrats first speak to each other to structure everything that follows.”Baerbock insisted that “the climate crisis ... is the leading issue of the next government, and that is for us the basis for any talks ... even if we aren't totally satisfied with our result.”While the Greens improved their support from the last election in 2017, they had higher expectations for Sunday's vote.The Left Party was projected to win only 4.9% of the vote and risked being kicked out of parliament entirely. The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no one else wants to work with — received 10.3%. This was about 2 percentage points less than in 2017, when it first entered parliament.Due to Germany's complicated electoral system, a full breakdown of the result by seats in parliament was still pending.Merkel, who has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises, won't be an easy leader to follow. Her successor will have to oversee the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.Germany's leading parties have significant differences when it comes to taxation and tackling climate change.Foreign policy didn't feature much in the campaign, although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.Whichever parties form the next German government, the Free Democrats' Lindner said it was “good news” that it would have a majority with centrist parties.“All of those in Europe and beyond who were worried about Germany's stability can now see: Germany will be stable in any case,” he said.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sent early congratulations to Scholz.“Spain and Germany will continue to work together for a stronger Europe and for a fair and green recovery that leaves no one behind,” he wrote on Twitter.In two regional elections also held Sunday, the Social Democrats looked set to defend the post of Berlin mayor that they have held for two decades. The party was also on course for a strong win in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania.For the first time since 1949, the Danish minority party SSW was set to win a seat in parliament, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-democrats-narrowly-beat-angela-merkel-s-bloc-in-german-vote-101632719494630.html

The study showed that life expectancy dropped by more than six months compared with 2019 in 22 countries and reductions in life expectancy were seen in 27 countries out of the 29, including the United States, Europe and Chile. According to data by worldometers.com, 4,761,895 people have succumbed to Covid-19 till now across the world and the US continues to top the death toll at 706,317, followed by Brazil and India.The study revealed that there was a greater reduction in life expectancy for men than women in the majority of the countries. The largest reduction was seen in men from the United States, who saw life expectancy drop by 2.2 years relative to 2019. "The fact that our results highlight such a large impact that is directly attributable to Covid-19 shows how devastating a shock it has been for many countries," said Dr Ridhi Kashyap, co-lead author of the paper, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Dr Kashyap appealed to more countries, including those in the bracket of low and middle incomeIn the US, the surge in mortality was largely seen in people of working age and those below 60 years. On the other hand, deaths due to Covid-19 among people over 60 years contributed more significantly towards the increase in mortality, the Oxford University study also showed.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking to revive its probe into the origins of the coronavirus disease, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. A team of 20 scientists is being formed to carry out the investigation. The revival comes after an initial inquiry by the United Nations (UN) body found out that the data provided by Chinese scientists is insufficient to answer important queries about Covid-19 origin.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-slashed-life-expectancy-by-most-since-world-war-ii-oxford-study-101632713223576.html

27-09-2021||World||Two women, political opposites, vying in race for next Japanese PM||The inclusion of two women among the four candidates vying to become the next prime minister seems like a big step forward for Japan's notoriously sexist politics. But their fate is in the hands of a conservative, mostly male governing party — and the leading female candidate has been criticized by observers for her right-wing gender policies.Sanae Takaichi and Seiko Noda are the first women in 13 years seeking the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in an election Wednesday. The winner is certain to become the next prime minister because of a parliamentary majority held by the LDP and its coalition partner.While both are LDP members, they are political opposites in many ways. The ultra-conservative Takaichi advocates a kind of paternalistic nationalism and a stronger military, while the liberal-leaning, pacifist Noda supports women's advancement and sexual diversity.“As tiny minorities in Japanese politics, women have limited choices to survive and succeed; they can confront the boys' club politics or they can be loyal to them,” said Mayumi Taniguchi, an expert on women's roles in society and politics at the Osaka University of Arts.Takaichi apparently chose loyalty while Noda appears to work outside the mainstream but without being confrontational, Taniguchi said.“They are quite different”In the race to pick a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the women are competing against vaccinations minister Taro Kono and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. Kono and Kishida are considered the top candidates; both are from well-known political families and belong to powerful party factions.But Takaichi is seen by some as a fast-rising candidate, with the crucial backing of former leader Shinzo Abe, whose arch-conservative vision she supports. The latest media surveys of party lawmakers show she is beginning to rake in support from party conservatives, while Noda remains firmly in fourth place.The only other earlier female candidate was Yuriko Koike, currently serving as Tokyo governor, who made a run in 2008.While it's unlikely either Takaichi or Noda will become prime minister, having two women try for the top job is considered progress for the ruling party. Some experts, however, have criticized Takaichi's gender policies.“She will most likely not promote women's advancements if she wins,” said Sophia University political science professor Mari Miura.“She will emphasize her achievement in breaking the glass ceiling and declare that Japan is already a gender equal country, even that it is ahead of the United States."Japan ranked worst among the Group of Seven advanced nations — 120th in a 156-nation gender gap ranking survey of the World Economic Forum in 2021.Women comprise only about 10 per cent of Japan's parliament, and analysts say many tend to try to advance by showing party loyalty rather than pursuing gender equality.Takaichi has supported women's health and fertility issues, in line with the LDP policy of having women serve in their traditional roles of being good mothers and wives, but she is unlikely to promote women's rights or sexual diversity, Miura said.Takaichi, 60, was first elected to parliament in 1993 and her role model is Margaret Thatcher. She has served in key party and government posts, including ministers of internal affairs and gender equality.A drummer in a heavy-metal band and a motorbike rider as a student, she supports the imperial family's male-only succession, and opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the 19th-century civil law that could allow women to keep their maiden name.Taniguchi, the analyst, says Takaichi's backing of the party majority is "unfortunate as her success could make many women think that speaking and acting on behalf of men is the way to be successful in this country.”Takaichi, who shares Abe's revisionist views on Japan's wartime atrocities, regularly visits the Yasukuni shrine, which honors war criminals among the war dead and is viewed by China and the Koreas as proof of Japan's lack of remorse.Her security policies include developing a preemptive strike capability to counter threats from China and North Korea.Political watchers say Abe's backing of Takaichi was made partly because he's aware of the need to improve the party's sexist image, and also to divert votes from Kono, the current front-runner and considered something of a maverick.Abe had promoted women's advancement, but his party made little progress and failed to meet a goal to have women represent 30 per cent of decision-making positions by 2020, postponing it by as long as a decade.Having a leader who prioritizes loyalty to men instead of fighting for other women's advancement, like Takaichi, could counter efforts to eliminate gender gaps, Miura, the professor, said.While Noda would push for more equality and diversity, her gender-equal policy is likely to be opposed by conservatives.Noda, 61, supports same-sex marriage and has campaigned for a quota system to increase the number of female lawmakers. She has promised to appoint women to half of her Cabinet if she wins.Noda had her first child, who is disabled, at age 50 after fertility treatment.Japan's rapidly shrinking population is a serious national security risk because Japan won't have enough troops or police in coming decades, she said in a recent campaign speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-women-political-opposites-vying-in-race-for-next-japanese-pm-101632710272052.html
27-09-2021||World||Germany polls: Country heads into unknown as rivals scramble to lead next govt||Germany headed into a period of unpredictability Monday after a close election saw both main parties claim the right to lead Europe's biggest economy, leaving the question of who will succeed Angela Merkel wide open.Partial results early Monday narrowly put the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) in the lead at 25-26 percent, followed by Merkel's centre-right CDU-CSU bloc with a record-low score of around 24 percent. The Green party placed third with around 14 percent.The SPD's chancellor candidate, Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and his rival Armin Laschet from Merkel's conservative camp each claimed a mandate to govern, setting off a scramble for potential coalition partners.For a country used to political stability after 16 years of Merkel's steady leadership, the coming weeks and months promise to be a rocky ride.Western allies are watching closely, aware that domestic preoccupations could blunt Germany's role on the international stage and create a leadership vacuum in Europe.Laschet, 60, and Scholz, 63, both said their goal was to have a new government in place before Christmas.Citizens "want a change in government," said Scholz, who ran an error-free campaign that cast him as a safe pair of hands, contrasting sharply with Laschet's series of gaffes.Poker game"Scholz wants to be in power, so does Laschet. The poker game begins: who holds the better cards?" asked the best-selling Bild newspaper.In the fractured political landscape of the post-Merkel era, the most likely outcome will be a three-way alliance, ending the post-war tradition of two-party coalition governments.Scholz and Laschet will be looking to the Greens and the liberal, pro-business FDP party (11.5 percent) to make up the numbers needed for a parliamentary majority.The kingmakers however are not natural bedfellows, diverging strongly on issues like tax hikes and public investment in climate protection.Green chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock -- whose party hoped to do better with the climate crisis a top voter concern this year -- stayed vague about her preferred tie-up, saying only it was time for "a fresh start" in Germany.FDP leader Christian Lindner suggested sitting down with the Greens first before starting exploratory talks with the two bigger parties to speed up the process."Europe is waiting for Germany to have a new government," he said on Sunday evening.Lindner has signalled a preference for a "Jamaica" coalition with the CDU-CSU and the Greens -- named after those parties' black, green and yellow colours -- but has not ruled out a "traffic light" constellation with the SPD and the Greens.OptionsLaschet also evoked a sense of urgency on Sunday, saying Germany's stint as president of the G7 club of rich nations next year meant the country needed to have a government in place capable of taking action."The new government must come into office soon," he said, "definitely before Christmas".Neither the SPD nor the CDU-CSU want a repeat of the left-right "grand coalition" that has featured in three of Merkel's four governments.And no party will team up with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose score fell to 10.5 percent from nearly 13 percent at the last election in 2017 as its pet topic, immigration, fell off the agenda.The far-left Linke party also lost support and was teetering on the edge of the five-percent threshold needed to enter parliament.Until the complex negotiations are settled, Merkel will remain in her role in a caretaker capacity.Should the talks last beyond December 17, Merkel will overtake Helmut Kohl's record as Germany's longest-serving chancellor.'Hurts a lot'Merkel is still Germany's most popular politician, whose voluntary departure marks a watershed moment for the country of 83 million people.Her legacy risks being tarnished however by the CDU-CSU's poor showing in Sunday's election, which saw the bloc fall below 30 percent for the first time in its seven-decade-long history.In a painful illustration of the CDU's downfall, Merkel's own Baltic coast constituency -- which she had held since 1990 -- was taken by the Social Democrats.At the CDU's headquarters on Sunday, Alfons Thesing, 84, put his finger on the problem."It hurts a lot that Merkel is no longer there," he told AFP.Merkel, 67, will be likely be missed beyond Germany's borders too, having helped steer the European Union through years of turbulence that included a financial crisis, a migrant influx, Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.While all Germany's main parties are pro-EU, none of her would-be successors can match her political gravitas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-polls-country-heads-into-unknown-as-rivals-scramble-to-lead-next-govt-101632709488724.html

They are imposing laws that defined its 1996-2001 rule when they enforced their version of Islamic Sharia law.Amid reports of large-scale human rights violations by the Taliban in Afghanistan, the outfit earlier had put on public display the bodies of four people who were killed after they allegedly carried out a kidnapping in the western city of Herat.It is been over a month since the Taliban captured Kabul after an aggressive and rapid advance against Afghanistan government forces amid the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.The country plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ban-barbers-from-trimming-beards-in-afghanistan-s-helmand-province-101632707662988.html
27-09-2021||World||German Social Democrats beat conservatives in vote to decide Merkel successor||Germany's Social Democrats narrowly won Sunday's national election, projected results showed, and claimed a "clear mandate" to lead a government for the first time since 2005 and to end 16 years of conservative-led rule under Angela Merkel.The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) were on track for 26.0% of the vote, ahead of 24.5% for Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc, projections for broadcaster ZDF showed, but both groups believed they could lead the next government.With neither major bloc commanding a majority, and both reluctant to repeat their awkward "grand coalition" of the past four years, the most likely outcome is a three-way alliance led by either the Social Democrats or Merkel's conservatives.Agreeing a new coalition could take months, and will likely involve the smaller Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP)."We are ahead in all the surveys now," the Social Democrats' chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-leadership-race-boring-olaf-bets-craving-stability-2021-09-21, said in a round table discussion with other candidates after the vote."It is an encouraging message and a clear mandate to make sure that we get a good, pragmatic government for Germany," he added after earlier addressing jubilant SPD supporters.The SPD's rise heralds a swing left for Germany and marks a remarkable comeback for the party, which has recovered some 10 points in support in just three months to improve on its 20.5% result in the 2017 national election.Scholz, 63, would become the fourth post-war SPD chancellor after Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. Finance minister in Merkel's cabinet, he is a former mayor of Hamburg.Scholz's conservative rival Armin Laschet, signalled his bloc was not ready yet to concede, though his supporters were subdued."It hasn't always been the first-placed party that provided the chancellor," Laschet, 60, told the round table. "I want a government where every partner is involved, where everyone is visible - not one where only the chancellor gets to shine," he said in an early attempt to woo smaller parties.Schmidt ruled in the late 1970s and early 1980s in coalition with the FDP even though his Social Democrats had fewer parliamentary seats than the conservative bloc.COALITION FOR CHRISTMAS?Attention will now shift to informal discussions followed by more formal coalition negotiations https://reut.rs/2ZeqYw3, which could take months, leaving Merkel in charge in a caretaker role.Scholz and Laschet both said they would aim to strike a coalition deal before Christmas.Merkel plans to step down after the election, making the vote an era-changing event to set the future course of Europe's largest economy.She has stood large on the European stage almost since taking office in 2005 - when George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister.After a domestic-focused election campaign, Berlin's allies in Europe and beyond may have to wait for months before they can see whether the new German government is ready to engage on foreign issues to the extent they would like.A row between Washington and Paris over a deal for Australia to buy U.S. instead of French submarines has put Germany in an awkward spot between allies, but also gives Berlin the chance to help heal relations and rethink their common stance on China.On hearing that the SPD were slightly ahead in polls, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington: "I'll be darned... They're solid."On economic policy, French President Emmanuel Macron is eager to forge a common European fiscal policy, which the Greens support but the CDU/CSU and FDP reject. The Greens also want “a massive expansion offensive for renewables”."Germany will end up with a rather weak chancellor who will struggle to get behind any kind of ambitious fiscal reform at the EU level," said Naz Masraff at political risk consultancy Eurasia.Whatever coalition ends up in power, Germany's friends can at least take heart that moderate centrism has prevailed, and the populism that has taken hold in other European countries failed to break through.The projected results for ZDF showed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on track for 10.5%, worse than four years ago when they stormed into the national parliament with 12.6% of the vote, and with all mainstream groupings ruling out a coalition with the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-social-democrats-beat-conservatives-in-vote-to-decide-merkel-successor-101632705308272.html

The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is an United Nations’ agency responsible for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism.History of World Tourism DayUNWTO was established on this day in 1980 to create awareness on how tourism affects social-cultural, political and economic values globally and the role of tourism within the international community.Significance of World Tourism DayOn World Tourism Day, UNWTO urges people to highlight the ability of tourism. “By celebrating this day, we state our commitment that, as tourism grows, the benefits that come will be felt at every level of our broad and diverse sector, from the biggest airline to the smallest family business,” Zurab Pololikashvili, UNWTO’s secretary general, said in his official message.UN secretary general António Guterres said the tourism sector touches almost every part of the global economy and societies, enabling historically marginalised people and those at risk of being left behind to benefit from development that is local and direct. “On World Tourism Day, we recognise the power and potential of tourism to advance prosperity and drive inclusive sustainable development,” he added.Theme of World Tourism Day 2021This year the theme of World Tourism Day is 'Tourism for Inclusive Growth'. It aims to help people associated with the tourism sector in every possible way. UNWTO has urged businesses, tourists, UN agencies, member states and non-members to "celebrate tourism’s unique ability to ensure that nobody is left behind as the world begins to open up again and look to the future".Celebrating World Tourism DayKeeping World Tourism Day in mind and to celebrate Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the Centre’s initiative to celebrate and commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence, the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board is organising various events and activities in the state to promote state tourism and make people aware of the state's rich history, traditions, cultural and national heritage, possibilities, tourism importance etc. and to enhance their tourism knowledge, news agency PTI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-tourism-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101632699142849.html
27-09-2021||World||France to donate 120mn vaccines to poor nations: Prez||President Emmanuel Macron has said France will double the number of vaccine doses it donates to poorer countries to 120 million.“The injustice is that in other continents vaccination is far behind because of us, collectively,” Macron said in a message broadcast during the Global Citizen fundraising concert in Paris.France will also commit to helping Unicef and health systems with vaccine distribution, Macron said, noting that only 3% of Africa’s population is vaccinated.A federal judge temporarily blocked New York City’s school system, the largest in the US, from imposing a vaccine mandate for teachers and other staff.China reported three more infections in the northeastern city of Harbin, a new cluster, and nearby Suihua city recorded one more. Harbin raised risk levels to “mid-level” for five residential complexes and the province’s official Weibo account described the coronavirus situation as “severe and complex”.South Korea is preparing to offer booster shots to people over 60, medical workers and other high-risk groups.Australia’s Prime Minister called on states to open their borders. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said state premiers must not keep borders closed once the 80% of eligible Australians are vaccinated, a threshold he expects to reach by the end of the year. “I can’t see any reason why Australians should be kept from each other,” the leader said on a Sunday television programme. “That puts a heavy, heavy responsibility on those who would seek to prevent that from happening.”Rowdy celebrations in Norway as curbs endPolice in Norway on Sunday reported dozens of disturbances and violent clashes including mass brawls in the Nordic country’s big cities after streets, bars, restaurants and nightclubs were filled with people celebrating the end of Covid-19 restrictions that lasted for more than a year.The Norwegian government abruptly announced on Friday that most of the remaining coronavirus restrictions would be scrapped beginning Saturday and that life in the nation of 5.3 million would return to normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-donate-120mn-vaccines-to-poor-nations-prez-101632697155400.html
27-09-2021||World||German polls: Laschet commits ballot blunder||The conservative candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany’s general elections, Armin Laschet, on Sunday folded his ballot with his choices visible in a final blunder of a rocky campaign.Laschet voted in the normally secret polls for his and Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in his hometown of Aachen.The election rules dictate that the ballot “must be folded in a way so that the choices cannot be seen” so as not to influence other voters.The faux pas before live cameras set off a Twitter storm, with some calling it an “own goal” for Laschet, although electoral commission chief Georg Thiel later said the ballot was still valid.“A nationally known politician voted, as expected, for his own party,” Thiel tweeted. “This would not influence voters.”Greens Party candidate hopeful of more votesThe environmentalist Greens’ candidate to be the next German chancellor says she’s hoping for “a few more votes” than pre-election polls showed her party getting.Annalena Baerbock is the party’s first candidate for chancellor. It led in polls after she was nominated in the spring but recent surveys have shown it in third place, several points behind the center-left Social Democrats and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Union bloc.Baerbock said as she voted in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, that “we are of course hoping for a few more votes, with a view to the poll results, so that we can achieve a real new departure in this country”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-polls-laschet-commits-ballot-blunder-101632697010840.html
27-09-2021||World||Race for Merkel’s successor too close to call: German exit polls||ermany’s Social Democrats and the conservatives are locked together in the national election exit polls, leaving the decision over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor hanging in the balance.Officials from both parties said they hope to lead Germany’s next government and have their candidates succeed Merkel, who has been in power since 2005.Olaf Scholz’s SPD, the front-runner over the final weeks of the campaign, had 25% of the votes, according to exit polls from broadcaster ARD on Sunday, which gave Merkel’s bloc -- led by Christian Democratic boss Armin Laschet -- the same result. A second poll by ZDF gave Scholz a narrow advantage of 26% to 24%.If support remains neck-and-neck, neither Scholz nor Laschet have a clear path to the chancellorship, setting up a messy post-election scramble. The control of the chancellery would likely be determined by the battle to sign up coalition partners to forge a majority.Nevertheless, the mood was upbeat at the SPD headquarters in Berlin and bleak at the CDU, where supporters were digesting the prospect of their worst ever election result.The general secretary of the Social Democrats Lars Klingbeil said he believes his party has been given a “mandate” to form a ruling coalition.In the CDU camp, several people covered their mouths in apparent disbelief when the exit polls were released. CDU general secretary Paul Ziemiak said after the publication of the ARD poll: “That hurts”.Party secretary Paul Ziemiak tried to maintain morale, telling his members they are in for a long night and they shouldn’t give up yet. “With this result, there would be a chance for a coalition” with the Greens and the Free Democrats, he said.“We cannot be satisfied with the results of the election,” Laschet told his supporters. “We will do everything possible to build a conservative-led government because Germans now need a future coalition that modernises our country.”After 16 years under Merkel’s pragmatic centrist leadership, the outcome of the vote will have wide-ranging implications for Europe and the West. The exit polls could prove less reliable than in past years because of the large share of mail-in ballots. Counting will proceed into the night. The fragmented political landscape means three parties would be needed to secure a majority in the German parliament for the first time in decades.The Greens, which are the SPD’s favoured partner, came in third with ARD projecting 15% -- their best ever results. The party is likely to play a kingmaking-role alongside the pro-business Free Democrats, which got 11% of the votes.The anti-capitalist Left, on 5%, could also potentially play a role in a coalition with the SPD.Whatever coalition formation ends up in power, Germany’s friends can at least take heart from an election campaign in which moderate centrism prevailed, and the populism that has taken hold in other European countries failed to break through. The far-right Alternative for Germany got 11% and will take a role in the opposition.The deadlock underscores the uncertainty facing Europe’s largest economy. Germany’s industrial model is under threat as value shifts away from mechanical engineering, while the country’s exporters risk getting caught up in geopolitical tensions, especially between the US and China.A new government will need to address the issues Merkel left behind, including aging infrastructure and a lack of investment in digital technologies. The most pressing issue is weaning its auto industry and its energy system off fossil fuels.Merkel and her current government, including Scholz as finance minister and vice chancellor, will serve until a new regime is sworn in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-for-merkel-s-successor-too-close-to-call-german-exit-polls-101632681754751.html
27-09-2021||World||Taliban appeal int’l airlines to resume flights||The Taliban government in Afghanistan appealed on Sunday for international flights to be resumed, promising full cooperation with airlines and saying that problems at Kabul airport had been resolved.The statement from their foreign affairs ministry comes as the new administration has stepped up efforts to open up the country and gain international acceptance following the collapse of the Western-backed government last month.A limited number of aid and passenger flights have been operating from the airport.But normal commercial services have yet to resume since it was closed in the wake of the chaotic evacuation of tens of thousands of foreigners and vulnerable Afghans that followed the Taliban’s seizure of the capital.The airport, which was damaged during the evacuation, has since been reopened partially with the assistance of technical teams from Qatar and Turkey.While some airlines including Pakistan International Airlines have been offering limited services and some people have been able to get places on flights, prices have been reported to be many times higher than normal. At present, airlines such as PIA and Afghanistan’s Kam Air are charging more than $1,200 for a one-way, 40-minute flight from Kabul to Islamabad. Even at that price -- the result of war insurance, according to the airlines -- the irregular flights are heavily oversubscribed.Foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the suspension of international flights had left many Afghans stranded abroad and also prevented people from travelling for work or study. “Many Afghan citizens were stuck outside and unable to return to their homeland,” he said in a statement.“Moreover, many Afghan citizens who have international employment or pursue education abroad are now facing difficulties in reaching their destinations,” Balkhi said.“As the problems at Kabul International Airport have been resolved and the airport is fully operational for domestic and international flights, the IEA assures all airlines of its full cooperation,” he said, using an abbreviation for Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban’s term for their new government.Since the Taliban overran Kabul on August 15 and seized control of the country, the Taliban have grappled with a severe economic crisis and have faced pressure on issues ranging from girls’ education to allegations of reprisals against former officials and others associated with the previous government.Despite international condemnation, the Taliban have said they will continue to impose swift and severe punishments on lawbreakers to stop crimes like robbery, murder and kidnapping that had become widespread in Afghanistan. On Saturday, Taliban authorities in the western Afghan city of Herat killed four alleged kidnappers and hung their bodies up in public to deter others.New passports, IDsThe Taliban on Saturday hintted they may decide on issuing new passports and national identity cards (IDs) for Afghans, and these may have written on them, the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”, according to a report.Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson and deputy minister of information and culture, told The Khaama Press News Agency, it is possible that these new documents may be issued by the new administration. However, the existing identity documents remain valid for now, the Taliban-led government had announced last week. Khaama confirmed this to the news agency. Currently, the passport and NID departments are still closed in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-appeal-int-l-airlines-to-resume-flights-101632680936913.html
