Four of our officers have been injured during clashes," the Metropolitan Police said, adding "this is unacceptable".The force had earlier tweeted that it was attending a demonstration outside the MHRA offices on Cabot Square in east London and "guarding the entrance to the building".Video posted on social media showed the protesters reaching the doors, with security guards on the other side.Seconds later, police pushed their way through the crowd and formed a cordon outside the building's entrance and scuffled with protesters trying to get in.The mask-free demonstrators shouted that they were there "to protect the next generation" as they rallied outside, a livestream showed.The protest came as Britain continues its successful mass vaccination drive, which has seen more than three-quarters of adults received two doses of approved jabs.An independent panel of experts on Friday recommended the government does not extend the programme to vaccinating all UK children aged 12 to 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-police-say-4-officers-hurt-in-clash-with-anti-vaccination-protesters-101630689092204.html

"By the grace of Allah Almighty, we are in control of entire Afghanistan. The troublemakers have defeated and Panjshir is now under our command," said one Taliban commander. However, Resistance leaders claimed that the fighting was still on.While the forces have been clashing sporadically for the past two weeks, an intense clash between the Taliban and the Resistance Front has been continuing for the last four days. On Thursday night, the fight escalated prompting former president Hamid Karzai to appeal to both the warring sides to stop clashing as more bloodshed is not of any service to Afghanistan and Afghan people. 
03-09-2021||World||Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?||Mullah Abdul Ghani, who is also known as Baradar (brother), is all set to be the leader of the new Afghanistan government. This is a last-minute development confirmed by international news agencies as Hibatullah Akhundzadam, who heads the Taliban since 2016, was supposed to be the supreme leader like it happened in 1996 when chief Mullah Mohammed Omar took charge of the government that the Taliban formed in Afghanistan for the first time.Why Hibatullah Akhundzadam is not taking chargeReports said that Hibatullah Akhundzadam who leads his life far away from diplomacy and the public will continue looking after the religious aspects of the group, while Baradar who is the public face of the Taliban will lead the country. Analysts consider Baradar as having a moderate image who appears as a political leader, not a military leader. His statements also seem reasonable, firm but non-confrontational, the Diplomat commented.Where was Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar all these years?After 2001, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar left Afghanistan and this August was the first time, he returned to his country. In 2010, he was arrested in Pakistan and was released after US intervention.Why is he called Baradar?This was what Mullah Mohammed Omar used to call him out of affection. Baradar is the only surviving Taliban leader who was personally appointed deputy by Mohammed Omar, which makes Baradar legendary. Baradar was also related to Mullah Omar by marriage relationsInternationally knownBaradar led the Taliban's negotiation team in Qatar which culminated in the2020 peace agreement. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Mike Pompeo, spoke with Donald Trump in the process of the deal. Baradar also met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Baradar's first speech after Kabul takeover"It was never expected that we will have victory in Afghanistan. Now comes the test. We must meet the challenge of serving and securing our nation, and giving it a stable life going forward," he said after the Taliban captured Kabul.Between 1996 and 2001, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar played a crucial role as the deputy minister of defence. Reports say Baradar does not have a good relationship with Pakistan and apparently he still nurses much resentment against Pakistan for his imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-set-to-lead-new-afghanistan-government-101630687856211.html

Biden has been facing criticism from the international community over the hasty troops’ pullout from Afghanistan which led to a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country following the Taliban’s lightning push to capture Kabul.In a Washington Post-ABC News poll, an overwhelming majority supported Biden’s decision to end the two decades of war in Afghanistan but disapproved of the manner in which the situation was handled. While 77% of respondents voiced support for the withdrawal, the chaotic evacuation including the deaths of 13 US service members hit the popular decision hard.Of the 77% who supported the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, 52% disapproved the handling. About 17% of respondents opposed the withdrawal while 6% had no opinion on the burning issue. Only 8% of the 1,006 adults involved in the survey thought US forces’ withdrawal from Afghanistan makes the United States safer from terrorism. While 44% opined that the pullout makes the US less safe, 45% of them said the decision makes no difference.Watch: Afghan withdrawal haunts Joe Biden; approval rating hits all-time lowAfter troops’ withdrawal and subsequent crisis in Afghanistan, the approval rating of the US president has hit a new low since he took the office in January. According to a new Marist National Poll with NPR and PBS Newshour, Biden's approval rating has fallen to 43 per cent. A large section of the populace has also termed the US' role in Afghanistan a "failure".Biden administration has been vehemently defending the withdrawal and said that the sole purpose of the US military was to eliminate al Qaeda and ensure Afghan soil is never used by terror groups to harm the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-disapprove-of-the-way-biden-handled-troops-withdrawal-in-afghanistan-101630686389612.html

They have said women's rights will be protected, but have yet to provide details.Women who work in justice have already been high profile targets. Two female Supreme Court justices were gunned down in January.Also Read| Afghan women forced into marriage at evacuation camps to flee Kabul: ReportNow, the Taliban have released prisoners across the country, which "really put the lives of women judges in danger," a high-level Afghan women judge who fled to Europe said from an undisclosed location.In Kabul, "four or five Taliban members came and asked people in my house: 'Where is this woman judge?' These were people who I had put in jail," she told Reuters in an interview, asking not to be identified.She was among a small group of Afghan women judges to have made it out in recent weeks with the help of a collective of human rights volunteers and foreign colleagues at the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ).Since then she has been in touch with colleagues back home: "Their messages are of fear and complete terror. They tell me if they do not get rescued their lives are in direct danger."In addition to the judges, there are around a thousand other women human rights defenders who could also be in the Taliban's cross hairs, said Horia Mosadiq, an Afghan human rights activist.Freed prisoners "are calling with death threats to women judges, women prosecutors and women police officers, saying 'we will come after you'," she said.FearfulBritish Justice Minister Robert Buckland said last week London had evacuated nine female judges and was working to provide safe passage for more of the "very vulnerable people"."A lot of these judges were responsible for administering the rule of law and quite rightly they are fearful about the consequences that could now face them with the rise of the Taliban," he said.Human rights and legal activists said Western countries did not make the evacuation of women judges and human rights defenders a priority in the chaos after Kabul fell."Governments had zero interest in evacuating people that were not their own nationals," said Sarah Kay, a Belfast-based human rights lawyer and member of the Atlas Women network of international lawyers.Also Read| ‘Will raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir’: Taliban spokesman Suhail ShaheenShe is working with an online group of volunteer veterans known as the "digital Dunkirk," named for the World War Two evacuation of British troops from Nazi-occupied France.

03-09-2021||World||‘Will raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir’: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen||A Taliban spokesman has said the group reserves the right to speak out in support of Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir, remarks that run counter to senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani’s contention that the organisation would not interfere in Kashmir. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen was quoted by BBC Urdu, in a report published online on Thursday, as saying that the group does not have a policy of taking up arms against any country. In this context, he referred to the terms of the agreement signed by Taliban and the US in February 2020.However, Shaheen said that the Taliban, as Muslims, have the right to raise their voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India or any other country. “We will raise our voice and say that Muslims are your own people, your own citizens. They are entitled to equal rights under your laws,” he was quoted as saying. Shaheen’s remarks are completely contrary to the stance taken by Haqqani Network leader Anas Haqqani, a member of the Taliban’s 14-member negotiating team, in an interview aired by News18 channel on Wednesday. Haqqani had said in the interview that Kashmir was not an issue for Afghanistan. “We have a clear policy that when something is not an issue for our country, we cannot interfere in another country,” he had said, speaking in Urdu. He had also described reports about the Haqqani Network supporting Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which are active in Kashmir, as “propaganda”. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Shaheen’s remarks. As reported by Hindustan Times, Haqqani has been engaged in an outreach towards India, along with senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who is expected to be given a senior position in the government to be formed by the Taliban. Haqqani had said in the interview that the Taliban have a policy of not interfering in the internal matters of other countries. “Our desire is that we don’t negatively interfere in internal problems. Our doors are open to the whole world for political relations and humanitarian aid, we want good relations with all countries,” he said. He contended that the Indian government had supported the Taliban’s opponents in Afghanistan for 20 years. He added, “But we don’t want to remember the past and we want good relations with all countries, including India.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the narrative being presented by Taliban leaders such as Shaheen and Anas Haqqani had to be seen in the context of the Taliban’s long-standing ties with Pakistan, and the channels of communication between India and the Taliban. “There is a constituency in Pakistan that the Taliban have to satisfy,” one of the people cited above said. On Tuesday, India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, had met Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s political office, at the Indian embassy in Doha following a request from the Taliban side. In his interview with BBC Urdu, Shaheen claimed the “propaganda” against the Haqqani Network was based on “mere claims”. He said, “The Haqqanis are not a group. They are part of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” Shaheen also raised the issue of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to Kandahar. The Taliban were then in power in Kabul and Indian officials have long contended that the Taliban had helped the Pakistani terrorists who hijacked the airliner to force India to release three terrorists, including Masood Azhar, who went on to create JeM. Shaheen contended the Taliban didn’t play a role in the hijacking and that the Indian government should be “grateful” for the help the group provided in Kandahar. The Indian side told the Taliban there was a shortage of fuel on the airliner and the group provided assistance for the release of the passengers, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-raise-our-voice-for-muslims-in-kashmir-taliban-spokesman-suhail-shaheen-101630678459695.html

He said, “The series of undertakings made by the Taliban are positive at the level of words. We should, however, see if this translates into words.”The minister also announced the release of the first tranche of 30-million-pound package for Afghanistan’s neighbours to help them deal with the possibility of a large exodus, adding that the aid for that country had been hiked to 286 million pounds.The Taliban captured Kabul on August 15, when the United States was in the middle of withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, as announced by president Joe Biden earlier this year.

03-09-2021||World||EU and AstraZeneca settle dispute over shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine supply||The European Union and UK-based drugs giant AstraZeneca settled their dispute over a shortfall in coronavirus vaccine supplies on Friday, agreeing an extended delivery schedule.The European Commission went to court after the firm failed to deliver all of a promised 300 million doses by June 2021, but AstraZeneca will now have until the end of March next year to make up the number.The agreement ends the legal battle and AstraZeneca will not face any fines or penalty payments -- unless it falls short of its new target dates."I'm very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding which allows us to move forward and work in collaboration with the European Commission to help overcome the pandemic," said AstraZeneca's Ruud Dobber.Brussels was furious when the British-Swedish pharmaceutical outfit fell far short of its promises, undermining the early stages of the EU's Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Officials accused AstraZeneca of prioritising UK vaccine deliveries over the EU order and European Commission lawyers went to court to demand deliveries or see huge daily fines imposed for any ongoing shortfall.But the firm argued that its contract with the bloc only obliged it to make "best efforts" to meet its delivery target, and that production bottlenecks in its European plants had been unavoidable.In an interim ruling pending the final settlement of the case, the Brussels court imposed a new delivery schedule on AstraZeneca."Today's settlement agreement guarantees the delivery of the remaining 200 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by AstraZeneca to the EU," European health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement."While this week we reached the important milestone of 70 percent full vaccination of the EU's adult population, there are significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial."AstraZeneca manufactures vaccines designed at Britain's Oxford University and sells them on a non-profit basis -- its version is cheaper and easier to store than many competitors.No finesBut the European Union has become frustrated by the slow pace of supply and has made another vaccine produced by US giant Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech the workhorse of its buying programme.A European Commission statement said AstraZeneca had delivered 100 million doses in the first half of 2021, would send 135 million more by the end of the year and another 65 million doses by March 2022."This will bring the total number of doses delivered to 300 million doses as agreed under the contract," it said.AstraZeneca said it would be able to meet the revised delivery schedule imposed by the Belgian court in its interim judgment and is confident of respecting its new timetable.But if it fails, it will have to pay member states a rebate on the costs of the vaccine equivalent to 10 percent for one month of delay, 25 percent for two months or 40 percent for three months of delay or more.The agreement also assumes that the European Medicines Agency will approve two new European manufacturing sites for the AstraZeneca vaccine before the end of October.Because the AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and can be stored at much higher temperatures than the Pfizer-BioNTech and other rivals, it has been sought after in poorer and developing countries.Eastern European states had ordered large quantities of it under the EU scheme, and now both the firm and Brussels hope to use it in the UN-backed Covax international vaccine distribution scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-and-astrazeneca-settle-dispute-over-shortfall-in-covid-19-vaccine-supply-101630668775419.html

In the following reports, Ezmarai Ahmadi, a Kabul resident, said that 10 of his family members were wiped out in the strike, including six children.The airstrike was launched a day after an IS suicide bomber carried out a massive blast at the Kabul airport, where a huge crowd had gathered hoping to flee in evacuations flights. Nearly 100 Afghans and 13 US service members lost their lives in the attack.In the backdrop of the escalating crisis, analysts have warned that the risk of civilian casualties in Afghanistan during drone strikes will only grow now that the US no longer has any on-ground intelligence.However, speaking during the press briefing, Psaki pushed back against the idea, saying there are many countries where the US has no military presence on the ground, "but we can still prevent terrorist groups from metastasizing and posing threats," the AP reported.Afghanistan is under major turmoil after the US and NATO troops withdrew from the country, leading to the Taliban taking over the country after being ousted in 2001. The war-ravaged nation is now facing a severe economic crisis as western nations pulled out the financial support and political uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Taliban is set to announce their own government which will likely be led by its co-founder Mullah Baradar.

This has triggered concern over the possibility of human trafficking flourishing around the evacuation from Kabul. The report said that since the issue has been brought to the notice of the diplomats and the extent of this practice is not really known, US diplomats in the UAE would provide guidance to identify potential victims of human trafficking.Also Read | From music to women's education in Afghanistan: What Taliban said so farWhere are these women now?As the evacuation process is now over and the Taliban are all set to announce their new government in Afghanistan, the evacuees are mostly in transit. Many are in the UAE. Once these third countries process their travel to the US, they will be leaving for the United StatesThe Taliban coming to power after two remaining two decades in the shadows rang trouble for women as in the earlier regime, between 1996 and 2000, all rights were snatched from the women. This time, the Taliban promised women rights as permitted by the Sharia law, but it has already banned co-education, travelling without male guardians etc.Hundreds of women associated with art, including journalists, have fled the country in the last few weeks. A report of Reporters Without Borders has said that women journalists are "disappearing" from Kabul and at present fewer than 100 of Kabul's 700 women journalists are still working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-women-forced-into-marriage-at-evacuation-camps-to-flee-kabul-report-101630661194038.html
03-09-2021||World||Humanitarian flights in Afghanistan resume as fate hangs in balance||The fate of the United Nations political mission in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover is a source of grave concern within the global body, UN sources told AFP, as humanitarian flights resumed this week.The mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was due to end on September 17, and it's extension is set to be debated on September 9 by the UN Security Council.The context of the potential renewal has changed dramatically, however, after the Taliban swept back into control mid-August, forcing a chaotic withdrawal of foreign governments, their troops, citizens and Afghan allies."The situation is so unclear" and it will be "a reasonable approach at this time" to implement a "technical rollover" of the mandate, a UN source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Also uncertain are the intentions of the new Taliban government, expected to be announced soon.For the United Nations and Western states, they "certainly would never want to lose certain aspects" of the current mandate, "and that includes human rights, protection of civilians" and coordination of international humanitarian aid, a UN source said.A top UN concern is over the treatment of women and girls under the hardline Islamist Taliban. Women's liberties were sharply curtailed during the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule in Afghanistan.For Ireland, which holds the Security Council presidency for September, the question of human rights under the Taliban is crucial -- and the group will be judged "by their actions, not by their words," said the country's UN envoy, Geraldine Byrne Nason.Unacceptable to Ireland would be the exclusion of women from key government posts, Nason told reporters this week."This won't stand for Ireland," she said, adding that Afghanistan is more in need of the UN and its humanitarian aid support than ever.'The world's eyes'In Afghanistan, 18 million people are staring down the barrel of humanitarian disaster, and another 18 million could quickly join them, the UN has warned, calling for international donations.On Thursday, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced humanitarian flights operated by the body's World Food Programme are "resuming... to enable 160 humanitarian organizations to continue their life-saving activities in Afghanistan's provinces."The flights link the Pakistani capital Islamabad with the Afghan cities of Mazar-i-Sharif in the north and Kandahar in the south. Three flights have already landed in Mazar-i-Sharif since August 29.Between 2002 and 2021, the UN Humanitarian Air Service served more than 20 locations in the country, Dujarric said, adding the goal was to return to that capacity "once security and funding permits."Since their lightning takeover, the Taliban have not indicated how they envisage the future of UNAMA, or even who might represent Afghanistan when world leaders gather at the annual UN General Assembly later this month in New York.What seems clear, a diplomatic source said, is that "they do want assistance going forward... both humanitarian and development," though the latter is not within the purview of the current UNAMA mandate.In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council to renew the mandate to "ensure that the mission and other UN agencies have the resources needed to deliver lifesaving aid and to fully monitor human rights" in Afghanistan."The Taliban have an abysmal track record on human rights and violating the rights of women and girls in particular, so the UN mission needs to be the world's eyes on the ground to publicly report on the situation in Afghanistan," said the organization's UN director, Louis Charbonneau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humanitarian-flights-in-afghanistan-resume-as-fate-hangs-in-balance-101630653799090.html

03-09-2021||World||Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar to lead new Afghanistan govt: Report||Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar will lead a new Afghan government that could be announced soon, sources in the Islamist group said on Friday, as it battled rebel fighters while striving to ward off economic collapse.Baradar, who heads the Taliban's political office, will be joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, in senior positions in the government, three sources said."All the top leaders have arrived in Kabul, where preparations are in final stages to announce the new government," one Taliban official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.The Taliban, which seized Kabul on Aug. 15 after sweeping across most of the country, have faced resistance in the Panjshir Valley, north of the capital, with reports of heavy fighting and casualties.Several thousand fighters of regional militias and remnants of the government's armed forces have massed in the rugged valley under the leadership of Ahmad Massoud, the son of former Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud.Efforts to negotiate a settlement appear to have broken down, with each side blaming the other for the failure.HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHEThe government's legitimacy in the eyes of international donors and investors will be crucial for an economy grappling with drought and the ravages of a conflict that killed an estimated 240,000 Afghans.Humanitarian groups have warned of impending catastrophe and the economy, reliant for years on many millions of dollars of foreign aid, is close to collapse.Many Afghans were struggling to feed their families amid severe drought well before the Taliban took power and millions may now face starvation, aid agencies say."Since August 15, we have seen the crisis accelerate and magnify, with the imminent economic collapse that is coming this country's way," Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the director of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan, told Reuters from Kabul.The administration of US President Joe Biden has no plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments and foreign currency reserves parked in the United States that it froze after the Taliban's takeover.In a positive development, a senior executive of Western Union Co said the firm was resuming money-transfer services to Afghanistan in line with a US push to keep up humanitarian work.RECOGNITIONThe Taliban enforced a radical form of sharia, or Islamic law, when it ruled from 1996 to 2001.But this time around, the movement has tried to present a more moderate face to the world, promising to protect human rights and refrain from reprisals against old enemies.The United States, the European Union and others have cast doubt on such assurances, saying formal recognition of the new government, and the resultant flow of economic aid, was contingent on action.The Taliban have promised safe passage out of the country for any foreigners or Afghans left behind by the huge airlift that ended when U.S. troops withdrew ahead of an Aug 31 deadline. But, with Kabul airport still closed, many were seeking to flee over land.Thousands of Afghans, some without documents, others with pending U.S. visa applications or whose families have mixed immigration status, also wait in "transit hubs" in third countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-co-founder-mullah-baradar-to-lead-new-afghanistan-govt-report-101630653115395.html
03-09-2021||World||Wary of Taliban diktats, Afghan media test limits of press freedom||Afghanistan's most popular private television network has voluntarily replaced its risque Turkish soap operas and music shows with tamer programs tailored to the country's new Taliban rulers, who have issued vague directives that media must not contradict Islamic laws or harm the national interest.Still, independent Afghan news stations are keeping female presenters on the air and testing the limits of media freedom under the group, whose militants have killed journalists in the past but have promised an open, inclusive system since coming to power in August.As the world watches intently for clues on how the Taliban will govern, their treatment of the media will be a key indicator, along with their policies toward women. When they ruled Afghanistan between 1996-2001, they enforced a harsh interpretation of Islam, barring girls and women from schools and public life, and brutally suppressing dissent.Since then, Afghanistan has seen a proliferation of media outlets, and women have made some strides within the restrictions of the deeply conservative society.In a first sign, the Taliban are trying to soften their extremist reputation, one of its officials unexpectedly walked into the studios of the privately owned Tolo News just two days after taking control of Kabul in mid-August. He sat down for an interview with the female anchor, Behishta Arghand.The 22-year-old anchor told The Associated Press that she was nervous when she saw him enter the studio, but his behavior and how he answered questions helped put her at ease a bit.“I just said to myself this is a good time to show for all the world, Afghan women don't want to go back. They want... to go forward,” she said.Arghand fled the country after the interview, unwilling to take any chances about the Taliban's promises of greater openness. She is temporarily in a compound in Qatar for Afghan refugees.She is among hundreds of journalists — many seen as the best in their field — who left the country after the Taliban takeover, part of an exodus of more than 100,000 Afghans.Yet her interview with the Taliban official marked a notable shift from the militants' first time in power when women had to cover themselves from head to toe and were stoned to death in public for adultery and other alleged offenses.This time, the Taliban shared a video of girls going to school in the provinces. They also have held news conferences after taking control of Kabul, fielding questions from local and international media.Saad Mohseni, the CEO, and chairman of Moby Group, which owns Tolo News, said he believes the Taliban are tolerating the media because they understand they have to win hearts and minds, convince the political establishment to play a role, and consolidate their rule.“The media is important to them, but what they do to the media in a month or two months' time remains to be seen,” he said from Dubai, where Moby Group has an office.Although the U.S. and its allies failed to create a stable democracy in Afghanistan, they did succeed in creating a thriving press, said Steven Butler, Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. The U.S. government spent huge sums of money on the project as the foundation of democracy, he noted on CPJ's website.Initial U.S. grants helped launch Tolo, which began as a radio station in 2003 and rapidly expanded to television. The Pashto- and Dari-language broadcaster employs 500 people and is the most-viewed private network in Afghanistan.Known for its news and entertainment programming, Tolo decided on its own to remove music shows and soap operas from the airwaves because “we didn't think that they'd be acceptable to the new regime,” Mohseni said. The romance dramas have been replaced by a Turkish TV series set in the Ottoman era, with more modestly dressed actresses.Afghanistan's state broadcaster RTA pulled its female presenters off the air until further notice. The independent female-run Zan TV has ceased showing new programming.The privately run Ariana news channel, however, has kept its female anchors on the air. Tolo had a female host on its breakfast show Thursday and the network has one female news anchor and several female reporters.Since taking control, there have been reports of the Taliban beating and threatening journalists. In one known case, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle said Taliban militants going door to door in a hunt for one of its journalists shot and killed a member of his family and seriously injured another.“We have to make sure that Afghan journalism stays alive because people will need it,” said Bilal Sarwary, a longtime journalist in Afghanistan whose work has appeared on the BBC, among others.Although he also has left Afghanistan with his family, he said a generation of citizen journalists are more empowered than ever.“If we can't go (back), it does not mean we will give up on Afghanistan. We will work on Afghanistan from wherever we are. ... Global connectivity is the new normal,” Sarwary said.Meanwhile, the Taliban are allowing journalists to enter Afghanistan from Pakistan and allowing media outlets to continue operating in Kabul, albeit under ominous guidelines. They have stipulated that news reports must not contradict Islamic values and should not challenge the national interest.Such vague rules are typical for authoritarian states across the Middle East and Central Asia, where they have been used to silence and prosecute journalists. In order to operate, local media may have to practice self-censorship to avoid repercussions.Afghanistan has long been dangerous for journalists. CPJ says 53 journalists have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 and 33 of them since 2018.In July, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer from Reuters was killed covering clashes between the Taliban and Afghan security forces. In 2014, an Agence France-Presse journalist, his wife, and two children were among nine people killed by Taliban gunmen while dining at a hotel in Kabul.Nearly two years later in 2016, a Taliban suicide bomber targeted Tolo employees on a bus, killing seven of them and wounding at least 25 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, calling Tolo a tool of decadent Western influence.Mohseni said he was concerned when the Taliban overran Kabul and that he remains “not necessarily positive.”"But I'm just thinking: Well, let's just wait and see. Let's see how restrictive they will be,” he said. “There's no doubt they'll be restrictive. The question is how restrictive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wary-of-taliban-diktats-afghan-media-test-limits-of-press-freedom-101630652849070.html

"We have this right, being Muslims, to raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India, and any other country,” Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, according to Geo News. "We will raise our voice and say that Muslims are your own people, your own citizens. They are entitled to equal rights under your laws," Shaheen told in an interview with BBC Urdu, Geo News reported.Shaheen, however, added that the group does not have the policy to raise arms against any country.

03-09-2021||World||As Suga steps down, here are potential candidates for Japan's next prime minister||Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga, his support ratings in tatters ahead of a general election, said on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for his replacement as premier.Here are details about the people who might become Japan's next prime minister.FUMIO KISHIDA, 64A former foreign minister, Kishida had been considered the likely heir of Shinzo Abe, who resigned last September, but the low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima typically ranks low in voter surveys. He came in second in last year's party leadership poll.Kishida hails from one of the LDP's more dovish factions and is seen as lukewarm about revising the pacifist constitution.Announcing his candidacy, Kishida called for reducing income disparities and pledged support to the economically vulnerable, such as workers in non-regular employment and women, in contrast with Suga, who has stressed self-reliance.This week, Kishida said an economic stimulus package worth "tens of trillions of yen" was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. He also said Japan must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the pandemic-hit economy.He has said he was running to show the LDP "listens to the people and offers broad choices, and to protect our nation's democracy," a comment seen as a criticism of Suga's governing style.SANAE TAKAICHI, 60An Abe disciple and former internal affairs minister, Takaichi has made clear her desire to become Japan's first female premier, and said she would introduce policies to fend off China's technology threat and help strengthen the economy.Takaichi said she wanted to work on issues left unfinished by previous administrations, such as achieving 2% inflation and introducing legislation "that prevents the leakage of sensitive information to China".She said an extra budget needs to be compiled as soon as possible to bolster Japan's medical system, which is under strain because of the pandemic.A member of the party's most conservative wing, she often visits Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial memorial to Japan's war dead, and has opposed allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.However, it is not clear whether she will obtain the 20 lawmaker backers needed to run in the leadership election.TARO KONO, 58In charge of Japan's rocky vaccination rollout, Kono ranks high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga.Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, the social media-savvy Kono has served as foreign and defence minister and holds the portfolio for administrative reform.Kono has a reputation as a maverick but toed the line on key Abe policies. He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to "comfort women", a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.A member of powerful Finance Minister Taro Aso's faction, Kono has not indicated whether he intends to run in the leadership race.SHIGERU ISHIBA, 64A former defence minister, Ishiba regularly ranks high in voter surveys but is less popular with party MPs.A soft-spoken security maven and rare LDP critic of Abe when the latter was in office, Ishiba has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.He defeated Abe in the first round of a party poll in 2012 thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. He has since lost two more times.Ishiba has criticised the Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-suga-steps-down-here-are-potential-candidates-for-japan-s-next-prime-minister-101630650230239.html
03-09-2021||World||3 Covid-19 vaccine doses may now become routine, enhance immunity: Fauci||White House chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that three doses of the vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may now become the standard regimen for most people. Fauci’s comments come even as medical experts who advise the US regulators on vaccine doses remain concerned over what they perceive as "political interference" by the Biden administration in the review process of booster shots for Covid-19 vaccines.Fauci, while speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, said, "I must say from my own experience as an immunologist, I would not at all be surprised that the adequate full regimen for vaccination will likely be three doses."Notably, the Biden administration is preparing to distribute Covid-19 "booster shots" in the United States from the week beginning on September 20. Senior US officials, in a health plan outlined last month in this regard, pointed out that protection from vaccines against the coronavirus disease may decrease even after taking the second Covid-19 shot if several months have passed since that dose. For this purpose, the federal health authorities cited three new studies released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that affirm their claims.The new plan aims to make third doses available to Americans eight months after they get their second shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. However, the plan is being critiqued by those who say the White House is getting ahead of US public-health and drug authorities, who still have to give their go-ahead to the plan.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, indicated on Thursday that he was in favour of the three-dose strategy. The top infectious diseases expert said that people taking an additional dose or the final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine months after the initial vaccination process will help make the immune system more 'mature'. He said that the final decision in this regard will rest with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the data is presented to the regulatory body, but he added that it was "reasonable" to believe three doses would be made the standard.“If it is durable, then you’re going to have very likely a three-dose regimen being the routine regimen,” he said.In some of Asia’s Covid-19 hot spots, powerful and wealthier citizens are nabbing booster shots even as most people remain unvaccinated, undermining the inoculation strategies of nations struggling with the highly infectious Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-covid-19-vaccine-doses-may-now-become-routine-enhance-immunity-fauci-101630645189639.html

"A violent extremist undertook a terrorist attack on innocent New Zealanders," Ardern told a briefing.The attacker was a Sri Lankan national who had been in New Zealand for 10 years and had been a "person of interest" for about five years, she said.The man was killed within 60 seconds of beginning the attack, she said, adding that he had been inspired by the Islamic State militant group."It was hateful, it was wrong. It was carried out by an individual, not a faith," Ardern said. "He alone carries the responsibility for these acts."A video posted on social media showed shoppers in the New Lynn supermarket shortly after the attacker struck."There's someone here with a knife ... he's got a knife," a woman can heard saying. "Somebody got stabbed."A guard asked people to leave the shopping mall shortly before about six shots rang out.Of the six wounded people, three were in critical condition, one in serious condition and another in moderate condition, the St John ambulance service said in a statement to Reuters.Witnesses told reporters outside the mall they had seen several people lying on the floor with stab wounds. Other said they heard gunshots as they ran out of the supermarket.Videos posted online earlier showed panicked shoppers running out of the mall and looking for cover.New Zealand has been on alert for attacks since a white supremacist gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in the city of Christchurch on March 15, 2019.In May, four people were stabbed in a supermarket in Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island.

In an interview published in an Italian newspaper on Thursday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the group looks at China as the "most important partner" and will primarily be relying on financing from China."China represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us because it is ready to invest and rebuild our country," La Repubblica quoted Mujahid as saying.Mujahid also said that 'One Belt One Road', an infrastructure initiative by China to open trade routes, is "held in high regard by the Taliban." There are "rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world," said Mujahid in the interview.Mujahid also confirmed that women will be allowed to continue studying at universities in future. He said women would be able to work as nurses, in the police or as assistants in ministries, but ruled out that there would be female ministers in the new government.Afghanistan plunged into turmoil after the United States and its Nato allies withdrew forces from the country, ending a two-decade-long war. Subsequently, the Taliban seized power and took over the capital city of Kabul as the US-supported government led by President Ashraf Ghani collapsed.Following the chaotic departure of foreign troops, mainly from the United States, western nations have severely restricted their aid payments, prompting fears of a major humanitarian crisis.Earlier this week, United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres warned of a looming "humanitarian catastrophe" in Afghanistan as he urged countries to provide emergency funding. Guterres also expressed his "grave concern at the deepening humanitarian and economic crisis in the country," adding that basic services threatened to collapse "completely" in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-rely-on-funding-from-china-says-spokesperson-zabihullah-mujahid-101630646266922.html
03-09-2021||World||Another election in 18 months if there’s no majority this time, says PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that if neither of the Liberals or the Conservatives secures a majority in the September 20 snap elections, the country could again go to polls in one and a half year’s time.The remark from the Liberal Party leader came during an unofficial debate on the network TVA. Conservative Party leader and PM hopeful Erin O’Toole, New Democratic Party’s (NDP) Jagmeet Singh, and Yves-François Blanchet of Bloc Quebecois took part in the discussion.In the pre-election debate dubbed “Face-a-face”, the other leaders slammed Trudeau for triggering elections amid the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Blanchet accused the incumbent PM of holding pre-poll campaign events and taking selfies without respecting social distancing norms.Singh did not respond to questions over whether he could work with the Conservatives in case they formed a minority government or even in a coalition arrangement. In previous national elections, Singh had categorically rejected supporting the Conservatives.Two official debates will be held next week under the auspices of the Leaders’ Debates Commission.With a little over two weeks to go for the snap polls that Trudeau himself recently called in a bid to convert his minority government into a majority one, the PM now finds himself in a tight spot.Pre-poll surveys and estimates indicate that not only is he unlikely to secure a majority win, the Liberals risk conceding the position of the single-largest party to the main opposition Conservatives. The Nanos Daily Ballot Tracking for the new outlets CTV News and Globe and Mail found the Conservative Party widening its national lead with 34.2% support as against 30.5% for the ruling Liberal Party.The outlet CBC News put the chances of Trudeau forming a majority government at just 8%. His chances of forming another minority government - with fewer seats than the 157 he won in 2019 - are 45%. That is just 3% ahead of the Conservatives, who have nearly caught up with the Liberals, though other pre-election trackers such as 338 Canada actually place the latter ahead at this time.According to the non-profit Angus Reid Institute (ARI), most Canadians do not prefer seeing another Liberal government, whether in majority or minority. Of those surveyed, according to figures released on Thursday, 42% want to see the next government led by Conservative leader O’Toole, while only 31% want to see Trudeau back at the helm, with the rest looking at a third option, such as NDP.What may give Trudeau some relief is that there is a surprising difference between what voters want and what they expect. Around 49% expect another Liberal minority government with another 12% believing that it could even become a majority. In contrast, just 34% think the Conservatives will form a government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-election-in-18-months-if-there-s-no-majority-this-time-says-pm-trudeau-101630646058765.html
03-09-2021||World||Member of ISIS 'Beatles' cell pleads guilty to beheading American hostages||A British national admitted Thursday evening in a federal courtroom near the nation's capital that he played a leadership role in an Islamic State scheme to torture, hold for ransom, and eventually behead American hostages.Alexanda Anon Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty to all eight counts against him at a plea hearing in US District Court in Alexandria. The charges include hostage-taking resulting in death and providing material support to the Islamic State group from 2012 through 2015.He admitted guilt in connection with the deaths of four American hostages — journalist James Foley, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller — as well as European and Japanese nationals who also were held captive.Kotey is one of four Islamic State members who were dubbed “the Beatles” by their captives because of their British accents. He and another man, El Shafee Elsheikh, were brought to the US last year to face charges after the U.S. assured Britain that neither man would face the death penalty.Elsheikh is still scheduled to go on trial in January. A third Beatle, Mohammed Emwazi, also known as “Jihadi John,” was killed in a 2015 drone strike. A fourth member is serving a prison sentence in Turkey.The plea deal sets a mandatory minimum sentence of life without parole. After 15 years, though, he would be eligible to be transferred to the United Kingdom to face any possible charges there.In the plea deal, he admits that life is an appropriate sentence in the United Kingdom as well. If he were to receive a sentence of less than living there, the deal requires that he serve the rest of his life sentence, either in the United Kingdom if that country will do so, or be transferred back to the U.S. to serve the life term.The deal also requires him to cooperate with authorities and answer questions about his time in the Islamic State group. He would not, though, be required to testify at Elsheikh's trial.The deal also requires him to meet with victims' families if they request it.Kotey gave a somewhat detailed account of his time in Islamic State when U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis asked him to explain in his own words what he had done.He said he traveled to Syria to “engage in a military fight against the Syrian forces of Bashar Assad” and that he eventually pledged allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.“I accept I will be perceived as a radical who holds extremist views,” he said.He acknowledged that he had participated in “capture-and-detain operations” to kidnap Foley and other Western hostages and that he led efforts to extract ransoms.He described the acts of violence that were inflicted on the hostages as a necessary part of keeping them in line and persuading Western governments to pay a ransom.In the years after the hostages had been killed, he said he filled multiple roles within the Islamic State, including as a sniper and as director of a special forces training camp.Prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick said at Thursday's hearing that Kotey, Elsheikh, and Emwazi were all friends at a young age in London, where they became radicalized.In a statement, Raj Parekh, acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is also a member of the prosecution team on the Kotey and Elsheikh cases, said the case has always been focused on the victims and their families."Their resilience, courage, and perseverance have ensured that terror will never have the last word. The justice, fairness, and humanity that this defendant received in the United States stand in stark contrast to the cruelty, inhumanity, and indiscriminate violence touted by the terrorist organization he espoused,” Parekh said.Mueller also was raped by the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to the indictment. Al-Baghdadi was killed by US forces in Syria in 2019.Kotey and Elsheikh were captured in Syria in 2018 by the US-supported Syrian Democratic Forces while trying to escape to Turkey.Family members of all four victims attended Thursday's hearing and stood outside the courthouse afterward with prosecutors. They will have an opportunity to speak at Kotey's formal sentencing on March 4.James Foley's mother, Diane, said she was grateful for the conviction and praised prosecutors for obtaining a detailed account of Kotey's culpability.“This accountability is essential if our country wants to discourage hostage-taking," she said. Diane Foley also called on the US government to prioritize the return of all Americans being held abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/member-of-isis-beatles-cell-pleads-guilty-to-beheading-american-hostages-101630642967733.html
03-09-2021||World||Supreme authority, Iranian model: Taliban likely to announce government today||The Taliban are likely to announce a new administration after Friday afternoon prayers on the lines of the Iranian leadership with the group’s top spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada as Afghanistan's supreme authority, according to reports. Bilal Karimi, a member of the group’s cultural commission, said on Thursday that the Taliban and other Afghan leaders have reached a “consensus” on the formation of a new government and cabinet under Akhundzada's leadership.“The consultations on forming an inclusive Afghan government within the Islamic Emirate’s leaders, with the leaders from the previous government and other influential leaders have officially ended,” Karimi was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “They have reached a consensus. We’re about to announce a functioning cabinet and government in a few days, not weeks," he added.All eyes are on the Taliban whether Afghanistan's new rulers will keep their promise of a more "inclusive" government and be more accommodating than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, which was notorious for its brutal and violent interpretation of Sharia, and its treatment of women. Women were not allowed to work and denied freedom of movement and girls were banned from school.Karimi said Haibatullah Akhundzada will be the top leader of any governing council, and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of Akhundzada’s three deputies and the main public face of the Taliban, is likely to be in charge of the daily functioning of the government in Afghanistan. Senior Taliban leaders have said that Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada will monitor the government from Kandahar, the stronghold of the movement.Also read | With Taliban close to forming govt, Afghan women protest for their rightsThe Taliban government will follow the pattern of the Iranian leadership under which the supreme leader is the highest political and religious authority of the country, reported news agency PTI. In Iran, he is above the president and appoints the heads of the military as well as the government and the judiciary.

Samangani said the name of the new governance system, the national flag and the national anthem are yet to be finalised, he said.Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the deputy leader of the Taliban political office in Doha, said that women and members from all tribes in Afghanistan will be part of the new government setup. Stanikzai also told BBC Pashto in an interview that while women could continue working, there "may not" be a place for them in the cabinet of any future government or any other top post. "Any person who was part of any former Afghanistan governments during the last 20 years will not be included in the new Taliban administration," he said.Also read | Biden's approval rating at all-time low after Afghanistan withdrawal, poll showsMeanwhile, some 50 women took to the streets in the western city of Herat on Thursday in a rare, defiant protest, demanding the right to work and over the lack of their participation in the new government.

The government has been considering holding the general election on Oct. 17.Suga was planning to reshuffle his cabinet and party executives, but those plans were no longer valid, two party sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, is competing for the party leader post. On Thursday, Kishida criticised Suga's coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic.Unlike last year, grassroots LDP members will vote along with its members of parliament, which makes the outcome of the party leader race harder to predict. Novice MPs, fearful of losing their seats, may be wary of following their elders' orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-suga-to-step-down-as-prime-minister-report-101630639736186.html

"Officials must bear in mind that tightening epidemic prevention is the task of paramount importance which must not be loosened even a moment,” Kim said during a politburo meeting on Thursday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Friday.While stressing the need for material and technical means of coronavirus prevention and increasing health workers' qualifications, Kim also called for “further rounding off our style epidemic prevention system,” KCNA said.Kim has earlier called for North Koreans to brace for prolonged Covid-19 restrictions, indicating the country's borders would stay closed despite worsening economic and food conditions. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has used tough quarantines and border closures to prevent outbreaks of the pandemic.On Tuesday, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), which procures and delivers vaccines on behalf of the COVAX distribution program, said North Korea proposed its allotment of about 3 million Sinovac shots be sent to severely affected nations instead. According to Unicef, North Korea’s health ministry has said it would continue to communicate with COVAX over future vaccines.Some experts believe that North Korea may want other vaccines while questioning the effectiveness of Sinovac and the rare blood clots seen in some recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University, said North Korea is likely to receive more effective jabs from COVAX and then strategically allocate them domestically. “Pyongyang appears to have issues with COVAX involving legal responsibility and distribution reporting requirements. So it might procure vaccines from China to deliver to border regions and soldiers while allocating COVAX shots to less sensitive populations,” Easley said.“The Kim regime likely wants the most safe and effective vaccine for the elite, but administering Pfizer would require upgraded cold chain capability in Pyongyang and at least discreet discussions with the United States. The (Johnson & Johnson) option could also be useful to North Korea given that vaccine’s portability and one-shot regimen," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-orders-stricter-covid-19-steps-after-north-korea-shuns-vaccines-101630635972276.html

03-09-2021||World||Hurricane Ida: At least 44 dead as flash floods drown US states. 10 points||Hurricane Ida pummelled through at least four states in the northeast United States over the past day, triggering torrential rains and flash floods that swept away cars, submerged subway lines, and grounded airline flights from Virginia to New England. While it is difficult to zero in on an exact death toll, given the extent of the damages, most of the international news agencies reporting on the incident concur that at least 44 people have died so fa, including 13 in New York City, while many are still unaccounted for. Large swaths of the affected regions still remain waterlogged as officials struggle to provide an exact rundown of the situation.Hurricane Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the US Gulf Coast, made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana, destroying entire communities.Here are the latest updates on the flash flood situation, triggered by Hurricane Ida, in the United States:1. At least 23 from New Jersey have perished in the massive flooding, according to the state's governor Phil Murphy. A victim at the Maplewood Township in New Jersey was swept away by the flash floods while he was apparently trying to remove debris from storm drains in the area, the police said.2. At least 13 people have lost their lives to Ida's remnant flooding in New York City, as per the Reuters news agency. Three of them were found dead in a basement at a borough in Queens, while four residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, died at a public housing complex flooded by 8 feet (2.4m) of water.3. CNN estimates that the death toll from flooding had risen to 46, highlighting that "dozens" have died in at least six Eastern States -- Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia -- after the storm brought unprecedented rainfall to some areas. Deaths have also been reported from suburban Westchester County.4. Subway service in New York City remained "extremely limited," transit officials said, and commuter rail services to the suburbs were largely suspended. About 370 flights were canceled at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport.5. Emergencies were declared for New York state, New York City, and New Jersey. The governors of the respective states have urged residents to stay home as crews worked to clear roadways and restore service to subways and commuter rail lines serving millions of residents. In New York City alone, emergency responders have rescued hundreds of people from vehicles on flooded roads and hundreds of others from the submerged subway lines.6. Roadways were transformed into river-like torrents in minutes as the downpours struck on Wednesday night, trapping drivers in quickly rising floodwaters. In New York, nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned on flooded highways, garbage bobbed in streaming streets, and water cascaded into the city's subway tunnels, trapping at least 17 trains and disrupting service all day.7. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said that two "tree-snapping tornadoes" struck Maryland on Wednesday, one in Annapolis and another in Baltimore. A 19-year-old was reported to have died after trying to rescue his mother from a flooded apartment in Rockville, reported the Washington Post.8. Hurricane Ida also made its presence felt in Philadelphia, where four people died as a result of the storm. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.9. Officials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. In Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River inundated hotels, warehouses, and condominiums that line the river. Emergency squads were reported to be waiting for the waters to recede before starting evacuations of possibly hundreds of people who live in nearby apartments.10. Hurricane Ida's soggy remnants merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change — warmer air holds more rain — and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-at-least-44-dead-as-flash-floods-drown-us-states-10-points-101630631548272.html

He also wanted “pushing forward huge nature-remaking projects,” to mitigate damage caused by floods and typhoons, it said.The North Korean leader has issued rare warnings of economic struggles and food shortages in the past months, perhaps to prepare his people for hard times ahead. But Kim so far has shown no indication he’s willing to sit down for discussions with U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on reducing his nuclear arsenal in return for economic incentives.North Korea is facing its worse food shortages in more than a decade, it said in a report to the United Nations a few months ago, giving the world notice Pyongyang is bracing for one of its biggest domestic challenges since Kim took power at the end of 2011. Kim told party leaders the dangers from what he called an abnormal climate have become higher in recent years. Food InsecurityNorth Korea’s perennial food shortages were made worse by typhoons in 2020 that wiped out crops and Kim’s decision to shut borders due to Covid, slamming the brakes on what little legal trade it has. According to the UN World Food Program, about 40% of North Korea’s population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”By making its problems public, Kim may be sending a signal to the Biden administration to allow more assistance through international organizations like the World Food Program. At the party meeting, Kim also called on officials to place “paramount importance” on tightening epidemic prevention, “given the further worsening worldwide health crisis,” KCNA said. Kim’s decision to shut borders at the start of the pandemic appears to have made North Korea’s food even more dire.North Korea says it has had no cases of Covid-19, but officials from the U.S., Japan and others highly doubt the claim. Kim meanwhile, has shunned offers of vaccines through the Covax program backed by the World Health Organization, apparently because it’s unwilling to follow the organization’s instructions and rules.North Korea most recently rejected Covax’s offer to provide around 3 million doses of Sinovac vaccines, according to NK News on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-warns-on-abnormal-climate-orders-land-overhaul-101630632771167.html

The deviation put the ship outside the air traffic control clearance area.The FAA is overseeing the probe; it's responsible for protecting the public during commercial launches and reentries. Crew safety, on the other hand, is outside its jurisdiction. Virgin Galactic insisted Thursday that Branson and everyone else on board were never in any added danger.“Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement.Virgin Galactic acknowledged the space plane dropped below the protected airspace for one minute and 41 seconds. The spacecraft's free-flying portion of the up-and-down flight lasted about 15 minutes and reached an altitude of 53.5 miles (86 kilometers).Virgin Galactic said high-altitude wind caused the change in the flight path and insisted the two pilots “responded appropriately.” In a statement, the company said the flight was “a safe and successful test flight that adhered to our flight procedures and training protocols.”In another statement Thursday, Virgin Galactic added that “at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public.” Virgin Galactic operates out of Spaceport America in the southern New Mexico desert.“We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions,” the company said.Branson ended up beating fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos — founder of Amazon as well as rocket company Blue Origin — into space by nine days. Bezos launched July 20 with three others from West Texas.Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are vying to sell seats to tourists, scientists, and anyone else looking to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Virgin Galactic's rocket ship is launched from an airplane, while Blue Origin's capsule is hoisted by a reusable New Shepard rocket.Virgin Galactic is aiming for late September or early October for its next flight, with two Italian Air Force officers, an engineer for the National Research Council of Italy, Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut instructor, and the rocketship's two pilots. It will be the company's first launch where researchers accompany their own experiments. The company plans to start flying ticket holders next year.Blue Origin has yet to announce a date for its next passenger flight, other than to say it will be soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-virgin-galactic-spaceflights-while-probing-mishap-on-richard-branson-s-trip-101630631059330.html

According to a new Marist National Poll with NPR and PBS Newshour, US President Joe Biden's approval rating has fallen to a new low of 43 per cent, the lowest since he took office. The majority of Americans disapprove of the way Biden handles foreign policy, while a large section of the populace has also termed the United States' role in Afghanistan a "failure".Also Read | 'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in AfghanistanWhile Joe Biden's approval rating as the US president is currently at 43 per cent, about 56 per cent of Americans disapprove of his handling of foreign policy. Around 61 per cent of the populace is against the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the data published by Marist Poll reveals. Although Americans are not sure about what exactly should have happened in Afghanistan, a large majority (around 71 per cent) say that United States' role was a "failure", the poll said.The 71 per cent of Americans who said so include 73 per cent of Republicans but also 66 per cent of Democrats, a large majority, hinting at a major dissent among Biden's own party colleagues. This section also includes around 75 per cent of independent politicians.A large majority of Americans or 61 per cent, however, seem to think Afghanistan "must determine its future without US involvement," while 29 per cent of the populace believe that it is the United States' "duty" to stay involved with the war-torn nation's affairs.When Americans were asked how the US ought to have handled the Afghanistan situation, opinions were varied and divided. While 37 per cent admit that all US troops should have been withdrawn, 38 per cent of the populace says that some troops should have been withdrawn and some left behind. Smaller proportions say no troops should have been withdrawn (10 per cent) or more troops should have been sent (5 per cent).Also Read | 'Not afraid, we are united': With Taliban close to forming govt, Afghan women protestFinally, the poll revealed that Americans do not think that the responsibility for the situation in Afghanistan rests solely on Biden. Overall, the largest section of all those who were polled, 36 per cent, ranked George W Bush as being the most responsible for the 'failure' of the military mission, followed by Joe Biden at 21 per cent, Barack Obama at 15 per cent, and Donald Trump at 12 per cent. Democrats, however, list Republicans Bush (53 per cent) and Trump (22 per cent) as their top two. Republicans list Democrats Biden (38 per cent) and Obama (34 per cent) as their top two.The Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan fell on August 15 following a Taliban blitzkrieg which saw the insurgents winning control of one province after another throughout the month, all while the United States continued to draw back its troops, ending its extended two-decade-long military mission in Afghanistan. The administration stuck to the August 31 deadline fixed by Joe Biden, even as critics raised concern over the deteriorating situation in the country in light of the Taliban offensive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-approval-rating-at-all-time-low-after-afghanistan-withdrawal-poll-shows-101630628681033.html

03-09-2021||World||Flights resume, some power restored in New Orleans after Hurricane Ida||Commercial flights resumed in New Orleans and power returned to parts of the business district Thursday, four days after Hurricane Ida slammed into the Gulf Coast, but electricity, drinking water and fuel remained scarce across much of a sweltering Louisiana.Meanwhile, the remnants of the system walloped parts of the Northeast, dumping record-breaking rain in a region that had not expected a serious blow and killing at least 45 people from Maryland to Connecticut. Eleven people in New York City drowned in basement apartments.New Orleans fared better than many other places because it was protected from catastrophic flooding by the levee system that was revamped after Hurricane Katrina. The power was back on before dawn in some downtown neighborhoods. Utility crews also restored electricity to several hospitals in Jefferson Parish and near Baton Rouge. Some streets were cleared of fallen trees and debris, and a few corner stores reopened.The city's main airport reopened to commercial flights for the first time since the hurricane. Delta was first airline to return, to be followed Friday by United Airlines and later by other carriers, officials said.Louisiana officials also reported a big drop late Thursday in the number of customers with no running water: 185,000, compared to more than 600,000 the day before.Still, the overwhelming majority of homes remained dark. In seven parishes, at least 95% of customers remained without power Thursday. Only 35,000 of the 405,000 homes and businesses in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish had power Thursday morning, according to the poweroutage.us website. Statewide, about 900,000 customers were without electricity, down from about 1.1 million at the height of the seventh named storm to hit Louisiana since the summer of 2020.“This isn’t our first rodeo, but it’s our worst rodeo,” Kirt LeBouef said as he wiped away tears while looking at damage to the Little Eagle restaurant in Golden Meadow, a 75-mile (120 kilometer) drive down a narrow highway from New Orleans toward the Gulf.LeBouef's family has owned the crawfish restaurant since 1920.Power should be restored to most customers around Baton Rouge area by Sept. 8. after workers finish assessing damage, Entergy Louisiana President Philip May said Thursday. Damage assessments are not as far along in the harder-hit regions, so Entergy said it has no timetable for getting service to those areas, which include New Orleans.Gasoline shortages were also a problem for people trying to run generators and waiting in drive-thru lines for food and water. The lines for gas stretched for blocks in many places from New Orleans to Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden also ordered the release of extra fuel from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure a steady supply. He said he would also provide utilities with satellite images to help restore power.“We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part,” said Biden, who was getting hourly updates on the recovery. “We need to get power restored. We need to get more food, fuel and water deployed.”Ida knocked out Port Fourchon, the primary hub to support offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil on its way to refineries. Port leaders said the damage to structures where the powerful eye came ashore was not as bad as feared.“The majority of them are still good, and we can get things back up and running,” said Chett Chiasson, executive director for the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, who did not give an exact estimate on reopening the facilities.The president was scheduled to visit Louisiana on Friday to survey the damage from Ida, which hit Sunday with 150 mph (230 kph) winds and was tied for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to strike the mainland U.S.At least 13 deaths were blamed on the storm in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including two 19-year-old utility employees who were electrocuted Tuesday as they were restoring power near Birmingham, Alabama. Authorities blamed several other deaths on carbon monoxide poisoning.The deaths of three Louisiana nursing home residents were classified Thursday as storm-related. Investigators from the Louisiana Department of Health were kicked off the property Tuesday, the agency said. Spokeswoman Aly Neel said officials had heard reports of deteriorating conditions at the site, including people lying on mattresses on the floor and not being fed or changed.Outside New Orleans, neighborhoods remained flooded and residents were still reeling. Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said 25% of the homes in his parish of 100,00 people were gone or had catastrophic damage, and up to 40% more had severe damage from winds that blew at over 100 mph (160 kph) for 12 hours.“This storm is more than just a New Orleans event. Lafourche took the brunt of this storm,” Chaisson said at a briefing.Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the state were told to boil their water before using it.Evacuees considering returning home to Terrebonne Parish were warned by emergency officials on Twitter that “there are no shelters, no electricity, very limited resources for food, gasoline and supplies and absolutely no medical services.”Louisiana’s largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, was considering opening a field hospital somewhere in Terrebonne or Lafourche parish because the shuttering of most of the hospitals in the area removed about 250 to 300 beds.Declining numbers of Covid-19 patients and restoration of power at additional sites helped Ochsner Health recover, CEO Warner Thomas said during an online news conference. The Ochsner system’s Covid-19 patient count fell to 663 from 990 about a week ago, Thomas said. That coincides with the state’s overall declining case numbers.Hard-hit areas in southeast Louisiana were also under a heat advisory Thursday. Forecasters warned that combined heat and humidity could make some areas feel like 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-resume-some-power-restored-in-new-orleans-after-hurricane-ida-101630627629516.html
03-09-2021||World||Death toll tops 40 after remnants of hurricane Ida drowns Northeast US||A stunned US East Coast faced a rising death toll, surging rivers, tornado damage and continuing calls for rescue Thursday after the remnants of Hurricane Ida walloped the region with record-breaking rain, drowning more than 40 people in their homes and cars.In a region that had been warned about potentially deadly flash flooding but hadn't braced for such a blow from the no-longer-hurricane, the storm killed at least 45 people from Maryland to Connecticut on Wednesday night and Thursday morning.At least 23 people died in New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said. At least 12 people in New York City, police said, one of them in a car and 11 in flooded basement apartments that often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nation’s most expensive housing markets. Suburban Westchester County reported three deaths.Officials said at least five in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape, according to authorities. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.In New York City, Sophy Liu said she tried using towels and garbage bags to stop the water coming into her first-floor apartment in Queens, but the flood rose up to her chest in just a half hour. She roused her son from bed and put him in a life jacket and inflatable swimming ring.The door stuck when she tried to open it, possibly from water pressure, she said. She called two friends who helped her jar it loose.“I was obviously scared, but I had to be strong for my son. I had to calm him down,” she recalled Thursday as medical examiners removed three bodies from a home down the street.In another part of Queens, water rapidly filled Deborah Torres' first-floor apartment to her knees as her landlord frantically urged her neighbors below — who included a baby — to get out, she said. But the water rushed in so strongly that she surmised they weren't able to open the door. The three residents died.“I have no words," she said. “How can something like this happen?”Ida's remnants maintained a soggy core, then merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change — warmer air holds more rain — and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.The National Hurricane Center had warned since Tuesday of the potential for “significant and life-threatening flash flooding" and major river flooding in the mid-Atlantic region and New England.Still, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the storm's strength took them by surprise."We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York,” said Hochul, a Democrat who became governor last week after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned.De Blasio, also a Democrat, said he'd gotten a forecast Wednesday of 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) of rain for the day. The city's Central Park ended up getting 3.15 inches in just one hour, surpassing the previous one-hour high of 1.94 inches (5 cm) during Tropical Storm Henri on Aug. 21.Wednesday's storm ultimately dumped over 9 inches (23 cm) of rain in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and nearly as much on New York City’s Staten Island.In Washington, President Joe Biden assured Northeast residents that federal first responders were on the ground to help clean up.In New York, some highways flooded, garbage bobbed in streaming streets and water cascaded into the city's subway tunnels, trapping at least 17 trains and halting service until early morning. Videos online showed riders standing on seats in swamped cars. All riders safely evacuated, officials said.At one Queens development, water filled the sunken patio of a basement apartment, then broke through a glass door, trapping a 48-year-old woman in 6 feet (2 meters) of water. Neighbors unsuccessfully tried for an hour to save her.“She was screaming, ‘Help me, help me, help me!’ We all came to her aid, trying to get her out," said the building’s assistant superintendent, Jayson Jordan, but "the thrust of the water was so strong.”Residents said they have complained for years about flooding on another Queens street, where a woman and her 22-year-old son died in a basement apartment. Her husband and the couple's other son were spared only because they stepped out to move a car, next-door neighbor Lisa Singh said.“No one should have to go this way. I feel like this was 100% avoidable,” she said.In Elizabeth, New Jersey, rain and river flooding in an apartment complex killed four people and forced 600 from their homes, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said.Greg Turner, who lives elsewhere in the northern New Jersey city, said his 87-year-old mother started calling 911 at 8 p.m., when the water started rising in her apartment. High water kept him and his brother from getting to her.As midnight approached, the water reached her neck, he said. Rescuers finally cut through the floor of the apartment above and pulled her to safety.“She lost everything," Turner said as he headed to a bank for money to buy his mother clothes and shoes.In New Jersey's Milford Borough, authorities said they found a man’s body in a car buried up to its hood in dirt and rocks.The ferocious storm also spawned at least seven tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. One split trees on Cape Cod, another tore off part of a high school roof in suburban Philadelphia and yet another splintered homes and toppled silos in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, south of Philadelphia."It just came through and ripped,” said resident Jeanine Zubrzycki, 33, who hid in her basement with her three children as their house shook and lights flickered.“And then you could just hear people crying,” said Zubrzycki, 33, whose home was damaged but liveable.Record flooding along the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania inundated homes, highways and commercial buildings, even as meteorologists warned that rivers likely won’t crest for a few more days. The riverside community of Manayunk remained largely under water.The Schuyilkill reached levels not seen in over 100 years in Philadelphia, where firefighters were still getting calls about minor building collapses and people stuck in flooded cars Thursday morning. The managers of a 941-unit apartment complex near the river ordered residents to evacuate, citing “deteriorating” conditions after water rushed into the parking garage and pool areas.In suburban Bucks County, several firefighters had to be rescued after rushing floodwaters pinned a rescue boat against a bridge pier, state emergency management director Randy Padfield said.Others were unable to escape the floods, including Donald Bauer, who was driving home to Perkiomenville with his wife after attending their daughter’s volleyball game at DeSales University, near Allentown.Their SUV stalled in the water and floated into a house, breaking the back windshield, said Darby Bauer, who was on the phone with his parents when the engine died. Donald Bauer helped his wife, Katherine, escape out the broken windshield and urged her to go, their son said.She clung to a tree and watched the rising waters carry the SUV out of sight, he said. She was rescued about an hour later and hospitalized.Donald Bauer, a 65-year-old retired school bus driver, “had one of the biggest hearts we knew,” his son said. “He was selfless down to his last act.”Authorities used boats to rescue people in places from North Kingstown, Rhode Island, to Frederick County, Maryland, where 10 children and a driver were pulled from a school bus caught in rising waters.On Sunday, Ida struck Louisiana as the fifth-strongest storm to ever hit the US mainland, leaving 1 million people without power, maybe for weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-tops-40-after-remnants-of-hurricane-ida-drowns-northeast-us-101630623442306.html

03-09-2021||World||‘Incorrect politics’, ‘effeminate styles’ banned from screens in China||China on Thursday broadened its crackdown on the entertainment industry, directing broadcasters to bar artistes with “immoral” records and “incorrect political positions”, and ban men who are “effeminate” in their performance styles.A “patriotic atmosphere” should be cultivated and propagated in entertainment shows, China’s National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) said in a notice published on its website on Thursday. It further said unhealthy content has to be regulated and television stars’ paychecks have to be capped.“Individuals with a wrong political stance, those who go against the country and the Communist Party of China (CPC), should not be employed by the industry. The same goes for those who violate Chinese laws or social moralities,” read an English translation of the NRTA notice as reported by The Global Times.The notice made a specific mention of banning what it called “abnormal aesthetics”, describing it as style propagated by “feminine men” on television.Entertainment involving “vulgar” internet celebrities, scandals and flaunting of wealth should be rejected, it added.The new rules come in the backdrop of a number of scandals - ranging from tax evasion and rape allegations - involving popular online and television actors. The stars involved have huge online following and are icons for several brands.Last week, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it will crack down on the chaotic culture of online celebrity fan culture as part of the campaign to correct the internet sector.The CAC announced that it would clamp down on algorithms that encourage fans to spend large amounts of money in support of celebrities.The call for an end to stars who are seen as too “feminine” has been on the rise in China.Chinese news agency Xinhua, too, has denounced fan culture, arguing that fan loyalty “can turn blind and toxic, giving rise to online trolling, impulsive buying, rumour-mongering, cyberspace manhunts and other problems”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-broadens-crackdown-on-entertainment-industry-101630566850850.html
