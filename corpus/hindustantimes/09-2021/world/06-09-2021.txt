In July it launched legal action against both countries over measures it says discriminate against the gay community.Polish LGBT activists posted a scan of the letter on social media and on Monday a spokesman for the Lubelskie region confirmed receiving it. A European Commission spokeswoman in Warsaw also confirmed the letter had been sent."The Commission would like to stress that declaring LGBTIQ-free/unwelcome territories, workplace or services constitutes an action that is against the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union," the letter said.It added that extra funding under part of the bloc's COVID recovery fund would be put on hold pending the regions' responses to the Commission's concerns.The funds are part of REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe), a package of additional cohesion funds under which Poland has been allocated a total of over 1.5 billion euros."At the moment, it (the letter) is being analysed in order to prepare an answer," the Lubelskie region spokesman said in an email.Lubelskie and Malopolska regions have both recently voted to remain free of "LGBT ideology".Gay rights is a deeply divisive issue in predominantly Catholic Poland.Also Read | Hate crime, violence feared in Polish 'LGBT-free zones'Many religious conservatives see the fight for LGBT equality as an attack on traditional values. In 2019 numerous local authorities declared themselves free of "LGBT ideology", seeking to ban what they see as the promotion of homosexuality and other minority sexual identities, especially in schools.A European Commission spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on the letter. The Polish Ministry of Funds and Regional Policy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Poland has also angered Brussels by asking its Constitutional Tribunal to rule on whether its constitution takes primacy over EU law.The primacy of EU law is a key tenet of European integration, and European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said Poland's questioning of this principle was holding up the acceptance of its spending plan for recovery funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-polish-regions-they-could-lose-funding-over-lgbt-free-unwelcome-zones-101630951712335.html
06-09-2021||World||In a first since August 31 pullout, four Americans evacuated from Afghanistan||Less than a week after the US withdrew its last soldier from Afghanistan – ending its 20-year-long presence in the country — at least four Americans who were left behind were evacuated into a bordering nation, a US state department official told Reuters on Monday. This marked the first US-facilitated overland evacuation since all its troops pulled out from the now Taliban-controlled Afghanistan on August 31. “We have facilitated the departure of four American citizens from Afghanistan via an overland route. Our embassy greeted the Americans as they crossed the border into the third country,” the officials noted without divulging any additional information, including the country they were evacuated to. US Congressional Representative Ronny Jackson confirmed the evacuation on Twitter, and also identified the four Americans as part of his constituent district in Texas. He added that the evacuation was successfully executed “after two weeks and multiple life-threatening attempts.”

But new clusters of infections since late April have tarnished that record."Tung travelled back to Ca Mau from Ho Chi Minh City ... and breached the 21-day quarantine regulations," the news agency said."Tung infected eight people, one of whom died due to the virus after one month of treatment," it added.Reuters did not immediately reach the Ca Mau court for comment.Ca Mau, Vietnam's southernmost province, has reported only 191 cases and two deaths since the pandemic began, much lower than the nearly 260,000 cases and 10,685 deaths in the country's coronavirus epicentre, Ho Chi Minh City.Vietnam is battling a worsening Covid-19 outbreak that has infected more than 536,000 people and killed 13,385, the vast majority in the past few months.The country has sentenced two other people to 18-month and two-year suspended jail terms on the same charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-jails-man-for-5-years-for-spreading-coronavirus-101630946191639.html
06-09-2021||World||‘Concerned over terror spreading from Afghanistan’: Russian envoy||Russia and India have the shared concern of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan spreading to Russian territory or to Kashmir, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev said on Monday against the backdrop of the Taliban takeover in Kabul.Counter-terrorism cooperation is a key part of the India-Russia dialogue at various levels, and Moscow wants an inclusive government in Kabul to ensure stability and sustainable development in Afghanistan, Kudashev told reporters during an interaction at the Russian embassy.Separately, Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud, who is on an official visit to New Delhi, told reporters at the Press Club of India that his country is closely watching developments in Afghanistan as they have implications for regional stability.“We are keeping an eye on that. Stability in Afghanistan is important for stability in the South Asian region,” Mahmud said. He added it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up formed by the Taliban.Kudashev, who spoke to reporters on the margins of an event at the Russian embassy, said Russia is closely cooperating with India to counter the danger of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Any flare-up of the civilian conflict would result in terrorism spilling over across the region, he said.“As far as the phenomenon of terror is concerned, we do share our concerns with India. There is a danger of terror...being spread to the Russian territory, to the territory of Kashmir maybe,” he said. “We want an inclusive government, we expect that Afghan soil would not be a source of terror emanating to the other countries of the region,” he said. “Thus, this is a matter of common concern and this is a matter of continued dialogue between Russia and India within multiple frameworks, be it the bilateral counter-terrorism working group, [or] the track of national security councils [or] the track of defence ministers [and] foreign ministers,” he added.Russia’s main concern is stability in Afghanistan and building an inclusive government that can “offer itself for recognition to the international community to secure stability and sustainable development,” Kudashev said.Afghanistan “deserves peace, predictability and sustainable development, and India and Russia want “Afghanistan to be peaceful [and] friendly with each and every country in the region,” he said. “These are the very basic values which bring Russia and India together. I don’t see much of a difference in our positions,” Kudashev added. Both countries are also cooperating on Afghanistan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and its working group on Afghanistan. Kudashev said it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up created by the Taliban. “The new Taliban dispensation should prove that it is a responsible government, that it is able to build an inclusive government, that it is able to look after each and every minority, each and every region of Afghanistan, that it is able to build predictable foreign ties...with the regional and international community,” he said. “If that will be the case, we will be able to revisit this question,” he added.Kudashev’s comments came against the backdrop of some amount of disquiet in New Delhi over Moscow’s efforts to work more closely with Islamabad on the issue of Afghanistan. India was kept out of several recent meetings of the “extended troika” format organised by Russia, and Pakistan was part of these discussions.Zamir Kabulov, the Russian special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, had even said that India was not invited to participate in the “expanded troika” meetings because it does not have any influence on the Taliban. Kudashev said in response to questions that India and Russia were expected to hold multiple interactions this year, including the annual bilateral summit, a 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers, and meetings of the military and technical commission, trade and economic commission, and other expert-level groups. These meetings will focus on matters such as UN reforms, strategic stability, the emerging regional architecture in Asia and the Pacific, and challenges such as terrorism, drug trafficking and crime.He noted, there are “enormous opportunities” for bilateral cooperation in defence, oil and gas, nuclear power, space, infrastructure and connectivity. The Russian proposal to build six new nuclear reactors is still “on the table” and “it is for the Indian government to take a decision” on this matter, he said.Kudashev said Russia is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. “There are no issues as far as the timeline is concerned. It would be performed in due course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-over-terror-spreading-from-afghanistan-russian-envoy-101630945666257.html

Washington completed the withdrawal on Aug. 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-1-000-await-flight-clearance-to-leave-afghan-city-of-mazar-i-sharif-report-101630944339193.html

Ireland meat checks||The UK and the European Union are set to extend the grace period during which certain food products can cross the border from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, people familiar with the matter said.Under the original Brexit deal struck with the EU by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the sale of chilled meats and fresh sausages into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK was going to be outlawed by the end of June. This extra time was given to let companies adapt to Brexit, but instead led to a confrontation, dubbed “sausage war.” The two sides defused tensions over the summer by extending the transition to the end of September. But now the new deadline is encroaching and there is still no resolution.A fresh extension may be announced as soon as tomorrow, according to three people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity discussing unannounced policy. They didn’t specify how long it would be for. Two officials said that while the EU hasn’t agreed to the postponement, the bloc wouldn’t start infringement proceedings, effectively nodding it through.The UK and EU are locked in discussions to try to resolve the issue, with Johnson’s government calling on the EU to rewrite a part of the Brexit deal that effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs area and much of the single market and means cargo coming from mainland Britain needs to be checked before or on entry to ensure it meets EU standards.Separately, two people familiar with the matter said that European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit Minister David Frost will hold a call later this week to try to make progress on a solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sausage-war-uk-set-to-extend-brexit-grace-period-on-n-ireland-meat-checks-101630940900997.html

The statement from the Islamist group comes after it confirmed that Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed met Taliban’s de-facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul last week in an unannounced visit.Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, while speaking to Afghan news agency Khaama, said the group will not allow any country to interfere in the nation’s internal affairs. ISI chief Hameed was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit Afghanistan from Pakistan following the Taliban takeover last month.Mujahid confirmed that Baradar met Hameed, news agency BBC Urdu reported citing people familiar with the development. He also said that the Taliban assured Islamabad that the Afghan soil will not be used against Pakistan.Pakistan earlier said that the ISI chief visited the nation on the Taliban’s invitation, but the Islamist group denied the claim and said that Pakistan proposed the meeting. The group, however, said that the Pakistani spy agency chief was in Afghanistan to improve bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad.Taliban spokesperson and deputy head of its cultural commission, Ahmadullah Wasiq, said that both the leaders discussed problems faced by passengers at the Torkham and Spin Boldak passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan.“The Pakistani official came to solve Afghan passengers’ problems at the border areas, especially in Torkham and Spin Boldak. They wanted (his visit to Kabul) and we accepted,” Wasiq was quoted as saying by Afghan news agency Tolo News.Pakistan closed the Chaman border crossing, which is the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan after Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, owing to security concerns.The high-level visit of Pakistan ISI chief to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan caused concern and surprise among security experts. The Afghanistan government, led by former president Ashraf Ghani, accused Pakistan of giving the Taliban military aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-won-t-allow-pak-to-interfere-in-afghanistan-s-internal-affairs-report-101630940167009.html

The HMS Queen Elizabeth arrived at the US Navy base in Yokosuka near Tokyo last week. It is Britain’s largest and most-powerful warship. HMS Queen Elizabeth is capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft such as F-35 stealth fighters, according to the Royal Navy.Japan is seeking to expand its military cooperation beyond the US as the Chinese navy presses territorial claims in the South China Sea. The aircraft carrier participated in a joint exercise with warships from the US, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan before arriving in Yokosuka.“European countries' interest in (China's) unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas ... contributes to the peace and stability in this region. I expect the port call will contribute to a further development of Japan-British defense cooperation,” Kishi was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. He also said that the previous exercise was part of efforts to achieve a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ - a vision led by Washington and Tokyo.China’s military influence in the region along with the nations escalating tensions with Taiwan and the US is a cause for concern for Japan. It protested Chinese presence near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands. China also claims these islands and calls them Diaoyu.Commodore Moorhouse upon his arrival in Yokosuka said that the strike group’s meeting was part of the UK's ‘commitment to strengthen our diplomatic, economic and security ties in the Indo-Pacific’. He said that interaction will take ties between Japan and the UK to a ‘new level’.“The Carrier Strike Group’s presence embodies the United Kingdom’s support for the freedom and security of the region’s vital trading routes, and for an international system that benefits all countries,” Moorhead said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-aircraft-carrier-arrives-in-japan-for-drill-aims-to-counter-china-101630939013817.html
06-09-2021||World||Pakistan ISI chief meets Taliban top leader Mullah Baradar: Report||The Taliban on Monday confirmed that Pakistan's powerful intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has met its de-facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, amidst efforts by the insurgent group to finalise a government in Afghanistan.Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Hameed dashed to Kabul on an unannounced visit last week, becoming the only high-ranking foreign official to visit Kabul since the Taliban seized the Afghan capital in mid-August.During a press conference in Kabul on Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the ISI chief had met with Mullah Baradar during his visit to Kabul, BBC Urdu reported.The Taliban has assured Islamabad that Afghan territory will not be used against Pakistan, it said.Earlier, Pakistani media reported that a delegation of senior officials led by Lt Gen Hameed was in Kabul at the invitation of the Taliban, but the insurgent group said that Islamabad had proposed his visit to Kabul.On Sunday, the Taliban said that the top Pakistani spy was in Afghanistan to improve bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad.Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the Taliban’s Cultural Commission, said that the Taliban leaders talked with Lt Gen Hameed about bilateral relations and the problems of Afghan passengers at the Torkham and Spin Boldak passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan."This Pakistani official has come to solve Afghan passengers’ problems at the border areas, especially in Torkham and Spin Boldak. They wanted (his visit to Kabul) and we accepted,” Wasiq was quoted as saying by TOLO news.Pakistan on Thursday temporarily closed the Chaman border crossing - the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan after the Torkham commercial town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – due to security threats.At his press conference, Mujahid noted that the recent delegation to Kabul said the crossings had been closed due to security concerns linked to release of prisoners inside Afghanistan, and requested checks for those seeking to enter or leave the country.Citing sources close to Hizb-e-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the channel said that Pakistan's intelligence chief also met him and discussed the current situation in the country.In a short video clip circulated in the media last week, Lt Gen Hameed was seen trying to respond to questions by a journalist who first asked: “Will you be meeting senior people in the Taliban?""No, I’m not clear…" the ISI chief said and looked towards Pakistan ambassador to Kabul Mansour Ahmad Khan, who was standing by his side, to respond to the question.In response to another question, Hameed smiled and said: "Don’t worry, everything will be okay."Hameed's visit to Afghanistan came amidst mounting pressure on the Taliban to form an inclusive government acceptable to the international community. The insurgent group is struggling to give shape to a broad-based and inclusive administration acceptable to the international community.It was the first high-level visit of any Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, in a move that surprised both their foes and friends.Since then, the Taliban have been trying to form a government but so far have held back the announcement.Pakistan was often accused by the Afghanistan government of giving the Taliban military aid, a charge denied by Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-isi-chief-meets-taliban-top-leader-mullah-baradar-report-101630932646364.html

The spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry, Wang Wenbin, told reporters that he has “no information to offer at this moment”.China has kept its embassy in Kabul open, joining the leagues of countries like Russia. Media reports suggest that Beijing is awaiting the formation of a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan. "We always respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, follow the principle of non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs and adhere to the friendly policy for all the Afghan people," Wenbin told reporters in late August.“China also stands ready to continue to develop good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with Afghanistan and play a constructive role in Afghanistan's peace and reconstruction," he added.Also Read: Warming relations between China, Taliban cause fear among Uyghurs: ReportThe official stance of Beijing in regards to a Taliban government is centred around preventing cross-border terrorism in its western Xinjiang region from anti-Beijing East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) militants, who, China fears, could seek sanctuary within Afghanistan.“China's primary concern now is for the Taliban to ... build an inclusive and moderate regime so that terrorism would not spill over to Xinjiang and the region. Any other calculus further to that remains to be seen," the foreign ministry told Reuters in August.To assuage China’s apprehensions Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar had assured Beijing that EITM militants will not be allowed to carry out operations on Afghan soil. Ghani who was on an official visit to China in July told Chinese state media that Beijing has always been a “reliable friend” and “the Afghan Taliban will never allow any force to use the Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimental to China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-refuses-to-answer-question-on-taliban-s-invitation-to-afghan-government-inauguration-101630928354586.html
06-09-2021||World||Afghanistan crisis: NRF leader says resistance forces still present in Panjshir,||The National Resistance Front (NRF) are still present in Panjshir, the last resistance stronghold of Afghanistan, and continuing their fight against the Taliban, said its leader Ahmad Massoud, in an audio message on his Facebook page, according to a report by Tolo News.This comes hours after the Taliban which took over the capital city of Kabul on August 15 following the US drawdown, said it has captured the remaining province of Panjshir, located in the northeastern part of the country. However, the NRF has denied the claims and says the fighting is still going on. Its forces are positioned on all strategic points, NRF spokesperson Ali Nazary said earlier in the day.After the fall of Kabul, Panjshir remains the only defiant holdout where resistance forces led by Massoud, the son of late former Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, are fighting the Taliban. Over the days, both sides have claimed to have an upper hand in Panjshir, even as neither of the parties have produced any conclusive proof to support the claim.Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last month as the United States and its NATO allies began withdrawing their forces from the country, ending the 20-year long war. The forces had entered the south Asian country in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack for anti-terror operations.With the collapse of the Afghan government which was led by President Ashraf Ghani, the Taliban is now set to form its government. Meanwhile, Ghani has fled to the United Arab Emirates along with his family and key officials.On Sunday, Ahmad issued a statement, calling for an end to the fighting and offered a ‘peace’ deal. The leader of the resistance force said he is ready to ask his forces to lay down their weapons, only if the Taliban agrees to end their assault.However, late on Sunday dozens of vehicles loaded with the Taliban were seen swarming into Panjshir Valley, according to a report by Associated Press.Meanwhile, the Taliban has assured the residents of Panjshir that they will be safe and the group aims to serve the country for a "common goal.""We give full confidence to the honourable people of Panjshir that they will not be subjected to any discrimination, that all are our brothers, and that we will serve a country and a common goal," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid in his statement earlier.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-crisis-nrf-leader-says-resistance-forces-still-present-in-panjshir-101630928240714.html
06-09-2021||World||University classes resume in Afghanistan with a 'curtain of separation'||A local news agency in Afghanistan reported on Monday that university classes started in the country but with a "curtain of separation". A photo posted on Twitter by Aamaj News shows male and female students sitting in a class room with curtains between them.در تصویر: دروس دانشگاه با پرده جدایی آغاز شد #آماج_نیوز pic.twitter.com/2we0oqRnbSThis is a result of education policy outline given by the Taliban, now in power in Afghanistan, through their diktats. Taliban have said in many interviews that they have no issue with women education "but they should study with a hijab".In a lengthy order issued on Saturday, the Taliban ordered women attending private Afghan universities to wear an abaya robe and niqab covering most of the face. They also said that classes must be segregated by sex - or at least divided by a curtain.The Taliban diktat said that female students should only be taught by other women, but if that was not possible then "old men" of good character could fill in.Women must also end their lesson five minutes earlier than men to stop them from mingling outside, the Taliban order further said.For students, the curtains have become a barrier. "Putting up curtains is not acceptable," Anjila, a 21-year-old student at Kabul University who returned to find her classroom partitioned, told news agency Reuters by telephone."I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago."The decree, said Taliban, applies to private colleges and universities, which have mushroomed since their first rule ended in 2001.During that period, girls and women were mostly excluded from education because of rules regarding same-sex classrooms and the insistence they had to be accompanied by a male relative whenever they left the house.A journalism professor at Herat University in the west of the country told Reuters he decided to split his one-hour class into two halves, first teaching females and then males.Of 120 students enrolled for his course, less than a quarter showed up at school on Monday.The Taliban have assured of a moderate and inclusive government this time and have issued statements in a bid to build confidence. But on the ground, situation hasn't changed much.On Saturday, a pregnant Afghan policewoman Banu Nigara was shot dead by Taliban fighters in front of her husband and children at her home in Firozkoh, local media reported. “Nigara a police officer was shot dead infront of her kids and husband last night at 10PM in Ghor province. Nigara was 6 months pregnant, she was shot dead by the Taliban,” leading Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary tweeted on Sunday citing her family members.The Taliban have, however, denied they were involved in the killing of Nigara.Colleges and higher education institutions opened in Afghanistan on Monday after remaining closed for months, first due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and later because of chaos in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/university-classes-resume-in-afghanistan-with-a-curtain-of-separation-101630925501362.html
06-09-2021||World||New Taliban provincial governor vows to fight IS||As a Taliban commander, he spent years battling the former Afghan government. Now, with his hardline movement back in power, Mullah Neda Mohammad vows to continue fighting against rival jihadists, the Islamic State (IS) group.Following the Taliban's victory in August, Mohammad took over as governor of Nangarhar province, home to the IS Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter's stronghold."We are searching for individuals who are hiding," Mohammad told AFP, claiming his forces have arrested 70 to 80 IS members since they took control of Nangarhar's provincial capital Jalalabad, the country's fifth biggest city.IS have been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan of recent years, massacring civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals.The group claimed responsibility for a devastating suicide bombing near Kabul airport on August 26 that killed more than 100 Afghans and 13 US soldiers.It was the deadliest attack against American forces in Afghanistan since 2011.After the blast, the US military said it had carried out a drone strike against an IS "planner" in the Nangarhar province.Still, Mohammad says he does not believe IS poses a great a threat as they did in Iraq and Syria."Here they have suffered many casualties in northern and eastern Afghanistan," he told AFP in Jalalabad, at the governor's palace, now decked with Taliban flags.With the Taliban in power, "there will be no reason for (IS) to be here", he said. "We don't consider IS as a threat."Bloody infightingAlthough both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they have differed on the minutiae of religion and strategy, while each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.That tussle has led to bloody fighting between the two.One IS commentary published after the fall of Kabul accused the Taliban of betraying jihadists with the US withdrawal deal, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communications.The latest estimates of IS's strength vary from 500 active fighters to as high as several thousand, according to a UN report in July.However, a spree of prison breaks by the Taliban during their summer offensive also led to many IS militants being released.The Taliban swept to power with staggering speed, and Mohammad described how he and his fighters were able to march on Jalalabad without firing a shot.There had been intense fighting against former government forces in nearby Sherzad as they made their advance, but once the Taliban took the village they received word of a surrender.Jalalabad's former leaders "sent a representative who told us that they did not want to fight any more and wanted to hand over the local government peacefully", Mohammad said."We built our organisation here," he said. "We appointed the police chief, intelligence chief and the governor -- which was given to me."Scarred by memories After two decades of fighting an insurgency, the Taliban must rapidly transition into a governing force that can manage a humanitarian crisis and war-wrecked economy.It has resulted in commanders more at ease with organising ambushes now running cities of hundreds of thousands of people.Like most in Afghanistan, the people of Nangarhar are scarred by the memories of the Taliban's brutal reign in the 1990s, which was infamous for deaths by stoning, girls being banned from school and women from working in contact with men.The province's new governor has offered reassuring words, but many people remain sceptical about the Taliban's pledge of a different kind of rule."We will protect their rights and we won't allow criminals to harm the people of Afghanistan, particularly the people of Nangarhar," Mohammad said.Despite the assurances, an aid worker in Jalalabad said on condition of anonymity that "a lot of people in the city are not happy, and they are afraid for freedom of expression".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-taliban-provincial-governor-vows-to-fight-is-101630924486774.html

06-09-2021||World||International flights from Kabul airport to resume soon: Report||The Taliban said international flights from Afghanistan will resume shortly as Qatar and Turkey help restart operations at Kabul airport and the group has complete control over the country with the last pocket of resistance in the north now defeated.“Domestic flights have already started and we’re waiting to hear when we can start overseas flights,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said at a press conference in Kabul. “We plan to start overseas flights very soon.”Restarting international flights and allowing safe passage to Afghans who wish to leave the country is key to the Taliban gaining international legitimacy. The other pledges from the militant group that the international community will watch out for are to allow women to work within the confines of Shariah law, and to prevent their land being used for terror activities.Mujahed addressed a wide range of subjects at Monday’s press conference but gave no details on when the group would announce their new government. “There have been some technical issues that delayed the formation of the new government,” he said. “The issues will be resolved and we will soon then announce the government.”Taliban have said they will be announcing their new ‘inclusive’ government soon. Their Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada will head any governing council and his deputy leader Abdul Ghani Baradar will likely be in charge of the daily functioning of the government, a member of the Taliban Cultural Commission, Bilal Karimi, said last week.The militant group has invited officials from Turkey, China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Qatar to participate in the ceremony that will welcome the new government, Afghan television channel 1TVNewsAF, reported citing Al Jazeera.While all of those countries have extended varying degrees of support to the Taliban, on Monday Iran pushed back against the group’s capture of the northern Panjshir valley. Saeed Khatibzadeh, spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, criticized the Taliban for blockading the region and cutting off food, water and electricity supplies and urged the group to abide by both international law and its own promises to the Afghan people.Pakistan’s military spy chief, Faiz Hameed, arrived in Kabul over the weekend to meet with Taliban leaders to discuss security, border issues and government formation. The U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths also met with Baradar in Kabul over the weekend and promised that the international agency would continue to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-flights-from-kabul-airport-to-resume-soon-report-101630922902624.html

"My leader and brother Ahmad Massoud is safe and will be giving a message to our people very soon!" Nazary tweeted.The Taliban claimed earlier on Monday that their fighters have captured Panjshir valley - the last pocket of resistance in Afghanistan - but the NRF quickly dismissed the claim. It said that fighting is still going on and that its forces are positioned on all strategic points.Here are the latest developments:1. The NRF posted a tweet from their unverified account on Monday, assuring people of Afghanistan that the struggle against the Taliban and their partners will continue.2. Iran "strongly" condemned the Taliban's military offensive against holdout fighters in Afghanistan. "The news coming from Panjshir is truly worrying. The assault is strongly condemned," Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told reporters.3. The resistance in Panjshir is being led by Massoud - the son of the iconic anti-Taliban fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud who was killed just days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States - and former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has vowed to not surrender before Taliban.4. In a statement on Sunday, Massoud's son Ahmad called for an end to the fighting. The young British-schooled Massoud said his forces were ready to lay down their weapons but only if the Taliban agreed to end their assault.5. The statement was issued as Taliban claimed victory over Panjshir. Late on Sunday, dozens of vehicles loaded with Taliban fighters were seen swarming into the valley. News agency AP quoted witnesses to report that thousands of Taliban fighters overran eight districts of Panjshir overnight.6. Fahim Dashti, the spokesman for the anti-Taliban group, was killed in battle on Sunday, according to the group’s Twitter account. Dashti was the voice of the group and a prominent media personality during previous governments.7. He was also the nephew of Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official of the former government who is involved in negotiations with the Taliban on the future of Afghanistan.8. The whereabouts of Saleh and the young Massoud are not known.9. A Taliban spokesperson, meanwhile, said on Monday that a new Afghan government would be announced soon, but he did not specify when.10. The spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid called on former members of the Afghan forces to integrate with the new hardline rulers and added that any insurgency against their rule would be "hit hard".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panjshir-valley-latest-developments-afghan-resistance-force-claims-ahmad-massoud-safe-101630916428929.html

The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said at a press conference there are “some technical things left” and that the new Afghan government to be announced could be interim with a view toward changes in the future, according to Reuters. "Final decisions have been taken, we are now working on the technical issues. We will announce the new government as soon as the technical issues are resolved,” Mujahid said.Reports in the past week have said that there has been a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders— the group’s co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Anas Haqqani. The disagreement between Baradar and Haqqani has mostly been on the way the group handles the resistance forces in Panjshir.An unverified Twitter handle of Panjshir Observer, which describes itself as an independent news outlet covering Afghanistan and Panjshir, said the gunfire heard last Friday was over the tussle between the two senior Taliban leaders."Gunfire last night in Kabul was a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders. Forces loyal to Anas Haqqani and Mullah Baradar fought over a disagreement on how to resolve the #Panjshir situation.

06-09-2021||World||Works of 3 Indian directors to feature at Toronto film festival||Three debut features from Indian directors, two fiction and one documentary, will be showcased at the 46 edition of North America’s leading movie event, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).Two of the films selected for the 10-day festival, which begins on September 9, are debut projects and both are featured in the Discovery section, a platform to introduce fresh talent.Mumbai-based Ritwik Pareek directs the Hindi film Dug Dug, which will have its world premiere at TIFF. A satirical film, it has at its core bizarre events surrounding a motorcycle that unleashes religious fervour. TIFF programmer Peter Kuplowsky described the feature as a “slick satire of religious commercialism and uninhibited idolatry” as Pareek’s maiden venture “abounds with irreverent wit and formal invention, exuding an irresistible zeal that mesmerises as it begs the biggest of questions”. The film, inspired by the esoteric temples Jaipur-born Pareek visited frequented with his grandmother in the remotest villages of Rajasthan, “astutely explores the contagious power of faith and its metaphysical - and often transactional -mysteries”, Kuplowsky noted.Just as unconventional in its theme is Nithin Lukose’s Paka (River of Blood). This Malayalam movie was touted by TIFF’s co-head Cameron Bailey as a “Romeo and Juliet-esque vengeance tale is set deep in the forests of Kerala, where the river is witness to a violent, generations-old feud”. He went to call it a “riveting modern folktale”.The third Indian film that will figure at TIFF will be Payal Kapadia’s debut feature-length documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing, which is in Hindi and Bengali. Calling it one of the year’s “most electrifying debuts”, TIFF programmer Andrea Picard said this was “a fever dream of impossible love tied to a broader reflection on contemporary India”. The documentary has already received global acclaim, being awarded Best Documentary at Cannes and Picard gushed that this film “announces the arrival of an audacious cinematic talent”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/works-of-3-indian-directors-to-feature-at-toronto-film-festival-101630907440634.html
06-09-2021||World||Canada polls: ‘Parties must reject vote-based divisive politics’||Major Indo-Canadian groups are becoming increasingly active as the 2021 Federal elections approach, in an effort to place their interests on the agenda of the main national political parties and their leaders.The umbrella National Alliance of Indo-Canadians (NAIC), which includes 30 organisations, has sent representations to the leaders of the principal parties, including Justin Trudeau, leader of the ruling Liberal Party and Erin O’Toole, leader of the opposition Conservative Party. The letters were also sent to the leaders of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Greens and Bloc Quebecois.The letter states that support for the objectives outlined “would garner support from the incredible Indo-Canadian community”. Among these are to representing the “viewpoint of the politically marginalised Indo-Canadian community in the parliament” and “rejection of vote-based divisive politics, based on ethnicity, religion, race, gender etc”.It also asks for “policy and programmes that integrate and enhance understanding of the Indo-Canadian heritage, including art, music and culture, in the mainstream Canadian society” as well as “better and enhanced Canada-India relations”. These letters are also being distributed to individual candidates as they seek votes from the community. This initiative, a first in Canadian elections by Indo-Canadians, is aimed at countering the increasing influence of pro-Khalistan elements in the country as well as divisions that have emerged between different groups within the community over issues like the ongoing protests in India against three farm laws.Concerns over such friction also led a group of Indo-Canadians to protest outside the offices of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in the town of Burnaby in British Columbia. Singh represents the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Burnaby South in the House of Commons and the protests started at his official MP’s office before those gathered marched to his campaign headquarters. About 70 people participated in the protest and among them was Sushil Nagar, a resident of Burnaby and, in fact, a constituent of Singh’s riding.Nagar said their objective was to highlight the growing divisions between the Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada over the farm laws and, as the leader of a major Federal party, they wanted Singh to address the matter as elections approach and issue a statement calling for “amity” within the larger community. He said they had held similar events since February this year but Singh had kept “ignoring” their pleas. “We feel like we’re a significant minority in Canada, and in Burnaby. We want a message from him that Hindus and Sikhs should not be divided because of the farmers’ protests,” Nagar said.These developments come as the World Sikh Organisation (WSO) has also issued an election guide for Canadian Sikhs. Among the issues it has raised are an expedited process for immigration of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to Canada. It also condemned as “misguided” the inclusion of Sikh (Khalistani) Extremism in the 2018 Public Safety Canada Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada was extremely misguided and called for suspending the Framework for Cooperation on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism between Canada and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-parties-must-reject-divisive-politics-better-ties-with-india-101630905340929.html

06-09-2021||World||20 years on, pandemic gives 9/11 conspiracists fresh impetus||For Heather Bauer, 9/11 anniversaries are about something other than the fallen Twin Towers, smoking wreckage at the Pentagon, and a crashed airliner in a Pennsylvania field.Instead of the accepted version of events -- that Al-Qaeda conducted the attacks -- she believes the US government was primarily responsible. That is among falsehoods being promoted at various events to mark the 20th anniversary of September 11."I question absolutely everything now, and I wonder how much or what we have been told of history is even really true," Bauer told AFP. That includes Covid-19, which she does not believe exists.Bauer, a Wisconsin homemaker, was 14 when the attacks left nearly 3,000 people dead.She believed the official narrative for years, but after falling into QAnon conspiracy theories, she looked again at the 9/11 story. She now thinks the attacks were orchestrated to justify the war in Iraq that followed in 2003.She is a devoted adherent of the 9/11 truther movement. Its members tirelessly discuss online what they see as evidence that the Twin Towers fell because of controlled demolition techniques, not because commercial planes flew into them.Those claims were developed in incredible detail over the past 20 years, and have been debunked just as minutely by documentarians and journalists.The general idea, including the oft-cited "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" argument, is to prove that some entity must have planted explosives in the towers, because they could not have collapsed so neatly from being hit by planes.- 'Uniquely conspiratorial country' -In-person conferences planned by the truther community for the 20th anniversary of 9/11 will also discuss the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines.The 17th edition of the "9/11 Truth Film Festival" will take place at an Oakland, California theater and be streamed online, featuring two documentaries related to the pandemic, including "Plandemic," a debunked documentary rife with falsehoods about the virus.Carol Brouillet, the event's organizer and founder of the Northern California 9/11 Truth Alliance, said: "We have so much that we want to cover, and only eight hours."The amount of 9/11 truther content is, as Brouillet said, enormous.One of the festival's speakers, Ken Jenkins, alone has produced dozens of 9/11 DVDs, according to the event's webpage.Conspiracy theories over 9/11 were the first to benefit from widespread internet access, spreading much faster than previous alternative interpretations of history, including about John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the Moon landings."America is a uniquely conspiratorial country," said Garrett Graff, a journalist and author of a book on the subject.With the internet, he said, 9/11 truth theories were able to not only have a greater and faster reach than previous conspiracies, but also enabled those who believed in them to network far more effectively.- 'Anthrax to the pandemic' -"9/11 conspiracies arrived at the precise moment where social media and online media like YouTube really began to allow people to spread these ideas in big and colorful and compelling ways," he added.Like Brouillet's group, the Lawyers' Committee for 9/11 Inquiry will hold a conference on the 20th anniversary, and will feature a Covid-19 discussion.The event is named "From 9/11-Anthrax to the Pandemic," in reference to letters containing the poisonous substance sent to journalists and politicians over several weeks in September 2001.For Mick Harrison, an Indiana lawyer and the committee's litigation director, the connection between the anthrax in 2001 and the Covid-19 virus today is clear."Because we researched the history of US work on bioweapons for the anthrax case, we're now concerned that there may be an ongoing problem with the use of bioweapons in this country," Harrison said.Asked about why they are fighting to overturn an established 20-year-old narrative, Bauer and Harrison both said they saw it as a civic duty."I'm trying to make this country better by making its government more democratic, more accountable, more transparent," Harrison said."9/11 is a big problem in that regard, because we still don't know the truth about what happened."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-years-on-pandemic-gives-9-11-conspiracists-fresh-impetus-101630893966439.html

The head of Guinea’s special forces, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, announced the takeover on state television on Sunday and urged the armed forces to back him.The action was taken to address financial mismanagement and corruption in Guinea under President Alpha Conde, he said. “If you see the condition of our roads, of our hospitals, you realise that it is time for us to wake up,” Doumbouya said. “We are going to initiate a national consultation to open an inclusive and peaceful transition.”Guinea vies with Australia as China’s largest supplier of bauxite, the raw material used to make alumina and eventually aluminium. The country shipped 82.4 million tons of the mineral globally last year, according to government data. Much of that went to China, which is the world’s biggest aluminium-consuming country.After seizing the airwaves, the mutinous soldiers vowed to restore democracy and gave themselves a name: The National Committee of Gathering and Development.Doumbouya sat draped in a Guinean flag with a half dozen other soldiers in uniform alongside him as he read the statement, “The duty of a soldier is to save the country.”He made no mention of Conde’s whereabouts and it was not immediately known where the 83-year-old leader was after Sunday’s developments.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the coup in Guinea and urged putschists who said they had seized power to release the country’s detained president. “I strongly condemn any takeover of the government by force of the gun,” Guterres tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coup-in-guinea-new-leader-says-govt-is-dissolved-101630877607548.html
06-09-2021||World||Joe Biden to visit all three sites of 9/11 attacks||US President Joe Biden will visit all three 9/11 memorial sites to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks and pay his respects to the nearly 3,000 people killed that day.Biden will visit ground zero in New York City, the Pentagon and the memorial outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where United Flight 93 was forced down, the White House said on Saturday. He will be accompanied by first lady Jill Biden.Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Shanksville for a separate event before joining the president at the Pentagon, the White House said. Harris will travel with her spouse, Doug Emhoff.Biden’s itinerary is similar to the one former president Barack Obama followed in 2011 on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. Obama’s visit to New York City coincided with the opening of a memorial at the site where the iconic World Trade Center towers once stood.Next Saturday’s anniversary falls less than two weeks after the end of the nearly two-decade-long US war in Afghanistan. The war was launched weeks after the 9/11 attacks to retaliate against the Al-Qaeda plotters and the Taliban, who provided them safe haven.Biden has found support from the public for ending the conflict but has faced sharp criticism, even from allies, for the chaotic evacuation of US troops and allied Afghans during the final two weeks of August.Biden on Friday directed the declassification of certain documents related to the September 11 attacks in a gesture towards victims’ families who have long sought the records in hopes of implicating the Saudi Arabian government.The conflict between the government and the families over what classified information could be made public came into the open last month after many relatives, survivors and first responders said they would object to Biden’s participation in 9/11 memorial events if the documents remained classified.Iran tells America: Stop addiction to sanctionsIran has urged the United States to stop its addiction to sanctions against the Islamic republic and accused Biden of following the same “dead end” policies as his predecessor Donald Trump.Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh made his remarks a day after the US treasury announced financial sanctions against four Iranians accused of planning the kidnapping in the US of an American journalist of Iranian descent.“Washington must understand that it has no other choice but to abandon its addiction to sanctions and show respect, both in its statements and in its behaviour, towards Iran,” Khatibzadeh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-visit-all-three-sites-of-9-11-attacks-101630877418826.html
06-09-2021||World||UN urgently calls for an end to violence amid talk of civil war||UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has called for an end to violence in Afghanistan amid fears of a new civil war, now that the Taliban group has seized power.“I call for an immediate end to violence, for the safety, security and rights of all Afghans to be respected, and for adherence to Afghanistan’s international obligations, including all international agreements to which it is a party,” Guterres said in a report to the UN Security Council this weekend.The document, which was obtained by AFP, has not yet been released publicly.“I urge the Taliban and all other parties to exercise utmost restraint to protect lives and to ensure that humanitarian needs can be met,” Guterres said.The report was compiled as the mandate of the UN political mission in Afghanistan is scheduled to expire on September 17. The UN had said that Afghanistan is mired in a humanitarian crisis affecting 18 million people, or half the population.UN aid efforts can finance help for only 38% of the country’s population, so the world body urgently needs nearly $800 million, the report says.“I call on all donors to renew their support so that life-saving response is urgently scaled-up, delivered on time and suffering is mitigated,” said Guterres, who has convened an international aid conference for Afghanistan in Geneva for September 13.He also called on countries to take in Afghan refugees and refrain from deporting any they might already be hosting.Some domestic flights have resumed at Kabul airport, with the state-run Ariana Afghan Airline operating flights to three provinces.Shershah Stor, the airline’s station manager, told AP the flights took place on Saturday to Herat, Kandahar and Balkh provinces. But he added that they were conducted without a functioning radar system at the airport.Taliban accused of killing pregnant cop: BBC reportThe BBC reported on Sunday that Taliban fighters gunned down a policewoman who was pregnant, citing witnesses. The woman, named in the local media as Banu Negar, was shot dead at home in front of her relatives in Ghor province’s Firozkoh city, according to the report.The Taliban group later told the BBC that its members were not involved in her death, but a probe was under way. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujaheed said, according to the report, that he was “aware of the incident and I am confirming that the Taliban have not killed her”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urgently-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-amid-talk-of-civil-war-101630877251758.html
06-09-2021||World||India has good reason to worry over Taliban's rise: Ex-CIA official||As someone who oversaw operations in Afghanistan as the CIA's chief for counterterrorism in South and Southwest Asia during 2016-18, Douglas London had a ringside view of key developments and events that culminated with the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 15.London, who was involved in assessments of Afghanistan prepared for former US president Donald Trump and consulted as a volunteer with Joe Biden’s counterterrorism working group during the campaign for the last presidential election, says India has good reason to worry about the rise of the Taliban, given Pakistan’s backing for the group and the complicated security scenario in the region.The CIA veteran, who retired in 2019 after 34 years of service, argues that what happened in Afghanistan was worse than an intelligence failure, and outlines the Haqqani Network’s long-standing ties with the Pakistani military. London, who is publishing a memoir of his time at the CIA this month, “The Recruiter: Spying and the lost art of American intelligence”, talks about how the US-Taliban peace deal of 2020 was the “worst agreement” the US has ever negotiated.This conversation was edited for clarity.Senior US officials such as Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have implied an intelligence failure with regard to the Taliban victory in Afghanistan. You have been arguing it's much worse than that.Under both the Biden and Trump administrations, I observed that the calculus for Afghanistan policy was more geared towards domestic political considerations as opposed to national security issues resulting from the consequences of leaving or staying in Afghanistan. In my opinion, that made it worse than an intelligence failure, which would have been the case had the intelligence community failed to forecast the developments which played out or became aware of crucial information but neglected to bring to the attention of policy-makers. Neither of those scenarios turned out to be the case nor influenced the decisions taken by both administrations.Were you surprised by the speed at which the Taliban marched into Kabul?Every scenario is forecasted against a range of conditions and “what ifs”. So when an assessment is done – and I’m sure the RAW and IB do it the same way – they offer a range of possible outcomes given projected conditions and policies. The assessment for such outcomes varied based on scenarios, which ranged from different levels of US forces or the timeline for US withdrawal, and for the state of progress in negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Another key factor was the stability of the Afghan government. As it turned out, we faced the worst case scenario, under which [President Ashraf] Ghani was unable to maintain strong alliances with various political and regional groups, while at the same time the US had highlighted its intent to go early on. Meanwhile, the Taliban proved insincere in its pledge to pursue a political rather than military settlement and increased the level of violence while undercutting the government's cohesion by negotiating and paying off regional opponents who were left unpaid, unsupported and without US military or logistical support. Under such circumstances, it was expected the government could collapse within days to weeks. I think Gen Milley's comments that he never saw an assessment projecting “the government could collapse in 11 days” were good political theatre but no intelligence assessment predicts to a day.You’ve also described the 2020 deal between the US and the Taliban as catastrophic. One of the things that surprised people in India was how the Taliban were not being held to any commitments.I think the problem was the treaty language wasn't really binding to specific commitments, and offered the Taliban room for interpretation. So, when the US negotiated the treaty, it didn't even require the Taliban to recognise the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by name. Yet the Taliban were recognised in the agreement by their name, “the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan known as the Taliban”. The Taliban had the freedom to interpret the agreement because the language only required them to talk to other Afghan parties, leaving them the room to choose who they thought were legitimate or non-legitimate representatives. Even in the prisoner exchange of about 5,000 people, if you look at the language, the agreement said they were to be released by the “other side”, it didn't even speak to an official entity or name the Afghan government.Regarding relationships with terrorist groups, the Taliban believed it was required only to prevent Afghan territory from being used for terrorist operations. The Taliban saw no requirement to break their relationships or expel such groups, let alone turn over those indicted for prosecution by other countries. Now, if you noticed, I think about a week ago, a Taliban spokesman mentioned the Taliban was yet to be convinced that al-Qaeda was responsible for 9/11. So bearing that in mind, how likely do you think it is that the Taliban would acknowledge the presence of foreign terrorists on their soil, let alone turn them over?So, if you look at the conditions [in the treaty], they didn't reduce violence. Violence increased remarkably within the week after the February 2020 agreement was signed, they chose not to recognise any official representatives of the government and they didn't cut ties to terrorists. The only aspect to which they held was in not instigating attacks against US forces, but that was in their own interests. By not instigating attacks, they didn’t provoke retaliation or increase the possibility the US would stay or increase its forces. So it was probably, diplomatically speaking, the worst agreement I've ever seen the US negotiate.You’ve also been critical of the role played by former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, especially how Pompeo championed the agreement despite intelligence warnings.Pompeo was the director of the CIA before he became secretary of state. During that time is when [president Donald Trump] announced the new South Asian strategy, in August 2017. That was the result of the intelligence community really sounding the alarm about the consequences of a precipitous US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the potential resurgence of al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in an accelerated fashion, enabling them to resume external plotting, including against the US homeland. Pompeo supported that view in 2017 and the intelligence never changed.In 2018, [president Trump] lost patience very quickly, before the new South Asian policy was given time to reap results. He had made it clear that he wanted to leave Afghanistan expeditiously. For political considerations, Pompeo flipped and went ahead to provide the president a solution to support his desire in spite of the intelligence. He wound up connecting with Khalilzad, who was conducting his own independent effort at the time to try to get back into the action by talking to Afghans he believed represented the Taliban. That's how he sold his way into Pompeo’s circle and thus became the new special representative, usurping the work of then US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, Alice Wells, who was taking a hard stand with the Taliban and Pakistan. It's my personal opinion that Khalilzad was willing to do anything it took to gain Trump's favour because he was hoping to become secretary of state to replace Pompeo on the assumption, which was pretty much the given at that time in the US, that Pompeo was looking at a Senate run, which he then abandoned later on due a lack of political support.A recent development that really struck people in South Asia was when the state department spokesperson said the Taliban and the Haqqani Network are separate entities. Do you have any thoughts on that?Clearly, he misspoke. That's not the position of the US government. Officially, we identify the Haqqani Taliban Network – that’s actually its official name in the US intelligence community – as being part of the Taliban. The Haqqanis are, by themselves, a vast and longstanding criminal network, but they swore bay’aht, pledged allegiance to the Taliban and fought under the Taliban and really provided the teeth to the Taliban strategy, which was to destabilise the Afghan government by attacks in the cities, including massive suicide bomber attacks, truck bombs and vehicle-borne IEDs, which really did shake up the government.They concurrently promoted a military campaign in the rural areas and the countryside to try to isolate the provincial capitals and the big cities.I know [state department spokesperson] Ned Price made that comment, which was really unfortunate and Jen Psaki upheld it, but it is at odds with the official US government view as related by the intelligence community. All you need to do is look up the Rewards for Justice and the state department website, and you'll see it's the Haqqani Taliban Network.Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, described the Haqqani Network as a “veritable arm” of the ISI in 2011.The Haqqanis are in bed and in league with the ISI. I wouldn't say they're a product of the ISI, which was responsible for enabling the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. Without the sanctuary from which the Taliban and Haqqanis could protect their leaders and move materials, arms and fighters across the border, they could not have endured and prevailed, but I don't believe the ISI actually created the Haqqanis. The Haqqani Network is long-standing, it’s principally a criminal network involved in narcotics, extortion, real estate and all of that business for years and years.They [the ISI] certainly provided great support to the Haqqanis, but it was a co-dependent relationship. The Haqqanis profited from the ISI and the ISI profited from the Haqqanis.Images have emerged of the ISI chief arriving in Kabul for meetings with the Taliban. What do you make of that?I've seen pictures of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. These are all people he's met before. I mean he was meeting them in Pakistan, though obviously they can’t acknowledge that. So, it's simply taking the relationship to a different place out in the open, and at a different and now official level.With the Taliban clearly facing problems on the economic front, how important will be the role of the Haqqanis in managing finances for the regime in Kabul?The Haqqanis are looking after their own finances. Their priorities are money, the family and their own establishments in the north and northeast. I hear the commentary by the White House and other governments, which suggests that because of this great financial need that the Taliban will have in governing, that there will be leverage on the part of the West. I'm not so confident because what the Taliban does not want is interconnectivity between Afghanistan and the rest of the world. There's a reason they would like to keep Afghanistan free from global integration.I believe they're prepared to look for ways to finance essentially an agrarian subsistence economy but they’re going to have more trouble in the cities, where 20 years of development and education have raised expectations. I don't see the Taliban, despite their lip service, wanting significant industrial development for the country that could provide more influence and presence to the West, which for them brings with it all the problems of keeping its own society in line with a very reactionary and repressive philosophy. In a way, I see a similarity between the Taliban leadership and the hardliners in Iran, who want to be free from the threat of sanctions, influence and pressures the West can use in its investments to leverage change in their country. I think the Taliban will be content to find a way to be self-sufficient to the point of subsistence, which I think is in their power to do over time based on their regional relationships with China and other sources of income. They’re going to court a variety of foreign investments from China and others without becoming overly reliant on any one, particularly Western sources. China's desire to press ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative will make them an enthusiastic partner. They're going to benefit from foreign remittances among Afghan labourers abroad, donations and criminal enterprises such as the narcotics trade. I think their preference is not to get too far down the line with great development projects, which will leave them vulnerable politically to outside influence and pressure and require global integration that might threaten their control at home.The Taliban seem to have learned how to handle public relations better and the projection of issues such as human rights in an apparent effort to get some sort of legitimacy. But will the world community be able to hold them to these commitments?I think they became very media-savvy because they pursued a very concentrated disinformation programme throughout the war, for which we gave them lots of material to use, what with the civilian casualties and the errant airstrikes. It totally fed into their narrative, and they became very aware of how successful that was. It worked very well and they got better press than the Afghan government did. A lot of their success was making more out of their gains than was really happening militarily, because they weren't winning military battles in their final conquest. They were basically paying people off and negotiating their way from city to city and town to town, similar to what they had done in 1996.The West kept talking about this great juggernaut, which really played into their strategy. If you're sitting up in Balkh or somewhere else in the north or west, you'd be thinking they’re going to take over the country and it would be better to cut a deal. And in terms of the Taliban's pledge to be different than they were in regards to the rights of women and other basic civil liberties, that dialogue and messaging is not from the people who've been making the decisions for the Taliban for the last 20 years. Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai has been out of the country for 20 years. He was part of the Taliban five who were traded for [kidnapped US soldier Bowe] Bergdahl. Moreover, Stanekzai was under house arrest by the Taliban before 9/11 and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was left to rot in prison for eight years. If the Taliban really wanted Baradar out, I guarantee you they could have gotten him out. They made no such effort because he was long out of favour with the Taliban's senior leaders then living in Pakistan.So, all these people that are talking about Taliban 2.0, a kinder, gentler Taliban are under the lights of cameras, whereas we don't know what’s going on where we have no visibility, nor what's in the minds of the Taliban's actual decision-makers.The reflections I see on social media suggest rather that it's the same old Taliban, they’re hunting enemies, they're executing people, they're torturing, and they’re keeping women at home. That's the Taliban, and decisions are not being made by Baradar, Stanekzai or any of these folks now on camera. The decisions are being made by a much closer circle of people from whom we don't hear.Given your focus on South Asia in your last role in the CIA, what implications will the rise of the Taliban have for this region and primarily for India? There is evidence out there of the presence of fighters from Pakistani groups in Afghanistan and what does that mean for regional security?I think India has good reason to worry. Pakistan's policies of supporting various jihadist groups and the Taliban were all done through the prism of Pakistan-India rivalry. They obviously see your country as an existential threat and any issue or challenge to them is viewed through that prism.My concern is that Pakistan's support of these jihadi groups has unleashed forces that could eventually go beyond their control and threaten the rule even of the generals in Pakistan. What comes then, if the generals are overthrown by jihadist, religious or an ISIS-like set-up, would be very disconcerting.I don't think India has helped itself by its virulent anti-Islamic campaigns and use of nationalism and religion for political gain at home. I think it will leave India as well pretty vulnerable to threats from within as well as from without.Tensions obviously have only increased with China, which is a closer partner with Pakistan and is trying to cultivate a stronger relationship with Afghanistan. China is concerned about what will happen if the Taliban support and cultivate Uyghur separatism in China, and so wish to discourage giving Afghanistan any reason to do so but I see the Taliban leaders as willing to promote and facilitate the jihadist groups with which they have long fought, partnered and even intermarried, and that's a threat for Pakistan, India and the Central Asia republics.Now you have the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan, and I don't see them cutting their ties with any of these groups, with the Kashmiri liberation groups that fought with them over the course of the war, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed.I think the time has come for regional players like India, the generals in Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian states to realise that they need to start making some changes and finding a way to work together so as to impede forces that could lead to greater turbulence and instability across the region.I think people need to start talking. I think the Pakistani generals need to realise that time is not on their side, [because of] having cultivated a lot of these forces that can consume them as well. I'm just worried the timing is not right because the Indian government has not extended a hand to the Muslim community inside of India, and is therefore probably not in a real great position to start looking at compromise with the Pakistanis or the Chinese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-rise-a-concern-for-india-ex-cia-hand-101630869550332.html
